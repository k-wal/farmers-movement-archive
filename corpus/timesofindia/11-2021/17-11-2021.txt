The two slain civilian’s families said their kin were not overground workers (OGWs) for terrorists, as claimed by the police, and the niece of one of them alleged her uncle had been used as a "human shield". The families’ claims led to PDP, NC and People’s Conference calling for an impartial investigation. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said on Tuesday one foreign terrorist named Haidar, his local terrorist associate Aamir Ahmad, an OGW named Mudasir Gul, and Altaf Ahmad Bhat, the owner of the building in which the terrorists had been hiding, had been killed in Hyderpora. He said Altaf Bhat would be counted as a "harbourer" of terrorists, PTI reported. According to Kumar, Bhat was killed in the crossfire, and Gul, a non-practising dentist running a call centre and property business in the same building, was in fact harbouring Haidar, a Pakistani terrorist from The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba outfit. "It is not clear whether bullets fired by the militants or by the forces hit the civilian (Altaf Bhat). The terrorists were carrying pistols, investigations will make clear whose bullet hit him," the Kashmir police chief said. You killed my innocent uncle Mohammad Altaf Bhat in cold blooded murder In Hyderpora, you used him as human shield… https://t.co/C95GFL7dbB— saimabhat (@saimabhat) 1637003544000However, Bhat’s teenage niece disputed the claims made by the authorities and alleged that he was used as a "human shield" by the security forces. "You killed my innocent uncle Mohammad Altaf Bhat in cold-blooded murder In Hyderpora, you used him as human shield and now saying he was 'OGW' (overground worker), return us his body @JmuKmrPolice @SrinagarPolice @IGP," tweeted Saima Bhat. The IGP said Aamir Ahmad, a resident of Banihal, was also a terrorist working under Haidar’s command whose cover was a job as an office boy at Mudasir’s call centre, an unregistered business. "He (Bhat) had kept the tenants and the police had no information about it. The responsibility of the owner does not end with renting out the place... He should also check once in a while as to what is happening there," the IGP was quoted as saying by PTI. "Mudasir was running an unauthorised call centre. This way, he was an OGW and was directly involved in harbouring militants," IGP Kumar claimed. The IGP told reporters at Police Control Room (PCR) Srinagar that on Monday evening the police had received a lead about the presence of terrorists on a side road off the airport road. "Police, CRPF and the Army laid a cordon and, when they zeroed in on the spot, the terrorists fired indiscriminately at the forces," Kumar said, adding that the two terrorists were killed in the gunfight that followed. "Mudasir was also involved in ferrying Haidar from the recent attack site in Jamalata Srinagar, where a policeman was injured," the IGP said, adding that he was also involved in ferrying terrorists from areas in south and north Kashmir. Two pistols, two magazines, six mobile phones and a few computers were recovered from the encounter site, the police said. He said the bodies of Altaf Ahmed and Mudasair were not handed over to their families for the last rites as there were apprehensions of a law and order problem. Asked whether the police had clear evidence that Mudasir harboured terrorists, the IGP said they had digital evidence and would get further proof. Meanwhile, the families of Altaf Ahmed and Mudasir Gul urged lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha on Tuesday to help them get the bodies of their kin so that they could be given a proper burial back home. The daughter of Altaf Ahmad, the building owner, urged L-G Manoj Sinha 0n social media to "direct the police to return my father’s body so that we can see him one last time and give him a proper burial". The family of Mudasir Gul, a resident of Rawalpora, staged a protest at Srinagar’s Press Enclave and demanded the return of his body. "He has two little kids and we want to show them the face of their father one last time," his family said. Mudasir’s mother, weeping, claimed that her son was innocent. Other family members and relatives of Mudasir rejected outright the police claim that the slain man was an OGW, stating that "Mudasir had no militant links and was innocent". The authorities, meanwhile, constituted an SIT headed by a DIG to investigate the "high-tech" Hyderpora "call-centre" hideout from where mobile phones and computers were recovered. "They will also get into the details of whether the militants were in touch with any foreign country. The team will also look into the sequence of events that led to the killing of the building owner and militant associate," IGP Vijay Kumar said. PDP chief Mehbooba alleged on Twitter that the use of "innocent civilians" as human shields, "getting them killed in cross firing & then conveniently labelling them as OGWs is part of GOI’s rulebook now (sic)." She added that a "credible judicial inquiry" was imperative to establish the truth and "put an end to this rampant culture of impunity". People's Conference leader Sajad Lone also demanded a probe. "…the least we deserve is a transparent description of what happened by a neutral institution. This is neither the first time nor the last time. Manoj Sinha — you have the opportunity to assert that human lives matter," Lone said. National Conference’s Omar Abdullah tweeted: "There have been numerous instances of fake encounters in the past and the questions raised about this #hyderporaencounter need to be answered swiftly and in a credible manner." He added that an "impartial and credible inquiry" was necessary as "there are far too many questions being raised about the encounter and about the people killed". Lok Sabha members Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi also called for an impartial and time-bound probe, PTI reported.

---||Delhi||NIFT Delhi hosts its first physical convocation amid pandemic||Of all the joys that the pandemic has robbed us of, not having physical farewell and convocation ceremonies ranks pretty high for students. The outgoing batch of the National Institute of Fashion Technology’s (NIFT) Delhi campus was lucky enough to have a physical convocation. On Friday, the NIFT Delhi campus hosted its 27th Convocation Day and 336 graduates, post-graduates and PhD scholars from the 2021 batch received their degrees from Union Minister for Textiles Piyush Goyal. The convocation also had Minister of State for Textiles Darshana Vikram Jardosh as the guest of honour and Upendra Prasad Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Textiles, as the special guest. NIFT Students taking the graduation pledge In a 90-minute-long ceremony held at the college’s amphitheatre, the students began with the graduation pledge wherein they promised to uphold the sanctity and dignity of their profession. Students taking the graduation pledge At the end of the pledge, Jardosh remarked, “It is a testament to the changing face of India that we could hear more female voices than male ones during the pledge.” Goyal began his address to the students with a promise. “I was told that parents (of the graduating students) couldn’t join the ceremony today physically due to paucity of space. But hopefully, in the coming years, we should be able to offer you a bigger amphitheatre at Pragati Maidan, where you could sit with your families for future convocation ceremonies,” he said. Addressing the students, he asked them to “show the world India’s strengths in fashion technology,” before adding, “I’m sure that’s what each one of you will do. My best wishes for a wonderful career!” The outgoing graduates expressed their joy at having a physical ceremony. “Honestly, I didn’t think we would have a physical ceremony,” said Varnika Manraj from the Accessories Design Department, adding, “Due to COVID, last year was a virtual ceremony. I am just so happy to see my friends again and have a chance to share this moment with them.” Others talked about the significance of this moment for them. Harneet Singh from the Fashion Communication Department said, “For me, this is not the end of anything but the beginning of a new journey. That needs to be celebrated and I am happy to do it with all my friends.” The ceremony was also attended by many notable alumni from the institute, including designers Gaurav Jai Gupta, Suket Dhir, Manish Tripathi, Swati Kalsi and Roshan Baid. ‘Let’s make India the fashion capital of the world’In his speech at the convocation, Union Minister for Textiles Piyush Goyal touched upon the need to elevate India’s status in the global fashion fraternity and how the graduating students could play a huge role in it. “We need to promise ourselves that in the next five years, we will try to make India the fashion capital of the world. Let’s get luxury into handloom. Our Indian design products should be associated with luxury world over and brands promoted by you all should be known world over. It’s time India starts draping the world with the best of quality and best of products,” he said to the students. The minister also expressed a couple of wishes to the graduates and the institute as a whole. He said, “Hopefully, we should be able to designate NIFT as an institute of ational importance in the coming years. And I don’t know if we have the budget for it, but I hope to see a fashion show run by NIFT students at the Dubai Expo. Also, I would ask the NIFT management if they could think of weaving in some progam in their curriculum to give exposure to the students about handloom and handicrafts, and making them more aware about our traditional designs.” Minister of State for Textiles Darshana Vikram Jardosh also had a suggestion for the college. “We have the Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav coming up, where we will celebrate 75 years of independence. Our PM Modi may not need any fashion advice, but I hope that NIFT can take the lead and design a uniform for all the other politicians for that event,” she said.

---||World||Trial set for Texas officer who shot Black woman at home||FORT WORTH: A former Fort Worth police officer faces a murder trial early next year for fatally shooting a Black woman through a back window of her home in 2019 while responding to a call about an open front door.  A Tarrant County judge on Tuesday scheduled Aaron Dean's trial in the fatal shooting of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson for January 10, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports. Jury selection is set to begin six days earlier, although Judge David Hagerman indicated he's expecting Dean's lawyers to seek a change of venue.  A location change could further hold up a case, which has been delayed repeatedly over the more than two years since Dean shot Jefferson during a late-night wellness check at her mother's house. His case was among many that were postponed when the coronavirus pandemic caused courts across the country to postpone jury trials.  Dean, 37, resigned from the city police force two days after shooting Jefferson. He was charged with murder and released on a $200,000 bond.  Following the shooting, Fort Worth police released body camera footage that showed Dean walked around the side of the house, pushed through a gate into the fenced-off backyard and fired through a window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson to show her hands. Police went to the house after a neighbour called a non-emergency line to report that the front door was ajar.  Dean, who is white, was not heard identifying himself as police on the video. The city's police chief at the time, Ed Kraus, said Dean acted without justification and that there was no sign he or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door. Kraus said Dean would have been fired if he had not quit without giving a statement to investigators.  A judge has issued a gag order in Dean's case. He declined to comment to a Star-Telegram reporter in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trial-set-for-texas-officer-who-shot-black-woman-at-home/articleshow/87745914.cms||---

These include shutting down all except five thermal power plants within a 300km radius of Delhi till November 30; stopping entry of trucks in Delhi except for those carrying essential commodities; keeping diesel and petrol vehicles more than 10 and 15 years old, respectively, in NCR off the road and banning construction and demolition activities in NCR till November 21, except for some government and infrastructure projects. All educational institutions in NCR will remain closed till further orders with only online mode allowed. At least 50% of the government staff across NCR will work from home and private establishments will be encouraged to do so till November 21. Among other measures announced by the commission are banning of DG sets in entire NCR, except for emergency services, and ensuring that all industries in NCR with gas connections are run only on gas, failing which they are to be shut down. The ones using unapproved fuels shall be closed by the respective governments with immediate effect, and wherever gas is available, they will be shifted to that mode of fuel. This followed a meeting with NCR states earlier in the day with the focus on vehicular pollution, dust pollution from construction activities and roads, and emissions from thermal power plants and industrial pollution. It was pointed out by the met department at the meeting that the air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the “very poor” category on November 18 and improve only from November 21, owing to strong winds. Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday, again entering the “severe” category at 403. Of the 11 thermal power plants, the five that have been allowed to function are NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi, TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd TPS, Rajpura; and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa. The secretary, ministry of power, has instructed that if there is any shortfall, supply shall be provided from power plants located beyond the 300km radius of Delhi. Constructions related to railway stations, Metro, airport, ISBTs, national security, defence and projects of national importance have been exempted from the ban. The commission has asked for tightening of PUC checks in NCR with checking to be carried out at petrol pumps, ensuring smooth traffic flow, deployment of more CNG buses and tightening of dust control measures with anti-smog guns, water sprinklers and fire tenders. Hotspots are to be targeted at least three times a day. More road-sweeping machines must be procured and enforcement made more stringent with penalties and closure. Stacking of construction material and C&D waste on roads are to be penalized. The meeting was attended by officials from UP, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi besides central ministries. A compliance report has to be filed by all the states by November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/air-pollution-thermal-plants-closed-trucks-cant-enter-delhi/articleshow/87745983.cms||---
---||World||Pfizer asks US to authorise Covid pill||WASHINGTON: United States pharmaceutical company Pfizer on Tuesday asked regulators to authorise its Covid pill after it was shown to cut hospitalisation or death by nearly 90% among newly infected high-risk patients.  The move comes a few weeks after Merck also approached the Food and Drug Administration seeking a green light for its antiviral capsule against the coronavirus.  Experts see the oral medications as an invaluable addition to vaccines in the fight to end the pandemic.  "With more than five million deaths and countless lives impacted by this devastating disease globally, there is an urgent need for life-saving treatment options," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.  "We are moving as quickly as possible in our effort to get this potential treatment into the hands of patients."  Pfizer is seeking an emergency use authorization (EUA) on the basis of positive interim results from a mid-to-late stage clinical trial of hundreds of people, which enrolled Covid-positive non-hospitalised adults at high risk of progression to severe disease.  The data showed an 89% reduction in Covid hospitalisations or death when the treatment started within three days of symptom onset, with no deaths in the treatment group. Similar results were seen within five days of symptom onset.  Side-effects occurred in about one-in-five patients in both the treatment and placebo groups, and were mild in intensity.  The treatment is given over five days.  Pfizer has said it will deliver 180,000 courses of its Paxlovid pill this year and at least 50 million by next year.  On Tuesday it announced a deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to sub-licence production for supply in 95 low- and middle-income nations covering around 53% of the world's population.  Paxlovid is a combination of a new molecule, PF-07321332, and HIV antiviral ritonavir.  Both belong to a class of antivirals called "protease inhibitors", which block the action of an enzyme critical to viral replication.  President Joe Biden's administration is set to announce that it is purchasing 10 million courses of the pill, the Washington Post reported.  The US is also buying 3.1 million courses of the Merck pill, Molnupiravir.  Given the timeline between application for an EUA and subsequent authorisation, it could be available by late this year or early next.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-asks-us-to-authorise-covid-pill/articleshow/87746169.cms||---
---||World||Michelle Wu sworn in as Boston mayor, becomes first woman to be elected to the post||BOSTON: Michelle Wu was sworn in Tuesday as Boston mayor, becoming the first woman and person of colour to be elected to the office in the city's long history.  The swearing-in of the city's first Asian-American mayor came two weeks after Wu won the city's mayoral election. Before Wu, Boston had elected only white men as mayor.  Wu, 36, takes over for a fellow Democrat - former acting Mayor Kim Janey - who was Boston's first woman and first Black resident to serve in, but who was not elected to the top post.  The swearing-in means Wu will now face the daunting task of trying to make good on a slew of ambitious policy proposals that were the backbone of her campaign.  To push back against soaring housing costs that have forced some former residents out of the city, Wu has promised to pursue rent stabilisation or rent control. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is the fact that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide.  Another of Wu's top campaign promises is to create a "fare-free" public transit system. Wu has said the proposal would strengthen the city's economy, address climate change and help those who take the bus or subway to school or work.  Like the rent control pledge, Wu can't unilaterally do away with fares on the public transit system. Wu has said she would try to work with partners in state government to make each proposal a reality.  Wu, whose parents immigrated to the US from Taiwan, grew up in Chicago and moved to Boston to attend Harvard University and Harvard Law School.  Wu, who has two small children, is Boston's third mayor this year.  "I know that Boston is in good hands and I am so proud to call you Madam mayor," Janey said moments before Wu was sworn in.  Janey had been president of the Boston City Council before taking over as mayor.  She rose to the top post on an acting basis when the city's previous elected mayor, Democrat Marty Walsh, stepped down this year to become US Secretary of Labor under President Joe Biden. Janey was sworn in March 24.  Janey attempted to use the status of the office in her run to replace Walsh, but she failed to garner enough votes to make it past the preliminary mayoral election that whittled the field down to two candidates - City Councilors Wu and Annissa Essaibi George.  Republican governor Charlie Baker, Democratic US Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and US Rep. Ayanna Pressley attended the swearing-in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/michelle-wu-sworn-in-as-boston-mayor-becomes-first-woman-to-be-elected-to-the-post/articleshow/87746170.cms||---
---||World||Biden bans entry of Nicaraguan president, officials to US||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Tuesday banned his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega and other members of his government from entering the United States as he issued a broad proclamation in response to an election that Washington has denounced as rigged in favour of Ortega. Biden's travel ban applied to all of Nicaragua's "elected officials", apparently including Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, in addition to security force members, judges, mayors and others seen as undermining democracy in the Central American nation. "The repressive and abusive acts of the Ortega government and those who support it compel the United States to act," Biden said in the decree. Biden's order came just a day after the United States, Britain and Canada imposed targeted sanctions on Nicaraguan officials in a concerted response to the November 7 election that many countries have called a sham. They took action after Ortega's re-election to a fourth consecutive term after jailing political rivals and cracking down on critical media. Ortega has derided his US critics as "Yankee imperialists" and accused them of trying to undermine Nicaragua's electoral process. Cuba, Venezuela and Russia have offered Ortega their backing. Previous sanctions and travel bans on certain Nicaraguan officials imposed by Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have failed to deter Ortega, and many analysts are skeptical whether new measures will have much impact. The Organization of American States (OAS) adopted a resolution on Friday saying Nicaragua's election lacked "democratic legitimacy". Twenty-five nations voted in favour and seven abstained, including Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-administration-bans-entry-of-nicaraguan-president-officials-to-us/articleshow/87746174.cms||---
---||India||Shut due to Covid, Kartarpur corridor opens after 20 months||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday announced the reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara corridor from Wednesday, ahead of Gurupurab — the November 19 birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The decision to resume movement of devotees through the corridor leading to the Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan’s Narowal “reflects the immense reverence of Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev-Ji and our Sikh community”, home minister Amit Shah tweeted while announcing the decision. The corridor was shut in March 2020, barely four months after it was inaugurated, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. The latest decision seemed on the anvil in the wake of a delegation of BJP leaders from Punjab meeting Modi recently to request him to reopen the corridor. Even the Pakistan government had last week urged India to allow devotees to visit the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara ahead of the Prakash Utsav celebration. The Centre’s decision can be seen to address many fronts with a state election coming up in Punjab and the PM’s repeated gestures to indicate his respect for the Sikh faith in the wake of the agitation of farmers’ unions, mainly from Punjab and Haryana and west UP, against the agri-reforms legislated by the Centre. "The nation is all set to celebrate the Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev-ji on November 19 and I am sure that Narendra Modi government’s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib corridor will further boost the joy and happiness across the country," Shah tweeted. There had been some concern, even before the pandemic, over the efforts of Pakistan agencies to use the pilgrimage to disseminate anti-India propaganda and look to "recruit" some impressionable pilgrims. Expressing gratitude to PM Modi and home minister Shah for the reopening, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday claimed to have personally taken up the issue with the central government. "This is a joyous occasion for the entire Punjabi community in general and Sikh brethren in particular," he said. On November 18, Channi will lead his entire cabinet to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib. Several senior politicians from Punjab including former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu too had on Twitter urged the government of India to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor in view before Gurpurab. Kartarpur corridor, called a "peace corridor" between India and Pakistan, had seen around 45,000 pilgrims travel through it between November 2019 and February 2020. The corridor allows Sikh pilgrims to travel visa-free to the Kartarpur gurdwara via the Attari-Wagah border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shut-due-to-covid-kartarpur-corridor-opens-after-20-months/articleshow/87746284.cms||---

Modi was addressing a rally in Sultanpur after the inauguration of India’s longest expressway, where he himself landed in a military transport aircraft on a 3.2-km stretch developed as an emergency air strip for IAF. The expressway begins from Chandsarai village on the outskirts of Lucknow and ends at Hadairia village on NH-31 in Ghazipur district. It cuts across nine districts, including Ayodhya, Amethi and Azamgarh. Watch: PM Modi lands on Purvanchal Expressway in IAF's C-130J Super Hercules planeModi said whenever he visited the state during SP’s stint in government, the party leadership would “vanish” after completing the formality of “receiving” him. “Unko itni sharam aati thi....kaam ka hisaab dene ke liye unke pass kuch tha hi nahi (they were ashamed...they didn't have anything to show in the name of work).” The PM said UP had been subjected to "punishment" under SP's governance. "Akhir UP ko kis baat ki saja di ja rahi thi (why was UP being punished)?" he said, recounting how one of the first tasks he undertook after becoming PM was to delve deep into the causes of the state's backwardness and initiating a series of remedies. "Our efforts included providing houses, toilets and electricity. But the state government did not help me and continued to do injustice to the people," he said. Referring to the Purvanchal Expressway as the route to a brighter future for UP, Modi said he couldn't have imagined he would land in a helicopter on the same expressway whose foundation stone he had laid three years ago. "It is an expressway to development of a new UP, a reflection of modernised facilities and a certification of turning sankalp (resolve) into siddhi (accomplishment)," he said after inaugurating India's longest functional expressway. Modi said the BJP government's development plans for UP were not just for five years but the entire decade. While lauding CM Yogi Adityanath and his team for the completion of the expressway, the PM also had a word of gratitude for the farmers whose land was acquired for the project. Taking a swipe at Congress and SP for their reliance on dynasties, Modi said both Delhi and Lucknow were largely dominated by such "parivarwadis". "Their partnership kept trampling the aspirations of the people of UP. But the people of UP have banished such people forever to keep the development trajectory intact," he said, highlighting why Yogi was elected in 2017 while he got a second stint as PM. The PM's reference to SP's alleged fear of losing its vote bank is being seen as an indication of BJP lending traction to a potential bipolar electoral contest with the SP, which is markedly backed by minorities and OBCs, mainly the Yadavs. Road to development: What the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway means for East UP, Bihar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-the-inauguration-of-indias-longest-e-way-pm-launches-into-sp/articleshow/87746454.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||India||Will throw out your deficient affidavit, angry SC tells government||NEW DELHI: Chafing at the lack of progress in framing a uniform scheme to ensure cooked food for the hungry and destitute across the states, the Supreme Court on Tuesday pilloried the Centre for filing a deficient affidavit, that too by a junior officer, before threatening to "throw out the affidavit" for the government's lack of respect to the highest court. The SC's earnest endeavour to make the Centre frame a uniform policy and the latter not keeping its solemn promise to work towards it irked a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli, which said, "You had promised to frame a uniform policy. There is not a word about it in the affidavit. Your secretary is so arrogant that he undermines the highest court by asking an undersecretary to file the affidavit. This cannot go on." Such was the intensity of questioning from the CJI and Justice Kohli that additional solicitor general Madhvi Divan had to repeatedly plead for permission to complete an argument on the difficulties faced by the Centre in framing a uniform scheme given the diversity of conditions in states, many of which are already implementing a scheme for highly subsidised cooked food for citizens. "We cannot thrust a scheme on community kitchens in the states," she said. Times ViewThe Centre can financially assist states, but given their diverse socio-economic realities, the purpose would perhaps be better served if states are left to devise their own schemes.As the ASG was finding it difficult to extricate the Centre from the situation, attorney general K K Venugopal intervened to calm frayed nerves, saying a uniform community kitchen scheme could be framed but only if the states agreed since the Constitution mandates poverty alleviation schemes and public distribution system implementation to the panchayati raj mechanism under the states. He said the country has 6.63 lakh villages and 2.55 lakh panchayats. "We will deal with the matter and come out with a concrete scheme after a thorough consultation with the states. The scheme involves taking care of huge logistics — foodgrains have to be transported to panchayats, storage space has to be created and kitchens have to be set up. We can come forward with a scheme while not violating the constitutional mandate about the three-tier governance system." The CJI-led bench said, "If you (the governments) want to take care of hunger, no Constitution or law will negate or impede it. Don't think that we want linking community kitchens with the schemes to provide nourishment to children. We are only concerned with hunger. We will grant you three weeks to call a meeting of all states and devise a uniform scheme. If you face objections or difficulties, bring it to our notice and we will sort it out through judicial orders." The AG said that many states have opened community kitchens and provide food to all at highly subsidised rates. "We cannot do that. We will ensure that the community kitchens cater to only the marginalised sections and those below the poverty line." The bench clarified that it was not insisting on any particular kind of scheme by the Centre. "What we want is that the scheme should provide succour to those hungry and those who are unable to make ends meet even once a day." The SC posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-throw-out-your-deficient-affidavit-angry-sc-tells-government/articleshow/87746484.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||India resumes vaccine exports to 4 countries||NEW DELHI: Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal and Iran have been the first recipients of resumed vaccine exports from India almost eight months after they were halted due to rising cases of Covid-19. The government had stopped vaccine exports as the brutal second wave hit India in April-May this year. It’s only after India had administered close to a billion doses of vaccines did the government relax restrictions. Commercial contracts were also kept in abeyance as production was procured for domestic use. India resumed its exports to the Covax facility with the first lot of doses landing in African countries. Adar Poonawalla, chief of Serum Institute of India, was quoted by Axios news website as saying that by this week, he expected Covishield doses to land in African countries. “I think by the 10th of November, you’re gonna see the first — if not a bit sooner — you’re gonna see the first doses arrive in Africa,” Poonawalla told Axios. Once shipments begin, Poonawalla said around 30 million doses per month could be supplied to COVAX. India now has a long list of vaccines — Covavax, Corbevax, ZyCovD, Gennova’s mRNA vaccine — at various stages of regulatory approval. The first 50 million doses of SII-produced Covavax will make its way to Indonesia this week though the vaccine is yet to be greenlighted by India’s DCGI, the WHO or US FDA. While the government is focusing on getting more Indians covered by the second jab, it’s clear that supplies are no longer a constraint. Vaccine manufacturers are chomping at the bit, because they need to go out to the world with their exports. However, there remain fears about a third wave and a repeat of the shortages faced during the second wave as well as uncertainties about production volumes and timelines of manufacturers. Here, government sources say they were hobbled by the slow rollout of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. Without the SII doing the heavy lifting (over 88% doses were Covishield), India would not have been able to ramp up its vaccinations as rapidly as it did. Until mid-October, Bharat Biotech had only supplied around 11 crore doses compared to the 40 crore promised by the government to the Supreme Court. Sputnik V, the third vaccine approved by India, stopped production because Russia just could not supply enough. Until mid-October, they had supplied only 45 lakh against the 10 crore promised. In fact, globally, Russia has promised one billion vaccines, but hasn’t been able to provide more than 5 million. This means large parts of Africa, Latin America and even Asia remain unserviced. China is moving aggressively, capturing markets, even though their vaccines have been shown to be well below par. Indian vaccine manufacturers are well-positioned to take a global lead on this. With the developed world going in for boosters and scientific evidence tilting towards giving vulnerable populations boosters after 6-8 months, it won’t be long before India too has to take a call on them. For government regulators, this is all the more reason to hold on to vaccines for Indians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-resumes-vaccine-exports-to-4-countries/articleshow/87746607.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Investigators claimed that the couple launched a mall project and took money from buyers on the pretext of giving them shops but they failed to deliver on their promise. Police said the two were directors of a company called JC World Hospitality Pvt Ltd and were living in Greater Noida. "We have arrested them from their residence," an officer said. According to police, one investor, Dhirendra Nath, along with a few others filed a complaint against the company and its directors. "Nath had booked two shops in a project named JC World Mall. It was launched by the accused in 2014 in Noida. He [Nath] had paid a sum of Rs 1.75 crore to the company in various instalments," additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh said. Singh said the company promised Nath that possession of the units would be handed over in 30 months from the date of the allotment letter. "Nath told us that the builder has not completed the construction work and no construction was going on at the site for the last 18 months," the officer said. Nath also claimed that several meetings with the directors had also been in vain. "We found that the company through its directors has cheated several complainants, buyers on the pretext of providing shops in its project," the officer said, adding that there were more than 30 complainants. During the probe, Noida authority informed police that the company had applied for approval of the building plan for the project in 2015, which was returned to them with some objections and they were directed to provide the relevant documents. "The company did not respond within the stipulated period and, hence, their application for approval of the building plan was rejected. It was also found that Rs 6 crore of buyers' money was given by the company to a sister concern," the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/daughter-son-in-law-of-jaypee-founder-held/articleshow/87746675.cms||---

Biden and his Democratic Party are betting that bipartisan progress and popular policies like investing in infrastructure and creating jobs can win over voters. The opposition Republican party remains divided over former president Donald Trump, his supporters' January 6 attack on the Capitol, and whether to cooperate with Biden on regular governance. "Despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans, we can work together," Biden declared during an event staged on the NH 175 Bridge, which local officials have sought funding for repairs for years.  Biden said the last 20 years saw the "backbone of this nation hollowed out" by lack of infrastructure investments and that his $1-trillion package will help lift the middle class and make the country more competitive globally.  Republicans won key elections this month by warning about inflation and taxes under Biden, and stirring up anger on cultural issues, and Biden's poll numbers are in a slump.  New Hampshire is home to a key US Senate race and two congressional contests for positions now held by Democrats, in a midterm where Biden's party can afford barely any losses.  Biden goes to Detroit on Wednesday to tout investment in electric vehicles, while Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to visit Columbus, Ohio, on Friday to highlight the package. The busy travel schedule is intended to hammer home the message that Democrats delivered on their promises. Neil Levesque, the executive director at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said it's no secret that Biden is coming to New Hampshire to help stem the bleeding ahead of 2022.  "My latest poll shows that 68% of people here in New Hampshire believe the country's on the wrong track, and that's a very devastating number for people who are incumbents and are perceived responsible for that feeling," Levesque said. In February, soon after Biden took office, 55% did, his poll shows. Wider concerns Midterm elections are always challenging for the party that holds the White House. But losses for the Democrats this month in Virginia and New Jersey have raised wider concerns.  New Hampshire Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, up for reelection in 2022, could face a close race, analysts say, even though the expected top Republican rival, Chris Sununu, decided to seek reelection for governor instead of challenging her.  Hassan has raised record amounts of money in successive quarters and is leaning into the bipartisan infrastructure bill, crisscrossing the state in recent weeks to visit water treatment plants, solar farms and other projects to tout the need for public investment.  "The measures that I helped fight for in this bill will strengthen our communities, jumpstart our economy, and create good jobs, and I look forward to working with the administration to get these dollars to New Hampshire as quickly as possible," Hassan said in a statement to Reuters.  Biden's job approval rating in New Hampshire - which he carried by 7.4 percentage points in 2020 - sits at around 44%, according to the latest statewide poll conducted in October by Saint Anselm College.  The entire congressional delegation, all Democrats, are now underwater on job approval, the poll showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/on-a-new-hampshire-bridge-biden-bets-infrastructure-beats-political-headwinds/articleshow/87746847.cms||---
---||India||Kerala losing paddy paradise to floods and a silent farmer flight||NEW DELHI: Flooding has been an integral part of life in Kuttanad. The seasonal disruption it inflicts is more than compensated for by the mineral-rich silt it leaves behind in what has become the “rice bowl” of Kerala. But over the last decade, and more conspicuously since 2018, flooding has become regular and, worse, the water doesn’t drain. Experts attribute the flooding to unseasonal rains and to the lowland sinking even further — the first a direct consequence of deforestation of the Western Ghats, and the latter, a result of rising sea levels. The sea-level rise is still fractional but in Kuttanad, the only place in India of substantial size where rice is cultivated close to 10 feet below sea level, it might prove catastrophic. Hundreds of farming families, rooted to this place for generations, are abandoning ancestral hearths to move to farmlands less vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change or to towns. The “exodus” is still largely invisible, especially to government and official agencies. “After the 1924 floods, there was an influx into Kuttanad as the soil had turned fertile. But after the floods of 2018, people are now moving out… The rise in sea level is very minute but if the flooding of rivers is followed by tidal floods, it will be very dangerous,” says KG Padmakumar, director of International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming. In Kainakary in Lower Kuttanad in Alappuzha district, where it is taking longer and longer for the waters to recede after each flood, the options for farmers have been shrinking by the year. P Rajkumar owned 2 acres of paddy fields and till 2018, life was comfortable for his small family that includes his wife, 13-year-old son and elderly mother. All that changed after the deluge in August that year. “There was water in our house for days. No electricity, no cellphone reception and we were scared to go out fearing sudden surges in the water level. We couldn’t sleep at night as there was no one else in the neighbourhood. Most people had fled to their relatives’ houses,” he says. “Drinking water increasingly became hard to obtain. Toilets were a big problem. Nowadays, we face floods through the year,” says his wife Bindu. The family has bought 3.5 cents of land in Gurupuram, a locality relatively safe from floods, and built a house. “My mother broke down when we left our ancestral home. There was a generations-old ‘sarpa kavu’ (sacred grove) near the house which was close to her heart. Even that had gone under water,” says Rajkumar. Radhakrishna Panikkar, who lives in ward 14 of Kainakary panchayat, relocates to his daughter’s house in the nearest town, Changanassery, whenever there is a threat of floods. “I am lucky that my daughter lives in the nearby town. What about those who do not have any such option?” asks the 75-year-old. On a sunny day, the sea of green padasekharams (paddy field clusters), undulating in the breeze and intersected by streams, is a picturesque advert for the “god’s own country”. The fields are protected by earthen bunds but breaching is common now. L P Chandraprakash, who resides close to Meenappally padasekharam in Kainakary, says the cluster has been water-logged for a year now. “There is no longer any paddy farming here. Nobody wants to live here. Bunds have been constructed under the Kuttanad package only on three sides. One side is open which allows water to enter the fields,” he says. There are around 5,000 families in Kainakary panchayat comprising 15 wards. The exodus of locals is not yet part of any government study and officials are reluctant to discuss the issue. “On average, 20-25 houses remain permanently locked in a ward where there are about 400 houses,” admits Jayan Chambakkulam of Integrated Rural Technology Centre, citing data from Haritha Karma Sena (the green task force of every local body), though he is ambivalent on the reasons. He does admit, “There is no provision for the water to flow out of Kainakary. The number of canals has come down and the existing ones have narrowed and easily spill over.” M C Prasad, president of Kainakary panchayat and a CPM leader, says many of the problems will be solved with the implementation of the government’s much-hyped but elusive ‘Kuttanad package’. He, however, agreed, “the unexpected arrival of water during rains is turning into a regular phenomenon. The breaching of bunds is another concern.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-losing-paddy-paradise-to-floods-and-a-silent-farmer-flight/articleshow/87746865.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

That’s one of the takeaways from a new report by the research arm of consultants McKinsey & Co. that examines the national balance sheets of ten countries representing more than 60% of world income. “We are now wealthier than we have ever been,” Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, said in an interview. Net worth worldwide rose to $514 trillion in 2020, from $156 trillion in 2000, according to the study. China accounted for almost one-third of the increase. Its wealth skyrocketed to $120 trillion from a mere $7 trillion in 2000, the year before it joined the World Trade Organization, speeding its economic ascent. The US, held back by more muted increases in property prices, saw its net worth more than double over the period, to $90 trillion. In both countries -- the world’s biggest economies -- more than two-thirds of the wealth is held by the richest 10% of households, and their share has been increasing, the report said. As computed by McKinsey, 68% of global net worth is stored in real estate. The balance is held in such things as infrastructure, machinery and equipment and, to a much lesser extent, so-called intangibles like intellectual property and patents. Financial assets are not counted in the global wealth calculations because they are effectively offset by liabilities: A corporate bond held by an individual investor, for instance, represents an I.O.U. by that company. The steep rise in net worth over the past two decades has outstripped the increase in global gross domestic product and has been fueled by ballooning property prices pumped up by declining interest rates, according to McKinsey. It found that asset prices are almost 50% above their long-run average relative to income. That raises questions about the sustainability of the wealth boom. “Net worth via price increases above and beyond inflation is questionable in so many ways,” Mischke said. “It comes with all kinds of side effects.” Surging real-estate values can make home ownership unaffordable for many people and increase the risk of a financial crisis -- like the one that hit the US in 2008 after a housing bubble burst. China could potentially run into similar trouble over the debt of property developers like China Evergrande Group. The ideal resolution would be for the world’s wealth to find its way into more productive investments that expand global GDP, according to the report. The nightmare scenario would be a collapse in asset prices that could erase as much as one-third of global wealth, bringing it more in line with world income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/amid-surge-in-wealth-worldwide-china-leapfrogs-us-to-top-spot/articleshow/87746932.cms||---

Today, audit is being considered as an important part of value addition,” the PM said after unveiling a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the headquarters of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) here. Stating that the relationship between the government and the auditor has changed because his government has nothing to hide, Modi said, “Earlier, due to lack of transparency in the banking sector, various wrong practices were followed. The result was that Nonperforming assets of banks kept increasing... and were brushed under the carpet. However, we put the truth of the previous governments in front of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/earlier-auditor-was-looked-at-with-dread-pm-takes-dig-at-upa/articleshow/87746968.cms||---
---||India||BJP to retain UP, SP to be distant second: Survey||NEW DELHI: BJP is set to retain Uttar Pradesh with a comfortable majority in the state assembly elections due early next year, a Times Now-Polstrat opinion poll has projected. BJP is projected to win 239 to 245 of the 403 seats, with the Samajwadi Party finishing a distant second with 119-125 seats, though more than doubling its 2017 tally. BSP is projected to lose a significant share of its votes to both SP and BJP and finish third with around 30 seats, while Congress could end up with five to eight seats, not very different from the seven it won in 2017. If the projections turn out to be accurate, Yogi Adityanath would become the first chief minister in Uttar Pradesh to serve two consecutive terms. The opinion poll indicated strong support for the Yogi government’s hard-line approach on law and order as well as, to a lesser extent, for its legal route to countering ‘forced’ conversions. On the Citizenship Amendment Act, however, opinion was more equally divided, with nearly half of the respondents seeing the Yogi government’s defence of it as an attempt to promote communalism. The poll also suggests that BJP’s charge of “Muslim appeasement” against SP and Congress has found resonance among the respondents. The opinion poll was conducted between November 6 and November 10 with a sample size of 9,000 respondents. The margin of error for the data is 3% with a confidence interval of 95%. According to C-Voter survey, the BJP and allies are projected to win 213 to 221 seats in 2022 assembly polls. The SP and its alliance partners are expected to win 152 to 160 seats this time. The BSP is likely to win just 16 to 20 seats. Congress party is likely to grab 6 to 10 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-to-retain-up-sp-to-be-distant-second-survey/articleshow/87747004.cms||---
---||India||‘SC, HCs can’t interfere in daily temple rituals’||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that constitutional courts cannot interfere in daily rituals and practices in a temple on the basis of a writ petition and said that if any devotee is aggrieved by any deficiency or violation of rituals she/he has to file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum seeking relief. “If a devotee is aggrieved by non-performance of any daily ritual properly or deviation from daily practices in a temple, he/she can file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum for grievance redressal. The HCs and the SC cannot deal with it,” said a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli. However, the apex court clarified that if a Devaswom Board or temple administration is failing in its duty to make proper arrangements for the devotees or indulging in maladministration of the temple, then a devotee could be permitted to seek redressal of her/his grievances before the HCs or the SC through a writ petition. The ruling came on a petition filed by Srivari Dadaa, who had accused the Tirumala Tirupati Devaswom (TTD) Board of deviating from daily rituals. The Andhra Pradesh HC had on January 5 rejected the petitioner’s PIL and said, “procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others”. TTD is an independent trust that manages temples including the famous Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple, in AP. Dadaa has alleged that the temple authority has been performing sevas in a “wrongful and irregular procedure”. Agreeing with the HC, the CJI-led bench said, “ the constitutional courts can’t start interfering with daily rituals of the temple and its customs and practices as it is not judicially manageable. Can we manage daily puja? Which law mandates that constitutional courts can interfere in daily rituals. Can we dictate to temple authorities how a coconut is to be broken in front of the deity? Can we tell the priests how to carry out aarti? This appears to be a publicity interest litigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-hcs-cant-interfere-in-daily-temple-rituals/articleshow/87747166.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This is not just another incident. It is a well-thought-out experiment to create polarisation,” he said, adding it was the Modi government that was the target. His remarks came a day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar accused BJP of fomenting violence in view of the approaching UP polls and ministers in the MVA government in state claimed BJP was instigating rioting with an eye on local civic body polls in Maharashtra. Accusing Congress member Rahul Gandhi of “leading” the polarisation, Fadnavis said Rahul was “well aware” that no masjids had been burned in Tripura, yet he had tweeted on November 8 that Muslims were being attacked in Tripura. “And on November 11, large processions are carried out in Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon,” he said. “How is it possible that these rallies are spontaneous, and if there was planning, how is it that the government and police intelligence (department) are unaware? These rallies were carried out with support from the MVA government. Shops owned by Hindus were burnt, and no leader from MVA spoke about it,” he further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-violence-experiment-to-create-anarchy-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/87747208.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Bengaluru||NEP effect: Universities in Karnataka introduce UG programmes||BENGALURU: With the introduction of National Education Policy (NEP) in Karnataka, universities which had only post-graduate (PG) programmes on campus till now are opening up for undergraduate (UG) courses too. In a first, Bangalore University conducted counseling for UG seats on Monday and is opening up its campus for 18-year-olds next week. Bengaluru City University also started a constituent college to offer UG education this year and is expected to start UG programmes on its own campus in the city centre by 2022-23. As per NEP, the four-year undergraduate programmes have come into force in the colleges in the state. A student who completes four years can do a post-graduate programme in one year. If the student has taken a research component in the fourth year, he can directly enrol for PhD, even without a PG degree. Karnataka State Higher Education Council vice-chairman Thimme Gowda B said most universities in the state will start UG programmes by next year. "Students can save one year by directly entering PhD after the four-year UG programme. Moreover, the UG students will also have the benefit of senior teachers on campuses. While PG and PhD students manage more through self-study, UG students will need more of their guidance," he said. "The PG programmes have got sandwiched between the new UG programme and PhD, becoming weak and irrelevant. Research will move from PG level to UG level," said KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor of BU. BU has received 30 students each in its UG Science, Biological Science programmes and 20 in the Arts programme. "Our professors will find it interesting to teach UG students. They are usually much more responsive and enthusiastic than the older set of students," he said. Bengaluru City University will have its own UG programmes in all departments from next year. While it started a constituent college – Multi-Disciplinary Constituent College for Women -- in Malleshwaram, only BCom programmes have kicked off with 21 students in the first year. NEP envisages that the affiliating system should move over and more colleges gain autonomy and get a degree-awarding status depending upon their performance and NAAC accreditation. This will also change the roles universities will play in the future. MK Shreedhar, who was on the drafting committee of the NEP, said the distinction between UG and PG programmes will disappear in the days to come. "There will only be a change in the nomenclature. The critical matter is the learning outcomes. The universities should become lifelong-learning centres. As of now, we have a structural approach to education and life -- we start college around 18 years, move on to PG at a certain age and then on to a job. But NEP should be a gamechanger where people can exit and return to studies whenever they want. If that trend picks up, each class will have students of various age groups," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nep-effect-univs-in-ktaka-introduce-ug-programmes/articleshow/87747228.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The ordinance comes in the wake of the high court’s verdict in August that said the Palike had no legal sanction to levy such a fee.While the civic body was to lose the powers of levying fee, it had also faced the prospect of repaying the amount collected in the past (to the tune of about Rs 3,500 crore). Officials said the ordinance has been promulgated to circumvent the same by validating powers of the BBMP chief to levy such a fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/building-plan-fee-govt-issues-ordinance-to-validate-bbmps-powers/articleshow/87747246.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||State takes digital step to verify papers for jobs & edu||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government is inching closer to a paperless system by introducing digital verification of documents for employment and education purposes.Using the government of India application Digilocker, the e-governance department has more or less completed digitisation of 2.8 crore students’ education details, including marksheets from 80 educational institutions in the state for 2019-20 and 2020-21. These include secondary school leaving certificate (SSLC), pre-university course (PUC), professional courses like BE and MBBS, and pure science, commerce and arts courses.With Digilocker application already having a direct link with the government-issued documents like Aadhaar, PAN and driving licence, the department plans to get on board private companies to digitally verify documents for employment purposes.“We have roped in 49 departments in the Karnataka government to secure access under Digilocker for digital verification of probable employees’ documents. We are in the process of getting private companies as well for the purpose,” said HM Shreevyas, project director for Digilocker.The process is also expected to authenticate the education credentials of every aspirant on account of a digital signature. “We have provided the option of a digital signature to every education institution, which will authenticate the academic credentials of the candidate and weed out fake certificates,” said Shreevyas.Access to records will be available only with prior consent. For this purpose, the state government will bring a consent platform called e-Sahamati. DPAR additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said the Data Governance Committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify the approval for private companies to access digital records of prospective employees.“With data protection and privacy being of utmost importance, the e-Sahamati framework will assist the data fiduciaries to share it with private companies only on consent being given by the candidate,” said Chawla.Chawla said once the framework and its rules are ratified, the government will invite private companies to secure a licence under e-Sahamati and proceed further to secure the data.It is said the government will then equip every small and big private company to have a trained professional with access to data for accessing and downloading records for their verification. “The department will secure the details of one particular person, who will be notified by the company as the nodal officer and give him/her the technical education on how to use the application,” said officials.The department is confident of the depository and Digilocker being safe from hacking on account of the sophisticated encryption being similar to the one UIDAI used to protect Aadhaar details of citizens.The same access can also be used by educational institutions for enrolling students for higher education. The government is hoping to digitise all education records of students for up to 10-15 years, from 2006, thereby giving the departments a substantial pool of documents for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-takes-digital-step-to-verify-papers-for-jobs-edu/articleshow/87747247.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The bench also said that a drive should be launched to identify such vehicles and the authorities should submit a compliance report regarding action taken.The authorities were told to take into consideration the operation of night clubs and organisations in violation of Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000. Regarding the petitioner’s contention on allowing use of loudspeakers and public address systems at 15-odd religious places in Thanisandra and surrounding areas, the authorities were asked to state under what provisions of law permissions have been granted. They were also asked what action has been taken to restrict the use of this equipment in accordance with the rules. The religious institutions claimed they are permitted to use loudspeakers and public address systems by way of a circular issued by the Wakf board in 2017. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/identify-vehicles-with-modified-silencers-hc/articleshow/87747251.cms||---

On March 31, 2015, the state government issued a notification clarifying the rate of tax on M-sand is reduced to 5.5%. The same was interpreted by the finance department to mean that prior to the issuance of notification, M-sand was classifiable at a higher rate i.e., at the rate of 14.5% under residuary entry and a demand notice was issued for April 2014 to March 2015.The notice was challenged before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal which ruled in favour of the department. The assessee company then challenged the January 3, 2019 order of the tribunal holding that M-sand is not covered under entry 83 of Karnataka Value Added Tax Act-2013.Allowing the petition, the division bench pointed out that as per the records placed before the court, which included a report of a project sponsored by the department of mines and geology and conducted by the civil engineering department of IISc, both M-sand and the river/natural sand are having similar physical properties and hence, the same cannot be considered as excluded from entry 83 of schedule-III of the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/m-sand-must-draw-same-levy-as-natural-sand-says-court/articleshow/87747253.cms||---

The accused is Muthu Hamad Meera, a resident of Sivaganga, Tamil Nadu. Kalasipalya police said he had brought the tortoises here to sell them, and 21 among the 401 were dead and 20 ill.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Clerk who took bribe from deceased’s kin convicted||BENGALURU: An official who harassed the family of a deceased government employee to clear the file on compensation payable to the latter has been sentenced to four years in jail and fined Rs 20,000. A local court in Tumakuru on Monday awarded the sentence to 41-year-old K Ramesh, a second-division clerk in Kunigal town municipal council. He was caught red-handed in 2015 while accepting Rs 5,000 bribe, and Lokayukta police filed a chargesheet under the Prevention of Corruption Act. “Accused Ramesh is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of four years and has to pay fine of Rs 20,000. In case of default of payment, he shall undergo further simple imprisonment for two months,” read the order passed by S Sudindranath, VII additional sessions and special court judge. Ramesh was trapped while accepting the bribe from the bereaved family of a waterman, Krishnappa from Kunigal, who had died on duty in 2015. The government had appointed Krishnappa’s son Nagaraj to his father’s post on compensatory grounds. Nagaraj had approached Ramesh seeking his help in getting death benefits of his father. Ramesh demanded a bribe of Rs 10,000 to clear the documents. Though Krishnappa’s family requested Ramesh to decrease the amount owing to their financial status, the latter was adamant. Nagaraj paid Rs 3,000 as advance and the family approached the Lokayukta with a complaint. Special public prosecutor N Basavaraju said. “The trap was laid on December 9, 2015. He was arrested the same day and sent to judicial custody. Nagaraj had recorded his conversations with Ramesh, wherein he demanded the bribe and refused to decrease the amount when requested. The voice recordings played an important role in the conviction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/clerk-who-took-bribe-from-deceaseds-kin-convicted/articleshow/87747255.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The incident took place on November 11. The accused, S Poorvik, a resident of Hennur, was produced before a local court on Tuesday and remanded in judicial custody. He has been booked under IPC sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 354D (stalking). The 19-year-old student had booked the cab to travel home from her educational institution near Yelahanka. “The cab driver asked me the pickup and destination details. He also asked me how many people would be travelling. When I said I would be alone, he used filthy words,” she said in her complaint. However, Poorvik brushed away the allegations. “She booked my cab and called me asking if I was coming or not. I replied that I was reaching the educational institution. She suddenly cancelled the trip without valid reason. I grew frustrated and demanded an explanation from her,” he told police. Even after the student reached home, the cabbie allegedly abused her on phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cabbie-held-for-abusing-student-who-cancelled-ride/articleshow/87747257.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Poor civic infrastructure may force us to shut shop: Bengaluru traders||BENGALURU: With the poor condition of NR Road, SJP Road, SP Road and Avenue Road and adjacent stretches keeping away their customers, some hardware merchants are left with no option but to shut down their business. According to traders, the roads just don’t exist due to their repeated digging by the agencies, whereas streetlights are not operational. There are no public toilets either. They say their repeated requests to their MLA, MP and civic agencies have not been of much use. A TOI team visiting the area recently found that overflowing drains, broken pedestrian paths, open manholes and dug-up carriageways were common sights. BBMP records show SP Road was dug up in 2018 by BWSSB to fix underlying sewage pipes. The project was to be completed by the end of 2019, but was delayed. Later it was halted due to the pandemic. The stories of other roads in the area aren’t very different. Saifee Eripurwala, a trader, said he has two shops on the same stretch, but he is unable to visit them. “There are no footpaths and I cannot walk on the road because of potholes and stagnating sewage water. I am worried I might have to close the shop because of the poor civic infrastructure,” he said. According to Karnataka Hardware and Allied Merchants’ Association (KHAMA), there are 20,000 merchants in the area with each employing at least five people. Claiming that the area generates 42% of the state’s taxes, the traders wonder why they have to put up with such apathy. “Customers are hesitant to use these roads due to their poor condition. We are not demanding new roads, just patchwork would be helpful. We’ve met MLA Uday Garudhachaar, BBMP and Ben Smart City Limited (BenSCL) officials, but they pass the buck to BWSSB, which in turn blames BBMP,” Vikram Agarwal, president of KHAMA, told TOI. “Avenue Road has been closed for over six months now, and our trade has been affected badly,” Kiran Hebbar, a member of KHAMA. “Poor coordination between civic agencies is an issue,” said Rahul Goyal BK, secretary of KHAMA. Women staff are hesitant to work in these areas due to lack of toilets and streetlights, Goyal said, adding: “BBMP wants to develop Silver Jubilee Park. Why not divert the funds to provide us basic infrastructure.” Members of KHAMA and other traders have raised numerous requests on Sahaaya 2.0 and Namma Bengaluru application, but in vain.  BBMP officials said the fault lies with BenSCL and BWSSB. “We have issued notices to the civic agencies to complete the works fast and fix the roads.” BWSSB said it will fix the roads in 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/poor-civic-infra-may-force-us-to-shut-shop-traders/articleshow/87747258.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The passenger blamed the airline for careless handling of his expensive equipment and lack of uniform security rules to carry drones as it had been allowed as cabin luggage from Mumbai to Bengaluru.  Sabit Tisekar, 30, a filmmaker who travels across India on photography and film assignments, claimed he often carries his work equipment — DJI Mavic drone fitted with a hi-end camera — in his hand luggage on flights within the country. Last week, he came to Bengaluru for an assignment and his production manager flew down from Mumbai on November 9 with the drone camera. “He took the Air India flight and before boarding, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at Mumbai airport took a written undertaking at the security checks with regard to the drone and it was allowed in the hand luggage,” Tisekar said. On Sunday, the photographer was leaving after his work on Air Asia flight I5 1561 from Bengaluru to Mumbai. He reached the KIA by afternoon. “I was carrying the drone in my hand luggage but I was told to check in the device saying drones were not allowed onboard. Since the officers stood their ground and I didn’t want to miss the flight, I ran downstairs to the Air Asia counter and the ground staff advised me to check in the drone. They promised that they will personally look into it. They pasted a ‘fragile’ sticker on my bag carrying the device and also made me sign on it,” he said. However, Tisekar was in for a rude shock when he collected the bag after landing in Mumbai. “The lens was damaged which had happened during the baggage handling by the ground staff. I raised a formal complaint with the Air Asia personnel at Mumbai airport. But they asked why I didn’t carry the drone in hand on flight,” fumed Tisekar who lodged a complaint with Air Asia’s nodal officer. The photographer was also agitated over lack of a non-uniform rule in carrying drones at two different airports. “The CISF security officer in Mumbai said it’s OK to carry a drone in hand but his colleague from Bengaluru said otherwise. It is ridiculous,” he lamented. Sources with the CISF in KIA said as per the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security guidelines of 2020 that are applicable to all airports in the country, devices like drones must be carried only in the check-in luggage and the batteries need to taken in hand luggage. Also, during inspection by security personnel at the airport, the passenger must explain as to why he/she is carrying such batteries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2l-drone-cam-checked-in-at-kia-damaged-airline-blamed/articleshow/87747259.cms||Petlee Peter

In addition to this, he has also given general instructions to zonal-level engineers to immediately address the problem of water entering houses and waterlogging of streets during rain. The instructions were issued at a review meeting held to discuss the progress of various developmental works in Yelahanka zone. Gupta has been reviewing all peripheral zones in the city. The chief commissioner said that roads that have been cut for various reasons need to be restored on a war-footing. “I have instilled a sense of urgency among both BBMP and BWSSB engineers that restoration works has to commence. BWSSB has to give us a certificate stating that they have completed work and we can then start restoring the roads. Most of the time, they do not certify that a certain work is over and hence restoration process is delayed...” “Similar instructions have been given to engineers from other zones too. I have made it clear that even ground-level engineers should know what is to be done. This is to ensure coordination among various related agencies,” Gupta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/start-fixing-roads-bbmp-chief-tells-officials/articleshow/87747260.cms||---

The BBMP commissioner, Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner, BDA chief and BBMP special commissioner (revenue) were the members of the panel.Then commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad failed to hold even a single meeting and was later transferred to the revenue department. As the panel’s term was set to end on June 28, 2021, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta requested the urban development department to grant more time for the panel considering the pandemic situation. The department issued a circular earlier this month extending another six months for the delimitation committee, to complete the task by January 28, 2022. Sources in the committee said a proposal has been made to include 58 villages on the fringes of Mahadevapura, Yeshwantpur and Bengaluru South.“The rule doesn’t allow us to go beyond 1-km radius, but some MLAs are expecting us to include areas that are 5-10km away,” they said, adding: “We are getting applications from various organisations too, but it is not possible.”The committee is also looking at other consequences. “According to the rules, if a village is brought under the BBMP, the gram panchayat members concerned will become associate members of the BBMP council for the rest of their term,” said a member.Will up property tax: MinST Somashekar, minister for cooperation and Yeshwantpur MLA, said, “I understand it is not easy to bring in more villages under BBMP. But our intention was different. Adding more villages will increase property tax and augment the civic agency’s revenue.” The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is hearing the matter of elections to the BBMP on December 6. Expanding the BBMP limits and increasing the number of wards to ensure better administration were some of the reasons that the state government had cited to delay the polls. “We will wait for the Supreme Court hearing, see what it decides and if necessary, make preparation for the elections,” said senior officials from the Palike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/legislators-propose-to-add-more-villages-to-bbmp-officials-dispose/articleshow/87747261.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Granting four weeks to the respondents to submit their objections, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said that registrations done pursuant to the impugned notification would be subject to further orders.The petition was filed by Mohammed Dastagir, an advocate from Mysuru city who worked in the transport department before his retirement in 2014. “In order to facilitate dealer-level registration of motor vehicles, respondent number one (principal secretary to the transport department) issued a draft notification on October 26 proposing to amend rule 33 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Only five days’ time was allowed for the public to file their objections and suggestions on the draft. The proposed amendment is ultra vires of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,” the petitioner said He said he submitted his objections on October 29, but they were not considered and the amendment notification was issued on October 31, a holiday. Dastagir claimed under the amendment, even an employee of a dealer with sufficient administrative experience and in regular employment can issue a certificate of registration under section 41(3) of MV Act. “Giving the power of registration to a dealer's employee will have far-reaching effects. All other subsequent actions, including insuring the vehicle, depends on the entries made on the certificate of registration. Any wrong entry, intentional or unintentional, can result in denial of insurance claim and ownership claim,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pil-challenges-registration-of-vehicles-by-dealers/articleshow/87747263.cms||---

Passengers inconvenienced by the flooding said no action has been taken by railway authorities to resolve the issue despite several complaints. “The leaking roof shows that one of the major railway stations in the city is poorly maintained. An inquiry should be conducted and action should be taken against staff found responsible,” said a passenger at the station. Videos of water gushing out of a drain spout also went viral. Umesh B Rao, co-founder of Institute for Research Development & Training of Construction Trades & Management, said the rainwater pipe’s placement on the platform is wrong. “Such a drainage system is unacceptable,” added the civil engineer. Rajkumar Dugar, founder of Citizens for Citizens, an NGO, said: “Cantonment is the oldest station in Bengaluru and is located in the heart of the city. Every year, it leaks during rain and railway officials are aware of the problem. But they haven’t fixed it so far. This is a huge let down for rail passengers.” Bengaluru divisional railway manager Shyam Singh was unavailable for comments. Revamp, suburban terminal proposals on paperSWR’s ambitious plans to redevelop Cantonment railway station and convert it into a suburban terminal remain on paper. In April 2019, the railway board sanctioned a new suburban rail terminal at Cantonment on the lines of Mumbai’s Victoria terminus. It was supposed to get five new stabling lines and four platforms. A suburban terminal will also help run additional Memu trains to places like Hosur, Devanahalli and Whitefield. Sources said the amount allocated for the suburban terminal was diverted to Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal (Byappanahalli third coaching terminal) after the project cost escalated from Rs 116 crore in 2012 to Rs 314 crore in 2021. Similarly, there was a plan to redevelop the station under the PPP model. In 2017, two-four acres of land at Cantonment was identified for the purpose. The land is now with Rail Land Development Authority, but the project has seen no progress. Though it adjoins SWR’s Construction Organisation’s headquarters, the station continues to be neglected. “This should be the fourth terminal of the city but no work has started even with the railway board sanctioning it. Track-quadrupling work between Bengaluru Cantonment and Whitefield is progressing so the terminal plan shouldn’t be delayed more,” said Dugar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/roof-of-cantt-railway-station-leaksafter-rain-passengers-rue-apathy/articleshow/87747264.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

There is nothing wrong in giving police protection to anyone. But the man never had any life threat in these years but has suddenly found enemies. I am presuming the Congress is in a much better position to explain the threat as they have the information,” he said.Opposition leader Siddaramaiah had tweeted that several influential people are involved in the scam, and hence protecting the accused was necessary. He claimed only Sriki knew the account details and nothing is written anywhere. The BJP went on the offensive against “unemployed” Siddaramaiah and said the entire case is being given the colour of scam in an one-upmanship tussle between the former CM and KPCC president DK Shivakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hdk-questions-cong-on-police-protection-demand/articleshow/87747248.cms||---

A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi also said clearance from the authorities is mandatory for shifting the zoo. Santosh Martin and Rajesh M Kurpad, two Ballari-based petitioners interested in wildlife preservation, contended that the authorities had not obtained permission from the apex court and there was also no environment impact assessment as per the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. They said the construction of a zoo close to the wildlife sanctuary with sloth bears would have an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive zone and could also increase the chance of conflict among animals, apart from reducing the sanctuary area. The authorities, however, said that zoo shifting is not a “non-forest activity” and hence no permission is required. They added that no recreational activity would be taken up at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Park in the forest area and minimum construction would be required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-recreational-activities-in-forest-area-hc/articleshow/87747249.cms||---

From the labour side, there is no place bigger for us. It remains our largest delivery organisation and the place where we see a ton of innovation coming out,” he said in an exclusive interaction with TOI. He described India as the company’s centre of skills. “It will be the place which will have a profound impact on our teams as we re-enter the broader market ecosystem,” he said. The managed infrastructure services company completed its separation from IBM earlier this month. The company has about 90,000 employees, of which a high proportion is in India. The company does not provide a geographic breakup of its workforce. Schroeter is moving fast. A week after the separation from IBM, Kyndryl and Microsoft announced a partnership under which they plan to launch a series of new managed services designed to accelerate hybrid-cloud adoption, advance artificial intelligence, enhance cybersecurity resilience, and modernise enterprise IT operations. Schroeter said the business was previously heavily focused on IBM, and part of the business’s mission was to help manage IBM technologies. “At the heart of us turning this business around is in our ability to participate in the broader ecosystem in a way that we couldn’t do before...We are going to have a substantial relationship with Microsoft and the Googles and AWSs of the world, and that’s what our customers are telling us – build capabilities and help them manage workloads. Up to this point, we didn’t have the investment to do it and the freedom of action to build relationships with them. You’ll see us move quickly here,” he said. Kyndryl has, as Schroeter has previously said, “a revenue growth problem, and...a profitability problem.” Revenues have been declining, and the company has been suffering a loss. The managed infrastructure services market as a whole is growing, he said, but Kyndryl has not been in that part. He thinks Kyndryl has a real opportunity to differentiate with its IP and data. “That sits at the heart of the platform we have. We are the biggest, so we have more data than anyone on how this version of SAP runs on that infrastructure with these other cloud providers. We are collecting all of that data, how they interact. We are just now starting to use that data in the right way to figure out what we can automate, what we can fix before it even becomes a problem, how we can help our customers really reduce their operational risk,” he said. Cloud, data (AI/ML), and security, he said, are the three top-of-mind things for customers, and the company is investing heavily in all of these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kyndryl-ceo-says-india-is-the-companys-centre-of-tech-skills/articleshow/87747316.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Mysuru||Karnataka takes digital step to verify documents for jobs & education||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government is inching closer to a paperless system by introducing digital verification of documents for employment and education purposes. Using the government of India application Digilocker, the e-governance department has more or less completed digitisation of 2.8 crore students’ education details, including marksheets from 80 educational institutions in the state for 2019-20 and 2020-21. These include secondary school leaving certificate (SSLC), pre-university course (PUC), professional courses like BE and MBBS, and pure science, commerce and arts courses. With Digilocker application already having a direct link with the government-issued documents like Aadhaar, PAN and driving licence, the department plans to get on board private companies to digitally verify documents for employment purposes. “We have roped in 49 departments in the Karnataka government to secure access under Digilocker for digital verification of probable employees’ documents. We are in the process of getting private companies as well for the purpose,” said HM Shreevyas, project director for Digilocker. The process is also expected to authenticate the education credentials of every aspirant on account of a digital signature. “We have provided the option of a digital signature to every education institution, which will authenticate the academic credentials of the candidate and weed out fake certificates,” said Shreevyas. Access to records will be available only with prior consent. For this purpose, the state government will bring a consent platform called e-Sahamati. DPAR additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said the Data Governance Committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify the approval for private companies to access digital records of prospective employees. “With data protection and privacy being of utmost importance, the e-Sahamati framework will assist the data fiduciaries to share it with private companies only on consent being given by the candidate,” said Chawla. Chawla said once the framework and its rules are ratified, the government will invite private companies to secure a licence under e-Sahamati and proceed further to secure the data. It is said the government will then equip every small and big private company to have a trained professional with access to data for accessing and downloading records for their verification. “The department will secure the details of one particular person, who will be notified by the company as the nodal officer and give him/her the technical education on how to use the application,” said officials. The department is confident of the depository and Digilocker being safe from hacking on account of the sophisticated encryption being similar to the one UIDAI used to protect Aadhaar details of citizens. The same access can also be used by educational institutions for enrolling students for higher education. The government is hoping to digitise all education records of students for up to 10-15 years, from 2006, thereby giving the departments a substantial pool of documents for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/state-takes-digital-step-to-verify-docu-for-jobs-edu/articleshow/87753759.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The process is also expected to authenticate the education credentials of every aspirant on account of a digital signature. “We have provided the option of a digital signature to every education institution, which will authenticate the academic credentials of the candidate and weed out fake certificates,” said Shreevyas. Access to records will be available only with prior consent. For this purpose, the state government will bring a consent platform called e-Sahamati. DPAR additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said the Data Governance Committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify the approval for private companies to access digital records of prospective employees. “With data protection and privacy being of utmost importance, the e-Sahamati framework will assist the data fiduciaries to share it with private companies only on consent being given by the candidate,” said Chawla. Chawla said once the framework and its rules are ratified, the government will invite private companies to secure a licence under e-Sahamati and proceed further to secure the data. It is said the government will then equip every small and big private company to have a trained professional with access to data for accessing and downloading records for their verification. “The department will secure the details of one particular person, who will be notified by the company as the nodal officer and give him/her the technical education on how to use the application,” said officials. The department is confident of the depository and Digilocker being safe from hacking on account of the sophisticated encryption being similar to the one UIDAI used to protect Aadhaar details of citizens. The same access can also be used by educational institutions for enrolling students for higher education. The government is hoping to digitise all education records of students for up to 10-15 years, from 2006, thereby giving the departments a substantial pool of documents for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/state-takes-digital-step-to-verify-docu-for-jobs-edu/articleshow/87753762.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Globally, GitHub has added 16 million new users in 2021. The ‘2021 The State Of The Octoverse’, the annual GitHub report released on Tuesday, says that almost 70% of active users in the code repository are now from outside North America. The fastest growing countries and regions outside of the US include Indonesia, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, UK and China. JavaScript is the top language, while Python continues to be the second most widely used language, and Java the third. TypeScript, which moved up to the fourth position last year, maintains that position. In fact, of all the 10 languages surveyed, only Shell and C changed places from last year -- Shell climbed one notch up to 8th position, displacing C. According to the report, teams perform 43% better using automation. It says that automating software delivery is a key enabler in open source, and it is also helping teams go faster at scale. “Automation helps reduce repetitive tasks, redundancies and errors, allowing developer teams to focus on higher-value challenges, and drive innovation. Ultimately, automation aims at empowering developers, enhancing developer experience and productivity, and helping create the right environment for them to innovate, solve challenging problems, and make a difference,” said Maneesh Sharma, general manager, GitHub India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/githubs-active-india-student-base-grew-24-8-this-year/articleshow/87747320.cms||---

Search and rescue teams recovered the body of a woman from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Vancouver, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Staff sergeant Janelle Shoihet added that investigators have received two missing person reports, but that they believe "there may have been other occupied vehicles that were lost in the slide." "The total number of people and vehicles unaccounted for has not been confirmed," she said. The rains had let up by late Tuesday afternoon. But mudslides, rocks and debris washed out several highways leading to Vancouver, trapping hundreds of motorists who were rescued by military helicopters by nightfall on Monday. Local television showed video footage of the Trans Canada highway -- which connects the coastal city to the rest of the country -- inundated. A bridge was also washed out. Other routes have also been closed, according to Drive BC, which said on Twitter: "Highways are closed until further notice." As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver would have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada. Anyone taking this circuitous route, however, would have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test upon re-entry into Canada. Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports. "Both CN and CP Rail indicate that no rail traffic is currently able to transit between Kamloops and Vancouver," a port spokesperson told AFP. In Ottawa, prime minister Justin Trudeau said his government is "watching closely" the evolving situation in British Columbia. He was to speak with the province's premier, John Horgan, later in the day to see what federal help might be needed. "We'll be there to help in any way, shape or form," he told reporters. Record rainfallEnvironment Canada said up to 250 millimeters (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado. The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town. On Tuesday, thousands of British Columbians were unable to return to their homes due to evacuation orders still in effect due to flooding in a dozen communities -- including all of Merritt and parts of Abbotsford -- and as many as 9,000 homes were without power. In Merritt, flooding compromised the wastewater treatment plant, while thousands in Abbotsford reportedly slept in their cars on an elevated road overnight, as farms in the Fraser Valley were inundated. Others took shelter at emergency sites set up across the province, with some also sleeping in church pews or at schools, local media said. "Everyone's been very good-humored," Andrew Clark, a musician stuck with a thousand other travelers in Hope, 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Vancouver, told public broadcaster CBC. "Everyone knows that we are in the same boat, so that's all quite good, but I think there's a sort of general air of disappointment that we can't find out more information about what's happening down the road," he said. "People are a little bit worried about how many nights we might be staying here."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/one-dead-in-mudslides-that-cut-off-vancouver-from-rest-of-canada/articleshow/87747321.cms||---

In the quarterfinals at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Tuesday, the hosts registered a five-wicket win to set up a clash with Punjab at the Alur cricket stadium on Thursday. Opting to bowl in a match which was delayed by 30 minutes and reduced to 48 overs a side due to overnight rain, Karnataka restricted MP to 169/9 before overhauling the target in 42.2 overs. Karnataka bowlers kept the run rate below four an over and reduced the opposition to 42/3 by the 14th over.

For the bowling unit, spinner Chandu V continued with her fine form, claiming 2 for 25. Shreyanka Patil and C Prathyusha too chipped in with two wickets apiece.In reply, Karnataka lost the in-form D Vrinda (7) early in the chase but Shubha S (43) and G Divya (28) steadied the innings. There was a brief lull in Karnataka's victory march when they lost Shubha and skipper Veda Krishnamurthy (17) in quick succession. But the middle order withstood the pressure, with wicketkeeper-batter K Prathyoosha scoring a 58-ball 45 (4x4) to see her team through.Brief scores: MP: 169/9 in 48 overs (Pooja Vastrakar 40, Soumya Tiwari 45; Chandu V 2-25, Shrenya Patil 2-27, C Prathyusha 2-29) lost to Karnataka: 170/5 in 42.2 overs (S Shubha 43, G Divya 28, Prathyoosha 45 n.o; Anushka Sharma 2-34).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-quell-mp-challenge-face-punjab-in-semis/articleshow/87747324.cms||---

---||Patna||‘Bihar govt to tighten noose around private bus operators charging high fares’||PATNA: Frequent passengers will now have to shell out more money as the fares of both private and government buses have gone up. The state transport department has given its nod to the increased fares in response to the request made by private bus operators after a rise in fuel prices. The secretary of the transport department, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told this reporter on Tuesday that the government would put up hoardings and banners everywhere so that “people know the exact bus fares”. “We had to fix the rates because the private bus operators were charging more money from the passengers. Now, if they ask for more money, people may lodge a complaint against them. We will take action against the violators and even cancel their permit,” Agarwal said, adding that all the regional transport officers would conduct meetings with the bus operators and discuss the new fares. Despite the transport secretary’s warning, private bus operators continued to charge exorbitant fares from passengers on Tuesday. Uday Shankar Prasad Singh, the president of the Bihar Motor Transport Federation, claimed, “We will not implement the new rates because we won’t earn any profit. Around 70% of us had suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and rise in fuel prices.” Earlier, the bus fares were revised in 2018. The new rates have been fixed under sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The government has implemented a hike of Rs 1.50/km for general buses, Rs 1.70/km for deluxe buses, Rs 2/km for deluxe AC buses and Rs 2.50/km for Volvo, Mercedes and similar buses. Besides, a hike of Rs 6.4 has been enforced for city buses for the first 4km and Rs 3 for the next 2km. Meanwhile, many passengers welcomed the new fares fixed by the government, but criticised the private bus operators for their arbitrariness. Aman Kumar, a bank employee, said, “The government rates are better than what the private operators are charging from passengers.” Bimal Kant, a resident of Lohanipur, rued, “Everything is costly now — fuels, bus fares and consumable items.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-tighten-noose-around-private-bus-operators-charging-high-fares/articleshow/87744143.cms||---
---||Patna||NDA hails, opposition assails one year of Nitish govt||PATNA: Nitish Kumar completed the first year of his seventh tenure as the state’s CM on Tuesday, but the period turned out to be marked by some searing experiences on account of the deteriorating law and order and the emergence of political killings. The year saw the burst of the disruptive second phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, pre-monsoon Amphan cyclone that damaged standing maize crops and four phases of floods with rain lashing the state as recent as last month, besides the hooch deaths this month, forcing the CM to go for a detailed review to overcome the lacunae and lapses in the implementation of the prohibition law that otherwise is deemed to be stringent on its own.  The ruling JD(U), of course, entered the Union cabinet, but it left heartburns. In the process, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) also got split that left Chirag Paswan, late Ram Vilas Paswan’s son and PM Narendra Modi’s self-declared ‘Hanuman,’ standing by the wayside -- a situation that was redeemed partly by the conferment of Padma Bhushan award to the senior Paswan, posthumously. The JD(U) overcame the initial hiccups by winning the bypolls for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats. The state also witnessed beating, manhandling and mistreatment meted out by the police to the opposition MLAs in the assembly for registering protests during the passage of the Bihar State Special Armed Police Bill, 2021. On the industries front, the state had its ethanol policy, and if the things kept going along the expected lines, Bihar could emerge as the country’s ethanol hub, as its manufacturing will be done by using (broken) rice and maize, besides sugar cane. Given the backdrop, the ruling and opposition parties reacted to the year gone by along expected lines with the ruling NDA combine seeing the glowing white on the curtain and the opposition the grim black patches on it. “CM Nitish Kumar has all along practised politics with a difference, as he not only has shown commitment to the state development consistently, but also prepares policies and plans to implement them and does not merely make announcements,” JD(U) chief spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar said on Tuesday. “He tackled the issues related to 32 lakh migrants who returned to Bihar from various states, and transferred money into their accounts under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method, which was also adopted by other states. The government went to the assembly elections last year with the second edition of the ‘Saat Nishchay’ prpgarmme and has also been implementing it,” Neeraj added. “The state government achieved vaccination of seven crore people and is also busy transforming the state into the ethanol production hub. The work is being done in infrastructure development and on improving health and educational facilities,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Chand Patel said. However, the opposition has remained unimpressed. “The government has failed to fulfill the promises as had been made by the JD(U) and its major allies in their poll manifestos. Neither jobs have been given to the unemployed, nor employment opportunities created,” RJD senior MLA Bhai Birendra said. “There is no control on law and order, prohibition has failed and the old disease of making transfers of officials for money minting has still been going on,” he alleged. On the other hand, while enumerating the government failures, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra also pointed to the “regular expressions of disagreement on policy matters,” including from the BJP, that, as he said, was the “manifest sign of lurking political instability in the ruling combine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nda-hails-opposition-assails-one-year-of-nitish-govt/articleshow/87744155.cms||Abhay Singh

Nitish took oath as the CM on November 24, 2005 and since then he has been continuing on the post, barring the nine months’ tenure of Jitan Ram Manjhi as the CM from May 20, 2014 to February 22, 2015. “The party has decided to organize special programmes at its state headquarters and all district offices on November 24 to mark the Nitish Kumar’s good governance in the state,” JD(U) chief spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar said at a press conference here on Tuesday. Neeraj said the party would organize discussions/symposiums on the social impact of the schemes launched by CM Nitish and other achievements of the JD(U)-led government. “JD(U) will also launch a new slogan –“Incomparable 16 years of impartial leadership and inclusive growth” on the completion of 16 years of the Nitish government,” he said. Neeraj also said Nitish is the only leader in the country’s political arena who does not believe in merely making announcements, but takes resolutions to execute his visions. “The 'Saat Nischay' (seven resolves) programme is an example of his strong commitment towards inclusive development,” the JD(U) leader said. Speaking on the occasion, JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha said coincidentally CM Nitish completed one year of his fourth term on Tuesday itself. Nitish took the oath as the CM for his fourth term on November 16, 2020. But he will complete 16 years on November 24. Kushwaha said the state government under Nitish Kumar has achieved several milestones in the field of development and progress. The party leaders would celebrate the day (Nov 24) by propagating the good works of Nitish Kumar among the masses. JD(U) state general secretary Mrityunjay Kumar Singh and state secretary Basudev Kushwaha were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-celebrate-16-years-of-nitishs-governance-on-nov-24/articleshow/87744170.cms||Madan Kumar

Under the instruction of the Calcutta High Court, the complaints of aspiring teachers are being heard by the SSC. We are trying to resolve the issues fast. For this, we have created a special cell. Apart from hearing the cases, we are also taking legal advices from lawyers,” said Basu. The minister added that they were doing exactly what the Calcutta High Court had asked them to do. “The HC gave us three months. Six senior officers of the SSC were hearing the cases daily. We will submit the report to HC. For job creations, we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the desire of chief minister Mamata Banerjee,” he said. Meanwhile, fire minister Sujit Bose faced the ire of assembly Speaker Biman Bandyopadhyay when he said that he had no figures of the fire incidents and deaths in such mishaps. Metiabruz MLA Abdul Khaleq Molla on Tuesday raised these questions in the assembly. Hearing his reply, Bandyopadhyay asked: “What are you saying? Why would you not keep such facts ready with you? You must look at the issue from a humanitarian point of view.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15k-teachers-to-be-recruited-soon/articleshow/87745133.cms||---

On the face of it, it may all look fine. But they might be laced with toxic chemicals that may eventually harm your health instead of providing you the necessary nutrients. A report prepared by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on groundwater contamination in Vadodara has revealed that toxic pollutants are not only causing adverse environmental impact but also entering the human food chain. This is happening in Padra, the vegetable bowl of Central Gujarat, located at the doorstep of Vadodara city. The central pollution watchdog has prepared a report on groundwater contamination due to poor operation of the Vadodara Effluent Channel Project (VECL) and contaminated industrial sites in Vadodara’s Padra and Bharuch’s Jambusar areas. Based on a complaint filed by Farmers Action Group (FAG), CPCB’s regional directorate at Vadodara along with officials from regional office of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had started random sample survey and monitoring of VECL’s channel earlier this year. VECL is an industry-supported body responsible for conveyance of treated wastewater from industrial units in and around Vadodara district through a 55 km long channel into the Gulf of Khambhat. The report has revealed gross mismanagement of industrial effluent which has severely contaminated groundwater in Luna, Umraya, Dudhwada and Pilodra village of Vadodara’s Padra taluka and Jambusar taluka of Bharuch district. Analysis as well as physical appearance of 11 groundwater samples collected from Luna, Umraya, Dudhwada and Pilodra villages of Padra taluka and Jambusar has shown significant contamination due to mismanagement of industrial effluent. “The groundwater is being used for agriculture and livestock feed and hence besides ill environmental impacts, toxic pollutants entering into human food chain is a serious issue of concern,” the report stated. The report states that CPCB’s monitoring between 2015 and 2019 had consistently found that VECL did not comply with the prescribed discharge standards at J-Point, the final discharge point in the estuarine zone of Mahi river. “The effluent having concentration of parameters much higher than the prescribed standards is being discharged by VECL in the estuarine zone of Mahi river,” the report further states. Environment activist Rohit Prajapati said that the report implies that GPCB continuously ignored violation of environment norms by VECL. “It had issued a so-called non-serious closure notice last year and which was not implemented leading to such a grave situation where you find chemical oxygen demand (COD) as high as 1,482 mg/l in Dudhwada village which is highest in the country,” Prajapati said. “At the same time, pollution of Mahi river stands fully exposed. Around 60 % of Vadodara depends on Mahi river’s water. Groundwater contamination had started with Luna and now has reached Dudhwada. Days are not far when borewells in Vadodara city will start seeing the impact of this contamination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/barodians-consuming-veggies-laced-with-toxins/articleshow/87744894.cms||Prashant Rupera

The blast had taken place on a plot left vacant by one Suleiman Ansari (80) behind his residence at Sultanpur Mirzatoli under the Danapur police station area in western Patna at around 2pm on Sunday. One Ayaz Khan’s (64) residence is located beside Suleiman’s house. Suleiman’s wife and his two grandsons and Ayaz’s wife were injured in the blast. Police had detained Sulieman’s 2 sons and one of Ayaz for interrogation, but set them free on personal bonds. Danapur SDPO Syed Imran Masood told TOI over the phone that they were still not certain what resulted in the explosion. “Test reports of the samples collected on Tuesday are expected in two to three days. The forensic test reports would decide further course of investigation,” he said. In reply to a query, Masood said explosive forensic experts were not available on Sunday due which their counterparts had collected samples. Probability of cooking gas leakage or large amount of cracker gunpowder are among the possible reasons behind the explosion. Meanwhile, the explosion spot is being guarded round the clock by police personnel. SI Dhirendra Yadav, who responded to Danapur police station SHO’s official cellphone, said the three persons who were set free on personal bonds have been directed to remain stationed in Patna till further investigation in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/forensic-experts-revisit-danapur-explosion-site/articleshow/87744192.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures invests in tech startup Velocity||Chennai: Revenue-based financing startup Velocity.in has raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based VC firm. Velocity has established revenue-based financing as an alternative to venture capital and traditional bank debt for e-commerce businesses in India. The company has over Rs 1,200 crore of fundable revenues connected to its platform and has already processed 250+ investments across 175 companies. The round brings Velocity's total equity raise to $30.3 million as it raised around $10.3 million in seed round earlier this year. The startup aims to deploy over Rs. 1,000 crore towards 1,000+ e-commerce businesses backed by the new funds. Velocity leverages this digital data to evaluate an application across 50+ parameters and extend up to Rs. 3 Crore of financing within 5 days. Velocity does not take any collateral, personal guarantee, or equity dilution and only charges a fixed fee of 4-8% on the deployed capital. As repayments are directly linked to a company’s revenues, Velocity has a skin in the game to support the revenue growth of its portfolio companies. Co-founder Abhiroop Medhekar says that an angel investor in the company connected them to Peter Thiel and Valar Ventures earlier and the firm had then taken a small position in their seed round and had kept in touch about the progress of the company since then. "Valar Ventures is a high conviction investor and they move very fast if they believe in the opportunity. For that reason, just as we were initiating our Series A fund raise process, Valar offered to lead the whole round instead," Medheker said. While increased internet penetration and widespread use of digital payments has resulted in growth in order volume on D2C websites, out of the 75,000+ independent e-commerce businesses being built on Shopify and WooCommerce in India, less than 0.5% have raised any equity funding, as per Velocity. "If you are generating healthy revenues, you don't need to dilute your equity, especially for repeatable and low-risk spends like marketing and inventory. Revenue based financing offers a much faster, flexible and dilution free alternative to keep growing your business," Medheker notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/peter-thiels-valar-ventures-invests-in-tech-startup-velocity/articleshow/87745073.cms||---

The PIDF was operationalised in January this year to subsidise deployment of card-swipe machines and QR codes among small merchants and in remote areas. The need for this was felt after debit card issuances crossed 90 crore, but merchant acceptance did not pick up. Traditionally, banks have been eager to issue debit cards as they got a fee on every transaction. Also, encouraging debit transactions meant that money remained longer in the bank as customers did not have to withdraw their weekly or monthly cash requirement. But the number of card-swipe machines were low as the revenue did not justify the capital expenditure. The RBI therefore created the PIDF with contributions from the central bank, card-issuing banks and payment networks. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the RBI said that Rs 613 crore was collected in the fund of which Rs 210 crore came from card-issuing banks, Rs 153 crore from card networks and Rs 250 crore from the RBI. Close to 40% of the machines were deployed at tier-3 and -4 centres, while another 35% was in tier-5 and -6 centres, 7% was in the northeastern states and 18% with small merchants in larger cities under the PM SVANidhi scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-fund-sets-up-2-5l-pos-terminals/articleshow/87745400.cms||---

The company, which claims to have cracked the two-wheeler financing market, is positioning itself as supporting the two-wheeler lifecycle by financing both new and old vehicles and also facilitating their sale, purchase and servicing. WheelsEMI , which is founded by three veterans from the two-wheeler industry, currently has the financing business as its mainstay with Bikebazaar the portal as its subsidiary. Last year the company disbursed loans over Rs 326 crore and has assets under management of over Rs 400 crore. Besides lending on its book, the company has co-lending arrangements with Yes Bank and electric two-wheeler manufacturer Greaves. The company was founded by K Srinivas, former president of Bajaj Auto, V Karunakaran also from Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance and Ratheesh Bharatan who was also with Bajaj Finance earlier. It has already raised capital from Elevar Equity and Faering Capital who have invested Rs 230 crore. Karunakaran told TOI that the company has an asset-light model and operates out of 12-14 branches across the company. Besides this, it has a large presence through a representative in a dealer’s offices. The company has built the capability to extend loans to anyone with the ability and willingness to pay within a 50-80 km radius of their representative. “We are in the final stages of a fund-raise, we have a verbal offer from one investor and expect to get a term sheet and close it in the next two weeks,” said Karunakaran. He said that the funds would help to bring down the cost of funds in two ways. First by making available funds for lending and second by improving the company’s credit rating above the current BBB level. An ‘A’ rating would sharply bring down the cost of funds for the company. The pandemic had put pressure on margins as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) doubled to nearly 6%. However, with the second wave receding the gross NPA numbers are also on a decline. However, unlike other lenders, WheelsEMI has been highly successful in recovering through the repossession of vehicles. “We refurbish these vehicles and sell them through the Bikebazaar portal. Our average loss for the vehicle was around Rs 10,000, which has come down to Rs 4,000 because we can sell the vehicle ourselves instead of dealers,” said Karunakaran. Given the integration between the verticals, the company expects to have a gross merchandise value of Rs 3,000 crore worth of vehicles by FY25. The used two-wheeler sales are also expected to feed into the third vertical of Bikebazaar service. According to Karunakaran, for customers, the USP of the portal would be the three Ts – transparency, trust and timeliness. Transparency would be ensured by adopting scientific methods for assessing engine conditions including an analysis of the sound and emission. The company would also ask for fewer documents and take a quick credit decision. The fourth vertical for the company is electric two-wheelers. “We strongly believe that electric two-wheelers are going to be the future. We want to get into the leasing of swappable batteries, which can cost up to 40% of vehicle cost,” said Karunakaran. He added that the company already had a partnership with Hero Electric, Okinawa and Ampere, which is owned by Greaves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bikebazaar-plans-fund-raise-to-expand-used-two-wheeler-sales-service/articleshow/87745500.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Amid market frenzy, Sebi looks to tighten IPO rules||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi has proposed to tighten the rules for initial public offerings (IPOs), which are currently witnessing hectic activities. Sebi, in a discussion paper, has suggested that at least half of the number of shares allotted to anchor investors should have a lock-in of 90 days or more, up from 30 days. The regulator has proposed that a company aiming to tap public money should be more specific about the fund-raise, rather than just stating ‘for future acquisitions’ as one of the objectives. In effect, the regulator seeks to cap the amount of money that companies could raise through IPOs for funding inorganic growth. However, going by precedents, any change in rules may not be effective within three-four months. The objective of the consultation paper is to seek comments from the public on certain aspects of Sebi’s Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) regulations relating to IPOs, Sebi said in the paper. Specifically, the proposed changes to the rules are relating to the objects of an IPO where the aim of the fund-raising is to make future acquisitions/strategic investments without identifying specific targets, conditions for offer for sale (OFS) by significant shareholders, lock-in of shares allotted to anchor investors and monitoring of funds raised for general corporate purposes. In the paper, Sebi said that a combined limit of up to 35% of the money raised by a company through an IPO could be deployed towards inorganic growth initiatives and general corporate purpose (GCP), where the target for the acquisition or the strategic investment is unidentified. This limit will not apply in case the target for acquisition or strategic investment is already identified and disclosed in the offer document. The proposed rule change may make it tough for startups and new age technology companies to raise funds. “It is seen that lately in some of the draft offer documents that new age technology companies are proposing to raise fresh funds for objects being termed as ‘funding of inorganic growth initiatives’,” Sebi said in the discussion paper. The regulator also proposes that companies should make detailed, quarterly disclosures about usage of funds raised for GCP. At present, companies could set aside up to 25% of the funds raised for GCP but are not monitored as strictly, Sebi said. The regulator seeks that, in IPOs of companies where there are no identifiable promoters, divestment of stake by all types of shareholders holding more than 20% could be capped at 50% of their pre-issue holding. In addition, their shareholding should be locked in for six months after the IPO, it said. Sebi is also looking at some lock-in for significant shareholders in companies without identifiable promoters. Currently, when promoter-driven companies go for an IPO, the shares held by promoters are locked in for 18 months. “It is meant principally to ensure skin in the game for the promoters to inspire confidence while approaching the public shareholder to raise fresh capital,” Sebi said. “There may therefore be a need to bring some parity to inspire confidence amongst the investors by existing shareholders, who are having significant shareholding. This may be specially required for loss-making companies coming up with IPO,” the paper noted. Sebi has sought public comments on these proposals till November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amid-market-frenzy-sebi-looks-to-tighten-ipo-rules/articleshow/87745388.cms||---
---||Business||Post-pandemic workplace needs culture of kindness||By Anjali RaghuvanshiNew Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s firm assertion is an insightful nudge to organisations today as they recognise and try to deal with mental wellness of their employees in a completely re-imagined future of work. A recent McKinsey report talks about mixed emotions amidst employees as they prepare to get back to different degrees of offsite-onsite work patterns. While 19% of those surveyed felt that a return to office will have a positive impact on their mental health, 49% felt that it could have a significant negative impact. Devastating as it has been, the pandemic has had a silver lining too. Emotional well-being at work has been finally given its rightful place, and organisations and individuals have stepped up to look for the sweet spot of connections that lend motivation to work. And that brings us to the one aspect that weaves the threads of purpose, belonging, collaboration, excitement and emotional stability into the fabric of happiness at work — kindness. The question is, how can we integrate kindness into an organisational culture to bridge and merge business performance with people happiness? A meaningful antidote to uncertainty In the Indian context, it is estimated that the second pandemic wave caused a loss of at least 7.4 million jobs. Besides the bleakness for those who are unemployed, it also places stress and uncertainty for the rest of the workforce, who have held the fort with extra tasks and responsibilities — not knowing when the situation will ease, and whether they will retain their employment. It is here that kindness as an organisational culture becomes critical. A research study by the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (APEX) showed definite links between a respectful & kind environment and solid business outcomes. Employees were found to be 26% more energetic, 30% more motivated to upskill & reskill themselves, and more open to new possibilities. In fact, they expressed 36% more satisfaction and 44% more commitment. These are exactly the emotions that will effectively neutralise the trail of uncertainty that the pandemic has left behind, as companies strive to deal with a disrupted normal. When broken down into points of action and acts, kindness can foster strong social connections, and create huge positivity across the entire organisation. In an unfolding scenario of remote work, kindness can increase camaraderie among employees, and make them feel that they are in control of what they do. In short, it creates a positive mindset and an environment where people are highly engaged to deliver outcomes of productivity, creativity and collaborative problem-solving. Creating an organisational culture of kindness The spirit of kindness starts with leaders — in fact, it is a leadership skill that cascades down the workforce to define the organisational culture. As Simon Sinek so beautifully puts it, “Leadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.” Leaders need to hone their emotional intelligence and self-awareness to create positive compassion in their interactions. Barring direct reports, leadership moments with the rest of employees are short, and it calls for authenticity to make them meaningful. It can be a simple but genuine “How are you?”, or taking time and effort to give an employee valuable feedback and advice. It can also be about complimenting people on the quality of their recent work, or remembering to enquire about a family member. The impact of such kindness is amazingly huge. Similarly, meetings and team huddles — be they in person or virtual — are excellent platforms and spread kindness. They occur regularly and offer relevant opportunities to connect with empathy and positive affirmation. Randstad India’s report ‘The Future of Work’ has revealed that virtual work is the preferred mode for consulting firms, technical service providers and digital media. Even for companies with static work requirements (such as banking, hospitality, healthcare, infrastructure and manufacturing), while 100% virtual working cannot be a reality, it will hover in the range of 30-50%. In such a redefined normal of hybrid work structures, HR and leadership teams must bring in measures to: * Integrate kindness intentionally into the workplace culture * Create a safe workplace that empower employees to be themselves at work with confidence, and without the fear of criticism * Enable the organisation to share information and create constructive dialogue with respect * Create opportunities for kindness through effective engagement policies and dedicated kindness calendars * Provide managers the resources and tools to support and celebrate a ‘kindness culture’ Creating a culture of kindness is an investment that can bring tremendous meaning in our professional lives. Its cascading effect is immense, as it encourages the payback of kindness to create outcomes of productivity, efficiency, collaboration and innovation — which are just the right ingredients for happiness at work.

Their teachers will, however, be trained first. Sanjay Kumar, the additional chief secretary of the education department, told this reporter, “Although English teaching starts from Class I in schools, many children fail to have a clear understanding of the language. This special programme will make them self-confident.” With a view to achieving this target, a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the State Council of Educational Research and Training and Leap for Word, a Mumbai-based organisation. Now, the teachers of elementary schools in the state will undergo a virtual training programme on YouTube or WhatsApp and help children improve their knowledge of English.  The other agencies involved in the programme will provide technical assistance to the schools. According to the agreement, the specially-designed English literacy programme will make government schoolteachers learn simple techniques that they will use to develop reading, writing, sentence construction and comprehension skills among children. The trained teachers will also be given certificates in the end. “The training programme, which starts next month, will be implemented in phases in three years,” said an education department official. The English literacy programme has already been successfully implemented in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-launch-english-literacy-programme-in-schools/articleshow/87744017.cms||B K Mishra

Chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, said that a decision will only be taken by the weekend, after discussing the taskforce recommendation with PTAs and other stakeholders. He said that a final decision by the government is yet to be taken and that the taskforce’s recommendation is not binding on the state government. Sawant said that the safety of children in high enrolment schools is a major area of concern for him. He said that he has asked director of education Bhushan Savaikar to submit a plan to him, outlining how social distancing will be implemented in schools with over 500 enrolment. “There are schools with almost 1,000 students and I am very much concerned about that. Taskforce has said there should be staggered timings, no assemblies, etc. But children are not vaccinated yet, which is my concern,” the chief minister said. Nearly two lakh children are enrolled from Classes I to VIII in schools across the state. Sawant said that after consultation with PTAs and other stakeholders, if the government feels it right, it may take a decision contrary to that of the taskforce. “Just because the taskforce has recommended it, does not mean the government should implement it. As chief minister and education minister, I can take a decision. The main problem is complexes like Cujira. There are schools with more than 500 students,” he said. Sawant said 15% of the eligible population has also not taken their second dose of the vaccine and many of them may have children in their families. He said that this was also an area of concern for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taskforce-for-reopening-schools-from-mon-cm-says-final-call-soon/articleshow/87746351.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna’s air quality turns ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate with fall in temperature||PATNA: The city air quality turned ‘poor’ on Tuesday and is likely to deteriorate further with the fall in temperature and calm wind. The air quality index (AQI) in Patna at 4pm was 242, considered ‘poor’ as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin. The environmentalists assert that the air pollution, mainly PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5microns) and PM10 (particulate matter less than 10microns), increases during this period of the year with fall in temperature and wind speed and rise in anthropogenic activities. Track the pollution level in your cityThe Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has predicted further rise in pollutants in the air due to climatic reasons. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials stated that the overall AQI of 242 for Patna was the average of AQI level at BIT-Mesra, Patna (318), Eco Park (303), SK Memorial Hall (286), DRM office-Khagaul (164) and Patna City (142). An AQI is considered good if it is between zero and 50, ‘poor’ between 201 and 300, ‘very poor’ between 301 and 400 and ‘severe’ in case of being in 401-500 range. A ‘poor’ AQI essentially means that people may suffer from breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure to such air. BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said wind velocity and its direction, weather conditions, anthropogenic activities and local conditions of adjoining areas (vehicular movement, construction work) decide the pollution level of the particular air monitoring station area. “That’s why the AQI level of some areas are more than the others. Besides, the temperature has started falling by 2-3 degrees Celsius with the onset of winter,” he told this newspaper. “Due to weather transition, there is formation of thermal inversion (soil is cooler than the air) in the atmosphere, which has lowered the vertical wind movement causing very low dispersion of pollutants, especially particulate matters,” he added. Several studies have found that states across the Indo-Gangetic plain, including Bihar, endure maximum exposure to particulate matters, because of its geographical area. To curb the pollutants in the air, the pollution board has decided to take measures to control different sources of the pollution, including open construction work and movement of open construction materials, conversion of brick kiln into zigzag setting and biomedical waste management. Ghosh said the BSPCB will send letters to all the district magistrates to ensure that screens are used in construction activities and materials be covered during transportation. “During winter, the construction activities increase but no one use the screens which lead to rise in PM2.5 level. We will impose environmental compensation (EC) on those who violate the norms. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given the rights to the boards to impose EC on violation of the norms. So, we will strictly implement this,” he said. “As far as the brick kilns are concerned, almost 5,000 of them have been converted into green technology. No other state has achieved this feat. The remaining kilns will be converted soon. We are also promoting fly ash and the state government has also announced that all the government buildings will be built by using it. Fly ash, the remains of coal, is the problem for thermal power. So it has decided that these ashes will be sued to make bricks for use in building construction,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-turns-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-with-fall-in-temperature/articleshow/87743932.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||No GST on top-up cover cost employees pay: AAR||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra bench of the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that recovery of an amount towards top-up of medical insurance and parental insurance premium from employees is not a supply and hence not subject to goods and services tax (GST). The AAR held that Tata Power, which had sought this ruling, is not rendering any service of health insurance to its employees or their parents and there is no supply of insurance services. Hence, the issue of levy of GST does not arise. However, it should be noted that the company had not availed of input tax credit for the GST charged by the insurance company. In this case, the AAR bench relied on a similar ruling given in 2018 in the case of Posco India Pune Processing Center. Lately, several AAR benches have adopted a similar stand that GST cannot be levied in cases of recovery of sums from employees for a wide range of services, such as a nominal amount recovered for canteen services or even parking. As reported by TOI earlier, the Gujarat bench of the AAR had held in the case of Tata Motors that GST would not be levied on the nominal amount recovered from employees for canteen facilities, which is passed on by the company to the third-party caterer. However, it had also added that input tax credit would be blocked. According to indirect tax specialist Sunil Gabhawalla, “The correct view is that there should be no recovery on nominal sums received from employees as there is no taxable supply. If this line of argument does not hold good, it can be argued that the company is acting as a pure agent and the value of ‘services’ should be taken as nil.” To illustrate, in the case of Ion Trading, a Noida-based subsidiary of a UK company, the UP bench of the Appellate Authority for Advance Rulings had held that the parking charges collected from employees and passed on to the building authorities was a service. However, it went on to add that the company qualified as a pure agent. Thus, there would be no GST levy on sums collected from employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-gst-on-top-up-cover-cost-employees-pay-aar/articleshow/87745404.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Business||Identify cos that are not viable: RBI governor to banks||MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday asked lenders to proactively identify loans to firms that have turned non-viable but not yet recognised as a non-performing asset (NPA) due to the special dispensation during Covid. The governor also asked banks to review the usability of capital for absorbing losses during a crisis. Pointing out that numerous high-frequency indicators are showing that economic recovery is taking hold, Das said that there have been several resolution frameworks announced in the wake of the pandemic. “As the support measures start unwinding, some of these restructured accounts might face solvency issues over the coming quarters. Prudence would warrant proactive recognition of such non-viable firms for pragmatic resolution measures,” said Das. Speaking at an economic conclave organised by the State Bank of India, Das noted that banks have weathered the Covid shock better than expected and, according to early trends, their bad loans and capital position has improved in September 2021 from their levels in June 2021. He said that the profitability metrics of banks were highest in several years. However, the improved parameters partly reflect regulatory relief provided to banks during Covid as well as fiscal guarantees and financial support given by the government, he said. “Certain concerns have re-emerged from the crisis which warrant our attention. Most importantly, we are faced with the question of capital and provisioning buffers of banks, their adequacy and resultant usability during a crisis,” said Das. He urged banks to focus and further improve their capital management processes to envisage the capacity for loss absorption as an ongoing responsibility of the lending institutions. In his speech, the governor also cautioned banks on the “technological invasion” that they face. “A word of caution is in order: Globally, the ‘phygital’ revolution has played out into several collaborative models between banks, NBFCs and fintech players such as incubation, capital investment, co-creation, distribution and integration… it must be recognised that the risks ultimately lie in the books of banks and NBFCs and hence the collaboration should be appropriately strategised,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-guv-to-banks-identify-cos-that-are-not-viable/articleshow/87745435.cms||---

These include IndiGo’s flights from Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad to Patna. According to sources, the Delhi-Patna flight arrived at the city airport at 12.50am on Tuesday night and left at 1.30am while the Bengaluru-Patna flight landed at the airport at 1.35am and left at 2.05am. The Hyderabad-Patna flight, on the other hand, reached the city at 1am and left at 1.40am. The Airports Authority of India had recently conducted a preliminary meeting to discuss the arrangements to be made at the Patna airport for tackling the problem of delay in flights due to foggy weather during the winter season. The airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), Santosh Kumar, told this reporter on Tuesday that a final meeting would be held with all the stakeholders in the next few days where issues like fog formation, safety measures, flight diversion and delays would be discussed. “The airport will take all the precautionary measures to ensure that passengers do not face any inconvenience during the winter season. Now that the terminal building has been renovated and expanded, we have a lot of space to accommodate more flyers,” Santosh said, adding that extra chairs would be placed in the security hold area if required. Meanwhile, depending on the climatic conditions, different airlines have also decided to reduce the number of flights operating in the morning and the evening hours. An employee of GoAir said, “At present, we are operating nine flights between 7am to 10pm. However, their timings have been changed under the winter schedule as the city is likely to experience foggy conditions in the next few days.” The Patna airport handles 50-56 flights every day, including 26 of IndiGo, 13 of SpiceJet, nine of GoAir, seven of Air India and two of Vistara. Its daily passenger footfall has also reached 14,000-15,000. As many as 14,249 flyers arrived at and left the airport on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-airport-no-late-night-flight-operations-from-today/articleshow/87743958.cms||Faryal Rumi

She said many of the private hospitals don’t share information on dengue. “Apart from sharing the information with the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), fogging in the identified localities is also being done by the health department,” she said. A total of 249 dengue cases have reported to the CS office till Monday evening. Three patients were undergoing treatment in the paediatrics ward at AIIMS-Patna and five in the department of medicine at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH). PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said rosterwise fogging in all localities was being done regularly. However, the localities identified by the health department as hotspots were taken for intensive fogging. “The PMC has 75 hand-held machines and 40 vehicles for fogging by using malathion as effective insecticide. Sanitiser machines are also being used with larvicide for destroying the breeding sites of mosquitoes which carry the dengue virus,” he said. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said some patients with symptoms of dengue also visit the medicine OPD, but they don’t meed hospitalisation and are sent back home.  “Dengue is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and the best protection from it is to keep the areas around you clean and dry. Its symptoms also vary from headache and fever to bleeding from nose or with urine. Timely medication is necessary for early recovery,” said Dr Satish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/249-dengue-cases-reported-in-patna-surrounding-areas/articleshow/87743978.cms||VK Tripathi

The chief minister sent the amount to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries from his Tadepalli camp office. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said the government was giving highest priority to farmers’ welfare. Besides extending a helping hand to the farmers through the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) across the state, he said the government was also coming to their rescue at the time of distress, including disasters. He said the government had paid a compensation of Rs 645.99 crore to 8.34 lakh farmers who lost their crops due to Cyclone Nivar in November 2020. The compensation was paid in December 2020, he added. With the latest Rs 22 crore, the government has in total paid Rs 1,071 crore to the farmers during the last two years towards compensation, he said.

The SIPB, which met at the chief minister’s camp office in Tadepalli on Tuesday, cleared the proposals, which will provide indirect employment to 7,683 persons. An Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd unit would come up at Pulivendula in Kadapa district at a cost of Rs 110 crore. This will provide direct employment to 2,112 persons for the manufacture of jackets and trousers. Century Ply would establish a plywood unit at Badvel in Kadapa district at a cost of Rs 956 crore, providing direct employment to 2,266 persons. The unit would also encourage farmers to grow eucalyptus on 22,500 acres. The unit is also expected to buy Rs 315 crore worth eucalyptus trees from the farmers for the unit. AIL Dixon Technologies Limited has also come forward to invest Rs 127 crore to establish a camera manufacturing unit in Kopparthy industrial cluster in Kadapa district. This unit would provide direct employment to 1,800 persons, the SIPB said. AIL Dixon Technologies would also establish a laptops and tablet manufacturing unit with an investment of Rs 80 crore. The unit would provide direct employment to 1,100 persons, the SIPB said. The SIPB also cleared the proposal to establish a unit to manufacture industrial chemicals by Grasim Industries. The firm would invest Rs 861 crore and provide direct employment to 400 persons. The SIPB, however, has not cleared Grasim’s proposal to establish a thermal power plant due to local opposition. While addressing the meeting, the chief minister told the officials to be cautious while allocating land for the industries. He also told them to consider land allocation for the existing industries wherever land is available. He directed officials to provide basic infrastructure in the area before giving permission to any industry. He also asked them to ensure that environmental precautions are strictly followed.

Palavalasa Vikranth, Devasani Chinna Govinda Reddy and Ishaq Basha filed nominations before the returning officer for the three MLC posts to be elected by MLAs. Deputy chief minister Dharmana Krishna Das, ministers Botcha Satyanarayana, Seediri Appala Raju, government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy and party leaders were present. Earlier in the day, all three candidates met chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at his Tadepalli camp office and received the party B Form from him to contest the MLC election. They thanked the chief minister for nominating them to the Upper House. The three posts fell vacant on May 31 this year with the retirement of MA Shariff from the TDP, Somu Veerraju from the BJP and D C Govinda Reddy from the YSR Congress. The ruling YSR Congress had nominated Govinda Reddy for another term, while the TDP and the BJP have lost the chance even to field their candidates as they have no required strength in the assembly. There were no other nominations for the three posts except those filed by the YSR Congress nominees. It is likely that the three candidates would be declared elected unanimous. Meanwhile, the YSR Congress is also set to win all 11 vacancies in the legislative council representing the local bodies. The ruling party had already named its candidates and it is likely that they would also be elected unopposed as the TDP or the BJP have no strength to field their candidates. These elections are scheduled to be held on December 10 and the counting would take place on December 14, if an election is required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-candidates-file-papers-for-mlc-polls-no-other-nominees/articleshow/87744372.cms||Gopi Dara

Speaking to TOI, inspector of Two Town police station K Venkata Rao, said the youngster had suffered severe burns that had affected his vital organs. The girl is still undergoing treatment at KGH, where her condition is said to be critical. Authorities at KGH said both the boy and the girl suffered over 60 per cent burns.

Harshavardhan was from Bhupalapalle of Telangana and the girl is a native of Visakhapatnam. . On November 12, Harshavardhan checked into a private lodge in Vizag city and the following day, called the girl to discuss their relationship.  The girl told the police that she had rejected Harshavardhan’s marriage proposal. An angry Harshavardhan poured petrol on the girl and set her ablaze. He then set himself on fire.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, new road work bids 20% below cost estimate||MUMBAI: The BMC, which had re-tendered road work contracts last month, has once again received bids that are below estimates. Municipal officials said that unlike the previous Rs 1,200 crore road work tenders, where contractors quoted up to 30% lower than the estimated cost, this time the bids are around 15%-20% below estimates. A municipal official said that by the month-end, the proposals will be brought before the civic standing committee for approval. TimesViewThe modus operandi of road contractors quoting rates below the official estimate has been happening in the BMC for over two decades. If a contractor is willing to do a job worth, say, Rs 100 for Rs 85, it hints at cutting corners. That is why freshly laid roads develop potholes with the first rain shower. The administration must break the cartel formed by some contractors.“Previously, when some of the bids were 30% below estimates, it was very obvious that no quality work could have been done. We have worked out the current estimates and found that satisfactory work could be done at the current rates quoted,” said a BMC official. This time when the BMC re-tendered the road works of Rs 1,200 crore along with it, it also tendered for another Rs 800-900 crore of road repair works, including those in Mhada layouts. This, therefore, has taken the total cost of repairs to about Rs 2,000 crore. Of the total 2,000km of road network in the city, as much as 275km is proposed to be repaired. Some of the repair works are likely to start by the end of December if the standing committee gives its approval in time. Corporators said that the entire process of re-tendering has only wasted time as bidders have again quoted below actual costs. “This has caused an unnecessary delay as we have already lost two months of ‘fair’ season work time. The taxpayers who pay for getting good quality of roads are being deprived of it owing to these administrative hassles,” said Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator. The opposition alleged that this has been a tactic to delay actual works as BMC did not have the funds to pay for these works in this financial year. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said funds meant for important works like road repairs were diverted to grand projects like cycle tracks or upkeep of penguin enclosures at the zoo. “Even if contractors have quoted below estimates, it is essential that the BMC seizes their security deposits if they find that the work being executed is not at par with what they have proposed. Besides, civic engineers should also ensure that regular supervision is undertaken to keep a check on quality,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-new-road-work-bids-20-below-cost-estimate/articleshow/87746998.cms||Richa Pinto

He asked them to be part of curriculum designing, syllabus preparation and introduction of new-age courses. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Federation of University (Contract) Teachers Association took exception to allowing aided college faculty members to join Andhra University as assistant professors. “This is a gross violation of status quo orders given by high court of Andhra Pradesh.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Govt in Catch-22 situation over clouded GST, VAT issues||GANDHINAGAR: Even as the ruling BJP government is gearing up to face a crucial assembly election next year, it finds itself in a Catch-22 situation. Even as the government has begun making preparations for the 2022-23 budget, there is looming uncertainty over continuance of GST compensation from July 2022 and ending of Value Added Tax on petroleum products by bringing these under the GST regime. Key sources close to the development said, “The state finance department has started planning for 2022-23 budget presuming that the five-year term of GST compensation will end on June 30, 2022 and that petroleum products will be included within GST from the next budget.” “At present, we get around Rs 20,000 crore as GST compensation per annum against loss of revenue due to adoption of GST regime and have around Rs 25,000 crore per annum income from VAT on petroleum products. If we do not get these two resources in 2022-23 budget, we may have to cut our budget size drastically,” sources informed. Explaining the predicament of the state government, sources said, “The state government has limited scope to mop up income to match loss of resources coming from GST compensation and VAT on petroleum products. It is likely that GST on petroleum products may not even be half of the actual income of VAT on petroleum products.” Sources added that the government cannot cut budgets allocated to ongoing schemes or resist announcing new schemes as next year will be a crucial poll year. “For the moment, it is a tight situation for the state government and we hope the Centre will address this concern,” said sources. Kanubhai Desai, finance minister, when asked about the planning for alternate financial resources in case the Centre stops giving compensation against loss of income from July 1, 2022 and if the Centre brings petroleum products under GST regime, said, “These are national level issues. All states are facing the same situation like us. Centre has always cared for Gujarat’s interest and we are sure it will do what is best for the state.” Desai avoided any specific comment on whether the Centre will be requested to extend GST compensation deadline beyond June 30, 2022 and not include petroleum products under the GST regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-in-catch-22-situation-over-clouded-gst-vat-issues/articleshow/87745620.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Visakhapatnam||Will the police’s new project usher in ‘Parivartan’ in Visakhapatnam's Agency, AOB?||VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam, Agency areas in East Godavari and the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) have emerged as the single largest region in the country in ganja cultivation. Though enforcement agencies are chalking out plans to root out the crop, the task is proving to be a daunting one that requires efficient coordination and educating ganja cultivators, who are mainly tribal farmers in remote regions. An interstate coordination meeting on strategies to combat narcotics trafficking saw the southern states come together to tackle the problem. DGP Gautam Sawang has said Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka will work with Andhra Pradesh and Odisha to combat narcotics trafficking, with a special focus on cannabis cultivation and smuggling in Vizag Agency and the AOB. In fact, ganja cultivation has grown in Visakhapatnam and along the AOB. The area under the crop is estimated to be over 10,000 acres and is spread across 200 to 250 villages in the region. Seventy-five per cent of the area under cultivation lies in the AOB while the rest is distributed between the Agency in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari. The banned CPI(Maoist) holds sway in some of the areas. “We have launched Operation Parivartan, under which we destroy the ganja crop, create awareness on the consequences of the illegal trade and provisions under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, besides educating ganja growers on alternative crops,” said deputy inspector general (Visakha range) LKV Ranga Rao. “We are hoping the Odisha government will also destroy the ganja crop on their side of the AOB,” he added. “Destroying ganja crops in AOB areas by deploying workers and armed forces is not an easy task because of the presence of Maoists. Moreover, it’s not easy to enter the AOB without coordinating with the Odisha government,” said a senior police officer, who pointed out that, “the smuggling network has been developed over the years by middlemen from various states and the system now works like a well-oiled machine that includes ganja growers, carriers and other persons.” “The government must understand why tribals take to ganja cultivation. We observed that ‘poddu’ cultivation and growing of paddy is not possible in many areas in the Vizag Agency and AOB and so some tribals have taken up ganja cultivation for a livelihood. Some educated tribal youth are also attracted to ganja cultivation for money to continue their studies. We are appealing to the government to come up with a sustainable action plan that will provide alternate livelihoods and employment in the hilly areas,” said the convener of the Joint Action Committee of Adivasi Organisations, Ramarao Dora. “Though enforcement agencies are destroying ganja crops in some areas, it is a temporary solution as the growers will plant them again and it is not that easy to destroy the crops in the remote areas of AOB,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/will-the-polices-new-project-usher-in-parivartan-in-agency-aob/articleshow/87744459.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Charges over ganja trade fly thick and fast||VISAKHAPATNAM: The high extent of ganja cultivation in the Maoist-affected areas of the Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) has seen the police and Maoists locked in a blame game. While cops accuse the rebels of ‘encouraging’ the illegal trade as a source of funds, the Maoists have denied links to ganja cultivation and smuggling and claimed that enforcement agencies are collecting bribes from smugglers. DGP Gautam Sawang has said that most of the ganja is cultivated along the AOB and in areas that have a CPI(Maoist) presence. However, the state’s handling of left wing extremism would pay dividends in the coming days, he added. The ganja trade is one that involves multiple players, starting from cultivators, financiers, seed and fertilizer providers, local transporters, local traders and ending with interstate smugglers. Business depends on a chain system for transporting the weed from remote areas to metros and other cities across the country. Dismissing the allegations of the police, Maoists alleged the ‘men in khaki’ of being hand-in-glove with the ganja mafia and collecting monthly kickbacks from smugglers. Adding that tribals are made victims, they alleged that ganja is a source of income for traders, middlemen and enforcement officials. Recently, a police constable, GA Naidu, attached to Koyyuru police station, was arrested for his involvement in the ganja trade in Visakhapatnam district. In 2015, an inspector of prohibition and excise in Narsipatnam, M Jaganmohan Rao, was suspended for pilferage of ganja worth over Rs 6 crore that had been seized from smugglers. Jaganmohan Rao had sold the ganja back to smugglers. “the ultimate victims in the ganja business are innocent tribal people. Many of them are now behind bars. The government has to understand the various aspects of the ganja menace to come to a suitable solution,” said convener of Joint Action Committee of Adivasi Organisations, Ramarao Dora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/charges-over-ganja-trade-fly-thick-and-fast/articleshow/87744478.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Boipara happy to see regulars back||KOLKATA: The reopening of educational institutes has given a new lease of life to Boipara on College Street and several iconic hangouts that are frequented by students. On Tuesday — the day when schools and colleges reopened after a gap of 20 months — several book vendors and traders experienced a rise in footfall, all of which did not convert to sales. However, traders hope that the return of regulars to Boipara will boost the sales of books. There are close 15 colleges and universities, nine schools and several coaching centres within 1km radius of College Street. The closure of educational institutes in March 2020 due to the pandemic had affected the business at Boipara. “Since afternoon many students came to Boipara, either to purchase or enquire about books. Sales went up by almost 15% on Tuesday, which may not be very high but indicates that once all the institutes start functioning fully, our business will return to the pre-pandemic level,” said Suranjan Ghosh, a book vendor at College Street. The pandemic-induced lockdown as well as two cyclones in two years damaged the business and the stock of booksellers at College Street. Even the big traders were affected too. Students of different colleges and universities started crowdfunding to help out the vendors. “The livelihoods of several lakhs of people are associated with the book trade. As the students had been attending classes online during the pandemic, the demand for reference books had dipped, which in turn hit our business. We anticipate that from now, the sales of books will improve. We request the regulars to buy books from small vendors as this will help them financially,” said Pratap Das, secretary of Sir Ashutosh Booksellers’ Association. The iconic Coffee House too reported an increase in footfall on Tuesday. “After the pandemic started, this place would remain half empty in the first half of the day because colleges and universities were shut. Usually, students and teachers come here for coffee and sandwiches in between classes. On Tuesday, we saw a few groups coming in. Business will get better when the campuses reopen fully,” said Tapan Kumar Pahari, secretary of Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society Limited that runs the Coffee House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/boipara-happy-to-see-regulars-back/articleshow/87745151.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Roy J Vayalat, owner of No 18 hotel, Fort Kochi, appeared before the investigating officer at the office of assistant commissioner on Tuesday after a summons was issued to him on Monday. Vayalat also produced a digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV cameras installed inside the party hall and parking area. The DVR was missing when police had carried out an inspection at the hotel. Though police said that nothing suspicious was found, sources said that some of the video footage is missing. Moreover, it was earlier found that two DVRs were missing from the hotel but Vayalat produced only one before the police. He was asked to submit the second one too. Sources said that Vayalat stuck to his earlier statements that all the four passengers of the car, including the driver Abdul Rahman, had consumed liquor at the party and he had advised them against driving in an inebriated condition. He also said that out of concerns for their safety, he had sent his friend Shaiju to follow the car. The police have already identified that Shaiju, who drove an Audi car, was seen driving close to the ill-fated car and that he had attended the same party at the hotel in Fort Kochi. Vayalat told the police that he moved the DVR from the hotel fearing action by excise department for serving liquor beyond permitted time. “He said that excise department has been probing reports of liquor being served at the hotel late into night. After the accident, he feared that if the CCTV visuals of the bar and party area, which shows late-night liquor serving, was found, it would lead to the cancellation of the hotel’s bar licence,” said a police source. The investigation team, which checked the DVR in Vayalat’s presence, said the statements given by the latter need to be verified and the missing DVR needs to be submitted for inspection. “He was allowed to go after interrogation. We have not booked him and further probe is needed,” said Ernakulam ACP Y Nizamudeen. Motorcyclist to file petition Meanwhile, Dinil Davis (32), the motorcyclist who was knocked down by the car before it crashed, may file a new petition. The private company executive said the FIR missed the fact that he was knocked down by the speeding car and he raised concerns that it might affect his accident insurance claim. He has sought legal opinion to file a petition. Davis was on his way home (Kanjoor) from the firm’s head office in Perumbavoor when the car knocked him down before it rammed a tree around 12.45am. He escaped with three stitches on his leg, a few minor wounds and bruises on his chest and shoulder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-question-hotel-owner-over-vyttila-car-accident/articleshow/87745900.cms||---

The leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly said that he and the other opposition leaders have been providing “positive feedback” to the CM, but the efforts lead to nowhere. The CM, at least, should heed the words of advice given to him by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal with regard to the prohibition policy and its implementation. Tejashwi alleged that as many as 80% of police personnel, including senior district level officials, and politicians associated with the ruling JD(U), have been consuming liquor that is otherwise banned in Bihar. Tejashwi also said in the past, he and the opposition had provided evidence in this regard in terms of video clips, but the government did not take any action. “Why the lower constabulary suffer the brunt of punishment by way of suspension and then they are also put on duty again after the revocation of their suspension order. No middle-rung police officer has been suspended or dismissed,” Tejashwi said, adding that if a few mafia elements were arrested and jailed in the past, they also got freed later for lack of evidence in the court. Tejashwi also said he had presented evidence on the floor of the state assembly against land reforms minister Ram Surat Rai and his brother, but no action was taken in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-calls-nitishs-review-meeting-on-prohibition-a-sham/articleshow/87745088.cms||Abhay Singh

Sources said the Army’s top brass is trying to neutralise the effect of the information leaked by jawan Ganesh Kumar to the Pakistan army as the enemy can take advantage of it in case of a war. These espionage details surfaced after the preliminary investigation and interrogation of Kumar, intelligence sources said. “Kumar leaked the information during his posting at Jodhpur Military Hospital reception from January, 2019 to September, 2020 when he got access to several documents containing information about the location where the officers or jawans had come from for admission or check-up. The PIO, who had honeytrapped Kumar while posing herself as the Indian Navy medical team staff posted at Kochi hospital, asked him how he filled the details in admission papers as some of the jawans and officers at her hospital did not mention all these. Then Kumar used to click the documents and shared them on WhatsApp with the PIO. The Pakistan intelligence used to join the dots to know about the deployment of Army units,” a source said. “Kumar was later transferred to Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, in September, 2020. The PIO then extracted information from him about the military hospitals across the country,” the source said. The action against Kumar, who served the Indian Army Medical Corps, was based on specific information from the Lucknow-based Military Intelligence (MI) unit and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). He had come under their surveillance several months ago. Kumar, a native of Asthawan village in Nalanda district, was arrested by the Bihar police anti-terrorism squad with the help of IB and MI when he was going by a train to join duty in Pune. He has confessed to sharing information related to national security with the Pakistan operative. Police and intelligence agencies also found sensitive documents from his cellphone and forwarded him to judicial custody on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/honeytrapped-jawan-leaked-sensitive-army-details-to-pakistan-intelligence/articleshow/87745101.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Total 109 cases of child abuse have been reported across the state out of which 77 are against girl child and 33 are male child between July to September 2021. The highest number of child abuse cases were reported at Mapusa police station (24), followed by Calangute police station (10) and eight at women police station. The least number of cases have been registered at Margao, Agasaim, Anjuna, Quepem and Saligao. Sexual abuse cases among teenagers were the highest in the state, followed by domestic violence, kidnapping, assault and cybercrime, according to the Victim Assistance Unit (VAU) report.  The VAU was set up in April 2014 and has successfully completed six years of providing service 24x7 to children who encounter the police and who come to the unit directly. VAU coordinator Emidio Pinho said that besides handling cases of abuse, the unit has also conducted various training as well as awareness sessions to different stakeholders. A few months ago, chief minister Pramod Sawant drawn sharp criticism on social media platforms and demands for an apology soared after he said in the House that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. He had also said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” He was referring to the gangrape of two minor girls at Benaulim beach. Last week, Sawant had said that the state government will soon take more steps towards ensuring women’s safety and security. He said that the government is contemplating to have a pink force to tackle crime against women. While he said that he felt upset when crimes were committed against women in the state, the chief minister maintained that Goa leads other states where crime detection is concerned. “Goa has a crime detection rate of 93%. One can compare this with other states. We will take more steps towards the safety and security of women in the coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/six-cases-of-child-abuse-every-week-in-goa-from-july-to-sept/articleshow/87746316.cms||Murari Shetye

Apparently, on November 14 when the Congress launched a statewide agitation against spiraling prices of petroleum products in Mumbai, supporters of Jagtap abused and heckled Siddiqui, a charge denied by the Mumbai Congress president. It was Siddiqui’s second letter in the recent past to Gandhi against Jagtap. In his letter, Siddqui has stated that when he participated in the morcha, Jagtap made derogatory remarks against him in the presence of AICC general secretary K C Venugopal. “Stern action should be taken against Jagtap in view of his rude behaviour,” Siddiqui said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cong-hit-by-infighting-complaints-reach-sonia/articleshow/87745893.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Kolkata||Families wake up to early mornings||KOLKATA: Parents and children had to reset their alarm clocks as they struggled to go back to the old school routine — getting up early, getting ready for school, preparing lunch and then keeping the extra time in hand to travel to school — on Day 1 of reopening of schools after almost 20 months. “Even during this period of online classes, my cell phone alarm used to ring at 6.45am every day, but I had learnt the art of snoozing it without even opening my eyes. Well, that’s not possible any more as my daughter has to leave at 7.30am to attend her first class at school by 8.30am. It’s a renewed struggle but I guess within a week, we will be back to our old routine,” said Sujata Ghosh, mother of a Class-X student of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. For Paikpara resident Amrita Nandi and Janbazar homemaker Rita Das, the struggle was similar, as both had to get up more than two hours prior to the time they had been waking up till Monday. “During this period of online classes, I had adjusted to the routine of waking up around 7am, preparing breakfast and lunch for my husband while my daughter had the luxury to sleep till 10am before I used to shake her up to attend the 11am class. But on Tuesday, I woke up at 4.30am, prepared lunch for the family and my daughter’s tiffin. I woke up my daughter, then she got ready and we left home at 8am. Her classes started from 9.30am but on the first day, we tried to reach a bit early,” said Nandi, whose daughter Paromita is a Class-XI student of Bethune School. Anilava Das, a Class-XII student of Scottish Church Collegiate School, was so excited to return to school after almost a two-year gap that it kept him awake for a major part of the night. For his mother Rita, the struggle was far more real as she woke up at 5am and did all the household chores as she accompanied her son to school and even stayed back to bring him home.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Travancore Devaswom Board hints at concessions in shop auction rates||KOTTAYAM: Devotees started arriving at Sree Dharma Sastha Temple in Sabarimala as the temple gates were opened from Tuesday morning. Only those who had booked slots in the virtual queue system are being permitted to the hill shrine from the base camp at Pampa-Thriveni. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president K Ananthagopan hinted at giving some concessions in the auction rate for the shops in Sabarimala. He said that the rates cannot be reduced steeply as asked by bidders who cite Covid-19 or floods. The same can be reduced slightly; but this will affect other operations here, he added. Addressing the media later in the day, Devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan said that more pilgrims will start arriving once the weather becomes favourable. The restrictions enforced now are for the safety of all pilgrims in the wake of the pandemic. He also said that currently 13 lakh devotees have registered online for darshan. A bath in the Pamba is not allowed for the safety of devotees as the water level is high. He also said that Njunangar Bridge across the river, which was destroyed in the heavy rain, will be reconstructed. In accordance with the increase in the number of arrivals, the traditional Sabarimala road, Neelimala-Appachimedu, will be opened for the pilgrims to return to Pamba. Sufficient lights and toilet facilities will be ensured along this road, said the minister, who also inaugurated the prasad packing units at Sannidhanam. TDB started its annadanam at Sannidhanam where pilgrims can avail free food three times a day. Breakfast is from 7am-10am, lunch is served from 10.30am-3pm and dinner after 5pm. Due to Covid protocol, food is served as buffet. The Punyam Poonkavanam project launched to keep Sabarimala clean, has completed ten years. The project was launched for removing the waste accumulated at the holy shrine every morning during the pilgrim season. It was introduced by IG P Vijayan in 2011. The service of Ayyappa Seva Sangham also began at Sannidhanam. Around 200 volunteers of the outfit are there at Sannidhanam for supporting the needs of devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tdb-hints-at-concessions-in-shop-auction-rates/articleshow/87745915.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Mukhyamantri Abhyuday Yojana to benefit students in every dist||Prayagraj: Now, the youths of the small towns in the state would also be benefiting from the classes being conducted under the Mukhyamantri Abhyuday Yojana. These classes, which offer free coaching to meritorious students across the state who cannot afford private tuition/coaching classes fees, would now be held in every district of the state instead of just the divisional headquarters. The scheme was launched by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on February 15, 2021. As part of the Abhyuday scheme, the UP government has set up coaching centres and offered free classes to prepare the students for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for the medical aspirants, the entrance exam for the National Defence Academy, Combined Defence Services (CDS) examination and Union Public Service Commission exams. The platform has over 500 IAS officers, over 450 IPS officers, over 300 IFS officers and several experts on various subjects who contribute by creating educational content through physical classes and virtual sessions for civil services and other competitive exams aspirants. A dedicated portal http://www.abhyuday.up.gov.in/- too has been launched for benefit ofstudents. These training classes were given online during the multiple lockdowns that the state went through. Gradually, the ‘Abhyuday’ coaching centres were set up at the divisional level in the first phase and is now being followed up at the district level in the next phase, informed officials of the state social welfare department. For paving way for the classes to begin at the district level, a missive has already been sent to all the Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates on behalf of Director of Social Welfare Department. Now preparations are on to constitute district-level committees, he added. Deputy director (social welfare), Prayagraj, Manjushree Srivastava said, “This time, the Chief Minister Abhyudaya Yojana classes are to be held in all the districts of the state”. She added, “State social welfare director’s letter has arrived in this regard. District-level committees are being constituted. This is the reason that the classes which were to start from November 15, have been stopped for the time being. As soon as the committees are constituted in all districts of the division, the classes will start simultaneously in all the 75 districts in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/mukhyamantri-abhyuday-yojana-to-benefit-students-in-every-dist/articleshow/87745916.cms||---

Appealing for cent per cent vaccination in all villages in the district, Chavan said villages achieving the target quickly would be entitled for such funding incentive. “The Covid vaccination is vital amid fears of the possible third wave of the pandemic. The rural population should shed its inhibitions and get vaccinated as early as possible,” he said, while addressing villagers from Khuldabad taluka. The district administration led by Chavan has launched an aggressive Covid vaccination campaign in the rural pockets where the vaccination percentage is still low. As part of the effort, Chavan has been visiting different villages with an appeal for speedy vaccination. As per official data, the rural areas of Aurangabad district have a target population of 21.7 lakh to be covered under Covid vaccination. Of this, 12.5 lakh beneficiaries have received at least one dose so far, which accounts for nearly 58% vaccination. The rural areas have only 4.1 lakh beneficiaries who are fully vaccinated, which account for only 19% of the total target population. To boost the vaccination programme, the Aurangabad zilla parishad has appointed a nodal officer for each of the nine talukas from the district. The officers concerned have been given a target of achieving minimum 90% vaccination by the end of December. Besides vaccine hesitancy among certain sections of the society, the heavy rainfall in Aurangabad district during the recent monsoons as well as the dearth of vaccination doses in the past have been blamed by authorities for the relatively poor vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/top-25-aurangabad-villages-in-covid-vaccination-to-get-extra-funds-collector/articleshow/87743532.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hindu man offers vacant Ggn shop space for namaz||Gurgaon: Amid opposition in some parts of the city to namaz being offered in public places, a local resident who is a Hindu has come forward to offer a small commercial space he owns in Old Gurgaon to the Muslim community for Friday prayers. Akshhay Rao, a wildlife tour organiser who owns several shops at the mechanic market, said most of his tenants are Muslims and were facing problems offering Friday prayers. He said he had made available one of his vacant shops, which can accommodate 15-20 people. “I have not done anything special. It is not the first time I have offered my place for namaz; I had done so a few years ago too,” said Rao. Rao told TOI he was born and brought up in Gurgaon and had never seen a communal dispute. “I was disturbed after reading reports about namaz being disrupted. My aim was to let our Muslim brothers know that it’s only a handful of people who are causing this. We have been living together peacefully and will continue to preserve and maintain our social harmony,” he said. District administration officials said they have not included any private land in the list of the places for Friday prayers and no one has yet formally approached them to offer their private land or space for namaz. Muslim groups welcomed Rao’s “gracious” offer but said they are yet to receive a formal proposal. At the same time, they said private spaces were unlikely to be a solution because there have been instances in the past of neighbours raising objections. Shahzad Khan of Muslim Ekta Manch said they had met a district administration official on Friday for restoring namaz in Sector 12A. “Two years ago, our mosque was sealed in Sheetla Mata Colony. We have been requesting to open it and clear encroachments from Waqf Board land to provide adequate space to offer namaz,” said Khan. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurgaon Muslim Council, said Rao’s offer was “a true example of brotherhood”. Like Khan, he also stressed the number of namaz sites, now reduced, is insufficient for the city’s Muslim community. The number of sites for offering namaz in the city has come down by nearly half. While 37 spots had been identified in 2018 after the first round of protests over the issue, 20 public places were earmarked for Friday prayers at the beginning of November by a government committee in consultation with community representatives. The sites were reduced after weeks of protests by right-wing outfits and some locals, first in Sector 47 and then at Sector 12A, against the use of public spaces for namaz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-man-offers-vacant-ggn-shop-space-for-namaz/articleshow/87745928.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC denies Indrani Mukerjea's bail ‘on merits’ in Sheena Bora murder case||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday dismissed on merits a bail application filed by Indrani Mukerjea in the Sheena Bora murder case. After hearing her counsel Sana Raees Khan at some length on Monday, Justice Nitin Sambre had asked her to take instructions and inform by Tuesday whether she desires to withdraw her bail application. Khan got back on Tuesday to say Indrani Mukerjea wishes to invite an order on merits of the case. In other words, she did not wish to withdraw her plea. Her advocate said Indrani will now move the Supreme Court agaisnt the rejection and seek bail there. Indrani Mukerjea (50), arrested by the CBI on August 25, 2015, for allegedly murdering her daughter, is lodged in the Byculla Women’s prison. It was her first bail plea on merits before the HC, said her lawyer. Justice Sambre had on Monday orally said, “on merits, am not convinced”, and on Tuesday passed the rejection order. The CBI alleged Indrani is the main accused who executed the murder of her own biological daughter following a conspiracy with her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamwar Rai, on April 24, 2012. Her body, the CBI said, was then burnt and dumped in a forest in Pen, Raigad district. Indrani’s husband Peter Mukerjea — who she divorced during the ongoing trial — was also arrested the day the chargesheet was filed. CBI prosecutor Sandesh Patil with DP Singh said her first bail plea was rejected in 2016, and four times thereafter and “there has been no change in circumstances”. Indrani denied all charges and is facing trial. She may now challenge the bail denial before the Supreme Court. Advocate Khan cited various “contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies” and said “no last seen theory” existed in the case to argue that CBI “concocted the case”. She also cited SC orders and argued that Indrani has faced six years of “pre-trial punishment” and the trial is likely to go on since 185 more prosecution witnesses are to be examined. The CBI, in turn, cited SC rulings to submit that neither delay in trial completion nor prolonged incarceration could by themselves be reason to grant bail in a serious case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-denies-indrani-mukerjea-bail-on-merits-in-sheena-bora-murder-case/articleshow/87745919.cms||---

After a search, cops found the Class-VIII student in the temple town of Bishnupur in Bankura district around 1pm. The boy told cops that he had gone to his maternal grandmother’s house there after being scolded by a teacher at his tuition class for being inattentive. He was scared that his parents would also scold him after his teacher complained to them. “So, the boy ran away to escape being scolded by his parents at home,” said an officer. After the boy was finally found at his grandmoher’s home, cops at Bansdroni polie station and Lalbazar heaved a sigh of relief as they had been trying to trace him since Monday night. “We had been told that the boy had booked an app cab and gone to Howrah station, where we lost his tower location as he had switched off his mobile or its battery had died. The boy told us that he had spent the night at the station and boarded a Midnapore local on Tuesday morning. From Midnapore station, he took a train to Bishnupur,” said a police source. “We were certain that he had boarded a train from Howrah after we spoke to several witnesses and traced the cab driver, who had taken him to the station,” said an investigating officer. As the search continued, the boy’s relatives living outside the city were contacted and instructed to alert his parents and police if and when they came across him. “However, we traced him with the help of a source,” said an investigating officer. Cops will counsel the boy to ensure that he does not make a similar mistake again. “There have been many such instances before. But children, who flee from houses for adventure, are often unaware of its consequences,” said an officer of the detective department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scolded-at-tuition-13-year-old-runs-away-to-bankura-traced/articleshow/87745159.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Allahabad||Robinhood army and Food Safety dept come together to feed needy||Prayagraj: To ensure that no person is forced to starve and even the poorest people in Sangam city have food to survive, a joint effort by the Prayagraj unit of Robinhood army and the Food Safety Drug Administration department of the district is sure to come as a boon just before harsh winter sets in. Following the noble work done by the Robinhood army for the past two years, the district administration has decided to come forward and further strengthen the bond between the ‘army for the poor’ and the restaurants of the district. Many restaurant owners in the city have happily agreed to part with the remaining amount of food that goes wasted at their respective establishments and the same would be distributed to the homeless and downtrodden by the volunteers of the Robinhood army. The department had arranged a meeting of the Robinhood army representatives and the office bearers of the hotel and restaurant association of the city. “Although we were in contact with some of the prominent hotels and restaurants of the city as we had collaborated to help the needy during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the businesses of both hotels and restaurants of the city were also adversely affected and it had an impact on our collections too. The meeting now was to restart the valuable contribution of these two segments, left-out food of which can be used to fill the stomach of the needy people in the city”, said a senior member of the Robinhood army, Narendra Tiwari. He further informed TOI that there are around 250 active volunteers of the ‘army’ and presently the sticker drive is being carried out by the team of these volunteers who visits the guest houses of the city every Sunday and paste the stickers at the noticeable places of the guest houses. “Through the stickers, we try to communicate the numbers using which these guest houses, who are used for marriage and birthday functions, can contact us if they have the leftover food. The food, which the donor wants to give us, should be minimum of 25 people with no limit of maximum quantity”, said Tiwari. He added that the sticker drive has already covered around 90 guest houses of the prominent localities of the city including Daraganj, Kydganj, Allahapur, Sobatiyabagh, Talierganj etc., while 90 odd more guest houses marriage halls would be contacted in the coming Sundays. “We attend the calls late at around 11 in the night also and if someone calls us after that, we request to kindly preserve the food and the same is picked up early in the morning, we taste the food and if it is fit to be consumed, we distribute it to the needy living in the vicinity of the site from which we have collected the food”, said Tripathi. Chief food safety officer at the Department of Food Safety and drug administration, KK Tripathi said, “The department is trying to play the role of a bridge between the hotels, restaurants and this noble NGO and from time to time, such meetings are held to spread awareness about the noble work of this ‘army’ and how hotels and restaurants can play an important role in the same”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/robinhood-army-and-food-safety-dept-come-together-to-feed-needy/articleshow/87745925.cms||---

A workshop in this connection would be held at KTDC Grand Chaitram here on November 17 and 18. Unveiling the plans, higher education minister R Bindu said the campaign has been named as ‘Samabhavanayude Sadkalasalakal’ (Virtuous Campuses of Equality). “Kerala caught the global attention in the past because its development indices were pro-women. Despite Kerala being in forefront in literacy and higher education, there are several glaring factors that pull the state back. It’s against this backdrop that the higher education department and the LDF started a new campaign to achieve the goal of establishing a pro-women Kerala,” the minister told reporters on Tuesday. The minister said the campaign is the beginning of the efforts to ensure women-friendly campuses and gender equality awareness throughout the higher education sector. It would help to ensure that gender justice forums are functional on all campuses. Steps would also be taken to make timely changes in curriculum and syllabus, the minister said.

The state reported fewer than 1,000 cases for the sixth day in a row, but there was a slight increase in Covid fatalities. Maharashtra added 886 cases and 34 deaths on Tuesday, taking the total cases to 66.3 lakh and fatalities to 1.4 lakh. Active cases in the state dropped further to 11,847, of which 3,554 were in Mumbai. The number of critical cases in the city at the moment was 257, a fraction of the tally in May-June. Less than 7% of the 17,500 beds earmarked for Covid patients were occupied, according to the BMC dashboard. With cases consistently staying low even 10 days after Diwali, the BMC has reduced over 2,000 beds for Covid. “We are closing down some wards in a few of our peripheral hospitals as there are very few Covid patients. In some places, we have allowed beds to be converted to non-Covid ones,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We can add the beds back if needed within a few days,” he added.The situation is the same across the state, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-single-covid-death-in-city-for-3rd-time-in-nov/articleshow/87747007.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Key accused in nat'l kidney racket was running clinic in Guwahati, held after 4-yr chase||Dehradun: After four years of chase spanning several states, police on Tuesday arrested a doctor, one of the main accused in a country-wide organ transplant racket, from Guwahati. He was quietly running a clinic in that city. Police said Dr Akshay Raut, who had set up the clinic in Guwahati some years ago, moved from one state to another, changed his name and identity to hoodwink officials. Electronic surveillance helped police pin down the accused, who carried a bounty of Rs 20,000 on his head. Blowing the lid off the scam, five persons had told Haridwar police on September 11, 2017 that Dr Amit Raut, Akshay's father, had illegally removed one of their kidneys during surgery at a hospital in Doiwala, Dehradun. Subsequently, on September 15, Raut was arrested from Panchkula in Haryana and police teams recovered luxury cars, including a Mercedes and BMW, and cash worth Rs 33 lakh, that the doctor, who turned out to be the mastermind of a large scale kidney racket, had earned through organ trafficking. Further investigations found that each kidney would be sold to prospective clients for anything from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore. During interrogation then, Raut told police that Akshay had fled to Chandigarh and had been hiding in several states, including Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal. He was finally traced in Guwahati, where the police arrested him. The accused doctor has been booked under sections 420 (fraud), 342 (wrongful confinement), 370 (trafficking of person) and under relevant sections of the Gangster Act. So far, 17 people, including doctors and nurses and support staff, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the scam. “The location of the absconding doctor was traced to Assam and West Bengal, following which teams were sent and the accused was arrested and produced in the court,” said a senior police officer in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/key-accused-in-natl-kidney-racket-was-running-clinic-in-guwahati-held-after-4-yr-chase/articleshow/87745173.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Thane||Oxygen capacity in Maharashtra 2,500MT, target 3,838MT||MUMBAI: The state could require up to 3,838 metric tons of medical oxygen during the peak of a possible third wave when active cases may skyrocket to 12.95 lakh, according to projections drawn by the health authorities. To tackle such a demand, the state has been steadily augmenting its storage and production capacity for the past four months. It has managed to almost double it to reach 2,500MT from the previous capacity of 1,200MT. However, it could take a while to reach the desired volume of 3,838MT. The state now has 150 liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks in public hospitals, including medical colleges, that can hold 2,000 kilolitres of oxygen. LMO is the mainstay in ICUs and high-dependency units, where patients on life-support require high pressure oxygen. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said the state plans to add 200 LMOs, the funds for which will be allocated from the Centre’s Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package (ECRP-II). In addition to the LMOs, a total of 513 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants that can generate oxygen are also being installed in all districts. Sixty-eight of these plants, provided under the PM Cares Fund, have already been installed. “In all, more than 50% of the PSA have already been installed, while the rest are in process,” he said. Mumbai has been building capacity to generate and store up to 400MT oxygen, up from its existing capacity of 250Kl. According to the guidelines of the Centre, 70% of the supplies for a region have to come from LMOs, 20% from PSA plants and 10% from tanks, dura cylinders, etc. Ramaswami said that based on this formula and the active case projection for the third wave, every district has been asked to build capacity. During the second wave, Maharashtra faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen, forcing it to borrow supplies from neighbouring states and enforce stricter norms like restricting the use of oxygen-guzzling devices such as high flow nasal cannula. Against the state’s capacity of 1,200MT oxygen, the demand had shot up to 1,800-1,900MT. To avoid similar sights of desperation, the Centre handed out comprehensive plans to states to increase their bed, medicine and oxygen capacity. Dr Kanchan Wanere, state nodal officer for medical oxygen, said states have been told not just to create capacity that would suffice patients on a given day, but to create enough storage for the next three days. The state received donations of 5,000 oxygen concentrators from PM Care Funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/oxygen-capacity-in-maharashtra-state-2500mt-target-3838mt/articleshow/87749587.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Material prosperity, he said, cannot save the nation if we allow the breakdown of traditional discipline or do not act promptly to arrest the decline of moral and ethical standards. He was addressing the vice-chancellors at the chancellor’s award presentation ceremony at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. “If there is an interruption in the transmission of the skills and values which have come down to us from the past, the purpose of universities is not well served. If we are not to fail, we must ensure that the basic Indian cultural values are properly assimilated by students, accepted by them, and made a part of their very being. That is what we require if our universities are to succeed. If we are not able to do it, that is not the right education,” he said. Knowledge one acquires should be deeply internalized that it manifests itself in enlightening others. It must become the very part of our being. It must make us different from what we were before we received our education and degrees. If it is not done, our education has not really been a successful venture, Khan said. Khan, who is also the chancellor of state universities, said that state universities are yet to contribute substantially to offering Massive Online Open Courses and to place themselves in the services like Study Webs of Active–Learning for Young Aspiring Minds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inculcate-values-in-students-guv-tells-varsities/articleshow/87745943.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi high court nod for herbal hookah with riders||NEW DELHI: In a boost to pub and restaurant business, Delhi high court on Tuesday gave its conditional nod for use of herbal hookah in all such outlets in the national capital, saying that Covid-19 restrictions cannot be permitted to continue at the cost of livelihood. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a batch of petitions by several restaurant and bar owners against the restrictions on serving herbal flavoured hookahs, said the prohibitions imposed on account of the pandemic couldn’t go on forever and noted that the authorities had already permitted cinema halls and swimming pools to function at full capacity. However, the court clarified it was granting permission as an interim relief and the same was subject to the petitioners giving an undertaking that they would strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. It restrained the authorities from interfering as long as Covid safeguards are followed. In case of any change in the pandemic situation, the government will be free to approach the court. The court directed the government to file its response and asked it to take a call if other restaurants and bars approach it for the same permission. The petitioners argued that they were serving herbal hookahs for which no licence was required as they were totally without tobacco, but police were still conducting raids, seizing equipment, and issuing challans. The petitioners had challenged the order of the joint commissioner of police (licensing unit). The government had argued that allowing hookah consumption in public places might spread Covid as people would share it. “Now you have opened everything. Cinema hall, full capacity. Swimming pool, full capacity. You want to ban hookah, you can do it, but not on the ground of Covid,” the judge told government counsel Santosh Tripathi. “What is happening? These people don’t have to survive? I’ve given you a long rope. But there has to be a limit. You can’t have such restrictions at the cost of livelihood. I know we can’t put our guards down, but this can’t go on forever,” the court observed, when the government maintained that herbal hookah could not be permitted now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-nod-for-herbal-hookah-with-riders/articleshow/87745960.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Cut dose gap, Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope urges his central counterpart||MUMBAI: State health minister Rajesh Tope has urged the Centre to reduce the gap between two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine Covishield. Tope met union health minister Mansukh Mandviya in Delhi on Tuesday and apprised him about the steps taken by the state to bring down the Covid-19 cases and informed him about the work done by the BMC to complete 100% coverage of first dose in the city.Tope said that to boost vaccination, the Centre must reduce the gap between two doses of Covishield to 28 days from 84 days. He said many countries have reduced it and many states have raised a similar demand. “The government has allowed the second dose to be administered in 28 days to those going abroad for studies or work and so there should be a re-think for others too,” said Tope. He asked the Centre to allow booster doses for health-care workers. Tope said that since schools and colleges in the state have started, the Centre must issue guidelines for vaccination of those under 18. The state sought funds for additional manpower in case of a third Covid wave and urged the Centre to re-start the scheme under the national health mission. Mandaviya congratulated the BMC for completing 100% vaccination coverage of the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cut-dose-gap-tope-urges-his-central-counterpart/articleshow/87747026.cms||---

A study conducted by the researchers of the Molecular Biology Unit at the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) has highlighted the important role of small RNAs during Chandipura virus infection, which can be used in microRNA-based therapy. Recently, the research on the pathogenesis of Chandipura virus was conducted by Neha Pandey under the supervision of Prof. Sunit Kumar Singh, a well-known virologist and the head of the Molecular Biology Unit. The study was published in the July-2021 issue of the prestigious peer reviewed international scientific journal, “Journal of Biomedical Science”. “Whatever is neglected today may be a potential threat tomorrow. Therefore, it is very important to understand the intricate mechanism of neglected viruses,” said Singh. He said that in 1966, the Chandipura virus was discovered during an unknown fever outbreak in Chandipur village near Nagpur, Maharashtra. The Chandipura virus particularly attracted the attention of virologists between 2002 and 2004, when its infection was reported in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. According to him, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of the Chandipura virus. Prevention of vectors spreading the Chandipura virus, maintaining good nutrition, health, hygiene and awareness in rural areas will help in preventing the risks related to the virus infection. The microglial cells of the brain respond quickly to infections in the brain. Chandipura virus infection in the brain over-activates microglial cells and induces inflammation. He said that the research highlighted a mechanism that might be involved in aggravating the encephalitis-like symptoms during Chandipura virus infection. The Chandipura virus is an RNA virus. Children under the age of 15 are more vulnerable to Chandipura virus infection and have a higher mortality rate. The Chandipura virus spreads through infected sandflies and mosquitoes. The sandflies belonging to Phlebotomus spp and Sergentomyia spp are reported to play a major role as a vector for the transmission of Chandipura virus. There are millions of nerves and cells in the human brain. Infection in the brain results in inflammation and disturbs normal functioning of the brain. Chandipura virus infection leads to high fever, vomiting, convulsions, and other brain disorders, similar to encephalitis like symptoms, and severely affected patients may slip into a coma or other serious complications. These symptoms are classified under the category of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Most cases of AES are thought to be caused by bacterial meningitis or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. However, in more than half of the cases of AES, the source or factor cannot be traced. Singh said that the research highlighted the role of microRNA-21 in the activation of microglial cells in the Chandipura virus infected human microglial cells. Chandipura virus infection in microglial cells upregulates microRNA-21, leading to reduced expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in cells. This leads to increased activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB p65) in human microglial cells. Activation of NF-kappaB p65 promotes reactions that contribute to the aggravation of symptoms associated with encephalitis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rna-based-drugs-vaccines-may-play-important-role-against-infectious-diseases/articleshow/87745972.cms||Binay Singh

---||Business||Coromandel Intl to invest Rs 400 crore in new plant||Hyderabad: Secunderabad-based crop protection products manufacturer Coromandel International Limited (CIL), which is a part of the Murugappa Group, is investing Rs 500 crore in setting up a new 1,650 metric tonnes per day capacity sulphuric acid plant at its fertiliser complex in Visakhapatnam. The new plant will boost the company’s sulphuric acid production capacity by another 5 lakh MT per annum from the current level of 6 lakh MTPA to a combined capacity of 11 lakh MTPA, the company said on Tuesday. Coromandel International said the investment is in line with its long-term objectives to secure key raw materials for its fertiliser production, reduce import dependence considerably and ensure sustainable production of phosphoric acid, which is one of the key raw materials for phosphatic fertiliser manufacturing. The company is the country’s second largest phosphatic fertiliser producer and the largest private manufacturer and marketer of phosphatic fertilisers in the country, it added. The company’s Visakhapatnam manufacturing unit has a production capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per annum of complex fertilisers and a captive phosphoric acid production capacity of around 4 lakh tpa, it said. CIL has also signed technology partnership agreements with MECS Monsanto Enviro-Chem Systems (MECS) and ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions (TKIS) for setting up the project. Commenting on the proposed facility, Arun Alagappan, executive vice chairman, CIL said, “India is a net importer of sulphuric acid, and the third largest importer globally, accounting for close to 20 lakh MT of imports. In line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision...for import substitution and promotion of local manufacturing, Coromandel has announced the setting up of the...plant...Considering the essential nature of fertilisers, this investment will improve the self-sufficiency and availability of phosphatic fertiliser in the country.” According to Brian Blair, global licensing manager, MECS USA, the company has worked closely with CIL to be able to guarantee the precise performance and emissions control needed for the project to meet stringent environmental standards and production objectives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coromandel-intl-to-invest-rs-400-crore-in-new-plant/articleshow/87745225.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi to strive for per capita income at Singapore’s level by 2047: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Outlining the economic and development vision of Delhi government at a meeting of chief ministers and finance ministers of all states chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the target was to make the capital’s per capita income equal to Singapore’s by 2047. The discussions were held to improve the country’s economy and accelerate the pace of development in all states. Delhi’s growth rate reached 11-12% in the past six years and per capita income Rs 3.5 lakh, which is three times the national standard. The service sector accounts for 85% of Delhi’s GDP. Currently, Delhi’s contribution to India’s GDP is 4.4% despite having only 1.5% of the country’s population. TIMES VIEWThe Delhi government has set itself the ambitious target of making Delhi’s per capita income equal to Singapore by 2047. But increasing per capita income should go hand in hand with reducing inequality. That ensures that the poorest sections have a share in progress, which should be the goal of any welfare-oriented government.Sisodia underlined that shortage of land was the biggest challenge in the all-round development of Delhi and stressed that the AAP government expected cooperation from the Centre in this regard. Delhi has 29 planned industrial areas and four flatted factory complexes. “There are also 25 non-conforming industrial clusters, but all activities take place there. The central government should validate these areas soon so that they can contribute to the growth of Delhi,” said Sisodia, while urging the Centre and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to cooperate in the larger interest of citizens. The Kejriwal administration intends to build a world-class multilevel manufacturing hub on 147 acres in Rani Khera. On 55.2 acres, a knowledge-based industrial park is being developed in Baprola. In Kanjhawala, an integrated industrial township has been planned. The proposed large greenfield project will be on 920 acres. “The city’s roads of 540km length are being redesigned at a cost of Rs 11,000 crore to meet world-class standards. Delhi government expects the central government to contribute in this regard too,” said Sisodia. The deputy CM added, “The AAP government is working to make Delhi pollution-free. It has implemented the Electric Vehicle Policy and intends to make the city the country’s e-vehicle capital. A thousand e-buses have been procured. In the coming days, 4,000-5,000 e-buses will be purchased for which the central government’s cooperation will be needed.” “New hospitals are being constructed on government-owned land. While DDA has given land to private trusts to build hospitals, they have not been able to use them. These lands should be audited by the central government. If the trusts are unable to build hospitals, Delhi government will construct world-class hospitals on such land,” said Sisodia. Sisodia further stated, “Currently, only 20% of Class XII pass children across the country get higher education. In the last 5-6 years, this figure has exceeded over 45% in Delhi. To build a college or university, Delhi government has to purchase land from DDA at high prices. If DDA brings a change in its policy with the intervention of the central government, it will be of great help in improving the field of higher education.” He also appealed to the Centre to approve the remaining three Delhi Metro Phase-IV corridors. Sisodia said the AAP government was promoting startups and had drafted a new policy for them. To improve ease of doing business, 454 old rules from 16 departments had been repealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-strive-for-per-capita-income-at-singapores-level-by-2047-sisodia/articleshow/87745981.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Madurai||Madras HC: Exhume body of fisherman, hold re-postmortem||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed a team of experts to exhume and conduct a re-postmortem on the body of the Pudukottai fisherman on November 18, after taking into account the apprehension raised by his wife that her husband’s death was due to gunshot injuries suffered at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities who had opened fire mid-sea. The court passed the order while hearing the petition filed by R Brundha, wife of the deceased fisherman R Raj Kiran. Justice G R Swaminathan said that while the authorities stated that the petitioner’s husband died as he fell into the sea following a collision of his boat manned by him with a Sri Lankan navy vessel, the petitioner contended that her husband died due to gunshot injuries. The judge said that it was further contention of the petitioner that though the postmortem was performed at the Jaffna Medical College Hospital in Sri Lanka, the postmortem certificate was not handed over to her. The petitioner was not allowed to see her husband’s body before burial as the body came in a sealed coffin. The judge observed that when such genuine apprehension is raised by the petitioner, it is the duty of the state to allay the same. The judge directed a team of experts to exhume and perform a re-postmortem on Kiran’s body on the site itself on November 18. The judge also permitted a retired forensic science professor representing the petitioner to be present when the procedure is done. The judge directed the authorities to submit the re-postmortem report before the court and directed to serve the same to the petitioner’s counsel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-exhume-body-of-fisherman-hold-re-postmortem/articleshow/87745221.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan said that while the police have taken a stand that the death of the man Suresh Kumar, 27, was suicide due to consumption of poison, the petitioner alleged that his brother was murdered.The judge said that the state submitted that CCTV footage shows that the deceased person had gone to an agro farm to purchase pesticide. The spot where his body was later found has also been captured in the CCTV.The judge said that the court had directed the investigating officer to circulate the CCTV footage to the petitioner’s counsel to allay his misgivings. Since the counsel insisted on a report, the judge directed the DSP to file the same. The judge also directed the police to ensure the safety of the petitioner’s family.In his petition, Anand stated that his brother was in love with a woman from another caste for the past eight years. When her parents knew about their relationship they threatened Kumar not to meet her and lodged a complaint against him. On November 7, police officials and the woman’s brothers came to Kumar’s house and asked him to come for inquiry. When his advocate went to the police station at around 5pm, he was informed that Kumar did not come there.Later, they found him lying unconscious with injuries. When they took him to the hospital, he was declared brought dead. Suspecting murder, Anand filed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-moves-hc-suspecting-caste-bias-in-brothers-death/articleshow/87745231.cms||---

The committee said Dr Priya Varghese, wife of CM’s private secretary KK Ragesh, was shortlisted ‘illegally’ for interview to the post of an associate professor in Kannur University. The minimum eligibility for the post of an associate professor is a PhD degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor-level. Varghese joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012. While working, she availed three years’ leave under the FDP programme for completing her Ph. D, the petition claimed. Quoting UGC Regulations 2018, Clause 3.9, the committee said the period taken by the candidates to acquire MPhil and/or PhD degree cannot be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to teaching posts. Further, the period of active service spent on pursuing research degree simultaneously with teaching assignment without taking any kind of leave shall be counted as teaching experience for the purpose of direct recruitment/promotion. The period of leave taken for pursuing research degree, i.e. for acquiring PhD, shall not be counted as teaching experience for the purpose of direct recruitment/promotion, it noted. “She also served as the director, student services for two years in Kannur University from 2019, which also cannot be considered as teaching/research experience. She cannot claim more than 4 years’ of teaching or research experience and thus she is blatantly ineligible to apply for the post,” the committee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/norms-flouted-for-cpm-mans-wife-to-be-on-list/articleshow/87745982.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Nepal seeks nod to let its census workers cross Dharchula in India to reach 2 of its villages||Pithoragarh: Nepal’s Darchula district administration has reached out to India’s Dharchula SDM (in Pithoragarh), AK Shukla, seeking permission for that country's census workers to use Indian routes to reach Tinker and Chhangru villages. The reason is that the two Nepalese villages situated on the eastern side of the Kali river do not have direct connectivity with the Himalayan nation's mainland, leaving only one option, Dharchula on the Indian side, to gain access to these villages. Taking place amid political skirmishes, Nepal’s 12th national census, conducted every 10 years, kicked off on November 14 and is slated to conclude on November 24. A house survey was completed in October this year. The foot trail lining Tinkar and Chhangru villages to the rest of the district and the headquarters, Darchula, was damaged by landslides triggered by floods. Following the devastation, villagers started using Indian roads to reach Darchula. Though the Nepal government started the construction work on the 127km Darchula-Tinkar road in 2008, only 40km stretch could be completed even after 13 years. The Nepalese army, too, repaired the track but it was damaged again, say locals. To reach their respective destinations, the villagers first go to Chhiyalekh, then cross the Kali river at Sitapul and enter India. While returning, the same drill is followed – they cross the river and enter Nepal via Dharchula. After the Nepal cabinet in May last year endorsed a new political map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura under its territory amid a border dispute with India, the villagers were left on the edge. They say that earlier, Tinkar and Chhangru villages were on the other side of the Kali river but with the new map showing Kalapani in Nepal’s territory, they have no idea where they belong. India’s Dharchula SDM said he has apprised the Pithoragarh DM of the situation and also forwarded the letter sent by the Nepalese authorities for conducting census. Responding to a query on whether authorities in India has considered giving permission to Nepalese officials, sources said they have received no response from the Indian side so far, adding that other means would be used to reach the villages if permission was not granted. The request comes less than a week after TOI reported that the Nepalese government is gearing up to conduct a census in the Kalapani region of Pithoragarh district -- an exercise that is likely to stoke border tensions between India and Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepal-seeks-nod-to-let-its-census-workers-cross-dharchula-in-india-to-reach-2-of-its-villages/articleshow/87745255.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Madurai||2 women’s bodies found at Sivakasi explosion site||Virudhunagar: After 10 hours of struggle, officials on Tuesday evening recovered the bodies of two woman employees from the debris of a cardboard tubes manufacturing unit building which collapsed following an explosion in Sivakasi on Monday. The unit was allegedly manufacturing crackers illegally. The charred bodies were identified as those of Hameedha, 55, and Kartheeswari, 33. Though it was suspected that owner Ramanathan and his wife Panchavarnam were also trapped under the building, no other bodies were found. The two-storeyed building had completely collapsed under the impact of the blast on Monday. Two people who sustained 60% and 30% burn injuries respectively were rushed to the Sivakasi government hospital.Official sources said fire and rescue services personnel from Sivakasi were carrying out the work of removing debris to ascertain if any others are trapped. Since chemicals required for cracker manufacture were stored inside the building, officials stopped the work. Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy inspected the spot and monitored the rescue operation. A fire and rescue services official said the presence of chemicals inside the building posed a great challenge to carry out the work of removing the debris. “We had to take a lot of precautions since there was a possibility of fire breaking out since chemicals were stored in the building. There was also apprehension on spraying water as fire would break out due to chemical reaction,” explained the official. Police sources said investigations revealed that unit owner Ramanathan and his wife Panchavarnam had left before the incident. No other bodies were recovered from the spot. Sivakasi Town police have registered a case against the couple under sections of IPC and Explosives Act and are on the lookout for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-womens-bodies-found-at-sivakasi-explosion-site/articleshow/87745245.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2-6 year olds join Covovax trials, SII plans vaccine for kids by Apr||Covishield maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has scaled up the paediatric trial of Covovax by including children in the two to six years age bracket across 10 sites in India, including Pune. The vaccine maker started off Covovax trials among children in August this year. Initially, the trial enrolled adolescents between 12 and 17 years and was later expanded by enrolling children in the 7-11 age group. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax will have a total of 920 children — 460 in the 12 to 17 years category, 230 in the 7-11 age group and another 230 in 2-6 age group. “As per the trial design, we have been expanding the trial after ensuring vaccine safety among 100 children from each group in reverse order of age. We first did that among adolescents and then included children in the 7-11 age group. Now, we have started enrolling children in the 2-6 age group after seeking due regulatory permissions,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India this year and for children by April 2022. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculating with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “We enrolled the first child in the 2-6 age group in Pune on November 11. We intend to enrol 25-30 kids in this (2-6 years) age cohort.” Earlier, Bharati Hospital had enrolled 35 children in the adolescent age group and 21 children in the 7-11 age bracket for the Covovax trial. “The enrollment in the adolescent age group is now over,” Lalwani said. KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial.” SII would submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licensure. According to the latest guidelines of the DCGI, the company can apply for a licence for the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results. The child cohort comprises about 13 to 14 crore population. India would need about 25-26 crore doses for them, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-6-year-olds-join-covovax-trials-sii-plans-vaccine-for-kids-by-apr/articleshow/87747169.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Delhi||Delhi govt to hire 1,000 buses for a month to cut pvt vehicle load||NEW DELHI: With public transport a crucial component of the fight against air pollution, Delhi government will hire around 1,000 private buses to augment the current fleet. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the state government had also proposed to Delhi Disaster Management Authority that standing passengers should now be allowed in buses and Delhi Metro. Vehicles are among the biggest contributors to particulate pollution in Delhi and a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment showed traffic congestion was back to pre-pandemic levels at a time when the air quality had degraded. Gahlot requested Delhiites on Tuesday to shift from personal vehicles to public transport to curb vehicular emissions. “To augment public transport, Delhi government is in the process of hiring around 1,000 private buses for a period of one month,” he added. Gahlot told TOI, “This is being done as an emergency measure. During the operation of the odd-even scheme in previous years, only around 650 buses could be arranged, but the government will strive to engage 1,000 buses.” During the road rationing exercise since 2016, the government has been engaging private buses to augment the existing public transport. “Owing to the improved Covid situation and to control pollution from private vehicles, we have also proposed to DDMA that standing passengers in buses and Delhi Metro should be allowed and the current prohibition lifted,” Gahlot disclosed. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that his department held a meeting with associations of tourist transporters, contract carriage and school bus owners to work out modalities. “Delhi Transport Corporation is working out the details because the buses will have DTC signage and its conductors to guide the drivers,” said Kundra. Kundra said that there are no large private bus fleets in the city, with most operators having 50 to 100 buses. But overall, these will add up to have around 1,000 buses that will augment DTC and Cluster Scheme buses. He said that the transport department and DTC would be flexible with arrangements, such as allowing school buses to be deployed only after school hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-hire-1000-buses-for-a-month-to-cut-pvt-vehicle-load/articleshow/87745987.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The SIT had written a letter to the state government to extend the tenure. The SIT has now been given time to complete the investigation and make arrests by May 2022. The investigation of the cases is almost over. After the paperwork, only the arrest of the accused is now pending. In the anti-Sikh riots, 127 people were killed in Kanpur in the aftermath of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination on November 1, 1984.After the filing of the report, action could not be taken due to lack of evidence and witnesses. The tenure of the SIT was ending on November 27, 2021, so the SIT chief had sent a letter to the state government seeking extension of time. On Monday, the state government extended the tenure of the SIT till May 27, 2022. The SIT has identified more than 80 accused. On verification it was found that only 66 accused are alive. SIT SP Balendu Bhushan Singh said, “The testimony of one or two is pending. Other operations have been completed. The accused will be arrested soon after completing the paperwork. About a dozen rioters who were involved in several murders.” The state government had set up SIT on February 5, 2019, to inquire into the circumstances leading to the deadly riots. The team was set up after the apex court issued notice to the state government in August 2017 on a petition seeking SIT probe into the riots. The four-member SIT is headed by retired UP DGP Atul.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Teen 'gang-raped' and killed at wedding hall in Meerut||MEERUT: A UP police constable's role is being probed in the alleged gangrape and murder of an 18-year-old girl who was found dead, without her clothes on, during the wedding ceremony of an uncle she was attending on Monday night. The girl's family started looking for her when she went missing from the venue in Meerut even as the rituals were on. They later saw her lying unconscious and half-naked in the washroom inside the banquet hall. A police constable, drunk, was found in a room next to the toilet where the girl's body was found. While the family maintained that the girl was raped and that the constable is involved in the crime, police filed an FIR only for murder against "unknown persons." A post-mortem report is pending. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, said, “We are investigating how the constable reached the spot and other aspects of the case in a separate inquiry.” He added that the girl’s family has not alleged rape in their complaint, which is why an FIR for murder has been filed. “We are awaiting the post-mortem report. Further additions in the FIR will be made based on the findings of the autopsy,” he said. An uncle of the girl said that the girl was accompanied by her mother and two brothers at the wedding. "When the family asked the banquet hall manager to open a room that was locked from outside, he refused. Relatives then broke the lock and found the girl lying inside the washroom in a terrible state. A man was sleeping on a bed in a room right next to the toilet. He was later identified as a police constable,” he said. Kin of the girl also alleged that the manager of the banquet hall refused to show them CCTV footage of the premises, saying that the camera was not working.They also suspect the involvement of another man who is a staffer at the banquet hall.

The toddler was abducted so that she could be made to beg. On November 13, a man named Suraj Khiradkar was questioned by the shopkeepers when they saw him beating the girl on the beach. The shopkeepers tried to intervene, but the man told them that he is her father and asked them to leave. The shopkeepers, however, were not convinced so they informed cops at Prabhas Patan police station. Police picked up Khiradkar for questioning and admitted the girl to the hospital as she was injured. Khiradkar gave the cops their identity and said that he hails from Amravati in Maharashtra and the girl was his daughter. As police found Khiradkar’s responses suspicious, they contacted his parents back in Amravati. Cops asked Khiradkar’s parents about their granddaughter, but they said that they did not have any granddaughter as Khiradkar was not married. When Khiradkar realized that he had been exposed, he admitted on Tuesday that he had kidnapped the girl from Nagpur railway station on October 22 to use her to seek alms. Police then contacted their counterparts in Nagpur to inquire if they had received any complaint regarding a missing girl. It then came to light that the girl’s mother had approached the police after the toddler went missing. The girl’s mother had come to Nagpur at her parents’ home from Allahabad along with her. Nagpur police and the girl’s family members were asked to reach Somnath to take the custody of the toddler and also Khiradkar. “The accused will be handed over to Nagpur police as the crime took place there and all legal proceedings will also be done there,” said inspector N M Ahir of Prabhas Patan police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nagpur-toddler-abducted-for-begging-rescued-in-somnath/articleshow/87745266.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi police oppose Ansals’ plea, say need to restore faith in justice delivery system||NEW DELHI: The police told a Delhi court on Tuesday that the offences proved against the real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal were of the “gravest of its kind” and had ultimately “shattered the faith” of the common man in the justice delivery system. The submissions were made during the hearing of appeals filed by the Ansal brothers against an order under which they were convicted and sentenced to seven-year jail for tampering with evidence in the Uphaar fire tragedy. Additional public prosecutor A T Ansari, appearing for the police, submitted that the peculiar facts and circumstance of the present case undoubtedly made it an exceptional case where the court should not lean to exercise its judicious discretion in the favour of the convicts. “By tampering with crucial evidence forming part of judicial records, convicts sought to hamper and scuttle the process of law. They have not only polluted the stream of justice but have also potentially undermined the majesty of 'rule of law’,” Ansari told additional sessions judge Anil Antil.  “It would not be an exaggeration to submit that it is a targeted assault by the convicts on the institutional integrity of Delhi judiciary. The possibility of reform cannot be expected from the convicts, namely Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal. They are previous convicts,” he added.  Ansari argued that this case has led to a formation of a perception that rich, mighty and influential people could do anything and get away with it and that they could even manipulate the judicial system in their favour.  “No court of law can afford to turn a blind eye to the commission of such a serious offence. In this case, even the aspect of prolonged trial cannot be a factor to be considered for suspension of the sentence awarded against the convicts as it was the Association of the Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT), which approached the Delhi High Court for expediting the trial,” he said.  He further said the Ansals tried to protract the trial in the main Uphaar case by one or other way and, when they failed to do so they hatched the conspiracy in question along with convicts, D C Sharma, PP Batra and Anoop Singh to get the crucial and material documents having potential to establish their involvement in the main matter tampered with.  He added that the age of any convict may be a relevant factor but it could not be a determinative factor by itself in the consideration of suspension of sentence and grant of bail  “When a person can commit crime in his old age, how can he seek the benefit of the same old age at a later point of time? It was by virtue of their age, the convicts gained sufficient knowledge to meticulously plan and hatch a conspiracy with nefarious design to get the document in question tampered with to scuttle the process of law and secure their acquittal in that case,” he submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-oppose-ansals-plea-say-need-to-restore-faith-in-justice-delivery-system/articleshow/87746004.cms||Usha Das

At a press conference in Nalgonda on Tuesday, Sanjay said: “We were only visiting the farmers and not involved in any protests. Why are police targeting BJP leaders and activists while letting off TRS activists even when they were attacking us.” Expressing displeasure over the spate of attacks on Monday, he said the TRS government was trying to instil fear among farmers over procurement of paddy. “There was an agreement between the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the state government that 60 lakh tonnes of paddy would be procured. What is preventing the state government from procuring the paddy,” he sought to know. Meanwhile, a BJP team met governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and lodged a complaint against the TRS government on the attacks in Nalgonda district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-blames-t-govt-for-attack-on-his-convoy/articleshow/87745985.cms||---

According to my knowledge, work is being done to resolve this issue." He added, "There are many places where terrorism is being spread, I am not saying all madrasas are involved in it, but many are providing education on terrorism and they work to defame education organisations." The MLA representing UP's Sardhana constituency also showcased support for a recent statement made by Wasim Rizvi, former chairman of the Shia Waqf Board, who had said, "Sanatan dharma is the biggest in the world." Som welcomed Rizwi's decision of wanting to be cremated according to the Hindu religion after his death. Som made these statements during an interaction with media in Muzaffarnagar, where he had arrived to appear before the MP/MLA court for a 2009 case registered against him for "breach of peace." According to the prosecution, police had registered a case against Som and three private guards for blocking roads in the Civil Line area while protesting against the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh during the BSP rule in 2009. However, charges could not be framed against him as his two co-accused, Virender Singh and Jaipal Singh, were not present in the court. Special judge Gopal Upadhyay has fixed November 26 as the next date of hearing in the case.

The prevention of crime branch (PCB) busted the racket late on Monday night and arrested 24-year-old Mohsina Munshi from a commercial complex on Old Padra Road. The accused revealed that her parents and brother too were involved in the drug selling racket. While brother Shaqib Munshi has been arrested, their parents are on the run. “We had received a tip-off following which we nabbed Mohsina and her 21-year-old brother Shaqib and also seized some amount of marijuana from the complex. The duo revealed that they have been selling drugs for over a year as both have good network among the youngsters,” said Jatin Patel, police inspector, PCB. Mohsina said that she came in contact with a man identified as Dilip when she was studying in Vidyanagar. Dilip told her that he buys drugs in large quantities from Madhya Pradesh and sells them in Gujarat. “Mohsina told her mother Zarina Munshi about it and they decided to become drug suppliers to earn some quick money. They also involved Abdullah Patel, Mohsina’s stepfather, in the trade,” Patel told TOI. Both Mohsina and Shaqib began selling marijuana and charas among their contacts that included youngsters from decent and upper-middle class families too. As the business grew, Abdullah and Zarina began making trips to Anand to get supply of drugs. Zarina used to manage the drug stock at home, while Mohsina and Shaqib sold it. The PCB also arrested two addicts — Meet Thakkar and Nupur Sehgal — who work for a multi-national company (MNC) in Gotri and were regular customers of Mohsina. They would buy drugs from her and sell it further among their friends. “We raided Mohsina’s house in Tandalja and seized about 560gm marijuana and 10gm charas,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/family-of-four-booked-for-selling-drugs-to-youngsters/articleshow/87744990.cms||---

The proposal is in lines with the Centre’s vision to have one college in every district of the country over the next five years. The state government is also planning to set up eight new medical colleges in the state in the next two years. They will add 1,200 MBBS seats, representing about 21% of the total number of prevailing seats in Gujarat, said sources in the state’ health department. The new medical colleges in Morbi, Godhra and Porbander are expected to start in the 2021-22 academic year. The inspection process by National Medical Commission (NMC) has been completed.

---||Nagpur||Depleting Gorewada water level affects arrival of migratory birds||Nagpur: Once a hotspot for migratory birds, the depleting water level at Gorewada Lake has affected the arrival of the winged guests from abroad. Bird watchers expressed concern over the non-arrival of migratory birds like the red-crested pochards, gadwalls, garganey, northern pintails and other waders that migrate from Europe and Siberia and South East Asia. They were seen in sizeable numbers at Gorewada even last year. Bird expert Nitin Marathe attributed the non-presence of migratory ducks to the depleting water level at Gorewada. “Diving ducks are agile swimmers. They dive far beneath the surface of the water in search of food, including fish, insects and aquatic plants,” he said. “These ducks need 15-20 feet water and prefer to stay in the water and can be ungainly and awkward on land. They have to build up speed to take off from the water’s surface,” said Marathe. A regular visitor to Gorewada, K Murli Manohar Naidu said, “Barring a few migratory gadwalls, local residents like whistling and spot-billed ducks, little grebes, jacanas, koots and purple morons are being regularly sighted. The gadwalls were recorded on October 21 after which the birds vanished but have arrived again .” However, Naidu said migratory ducks from abroad are missing this time. These birds need deep water and hence, are avoiding the lake. “Despite good rainfall this year, I’m surprised why the lake water level has decreased. The water has reached a level which normally happens during the summer season,” he stated. NMC officials admitted that the Gorewada water level has gone down to 314.30 metres. Normally, the water level is 314 metres and during the monsoon, it is 315 metres. The lake receives water from Navegaon Khairy (Pench) and it is supplied to treatment plants at Pench I, II, & III pumping stations. “Water continues to flow in and released out. In the next two days, the water level is expected to be at the normal level,” they said. However, a birder and assistant manager with FDCM Kalpana Chinchkhede says, “It is possible that the birds may arrive a little late as severe winter must have not set in the areas from where these birds migrate. The climate change effect cannot be ruled out as there are fluctuations in the temperature even in the city. Graylag geese and brahminy ducks were also sighted at the lake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/depleting-gorewada-water-level-affects-arrival-of-migratory-birds/articleshow/87746012.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Meerut||Four primary schools in UP to be illuminated with solar energy||Bijnor: Four government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh's Bijnor district are set to be illuminated with solar panels soon. The schools were unable to get electricity before as they are situated near the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, through which power lines cannot be drawn. The schools are situated in four villages. Two of these villages, with one school each, are Rampur Chata in Najibabad and Telipara in the Kotwali Dehat block. Both villages are located near the UP-Uttarakhand border. The UP government provided individual homes here with solar packs in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The other two are Rampur Thakra, which falls in the Haldar block around 15 kilometers from Bijnor, and Ram Sahaywal village, located near the Muzaffarnagar-Haridwar border. Rampur Thakra, in which the third school is located, is on forest land. The village previously had electricity but the same was cut off after the Allahabad high court in 2019 said that relocation of residents was necessary as power lines could not be laid through the forest. Ram Sahaywal village, which has the fourth school, has also been provided with solar packs as the presence of the Ganga river makes it impossible to lay power lines. District coordinator of basic education, Salim Beg, said, "All four villages were provided solar power packs by the government. However, our schools still remained without solar energy. We have prepared a proposal to illuminate four primary schools. I hope solar panels will be set up here by next year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/four-primary-schools-in-up-to-be-illuminated-with-solar-energy/articleshow/87744367.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Delhi: Without proper headgear, kids in harm’s way on roads||NEW DELHI: Three years ago, Lucky, then 12 years old, and his older brother, then 18, were going to their south Delhi school for a cricket match. At a traffic junction, when the light turned green, they rode ahead only to hit by a milk van speeding to beat the lights from another direction. Lucky (name changed) was knocked unconscious while his brother suffered knee and hand injuries. “My older son had a driving licence and a helmet on, but Lucky wasn’t protected,” said Vipin, their father, a Kalkaji resident. Lucky did not regain consciousness for two days. He underwent surgery and was in hospital for five days. Three years later, Lucky still has seizures. “The doctors had cautioned us that the contusions could continue to affect him,” Vipin said. “A month after returning from hospital, he had his first seizure. It happened again four months later. Now he suffers such seizures at least twice a year. Because we don’t know when he will have these attacks, we don’t allow Lucky to do things such as cycling, swimming or sitting on the front seat of the car.” The long-suffering father has a message for two-wheeler riders, especially children: “Please make sure the pillion rider, irrespective of religion or community, wears a helmet, one that is certified as meeting quality standards.” Every year thousands of children across India die in two-wheeler mishaps, mostly because their heads are unprotected. According to data provided by Delhi Traffic Police, the number of children’s deaths on two-wheelers till October 31 has risen from 11 last year (15 in the full year) to 17 in 2021. The figure for the injured has also gone up from 46 in 2020 to 60 this year. This, despite the amendment in the Road Safety Act in 2019 making it mandatory for children aged four years and above to wear a helmet while on two-wheelers. Over 70% of Indians ride on two-wheelers. The National Crime Records Bureau data shows that last year, 121 children below the age of 14 and 145 aged 14-18 died in road accidents. This year in Delhi, up to October 31, two-wheelers were involved in 1,560 accidents, 373 of them with fatalities. Last year, in the same period, there were 1,439 accidents in the city involving two-wheelers, 355 of which recorded loss of lives. In Delhi, 28.9 lakh notices have been issued to two-wheelers for speeding this year against 82.3 lakh last year. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, neuro and spine surgeon and medical director of Indian Head Injury Foundation (IHIF), cited a Union road ministry report putting the number of children who lost their lives in road accidents across the country in 2019 at 11,168. “The unofficial estimates are much higher,” revealed Prasad. “The children frequently sustain severe disabilities after accident due to untrained first responders, poor pre-hospital care and lack of neuro rehabilitation facilities. The chances of survival automatically improve if they wear good headgear while riding two-wheelers.” IHIF, which helps road accident victims and also rehabilitates them, said in most accidents involving children, they were found not wearing helmets. “Frequently, a child sitting on the pillion dozes off and falls down. There have been numerous cases in which children with head injuries have had to stay in hospital for many months,” said Prasad. “There needs to be some method of checking children are protected. For example, schools shouldn’t allow children to enter if they ride in without helmets.” Rohit Baluja, president, Institute of Road Traffic Education, and observer for India at the Global Forum on Road Safety Collaboration, United Nations, noted, “No company in India makes helmets for children complying with BIS norms. At best, there are the helmets used by cricketers and construction workers, which guarantee no safety in road accidents.” Baluja also pointed out loopholes in the prevailing law. “By amending the law to make it possible for a four-year-old to ride pillion, we wrongly promoted children riding on a two-wheeler. But the law doesn’t explain how a child should be secured on a two-wheeler,” said Baluja. “In Europe, if your feet don’t touch the footboard, you aren’t allowed to ride a two-wheeler. In other countries, say Vietnam, the two-wheeler traffic is segregated from the other vehicles. In India, both heavy vehicles and two-wheelers are supposed to drive on the left-most lane.” Traffic officers that TOI spoke to accepted that the unavailability of headgear for children was a drawback. “Elders should try to secure the child firmly while riding two-wheelers,” said Manish Aggarwal, joint CP (Traffic). “We also hope manufacturers come up with children’s helmets that meet the safety norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/without-proper-headgear-kids-in-harms-way-on-roads/articleshow/87746015.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two held for involvement in over 50 snatching cases||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested two men for their alleged involvement in more than 50 cases of snatching and robberies. They were arrested after a brief exchange of fire in the early hours. The men have been identified as Manish Poddar (25) and Nirala alias Mohd Nizamuddin (24), both residents of JJ Colony in Bawana. Police have found that Poddar was involved in at least 37 criminal cases and Nizamuddin in 19 cases. A pistol with which the accused threatened their targets, two used .32 cartridges, and a KTM Duke 200 bike used in crimes in the recent past have been seized. The KN Katju Marg police station received a tip off that two active snatchers, with a loaded pistol, would reach Rohini to target people on Monday. “Accordingly, a trap was laid and, around 1am on Tuesday, they were spotted. As soon as they were directed to surrender to police, the accused tried to run away. The rider of the bike hit constable Rakesh and the pillion-rider fired two rounds at the police team,” said deputy commission of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal. In retaliation, the police team also opened fire and the pillion-rider sustained an injury on the right leg. “Both of them were overpowered. During their search, one .32 pistol and two used cartridges were recovered. Poddar, who was riding pillion, was taken to BSA Hospital for treatment. Both have been booked for attempt to murder among other sections,” the officer said. The accused later disclosed their involvement in various crimes, police claimed. The cops are trying to find out if they were involved in more cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-involvement-in-over-50-snatching-cases/articleshow/87746018.cms||---
---||Meerut||Biscuits being distributed as mid-day meals in Meerut school||MEERUT: A team of education department officials performed random checks in the city's schools and found that one, Jai Kishan Inter College, was only distributing biscuits to children under the mid-day meal scheme. Another, the Composite and Primary School in Putthi, was not providing "adequate" meals according to the mid-day meal menu as the gram pradhan had allegedly hoarded ration inside his house. The department said that during the raid, school authorities at Jai Kishan Inter College told the team that this was being done since students had "less attendance". However, the principal of Jai Kishan Inter College, Indresh Kumar, later told TOI, "There was proper food in the school. I will complain about this matter to senior authorities." Virendra Kumar, the divisional coordinator of Meerut, said, “A team comprising deputy inspector (Urdu), Amarveer Singh, visited several government schools on Tuesday. These were Composite and Primary School, Putthi, Primary School No 2, Jai Kishan Inter College, and Primary School in Lodipura and Khatki. At Jai Kishan Inter College, the students never got proper food after they returned to school after the second lockdown. They told us that they are being given Parle biscuits instead of proper meals." Kumar added that prima facie, it looked like Jai Kishan's principal and an NGO have distributed the money meant for mid-day meals among themselves. He said that the NGO and principal also did not deposit convenience money into the bank accounts of the students. The principal refuted the allegations and said that the education department's team demanded "certain things" from the school that they didn’t do, which is why they made "baseless" allegations. "We have given the money to students as and when it was due," he said. Meanwhile, those at the Composite and Primary School in Putthi were supposed to receive raw material for meals from the gram pradhan. Virendra Kumar said that the pradhan kept the ration in his own house, thereby depriving children of proper meals. He said the cook at the school also corroborated this. The gram pradhan, Sonu, said that he has kept the ration at his home because the door of the school is broken and anyone can enter the premises and steal it. “It's wrong if they say I don’t give the ration when asked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/biscuits-being-distributed-as-mid-day-meals-in-meerut-school/articleshow/87744375.cms||Ishita Mishra

The recruitment was on hold for several months and many aspirants had been waiting for government orders. A statement issued by the state education department said that a committee appointed to study the vacant posts had suggested filling up 4,737 posts, of which 1,697 posts were filled two years ago. The payment for recruited candidates will start from the 2022-23 academic year, an education department notification issued on Monday stated. Dattatraya Kahar, state department of higher and technical education department official, said, “Teachers who were considered ‘extra’ will be accommodated in these vacant posts on priority. There are no additional posts of assistant teachers. Hence, the joint directorates in the state can immediately issue an advertisement for recruitment in their respective divisions.” The selected candidates will be appointed for 2022-23 academic year. The joint director must mention this in their recruitment advertisement as well, he said. Kahar said that the unaided non-agricultural universities also have vacancies for teaching and non-teaching staff. However, the vacant posts and their structure have still not been decided by the designated committee due to some technical issues. It will be resolved soon.” The distribution of vacant posts has been done by the education department considering affiliation of the institute with the universities and accreditation and reaccreditation limits. The joint directorates have been informed by the education department to strictly follow the university rules and regulations during recruitment. The colleges will have to submit the monthly report on the recruitment process and thereafter to the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-recruitment-in-aided-colleges-gets-go-ahead/articleshow/87745270.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Another shooter, Raju Singh, was earlier arrested on October 4 after a brief encounter with police. The professor’s husband, Kamal Sharma, and four of his relatives -- including his father, mother and brother -- are on the run. Police had earlier claimed that Kamal had paid advance money of Rs 5.5 lakh to contract killers. According to Bijnor superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh, acting on a tip-off about the presence of the killers in the district, police sealed the district borders. During vehicle checking on Jhalu road, police spotted the three men on a bike coming towards Bijnor city and signaled the riders to stop but they tried flee and also fired at the police personnel. The cops managed to arrest the three, identified as Vikrant, Ankur and Kapil Kumar – all from Moradabad. The SP said, "The arrested persons confessed to their crime. They told police that Kamal Sharma had given the contract to eliminate his wife Priya, her sister-in-law and her husband in lieu of Rs 12 lakh. Kamal had made Rs 5.5 lakh advance payment, and the rest was to be given after the three were killed. After killing Priya, the killers were camping in Bijnor and looking for an opportunity to kill her sister and brother-in-law." “So far, nine accused have been booked in the case. Four accused have been arrested. A reward of Rs 25,000 for information on each of the remaining five accused was announced earlier," the SP added. Priya, professor of English literature, was gunned down in posh Saket area on October 29 while she was on her way to college. She was a resident of Surendra Nagar, under the jurisdiction of Bijnor city police station. Locals said they were inside their houses when they heard a gunshot and rushed out to find a woman lying in a pool of blood. Some of them spotted two bike-borne assailants speeding away. The bullet hit Priya's temple, killing her on the spot. The motive behind the crime, according to police, was marital dispute between the husband and wife. She had moved to her maternal house and was staying with her parents, who claimed that her husband had allegedly attacked her earlier as well. Priya had filed a dowry case against her husband and in-laws a day before her murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-more-contract-killers-held-in-bijnor-lecturers-murder-case/articleshow/87744385.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Nashik||Dist development council approves outlay of Rs 861cr for Nashik this fiscal||Nashik: The district planning and development council (DPDC) on Friday approved an outlay of Rs 860.9 crore for the Nashik district for the ongoing fiscal — about Rs 36 crore higher than the previous financial year. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal chaired Tuesday’s DPDC meeting, which was attended by the elected representatives and district officials. Bhujbal told reporters that the infrastructure in Nashik would be one of major focus areas this fiscal. “Till October-end, the state government released only 10% of the outlay due to Covid-19. That is why we could spend less than 10% of the total outlay by last month,” Bhujbal said, adding, “But now the government has started releasing funds. We have received 90% of the funds in the past few days and plan to spend all the funds under DPDC by March 2022.” In the past financial year, DPDC had approved Rs 824.14 crore, and 96% of the outlay was spent by the various departments. The remainder could not be spent due to the Covid pandemic. Of Rs 860.9 crore this time, Rs 470 crore outlay is for general schemes, while Rs 290.9 crore is planned for tribal development schemes. The remainder would be spent on schemes for the Scheduled Castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-development-council-approves-outlay-of-rs-861cr-for-nashik-this-fiscal/articleshow/87743646.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||Doc writes to ECI to provide vote verification facility to blind||Nagpur: A Mumbai doctor has drawn the attention of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to blind voters’ right to exercise their franchise in an autonomous and independent manner. In a letter to the ECI, Dr Akshay Bajad proposed ‘image-text to speech’(ITTS) conversion system be introduced in electronic voting machines (EVMs) that will enable blind voters to verify their vote. ITTS is a simple, inexpensive and proven technology that provides reasonable accommodation to visually challenged, in the process bringing them at par with other voters, he said. Dr Bajad has also forwarded the same e-mail to the ministry of law and justice and chief commissioner for persons with disabilities four months ago. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and National Association for the Blind (NAB) have appreciated his initiative and forwarded the suggestions to the ECI. However, the ECI is yet to respond. Quoting 2011 Census, the 31-year-old doctor said there are about 2.68 crore disabled persons in India, of which about 50 lakh are blind. “Such voters have to cast their vote only with the assistance of a companion. An assisted vote, while not a secret and independent, still allows such voters to participate in the electoral process. However, in the present system of voting through EVMs, there is no way of knowing if the assisting person has indeed cast his/her vote for the candidate picked by the voter with disability in seeing,” said Dr Bajad. He said for the convenience of such voters, there is Braille signage on the EVM unit. On its right side along the candidates’ vote button, digits 1 to 16 are embossed in Braille for their guidance. “However, though a blind voter can press a button, he or she cannot ascertain the actual voting. The voter is not sure whether the vote is recorded or not, and whether it is in favour of the candidate to whom it was intended to. Moreover, not every person with such a disability understands Braille,” he said. Explaining ITTS, the ayurvedic doctor said the basic idea behind the proposed stand-alone real-time system was to capture the image of the paper slip generated by the printer in VVPAT, extract text from it and convert it into speech that can be listened to through headphones. “ITTS device shall be fixed inside the VVPAT machine in such a way that voters’ view through the transparent window of the machine remains unobstructed and the printed paper slips displayed for seven seconds come within the field of view of its camera lens. Externally, it requires a set of headphones with volume control so that blind voter can listen to his choice of vote,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doc-writes-to-eci-to-provide-vote-verification-facility-to-blind/articleshow/87746023.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Gahlot visited the rain-affected Mundhela and Malikpur villages and was informed that due to the low embankment, the Najafgarh drain overflows and enters nearby fields, affecting crops. Farmers told him that they had not been able to sow crops due to the waterlogging. The minister instructed the officers to complete the survey in a time-bound manner. In Malikpur, the village pond has overflown, submerging nearby fields. Officials will explore the possibility of raising a protection wall around it. To provide immediate relief, pumps have been installed in these villages. Gahlot also ordered the revenue department to prepare an estimate to build a proper embankment. “As per the orders of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the revenue department is conducting a survey in different rain-affected villages. About 80% of our survey has been completed,” he said.

Local residents said that three wild elephants were standing guard to the body on Monday night and were seen pushing it and giving signals to get up. The elephants were found very close to the human settlements, creating fear among the local residents. Forest department officials have cautioned the residents that the wild elephants may return to the spot where the body of the baby elephant was found. Meanwhile, the authorities are now trying to see that the three wild elephants are moved into the forests so that the autopsy procedures of the dead elephant could be undertaken.

In his place in the Rajya Sabha, the TRS may give an opportunity to KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha whose term as an MLC would expire in January 2022. On the last day of nominations to fill six vacancies under the MLA quota on Tuesday, the TRS named its six candidates. Apart from Prakash, names of former legislative council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, party leader from Huzurabad Padi Kaushik Reddy, senior leader T Ravinder Rao and former Siddipet district collector P Venkatrama Reddy were announced. The party leadership is believed to have considered Nalgonda leader MC Koti Reddy, former SC Commission chairman Erolla Srinivas and sitting MLC Akula Lalitha along with others. In the end, Prakash clinched the issue in his favour while others whose names were doing the rounds since Monday made it to the list. Venkatrami Reddy, who took voluntary retirement on Monday, was initially considered as an MLC nominee from Medak local authority constituency for which elections will be held on December 10. However, the party had decided to send the former IAS officer under the MLA quota. Party sources said Prakash, who belongs to Mudiraj community, got the green signal as he may be inducted into the state cabinet in the next reshuffle. Prakash hails from the same community to which former minister and Huzurabad BJP MLA Eatala Rajender belongs and his likely induction in the cabinet is being seen as a move to keep the Mudiraj community happy. Speculation is also rife that former assembly speaker S Madhusudhana Chary could be sent to the upper house in place of Prakash and that he will be nominated to the legislative council under governor’s quota in place of Kaushik whose nomination has not been cleared by the governor till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/surprise-as-kcr-names-banda-for-mlc-seat/articleshow/87746027.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Pune||Engineering admissions: Last 2 yrs’ cut-off marks now available||PUNE: The State Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell has uploaded the category-wise cut-off marks for the last two academic years, which should be checked before filling up the online admission forms for the engineering course’s first year, engineering college teachers have told candidates who are in the process of filling up the said forms. The last date to fill up the forms and upload the documents online is November 18, after which the first merit list will be published by the cell on November 27. An engineering college professor, on the condition of anonymity, said that many private colleges are under a lot of pressure financially and many professors have not been paid their full salaries in the past two years. “This automatically causes a lot of issues. Some colleges have also asked senior faculty members to leave if they want, because they can then employ recently passed out postgraduates who can be paid less for the same work. In the end, placements are the biggest deciding factor for the students. So, my advice is to check placement data before zeroing in on a college,” the professor said. A candidate who is filling up his admission forms, however, complained that many colleges are not putting up their complete data online. “It is not possible to visit all colleges. We mostly rely on their websites, but many colleges just give names of companies who hire from them, without details — like when did they hire, which department did they hire from, how many were hired, what was the average salary, and more. There is also not much information on faculty. Hence, choosing a college, especially if one has got fewer marks in the CET, is very hard. Except names of renowned colleges, nobody knows the status of the remaining ones — which is where maximum students end up,” he said. On December 6, all colleges will commence their academic activities, while the cut-off date for all admissions for the academic year 2021-22 will be December 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engg-admissions-last-2-yrs-cut-off-marks-now-available/articleshow/87745289.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Voice-to-text tools help med professionals save time||Pune: Paperwork and documentation, though tedious and time consuming, is as important a part of a medical professional’s work as diagnosing and treatment. Many are now using AI-based voice-to-text tools to document their work more efficiently and save time. Aditya Shetty, radiologist, said, “A voice-to-text app can precisely follow the flow of my thoughts in the form of commands, helping me generate and finalise reports in minutes without relying on a transcriptionist or assistant. This experience is further supplemented with the introduction of mobile mic app, thus creating a more convenient hands-free capability to dictate reports through my earphones while I remain focussed on viewing and reporting the scans.” “The desktop app in conjunction with the mobile mic app is a ground-breaking experience in the work environment, which has revamped and revolutionised the way we approach the process of generating a report at a remarkable turnaround time,” he added. These apps also help with hospital administrative work. Rahil Shah, director of NM Medical, said, “Text-to-voice apps have transformed the efficiency of our documentation process.” While there are a couple of voice-to-text apps for different purposes and professions, one used for medical purpose needs to be verified and trustworthy with no room for technical errors. An issue with such apps can be accent recognition and vocabulary of technical medical terminology. Anand Patil, general manager, information technology, Ruby Hall, said, “We are seeing substantial benefits in efficiency with this software.” Using a voice-to-text tool that is developed in India decreases the chances of misinterpreting one’s native accent or MTI, and is more conducive to local work environment, said tech-savvy medical professionals who rely on such apps to get through work more efficiently on a daily basis. Rustom Lawyer, co-founder and CEO, Augnito, currently the only Indian voice-to-text app built for local medical professionals, said, “We aim to transform our two decades of clinical documentation knowledge and expertise in quality systems, security, and the criticality of turnaround times in hospital environment, and package this into a powerful AI, which is easily accessible to every doctor in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/voice-to-text-tools-help-med-professionals-save-time/articleshow/87745302.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Delhi||Once burnt, forever shy: Theatres do their bit to avoid Uphaar Part II||NEW DELHI: Friday the 13th proved proverbially sinister in June 1997. In one of the worst fire catastrophes in the country that day, 59 people lost their lives and 109 suffered serious injuries in a fire in Uphaar cinema hall in Green Park. The only silver lining in the tragedy was it taught theatre operators and the authorities to ensure strict guidelines to make movie viewing safer for people. Amit Sharma, MD of Miraj Cinemas, which owns over 150 screens across India and 10 in the National Capital Region, claimed that now the theatres strictly comply with the national building code guidelines for theatres, including designing the seating in such a way that the exit gates aren’t more than seven seats away from any viewer. “We use fire-resistant fabrics and materials for seats, carpets, curtains and wall panels,” Sharma said, explaining that while accidents couldn’t be avoided, most establishments have staff who are now equipped and trained to face threatening situations. Fire and a combination of heat and smoke detection are key. "If detected, our staff is trained to evacuate the hall and extinguish the fire,” Sharma added. “The staff undertake regular training on dousing fires caused by electric equipment or by wood burning. They are also trained to handle injured people and evacuate them to safety.” At the malls too, nothing has been left to chance, attested Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Malls. His staff, Bansal claimed, underwent regular drills conducted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority and Delhi Fire Service (DFS). The building bylaws too have changed for the better since Uphaar, defining the number of staircases required and their width to facilitate smooth evacuation of the people. Bansal points out that the size of the halls has changed to seat around 250 people rather than the 500-1,000 they did then. Rajeev Patni, chief operating officer, INOX Leisure Ltd, claimed to have put in place pre-emptive measures to reduce the probability of disasters — from using fire-retardant seating and wall fabric to using beam detectors and smoke and heat detectors in auditoriums and in the lobby and concessionaire counters. "We also have installed smoke extraction fans in all the auditoriums and have emergency power backup to light up the exit signage," said Patni. Inox also keeps ready safety gear and emergency response kits, comprising masks, oxygen cylinders, searchlights and first aid boxes. Maintenance of safety equipment has become a must. “Merely investing money on safety is not enough,” said Sharma. “We also have to see that sprinklers are kept fully functional and the detectors work efficiently.” A manager at a multiplex, however, felt that many establishments, especially the single-screen theatres, needed an infrastructure upgrade because their entries and exit were still cramped and there was a laxity about fire safety norms. Fire officers agree that safety in cinema halls and multiplexes has improved since Uphaar. Sanjay Tomar, deputy fire officer, DFS, cited the court order requiring the quarterly inspection of all cinema halls by a joint team of DFS, the electricity and licensing departments and the land-owning authority. “The advantage of this system is that if there are shortcomings, they are highlighted by the various agencies and change and amendments can be made expeditiously,” said Tomar. Atul Garg, DFS director, confirmed, “Nowadays we inspect cinema halls once every six months.” He also disclosed that around 60 theatres operated in Delhi with a valid fire NOC. Tomar noted that in a multiplex, a licence to operate is not issued until the fire department certifies the entire mall or high-rise complex as fire safe. Earlier, the theatre doors were bolted from inside, but these days not only do they remain unlocked but are also prominently indicated by exit signs. “We also train the theatre staff to operate firefighting equipment,” added Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/once-burnt-forever-shy-theatres-do-their-bit-to-avoid-uphaar-part-ii/articleshow/87746073.cms||Amin Ali
---||Vijayawada||Farmers stand to lose Rs 33,000 crore if capital is trifurcated, Andhra Pradesh high court told||VIJAYAWADA: Capital region farmers stand to incur a loss of at least Rs 33,000 crore if the value of returnable plots is estimated at the lowest possible prices, senior counsel Shyam Diwan, arguing on behalf of the farmers, told the high court as the hearing on the batch of petitions challenging the trifurcation of the capital continued on Tuesday. Stating that capital establishment is a consequential effect of the State Reorganization Act, Diwan said the state government does not have the power to make laws to change the capital. Referring the Reorganisation Act, he said the power to decide the capital of any state lies with the Union government under article 3 of the Constitution. The Union government, through the said Act, decided Hyderabad as the common capital for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for not more than 10 years, after which it would remain as capital of Telangana. It also mentioned that AP shall have a new capital post bifurcation and an expert committee was constituted by the Centre to identify the location, Diwan said, adding that the state government does not have the legal competence to do that exercise over and over again as it has to be a one time exercise. As the capital has already been identified, notified by statute, master plans were prepared and investments made including the funding given by the Centre, it cannot be changed as and when the state government changes its mind, he argued. Stressing on the farmers’ contribution, Diwan said they gave up their livelihoods for the construction of a world-class capital. Though lands are being acquired for several projects, the capital region farmers cannot be equated with others and must be looked upon as a special class, because without their collective contribution a project of this size and magnitude is impossible to accomplish, he added. Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra intervened at this juncture, saying that the capital not only belonged to the 30,000 farmers who gave away their lands, but to everyone in the state. In reply to a query from the bench as to how vested rights were conferred on capital farmers, Diwan said had the decision to have three capitals taken at the time of bifurcation, this problem would not have arised. But by virtue of APCRDA Act and land pooling scheme (LPS), certain rights are vested with the farmers which cannot be taken away arbitrarily, he said. The hearing will continue on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-stand-to-lose-rs-33000-cr-if-capital-is-trifurcated-high-court-told/articleshow/87744409.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The air quality index (AQI) levels recorded in Agra city on Tuesday though remained in the 'poor' category at 262, this marked a slight improvement as against 'very poor' to 'severe' category for seven continuous days last week. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 is 'satisfactory'; 101 and 200 'moderate'; 201 and 300 'poor'; 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Environmentalists, however, warn that the air quality is expected to soon deteriorate from 'poor' to 'severe' due to low temperature and high humidity. Green activist Debashish Bhattacharya said, "Air quality gets improved due to settlement of dust particles on the ground by sprinkling of water on roads.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which oversees and frames the policy for the Income Tax Department, did not disclose the name of the firm, but said that the company manufactures excavators, cranes, piling rigs, and equipment in the mining and port space. Officials from the ITD or the CBDT did not respond to queries till late on Tuesday. In a statement, the CBDT claimed that the company has “admitted” to up to Rs 120 crore of unaccounted income, adding that cash, jewellery and bank lockers linked to the firm have been placed “under restraint”. The CBDT said the firm resorted to various means to suppress its income and profits by writing off expenses, such as by issuing credit notes, “non-verifiable” commission payments, “incorrect” depreciation claims, among others. The statement further added that the ITD had found and seized unaccounted investments, loans, and cash receipts by various parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/income-tax-dept-raids-pune-heavy-machinery-firm/articleshow/87745308.cms||---

Babu Bambhaniya, a resident of Nava Bandar village of Una taluka in Gir Somnath, is expected to reach his native village on Wednesday. According to case details, Babu was arrested by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) in March 2017 along with five other fishermen. But his five crew members were released within six months of the arrest after completion of jail sentence. The reason why he was not released was a typographic error in his father’s name. According to records of the Indian authorities, Babu’s father’s name was ‘Krisan’, but Pakistani authorities had mentioned it as ‘Naran’. Ajay Shiyal, a social worker from Amreli, who represented his issue with the Union ministry of external affairs and the Indian embassy in Pakistan said, “Babu was once released but had to return from Wagah border because of the typo mistake. We lost hope of his release now but suddenly we got the news that he is among the 20 fishermen released by Pakistan.” Babu’s eldest son is working with a local fisherman and is the sole breadwinner for the family. His two other children — a son and a daughter — are studying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fisherman-stuck-in-pak-jail-due-to-typo-error-released/articleshow/87745316.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: After lull, Nawab Malik raises storm with cruise ship trap list in KP Gosavi chats||MUMBAI: After a brief gap of a few days, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Tuesday stepped up his drive against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede for shielding the drug mafia and fashion designer Kashiff Khan. Malik shared a series of WhatsApp chats of K P Gosavi, the independent witness of the NCB during the raid on a cruise ship on October 2 and an informer, which shows how they were planning to trap people going to attend the party on Cordelia Cruise. The chat specifically mentioned Kashiff Khan and he was identified as suspected but not arrested by the NCB. He was on the cruise for two days but no action was taken against him. During the cruise raid, mega star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested by the NCB and later released on bail. “Wankhede must come out clean what are his relations with Khan and explain to the people as to why he was allowed to go and innocent persons arrested and sent to jail,”Malik said while disclosing the entire chat between Gosavi and an informer in New Delhi. Malik said that following the chat between Gosavi and the informer, it appears that the persons to be trapped were identified well in advance and their pictures, including one of Kashiff Khan, was sent to them. While more than a dozen persons were detained, Kashiff Khan was let off by the NCB sleuths. “Kashiff Khan and White Dubey’s names were among the persons to be arrested, but the duo was let off owing to his relations with Wankhede,” Malik said. Malik alleged that serious offences have been registered against Kashiff Khan across the country, including one in Mumbai. One court in Mumbai has declared him absconding. Malik was the first politician to raise doubts over the raid on the ship, saying it was fake and fabricated. He alleged that most of the witnesses were fake and criminals and they were working for Wankhede. Malik was proved right when it was found that Gosavi was indeed facing a series of criminal cases and that he was declared absconding, while another witness Bhanushali was a BJP worker. The third witness, Prabhakar Sail, submitted an affidavit against the NCB. While Wankhede declined to comment on the charges, an NCB official said that on umpteen occasions Malik had alleged Wankhede has relations with Kashiff Khan but he must produce evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-lull-nawab-raises-storm-with-cruise-ship-trap-list-in-gosavi-chats/articleshow/87746656.cms||---

---||Pune||5 Rajasthan men held for cheating folk artist online||Pune: The cyber cells of the Delhi and Pune police, in a joint operation, busted an online cheating racket with the arrest of five men from Rajasthan on Tuesday. A Pune police team left for Delhi after the arrested suspects were brought there by their Delhi counterparts. “The fraudsters cheated a Balewadi-based folk artist (35) to the tune of Rs16,200 on November 11. The woman had lodged a police complaint in this regard. During the probe, it was revealed that the suspects were operating from Rajasthan, and the Pune police shared details with the Delhi police’s cyber cell,” senior inspector D S Hake of the Pune cyber police said. The arrested men have been identified as Bajrangla Jagdish Narayan Meena, Ram Lalram Meena, Anilkumar Ramavatar Meena, Harbhajan Durgaram Meena. “The victim takes online folk-art classes and teaches students. She has a social media profile. The suspects read her posts and contacted her on the phone,” he said. He said the suspects claimed that they wanted to join her online classes and inquired about fees. The woman said she charges Rs1,800. The suspects agreed to pay through UPI,” he said. “The fraudsters then prepared a fake image to claim they paid Rs18,000 to her. They sent this image to the woman. Within minutes, they called up the woman and told her they accidentally transferred Rs 18,000 and demanded a refund of Rs 16,200. The woman checked the image and transferred the money,” Hake said. Under questioning by the Delhi police, the arrested men disclosed that they had created fake profiles on a social networking site. They used to visit shopping pages on the site and after taking the screenshots of the product, they used to ask the sellers for the price via messages, an officer said. “Then they would send fake messages of the paid amount, which would be higher than the amount quoted, and demand a refund of the excess amount,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-rajasthan-men-held-for-cheating-folk-artist-online/articleshow/87745323.cms||---

But in 2018 and 2019 when the two FDs were to mature Pravinchandra Shah, who lives in Makarpura, was shocked to know that the bank did not have any records of it. Shah pursued the issue with the bank since 2018, but the money was never paid out to him. However, the consumer court came to his rescue recently. The court ordered the bank to pay the matured amount of Rs 65,342 along with interest and compensation of Rs 2,000. As Shah did not get any positive response from the bank, he had filed a complaint at the consumer forum in November 2019. He told the court that the bank did not have records of his FDs. When he approached senior officials of the bank, he was told that as the bank’s system had changed, his FDs’ account numbers had changed and he was assured of the payment. But Shah never got the money and instead learnt that the bank had deducted tax at source even as he had filled forms 15H and 15G and the rate of interest was reduced without informing him. The bank was sent notice to appear before the forum and respond to Shah’s complaint, but the bank’s representatives never remained present. Since Shah had submitted all documentary evidence and they were not opposed by the bank, the court upheld the evidence. The court ordered the bank to pay the promised sum of Rs 65,342 to Shah within two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bank-misplaces-fd-records-of-senior-citizen-told-to-pay/articleshow/87744933.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Congress razes bust of Godse installed in Gujarat village||RAJKOT: A massive controversy has erupted in Jamnagar after members of a right-wing group installed a bust of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse, which was razed by the Congress members a day after being erected. The members who identified themselves as activists of Hindu Sena installed the statute in an ashram in Morkanda village adjoining Jamnagar city on Monday. They even raised slogans hailing Godse. However, local Congress leaders led by city’s party president Virendrasinh Jadeja razed the bust on Tuesday. The Hindu Sena and Congress lodged cross-complaints with Jamnagar A-division police station. The members of the outfit claimed that they had demanded a place from Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) to install Godse’s bust a month ago but JMC did not respond to their application. Pratik Bhatt, Gujarat president of Hindu Sena, said “Godse was associated with Hindu ideology and he fought for a Hindu nation. When our demand to erect his bust was not heard, we did it on our own on his death anniversary.” In his complaint, Bhatt named Jadeja and a person named Dhaval Nanda. “We are followers of Godse’s ideology. The accused vandalized the bust and threw a saffron cloth and a cloth on which Shree Ram was written in garbage. This act hurts our religious sentiments,” he stated. Meanwhile, Virendrasinh Jadeja in his complaint against Bhatt, Dhiren Bhanushali, Bhavesh Thummar and two unidentified persons, alleged erecting the bust of Godse was a blasphemous act. “They installed the bust without taking any permission and insulted those who believe in the ideology of Gandhiji. This act is creating dissension, hatred and animosity between people,” the complaint stated. In both complaints, those named were booked under relevant IPC sections including 153 (a) for an offence of promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony. Jamnagar deputy superintendent of police J S Chavda said “We have registered both FIRs against and the matter is under investigation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/congress-razes-bust-of-godse-installed-in-gujarat-village/articleshow/87745332.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: GVMC to supply 7 lakh bins for waste segregation at source||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has floated tenders to procure seven lakh garbage bins. These bins will be distributed to about 2.3 lakh households belonging to the below the poverty line in the city. The major objective of this initiative is to further waste segregation at source and promote the three-bin culture among the residents of the city. The civic body will utilise the 15th finance commission grants for this purpose. The GVMC earlier decided not to collect the non-segregated garbage from the public. But it is not being properly implemented at the ground level due to lack of awareness or for the want of bins on the part of some households. The GVMC distributed about 1 lakh bins in 2020 to tide over the situation to some extent. Now, the GVMC is expecting that the distribution of 7 lakh bins will reach out to all the eligible beneficiaries in the city. The Corporation earlier made a council resolution to intensify its solid waste management practices by adopting the guidelines of the solid waste management rules 2016. The source segregation of waste has been mandated to channelise the waste to wealth by recovery, reuse and recycle. As per these rules, the waste generator will have the responsibility of segregating it into three streams - wet, dry and hazardous waste. The generator will have to pay a ‘spot fine’ for littering and non-segregation, the quantum of which will be decided by the local bodies. Even though the two-bin segregation has been happening for quite some time in Vizag city, the majority of the residents are yet to adapt to the three-bin culture. A GVMC official informed that the tenders for procuring the bins would be finalised by November 20 and the distribution will begin in the coming weeks. “The distribution of three bins for every eligible household will help the public habituated to the waste segregation into three channels. The solid waste management rules 2016 emphasise scientific disposal of solid waste through segregation, collection and treatment and disposal in an environmentally sound manner. The GVMC is implementing several initiatives to achieve the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission and solid waste management rules,” said the health wing official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-supply-7l-bins-for-waste-segregation-at-source/articleshow/87744429.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Around six hospitals have allegedly been de-empanelled by these companies following disagreement over new packages offered for different treatments at the time of renewal, recently. The Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) has alleged that the insurers and TPAs adopted ‘arm-twisting’ policy through a lesser known body ‘Nagpur PPN Hospital empanelment committee’. A member of the committee, refusing to be quoted, passed the buck on the insurers. “We only communicate the decisions of the companies to hospitals. We don’t have much authority in negotiating or fixing the rates,” said the member, adding the committee is unaware of the VHA ultimatum. The VHA claimed all of its 160 members will soon take a similar decision. “If the fair demands are not met, the privilege of cashless services to the policy-holders of these insurance companies and TPAs will be stopped,” stated a press note issued by the VHA. Sources said the insurance companies and TPAs could take such a bold decision of slashing rates by over 50% due to support from some hospitals. “The companies and TPAs are citing the example of a select hospitals which have agreed to their revised rates. This can’t be standard for rest of the hospitals. These hospitals are startups and don’t have the similar set of doctors and expertise as compared to those who have built a reputation for themselves,” they said. The sources added that a possibility of these hospitals deliberately agreeing to the new packages at low rates to divert patient load under them can’t be ruled out. On last Saturday, the concerned VHA members had convened a meeting and resolved to stand united with the aggrieved hospitals. They have sought technical details supporting the extensive tariff reductions. “Instead of such crude rate cutting, all hospitals were waiting for some augmentation on existing tariff proportionate, at least on national indexes as a way to thank the private health care service providers,” said the VHA. Such ‘cartelization’ will result in poor quality and less choice of services for beneficiaries and is violative of the Competition Act, 2002, the VHA added. “The beneficiaries should have been at liberty to choose hospitals to avail quality health care. These companies are misleading and cheating policy holders by forcing them to avail services in select hospitals,” alleged the VHA.  ‘Insured face hardships due to decision of insurers’ cartel’ An insurance beneficiaries body has slammed the companies and the TPAs for “arm-twisting” private hospitals in agreeing to lower rates. “It is learnt that member hospitals of Vidarbha Hospitals Association are deliberating on stopping cashless services to health insurance beneficiaries of major TPAs of Nagpur. If such decision is taken, this will affect lakhs of the health insurance policy holders. People pay health insurance premium so that in times of need, cashless health care is available. One does not have cash ready during hospitalization and it creates lot of problems if admission of self or any dependent is required. We propagate health insurance only to avoid this,” said Insurance Beneficiaries Organization, Nagpur, in a press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20-hospitals-warn-of-stopping-cashless-facility-over-tariff-cut/articleshow/87745338.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The accused, identified as Rajneesh (who goes by his first name), went to the same school as the victim girl. The victim's brother told police that they were returning home after shopping in the Fatehganj East area, when Rajnish came before the bike and as he applied the brakes, allegedly kicked it, knocking the brother-sister duo off the bike on the road. Subsequently, he dragged his sister by the hair, tore her clothes and shot her five times at point blank range. The injured man said the attack was over even before he could pick himself up and save his sister. Rohit Singh Sajwan, Bareilly senior superintendent of police (SSP) said while police teams were searching for Rajneesh, he walked into the SSP office on Tuesday afternoon and surrendered along with the murder weapon. He said he killed the girl because she did not keep her promise of marrying him. Some villagers claimed the girl broke off ties with Rajneesh after her parents came to know about their relationship and did not approve of it. They fixed her marriage elsewhere and she abided by her parents' wishes. SSP Sajwan said, "The girl was shot in the neck and abdomen and she died on the spot. Her body was handed over to the family after an autopsy on Tuesday. An FIR has been registered against Rajneesh under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder) and 504 (intentional insult). The accused has been sent to jail." A police force has been deployed at the village to maintain law and order till the matter settles down, the SSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-19-shot-dead-by-jilted-boyfriend-in-bareilly/articleshow/87744454.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

According to zoo officials, a lioness gives birth to a maximum of four cubs, and that this is the result of continued efforts for successful breeding. “Five cubs is a rare event. Last year, a lioness gave birth to six cubs which is a very rare phenomenon. Lionesses have only four teats on their mammary gland, so naturally she can afford only up to four cubs,” a senior forest official said. D T Vasavda chief conservator of forest (wildlife circle) said “The mother is experienced as she has given birth to three healthy cubs earlier also. All are being taken care of and monitored by the staff.” Of the total 62 lion cubs born in Sakkarbaug zoo in the last two years, 30 cubs were born in the last one year. The zoo authority has studied behaviour management of lions and provided the cats with privacy and a relaxing environment for mating. The pairs are then kept in separate enclosures to create a conducive environment for the animals, with minimal human interference. As part of behavioural engagement, zoo authorities also included a few colourful balls to engage the felines in a playful mood and dispel any natural odium between opposite sexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lioness-gives-birth-to-quintuplets-at-sakkarbaug-zoo/articleshow/87745349.cms||---

Divisional traffic officer K S Patil told TOI that on Monday, one bus left for Borivali in the evening. “People are still not aware of the Shivshahi bus service to Borivali. Therefore, only one bus was sent on Monday. Another bus plied on Tuesday morning. As the information spreads and passengers start arriving at the stand, more buses would be operated on the route,” said Patil. MSRTC officials said more destinations would be added as and when required for the convenience of passengers.

---||Delhi||DJB to start installation of new connections||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Tuesday issued an order to start installation of new water connections. To stop contamination of water and avoid unauthorised connections, water minister Satyendar Jain had held a meeting with officials last month. It was decided that DJB would directly provide connections to its consumers, thereby removing any scope of intermediaries. The installation charges have been divided category-wise based on the colonies. For colonies falling in groups A, B and C, the charge for a new connection would be Rs 4,000. For categories D and E, the charge would be Rs 2,000 and in case of F, G, H and rural villages, Rs 1,000 would be levied. For commercial connections, the charges would be double the domestic charges based on the category of the colony. DJB would approve sewer connections along with the water connections and no separate charges would be levied. All zonal officials have been directed to send a daily list of sanctioned water connections to the officer concerned in the maintenance department for installation without waiting for payment by the customer. During this process, the government would also be replacing defective meters and regularising unauthorised connections. DJB has also made it clear that only authorised people would be allowed to lay water or sewer pipelines. “No unauthorised person will touch the water or sewer pipeline as only people authorised by DJB will lay the connection, according to the decision of the board,” stated the order issued by Akriti Sagar, director, revenue department. “As water is a basic human need, every house in an area where water pipelines have been laid and made functional will be provided a connection and all unauthorised connections will be regularised,” added the order. Through this effort, DJB hopes to benefit customers by providing a single-window facility for its services. There would be better maintenance of pipelines as water connections would be done by an expert team, thereby avoiding chances of damage and contamination of water. This would also reduce revenue losses through household connections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-to-start-installation-of-new-connections/articleshow/87746096.cms||---

The passengers, a few of whom spoke to TOI, said that many aggregator drivers were becoming just like Kaali Peeli drivers in the past. Recently, TOI wrote about how they have begun cancelling rides and “refusals” similar to Kaali Peeli drivers. And now, the latest modus is to demand “fixed fares” for a ride to the airport. This was something Kaali Peeli taxis would do at the stands a few years back. TimesViewAggregator cabs came as a major relief for lakhs of commuters in Mumbai in 2014 when citizens were frustrated with refusals, and rigged meters of autos and Kaali Peeli taxis.If the aggregators have to survive, they need to discipline drivers, ensure zero refusals and provide low cost rides to woo back commuters’ trust.The drivers have also begun asking for the fare shown in the app for the trip to the airport, a few riders said. If the fare does not suit him or is lower than his expectation, he quickly cancels the ride. One such rider, Virat Singh, said he refused to reveal the fare shown in the app and the driver cancelled the ride. “After I booked the cab, the driver instantly called me and said ‘rate kitna dikha raha hai airport drop ka app mein (what is the fare for airport being shown on app)? I refused to give him the fare while he kept insisting and when I did not budge, he just cancelled the ride,” he said. Another passenger said she had booked a cab for her brother to the domestic airport. “The driver called me asking what is the fare shown in the app and said that he will only ply if we pay Rs 600. This is ridiculous. Drivers should compulsorily ply cabs at fares being calculated by the app,” she demanded. Singh said he complained to the aggregator firm, which replied : “We’re sorry to hear about this. We understand how this experience can be upsetting. We’ve always encouraged driver partners to take all rides irrespective of the destination. Since this wasn’t the case here, we’ve reached out to the driver partner and made a note on his profile. We use a point-based model that records every feedback about a driver-partner and takes necessary actions ranging from educating them to excluding them from the platform. We appreciate you bringing this to our notice.” Social media had citizens discussing the same issue and some of the tweets were : #Ameya Chumbhale @ameyapc : “No long term solution will be found on this....All they are interested in is their profits. Nor will our government step in to make them do it.... they are the new kaali peelis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/app-cabs-demand-fixed-fares-for-trip-to-airport-in-mumbai-riders/articleshow/87745345.cms||Somit Sen

The Ankudu wood depot that was set up in the village has never served the purpose. Etikoppaka toys are mainly handmade, using wood which is lightweight and easy to cut. Etikoppaka toys are exported to even foreign countries. The previous government set up a depot of Ankudu wood, which is most suitable for making toys, but not a single load of wood came before it was closed a couple of weeks later in 2018. The village artisans need around 15 to 20 tonnes of Ankudu wood a month. The wood is available in Golugonda, KD Peta, Kottakota, Tallapalem, Ravikamatham, and other areas. The tiny village with a population of 15,000 on the banks of river Varaha has 200 artisans including five national and five state award winning craft persons. The artisans are now depending on vendors who deliver the wood secretly. Akudu wood is available in forests but the department says it is forest produce. Sirsailapu Chinnayya Chari, the President Award winner, says Ankudu wood is available at various places but needs forest department permission. “Forest department officials are trying to get permission from the government. We are dependent on craftwork and the government should save us. Most of the artisans have moved to other works and not trained their wards in the art, “ Chinnayya Chari said. More than three-century-old legacy of the softwood-lacquerware toy industry is now urging the government authorities to provide permission to bring the wood from forest areas or set up a depot in their village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/etikoppaka-craftsmen-in-limbo-after-bar-on-transport-of-wood/articleshow/87744458.cms||Siva G

The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by Rs 1,050 per quintal in just a week, from Rs 2,900 per quintal on October 9 to Rs 1,880 per quintal today. APMC officials said the supply of new onion crop has increased in other onion growing belts in the country and it has reduced the demand for Nashik’s onions. Moreover, export of onions has also reduced, which has led to overall drop in average wholesale onion prices, said APMC officials. Moreover, the central government has created a buffer stock of 2 lakh tonnes and it is in the process of selling over 1 lakh tonnes in the markets in major metro cities. This has also impacted the wholesale market leading drop in average wholesale onion prices, said APMC officials. Meanwhile, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 901 and Rs 2,512 per quintal, respectively. Around 8,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Tuesday. Presently, the onions arriving at the Lasalgaon APMC are the summer onions harvested in March and April. The summer onions have a shelf life of over six months and farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices. The fresh kharif onions have also started arriving at the market but in very low quantity — only 4% of the total arrivals at the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/onion-prices-continue-to-drop-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/87743723.cms||Tushar Pawar

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana noted that the accused was allegedly part of the syndicate that cheated Indians with the help of Chinese nationals by using a complex maze of mobile applications, websites and shell companies. “The chats of the applicant/accused with the Chinese nationals through Telegram and WhatsApp applications clearly proves the role played by him in the commission of the alleged offence,” the judge said while refusing to grant him bail on account of parity on Monday. “The instant bail application is bereft of any merit and the same is accordingly dismissed,” he added. During the hearing, the accused’s counsel claimed that he had been falsely implicated and neither anything incriminating had come on record to connect him with the commission of the alleged offence nor he had received any pecuniary benefit from it. Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea, saying the accused had duped the victims on the pretext of doubling their money within a short span of 30-35 days. Ahmed argued that the gullible citizens were initially paid about 10-15% of their amount before they were blocked and the rest of their amount was cheated by the accused people. He further submitted that many companies were used in the scam for siphoning money and large amounts were transferred from one company to another. It was also submitted that while the power bank app had projected itself as a Bengaluru-based company involved in quick charging technology, the server of the app was found to be based in China and the app was associated with several dangerous permissions. Once the user registers on the app, he/she was induced to invest money to earn high returns and invite their friends and relatives to join it, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-accused-in-chinese-crime-syndicate/articleshow/87746101.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and other outfits from Sangli and Satara districts are angry over the fact that the mills have started sugar cane crushing without announcing the price they would pay to the farmers. The mills from the Kolhapur district have announced that they will pay the farmers an amount equal to Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the central government. The outfits are demanding the FRP amount to be paid in a single installment. Mahesh Kharade, Sangli district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana who attended the meeting in Pune, said, "Apart from a couple of mills in the Sangli and Satara districts, no mill has announced the prices even though the cutting and crushing has been started. By law, it is mandatory for the mills to pay the amount equal to FRP to the farmers, however, many mills have not announced the prices so they can pay less." The transportation of sugarcane to the mills is being obstructed violently. Now, since the meeting with Gaikwad remained inconclusive, the farmer outfits are likely to intensify the agitation. "We will hold a meeting with the local workers. It is for sure, the agitation which was limited to a few mills will now be extended to all the mills from both the districts. The mills will not be allowed to cut the cane," said Kharade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-outfits-to-intensify-stir-over-sugar-cane-prices/articleshow/87743751.cms||---

At the time of chief minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, a committee was set up to come up with a transfer policy in Rajasthan. The committee submitted its two-volume report, which was later presented in the state assembly, but couldn’t get passed.Since then, there have been several discussions regarding the transfer policy, but no concrete step was taken by any government. Teachers have been demanding a transfer policy for a long time. Vipin Sharma, vice-president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Government Teachers Association said, “We have been listening to these discussions for a long time. Instead of just talking about it every year, the government must take ction.”Spokesperson of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh, Narayan Singh Sisodia, said the step in implementing this decade-old plan should be executed by the state government as this will give relief to government teachers who have to suffer due to this.A transfer policy will decide the time limit of transferring an employee.

Environmentalists are happy that all the five choked tidal water inlets to Panje wetland have been unblocked now and migratory birds have also started arriving there. Cidco, revenue, and forest department officials, accompanied by environmentalists from NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, and the fishing community representatives trekked the radius of the nearly 300-hectare wetland for close to three hours and physically checked all the five inlets. Cidco nodal officer for environment, Pramod Patil, Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare and range forest officer S A Kadam also joined the inspection team. Two inlets were towards the Dongari village end and three at the Panje end. “With the help of the map prepared earlier by BNHS, the officials managed to detect and open all the choke points, which is good for the Panje wetland,” NatConnect Director B N Kumar said. “Some miscreants were earlier trying to sabotage and destroy the wetland by blocking these five inlets, which are now reopened. We also urge the authorities to conducte regular patrolling at Panje,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan. The visit assumed significance as the Bombay high court had on Monday admitted the petition of the NGO Vanashakti Foundation for declaring Panje a protected bird sanctuary. Since it was the low-tide time during the joint inspection, water was flowing back into the sea through the channels. Responding to the Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan’s petition, the Western Zonal bench of the National Green Tribunal had earlier asked the Raigad district collector and Cidco to ensure that the state government’s orders were complied with on the issue of preservation of Panje. Finally, at the end of a battle lasting exactly one year, the channels were kept open on the instructions from collector Mahendra Kalyankar. The decision followed complaints of attempts to sabotage the wetland by rendering it dry to suit vested interests who are trying to convert the place into a concrete jungle. Sub-divisional officer Rahul Mundake assured the environmentalists that the officials would keep an eye on the wetland to ensure that the inlets are kept open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-panje-wetland-choke-points-cleared-finds-joint-inspection/articleshow/87745393.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Hyderabad||‘Keep Mask On To Avoid Resurgence Of Covid’||Does the drop in Covid-19 numbers mean the pandemic is behind us? Can people drop their guard already? N K Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 and senior member of India’s Covid-19 task force, addresses these questions  “Keeping the hands sanitised at all times is a good and desirable habit. It should become part of our lives and culture – Covid-19 or no Covid-19. It will prevent several other respiratory and gut infections”, says N K Arora, co-chair of INSACOG Q: There are conflicting reports coming in from different quarters about the status of Covid-19. Is it really on the wane? A: From June-July 2021, there is a gradual decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The decline is variable – some parts of the country have seen a faster decline while other parts like Kerala and the north-east are witnessing a slower reduction in cases. Overall, the test positivity rate has come down across the country and now we have 10,000 to 12,000 cases every day for the last several weeks. Q: A lot of people have stopped wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Is that advisable? If not, why? A: SARS-COV-2 is very much around us. That is why we are still getting over 10,000 cases every day. People in several countries in Europe and other high-income countries have made the mistake of giving up Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after high vaccine coverage and initial decline in cases. That has led to the resurgence of the disease. We do not want to make that mistake in India. Q: What other Covid-19 protocol must we follow while stepping out into public places? A: Besides SMS (Sanitation, Mask and Social distance), the key is to avoid crowds and avoid creating a crowd. In any social gathering we do not know about the Covid-19 infection status of the person standing next to us. Currently, several other infections – the so-called ‘viral fevers’ -- are also widely prevalent but unfortunately none can be differentiated from Covid-19 infection unless tested. Despite vaccination, we can acquire and carry the infection back to our homes and become a reason for continuing the chain of Covid-19 virus transmission in our near and dear ones. Q: As offices and schools have started reopening, what precautions must we take while being inside closed spaces? A: Strict adherence to Corona Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) is very important because the risk of spreading of infections increases several folds, in closed spaces. Employees and students who have even mild common cold/flu like symptoms should be asked to work or study from home till the symptoms subside in three to five days. Q: Is it still necessary to sanitise our hands and things we buy from outside, before using them? A: Keeping the hands sanitised at all times is a good and desirable habit. It should become part of our lives and culture – Covid-19 or no Covid-19. This habit will prevent several other respiratory and gut infections. The recent evidence suggests that Covid-19 virus does not survive for long on any surface but usual cleaning of vegetables and fruits with running water is necessary. Q: Do we really have a shortage of vaccines or are people still hesitant to get the shot? A. India started on a journey of Atmanirbharta right from day one and the complete vaccination programme has been accomplished with indigenously manufactured vaccines. There is absolutely no shortage of vaccine. In fact, vaccine manufacturers have been allowed the export of vaccine now. Q: Are there any other challenges that we need to overcome to increase our vaccination rate? A: Last mile run in any vaccination programme requires extra effort – be it polio or measles or now Covid-19. Additional efforts like ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ are necessary to reach everyone to get both doses of the vaccine. Hesitancy is only part of the story. A large number of families and individuals are not able to avail the facility due to fear of loss of their daily wages. Availability is an issue for those staying in inaccessible areas as well. Q: Many were infected with coronavirus after taking two shots of the vaccine. Are there chances of contracting it even after the third dose? A: The Covid-19 vaccines, irrespective of any brand available anywhere in the world, do not completely prevent the risk of infection with the virus. Having said that the Covid-19 vaccines practically eliminate the risk of severe disease, need for hospitalisation and death. Third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is required in those with immunity problems and who may not mount adequate protection after the regular two-dose schedule. Q: Will a third dose or booster reduce the fatality rate further? A: The question is about the need and timing of boosters. Based on scientific evidence in India, we do not require boosters now. The individual and national priority is to get everyone two doses of the Covid-19 vaccines at the earliest and the people must continue to demonstrate discipline in the form of adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and avoiding social gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/keep-mask-on-to-avoid-resurgence-of-covid/articleshow/87745416.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||AUM for equity MF surges Rs 3,756cr in October||Ahmedabad: Propelled by sustained inflows into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), the assets under management (AUM) for equity-linked mutual funds (MFs) increased by Rs 3,656.4 crore in Gujarat. According to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), AUM for equity MFs touched Rs 1.35 lakh crore, continuing its rally in October, against Rs 1.31 lakh crore in September. However, the growth in AUM slowed last month as compared to September, when it grew by Rs 7,279 crore against Rs 1.24 lakh crore in August. Financial consultants attribute the slowing growth to increased profit-booking by investors for festival spending and savings. “With market indices touching new highs, several investors continued to profit-book their gains from mutual funds. This could have been for festive season spending or for future and long-term savings due to which growth in overall AUM during October was slow,” said Jayesh Vithalani, a financial consultant from Ahmedabad. The surge in AUM for equity MFs was largely due to increase in net asset value of prevailing investment in addition to sustained inflows into SIPs. “SIP inflows touched record-high across the country and the trend remained similar in Gujarat as well. Fresh investments also continued to pour from investors, thanks to a few new fund offers being launched by asset management companies from time to time,” Vithalani added. Financial consultants also said that several youngsters are becoming aware and opening demat accounts which is also propelling fresh inflows into equity-linked MFs. In October, the total AUM stood at Rs 2.58 lakh crore in Gujarat, which was marginally up by 0.54% against that in September. This was largely driven by equity-linked MFs. In fact, the AUM for gold exchange traded funds also grew by a significant 10.55% in October to touch Rs 307.37 crore. “On festive muhurats of Dussehra and Pushya Nakshatra, investors not just purchased physical gold in the form of coins and bars but also invested into gold ETFs. Price of gold also went marginally up during the month which led to an increase in the net asset value of investments,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aum-for-equity-mf-surges-rs-3756cr-in-october/articleshow/87745700.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Surat||Conversion racket: Complainant alleges death threats, given police protection||Surat: The complainant in the religious conversion racket has alleged that he received death threats after lodging the complaint in Amod police station of Bharuch district. This prompted police to give him protection even as his identity was not revealed by the cops.  The complainant alleged that he too was converted and claimed in the complaint that he was lured with a good job and expenses to renovate his house. After conversion, he was taken to Surat where his Aadhar card was made with a new identity.  He further alleged that around 100 other people from the same village were converted by offering grocery, money and luring men for second marriage. The accused involved in the racket even arranged a trip to Mumbai for some families. He has alleged that some unidentified people threatened him with life when he was passing by some houses in the street of his village. MP Bhojani, in-charge deputy superintendent of police, Jambusar told TOI: "The person did not file any official complaint about threats but have provided him armed police protection. We have not arrested any accused still and the investigation is on."  "Further legal actions will be taken once we record statements of victim families. Police will also investigate the source foreign funds that were used to finance the racket. Some unidentified persons in the UK sent money to local persons to encourage conversions," said a senior official. Bharuch police had lodged an FIR against nine persons after receiving the complaint that around 100 people of 37 families in Kankaria village were converted.

BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, while speaking in Mumbai said, “On Monday, our core group has finalised the names. We have also spoken with the central leadership. For the Kolhapur MLC constituency, Amal Mahadik’s name has been finalised and sent to the central leadership for an announcement to be made in the next two to three days after we finalise the candidates for other seats. The nominations have to be filed by November 23 and therefore, we have enough time for the final announcement by the central leadership." Patil also said that the campaigning has already been started by the local leaders. He said BJP has the upper hand in the elections. "The voting for the elections is secret and we are fighting all seats with all might," added Patil. Now, it is clear that Amal Mahadik will be a candidate against Congress's Satej Patil. Interestingly, Amal Mahadik was the one who defeated Satej Patil in the 2014 legislative assembly elections, which then left Satej Patil no choice but to contest the 2015 MLC election which he won against Amal's father and three times sitting MLC Mahadevrao Mahadik. In the 2019 assembly elections, Amal was defeated by Satej Patil's nephew Ruturaj Patil. Earlier, Shoumika Mahadik, wife of Amal Mahadik’s name was finalised, however, she declined due to unknown reasons. After the defeat in Gokul cooperative dairy, Mahadiks are politically marginalised. However, it is for sure, political rivalry between Satej Patil and Mahadiks will continue for some time now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bjp-picks-mahadik-for-kolhapur-mlc-election/articleshow/87743768.cms||---
---||Mumbai||How can Maharashtra intel be in dark about rallies: Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis asked on Tuesday, “How is it possible these rallies (in Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon) are spontaneous, and if there was planning, how is it that the government and police intelligence (department) are unaware? These rallies were carried out with support from Maha Vikas Aghadi government. This is a planned experiment. Shops owned by Hindus were burnt, and no leader from MVA spoke about it.”He alleged, “As they (MVA partners) don’t have answers to PM’s (work on) development, they are polarising minorities. A similar experiment was done at Bhima-Koregaon.” Continuing to draw a link between the alleged incidents in Tripura, Rahul Gandhi’s tweet and violence in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said on October 26, a rally was organised in Tripura in solidarity with Hindus attacked in Bangladesh. “There was no violence. But from October 28, posts started appearing on social media. Photos were posted of burning of a CPI(M) office, which was shown to be a masjid. Similarly, a fire in a refugee camp in Delhi was misrepresented. Similarly, pictures of a project in Pakistan were shown as those from Tripura,” he said. Fadnavis attacked Sena’s Sanjay Raut for alleging BJP had caused riots. “Nawab Malik was fully aware of the source of funding for the riots and as a cover-up alleged money went from so-and-so places,” he said. Fadnavis asked why police were not called in early. “There are seven companies of SRPF in Amravati. Initially they were given no orders and when the situation got out of control, police were attacked. It is similar to the Azad Maidan incident where police were injured. Not a single person has been arrested for injuring cops in Amravati,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-can-maharashtra-state-intel-be-in-dark-about-rallies-ex-cm/articleshow/87746730.cms||Clara Lewis

Bhallabh said on October 4, 2018, two former Union ministers of BJP and a senior lawyer submitted a complaint to the director CBI, citing massive corruption in the Rafale deal. Just a few days later (October 11), the government of Mauritius through its attorney general had supplied the documents to the CBI regarding alleged pay off. As a consequence, the Modi government on October 23 removed the CBI director Alok Verma in a midnight coup and appointed its protege M Nageshwar Rao as CBI chief. He said the UPA government negotiated Rafale aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526.10 crore per plane after an international tender for 126 planes. Modi government bought the same jet off the shelf (without tender) for Rs 1,670 crore per plane without transfer of technology. The difference in cost of 36 planes purchased by Centre is a whopping Rs 41,205 crore. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-was-busy-covering-up-rafale-deal-says-congress/articleshow/87746726.cms||---

Bhati, a Gurjar by caste, who was earlier with the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Congress, was in the thick of controversy around an IAS officer in the previous government.His video of how he got the said IAS officer suspended had gone viral. BJP workers, especially from west UP where Bhati has his influence, are reportedly unhappy over the development. Sources said a senior minister in the Yogi Adityanath government had been pushing for Bhati’s induction into the BJP for the last one year. Among others who may join the BJP, most probably on Wednesday, include CP Chand, son of former minister Late Markandey Chand from Gorakhpur, Ravi Shanker Singh, the cousin of Rajya Sabha member Neeraj Chandrashekhar. Sources said the BJP had started preparation for the election of local body MLCs, the election for which is likely anytime next year. When contacted, a senior BJP leader tried to downplay the joining of Bhati and said he was being brought into the party fold after proper screening and he did not have any case against him. Sources said Bhati’s induction was being done to pacify Gurjar voters who are unhappy after the controversy around the installation of the statue of Mihir Bhoj in Gautam Budh Nagar.

Speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly formed executive by the Secretariat Employees Union, the chief minister jokingly said, “it seems the cabinet reshuffle has been held up due to the delay in the swearing-in of the executive. Now that with the swearing-in has taken place, the cabinet reshuffle also will be held soon.” It was the first time he was referring to the reshuffle. Similarly, Gehlot has indicated that education minister and state Congress party chief Govind Singh Dotasra may be divested of his ministerial post. After Dotasra's speech at the state-level teachers ward ceremony, the chief minister said the minister gave a speech as if it was his farewell speech. He added that, “Dotasra had requested the high command several times to stay on only one post. I feel that now Dotasara ji only wants to remain on the post of state president.” Gehlot on Tuesday also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of being involved in the fall of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and trying to do the same in Rajasthan. Gehlot made the allegation while referring to the political crisis over the stability of his government in 2020 after rebellion by his then deputy Sachin Pilot and said the Congress MLAs stayed in hotels for a long time but “the present government is in place only due to the blessings of the people”. "The Home Minister could not do anything,” said Gehlot, without naming Shah. “He had a lot of arrogance over Madhya Pradesh but the people of Rajasthan shattered his arrogance,” asserted Gehlot. “Is it a way to act in a democracy, bringing down governments?' he asked. He claimed that about one lakh government jobs have been given in Rajasthan and the process of giving about 80,000 jobs is going on." Expressing concern over the present political situation in the country, he said, “In which direction the country is going? Nobody knows. Today the Constitution and democracy are in danger. The situation is very serious. Every person will have to think," the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-hints-at-cabinet-rejig-dotasra-may-be-dropped/articleshow/87746731.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vaccination count surges in Maharashtra again after a month’s low||PUNE: After almost a month of low vaccination rates since mid-October, inoculation has surged once again with the state administering the highest daily jabs on November 13,15 and 16. Official data showed day jabs crossed 7 lakh for the first time on Saturday and Monday since October 18. The state administered 6.6 lakh shots till Tuesday evening. Daily jabs in the past few days, barring Sunday (usually a lean day), have thus been highest in some time now. State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai said the current target was to complete all the first doses in Maharashtra by November-end. “Accordingly, a daily target of 10 lakh jabs is being kept in sight,” he said. Currently, the state is yet to cover nearly 24% of its 9.14 crore eligible population with first jabs. Dr Desai said, “In the last two days, Maharashtra’s daily jabs have increased, the average being higher than almost a month. The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme started last week and took some time to pick up momentum as the districts were still collating data on the left-out beneficiaries. We have covered 76% of the eligible population with first doses in the state, and aim to cover the rest by this month-end.” Daily average for shots administered in the state had plunged to 3-4 lakh since October third week, owing to the festive season and the huge gap (84 days) between the first and second doses of Covishield and fall in beneficiaries’ footfalls at the inoculation sites. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, however, said jabs administered in Pune in the last couple of days had not shown any major improvement, being nearly 35,000 on average. “However, conditions may improve in 4-5 days not only as the programme picks up but also because the November-end period is likely to see a huge number of beneficiaries becoming due for their second shots,” he said. An official from the district health department, Thane, said the district administered over 64,000 jabs on Monday, with the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme being on. “Surveys are on at village and city level to find first and second dose beneficiaries. We are organizing separate vaccination camps in areas that have a higher number of beneficiaries for the pending vax doses. The programme picked up pace since Monday, as the previous week was spent in collecting data and sensitizing people on the importance of vaccination,” the official said. District Health Officer, Thane, Dr Manish Renge told TOI, “As part of the sensitizing activities, we have been telling people about the role of the vaccine in reducing mortality. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-count-surges-in-state-again-after-a-months-low/articleshow/87747186.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||HC asks cops, waqf board to inspect Markaz||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed a joint inspection of Nizamuddin Markaz, where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held in March last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, by the city police and Delhi Waqf Board to ascertain its structural components and examine the issue of its re-opening. Justice Mukta Gupta, who was hearing the Waqf Board's plea to re-open the markaz which has remained shut since March 31 last year, said that each party can nominate five persons to conduct the inspection and sought a report on the same within 15 days. The order was passed after the senior counsel for the petitioner stated that under the latest Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines, all religious places are now open for visitors. The masjid is the only rare religious place under lock and key, the Board said. The judge observed that the property in question, popularly known as the Masjid Bangley Wali, comprised three areas place of worship, place of congregation, and residential area and therefore there could be no “sweeping order” concerning the entire compound. The court further stated that even under the latest DDMA order, there is still a cap on the number of participants in a congregation. Central government counsel Rajat Nair said that the entire property has to be “earmarked” and the DDMA order would apply to each zone accordingly. “Earmark the property so that one knows which area is for what purpose and DDMA guidelines will apply. Plain and simple, bifurcate. Place on record the map,” said the judge who went on to observe that the three components may be “interconnected” and making a distinction among them may ensure smooth functioning. “A joint inspection of the Delhi Police officers including the SHO concerned and the authorised representatives of the petitioner be carried out so as to demarcate the three areas,” the court ordered. The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-Uloom, and attached hostel -- continues to be locked up. It has further contended that even if the premises were part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of the enquiry process. Several FIRs were registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, the Foreigners Act, and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown last year. On the last occasion, the court had questioned the Centre as to how long it intended to keep the Nizamuddin Markaz locked, saying it can't be “kept forever”. “Some persons were in possession of the property. Due to the pandemic, an FIR was registered.. (and) you take possession as case property. It has to be handed over. It can't be that the property is kept forever (subject to court orders). What is your stand on the facts of the case? You tell me from whom you took it. How long will you keep it locked as case property?” the judge had said. In its affidavit affirmed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime, the Centre had told the court that it is “necessary and incumbent” to “preserve” the Markaz property as the investigation in the case registered for violation of the COVID-19 protocols has “cross borders implications and involves nation's diplomatic relations with other countries.” On April 15, the court had allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship. The matter would be heard next on January 12. PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-cops-waqf-board-to-inspect-markaz/articleshow/87746133.cms||---

The circus artists wearing colourful attires rolled, jumped, juggled and skipped to entertain the audience and were applauded. The circus is on its three-day tour since Monday. The entertainers performed the most difficult looking stunts with effortless ease and left the young ones in awe. Like other kids of their age-group, brothers Manak and Manas started shouting with glee as soon as they saw the jokers arrive. Their father Ram Sajivan Yadav said, “This is the first time my sons are witnessing a circus and they are thrilled. They started jumping and clapping with excitement as they saw the jokers fighting on the stage. I have never seen them so ecstatic before.” Several residents of the nearby apartments also came to see the circus. Snehlata Rai, who brought her daughter and 10 years old son, said, “I had been hearing about the Hunar Haat from my neighbours and friends. My daughter jumped with joy when I told her about the circus. My children found it very entertaining. It was a different experience for them than watching cartoon shows on television.” The excitement of tiny tots had no bounds. Disha Patel, a little girl, kept standing on the chair for the entire show. “I really loved how the circus artist balanced himself on buckets.” Sunil Verma, a visitor, said, “My son got really scared on seeing the fire balancing act and started crying. I comforted him somehow, and he soon started laughing when the jokers arrived.” “I had been planning to visit the haat with my friends but could resist no further on hearing about the circus,” said Princy Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/acts-of-jokers-jugglers-leave-audience-in-splits/articleshow/87746138.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Excise takes to social media for large bid on liquor licences||HYDERABAD: The excise department adopted a novel approach to get the targeted number of applications for the auction of liquor store licences. The government was expecting close to 50,000 applications for more than 2,620 liquor shops, but received only 6,600 applications till Monday. The department is aggressively pushing the bid details on social media and urging entrepreneurs to submit applications now that store running guidelines have been relaxed. The department is sending messages on phones informing the interested traders that the bank guarantee had been reduced by half and that there are increased margin benefits now. Previously, shop owners used to receive seven times of the stock and a 20% profit on deposits paid, but that has now been upped to 10 times. “This time, the goal is to receive 50,000 applications,” excise officials said. After the bid was announced, the most number of applications (3,750) were received on Monday, with the highest number of applications coming from Khammam district (1,064). Interestingly, despite having the most authorised liquor stores, Hyderabad received only 217 applications. The department is also informing entrepreneurs that the bank guarantee can be paid in instalments and that there is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted. Since the application fee is non-refundable, the department received more than Rs 1,000 crore in revenue from the 2019 auction. The application fee received from districts such as Khammam and Warangal was more than Rs 100 crore in the earlier auction. The excise department is also campaigning big this time, claiming that there would be greater margins for owners because permit rooms are authorised and they can sell liquor-related items. “Some of the staff and officials are calling us and telling us to apply for licences because it is profitable this time. WhatsApp groups are also being formed,” said an entrepreneur, who possessed a licence a few years ago, but later shut it down. For new applicants, the department has also simplified the application process by making it a single page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/excise-takes-to-social-media-for-large-bid-on-liquor-licences/articleshow/87745411.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Power rates up by 33 paisa/unit for 90 days due to rising coal costs||JAIPUR: The discoms in Rajasthan have raised electricity tariffs by 33 paisa for the next three months factoring in rise in purchase cost due to coal and other input costs. Electricity rates in Rajasthan are already one of the highest in the country, at over Rs 10 per unit. The hikes also comes at a time people have been burdened with highest auto fuel rates. But discoms are not entirely responsible for this. They pay the highest price among discoms in the country to buy power from power generation companies, at Rs 4.81 a unit. Similarly, in crisis times like the recent one involving coal shortage, they pay more to buy from exchanges. And there are legacy issues that contribute majorly for the high power tariffs. For example the interest cost of discoms adds Rs 1.34 per unit of power. TimesViewThere are many ways to cut power cost for the end consumer. Unfortunately, every time there is a rise in input cost, it is passed on to consumers. For example, discoms in the state have one of the highest transmission losses. There are other verticals where you can improve efficiency. Instead of burdening the public, the department should explore these options.In fact, sources in the energy department said there are three major natural disadvantages that the state suffers. It is far away from coal sources resulting in higher coal cost and has a bigger geography with vast transmission network that needs more investment and depreciation and the third is extreme weather pattern with peak demand moving between a wide range of (14,000- 9,500mw). Discoms need to pay a fixed charge to power generators even if they don’t buy some quantity of power when demand comes down. But the biggest of all these problems is the mismanagement of the department. He said the state has power plants that charge Rs 15 a unit (Anta Gas plant). Discoms pay Rs 10 per unit to Auraiya Gas power. Why the department is not taking a decision to exit from such costlier contracts. Similarly, there are costlier power purchase agreements with some units of NTPC. They have to be retired as well. Management of demand and supply of power seems to have gone for a toss. In coal purchase, Rajasthan is paying Rs 600 extra per tonne to Adani for a better quality coal. Questions have been questioned about the quality of coal. Selling fly ash from the power plants are not transparent as well, said sources. That could have generated revenues for state power generators and helped reduce power cost. Of course the discoms cannot escape from the responsibility of reducing high transmission and distribution losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-rates-up-by-33p/unit-for-90-days-due-to-rising-coal-costs/articleshow/87746740.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The decision of the government comes at a time when 400 room nights in hotel has been booked till February. In the past also, the department had decided to leas out the property but after the protest by the RTDC employees union, the move was stalled. Acoording to the union, the commercial tax will take the hotel on rent to station one of its departments for which the government has already sanctioned land. The union said that this a peak tourist season and already rooms have been booked. “Once the commercial department starts working here, then all the hotel’s materials like beds, TV, chairs and other hotel specific furniture and assets will have to auctioned. It will be very difficult to restart the hotel again,” said Tej Singh Rathore, president of the RTDC employees association. He said the hotel has improve its level of occupancy to over 25% and has been profitable in the recent times except for the Covid period. Weddings have also been booked, he said. In fact, the decision to give the hotel on rent to run an office has come as a surprise for the employees. “We don’t know when the decision was taken,” said another source. According sources, Teej has been performing better in terms of occupancy and profitability that other two RTDC properties in Jaipur – Gangaur and Swagatam. Of late, the state finance department has been trying to lease out the hotels, but has failed to take a decision. “The government has neither a concrete plan to sell the hotels nor allow them to run properly. At the same time it is trying to take a loan on RTDC having hotels as underlying asset to create the Rs 500 crore tourism development fund announced by the chief minister in the budget,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-give-teej-hotel-on-rent-union-livid/articleshow/87746742.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC polls: In 2017, electoral wards split, boundaries tweaked for political gain, says Mumbai mayor||MUMBAI: Electoral wards were split and boundaries changed in 2017 for political gain, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said on Tuesday, responding to BJP’s allegations of “mischief” in the redrawing of ward boundaries ahead of the BMC elections. Pednekar, who is also a Shiv Sena corporator, said that each constituency or electoral ward should ideally have a population of around 50,000 so that citizens’ issues can be resolved and development works can be carried out. In 2017, Maharashtra government was led by BJP with Shiv Sena as the junior partner, but the two parties fought the BMC polls independently. Last week, the state cabinet had decided to add nine more electoral wards to the existing 227, raising the number to 236. The opposition, BJP, had called the decision politically motivated, saying the ruling parties have taken the step to better their electoral chances. “I don’t want to reply to any allegations since this is an election process which is being carried out officially under the State Election Commission, but it’s a fact that several wards were broken into two or three parts, and boundaries were altered for political gain in 2017. As a result, in some wards the population is 65,000, while in some wards in the suburbs it is just 40,000,” Pednekar told TOI. Election data analyst Hitesh Jain pointed out that many wards in the island city have 60,000-plus population. “The average population per ward should be around 50,000, but several electoral wards like 194, 199 and 198 in central Mumbai have over 60,000 population. There should be a uniform population across all 236 wards. A 10% difference is fine, but in some wards the population is 20% above or below average,” he added. Pednekar concurred: “Only if the average number of voters in each electoral ward is 50,000 will work get done...else it becomes physically impossible for the corporator to cater to 65,000 people... there has to be a readjustment of boundaries to end this current disparity in population in wards.” According to civic officials, five wards may be added in the western suburbs and four in the eastern suburbs. There could, however, be a readjustment in ward boundaries and population in the island city, they added. The last time electoral wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. After the 2011 census came out, the BMC had redrawn electoral wards to account for a rise in population in the suburbs and a decline in the island city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mayor-in-2017-electoral-wards-split-boundaries-tweaked-for-political-gain-in-mumbai/articleshow/87745424.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Madurai||13th century stone inscription found in Madurai||MADURAI: A thirteenth century stone inscription pertaining to the later Pandiya period was found near a dilapidated Siva temple at Pothanathi, a village near T. Kallupatti in Madurai. The message on it speaks about a donation of land made to the temple, identified as Thiruvalavudayar Siva temple, to ensure that a lamp (sandhya deepam) was kept burning in it. The discovery of the stone was conveyed by panchayat president Vinayaga Moorthi to the coordinator of Pandiya Naadu Panpaatu Maiyam D Muneeswaran. The two of them along with with Meneeswaran’s team including Anandha Kumaran and Karupasamy inspected the inscription which they estimated belongs to the period of the first Maravarman Sundarapandiyan (1216-1239 AD). Muneeswaran said that a chieftain named Pothan had ruled the area which came under Sengudi Naadu on the banks of Kausika river and was under the control of Madhavela Nayakanur. The Siva temple, near Pothan Oorani, has a sanctum sanctorum tower and a mandap in the front but is badly damaged. The tower and the sculptures of the temple constructed using bricks are badly damaged. The sanctum sanctorum is square and faces east while the front mandap has sculptures of man and female in worshipping positions. The pillars have flowers and buds sculpted on them. The 3-foot-tall and 2-foot-wide stone has 8 lines inscribed on it. The message on the inscription was deciphered with the help of senior epigraphist Santhalingam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/13thc-stone-inscription-found-in-madurai/articleshow/87745408.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan directed the DSP to complete the investigation as expeditiously as possible and directed the police to ensure the protection of the petitioner, K Villayi, wife of the deceased priest Karuppaiya, and her family. In her petition, Villayi stated that her husband was working as a priest of the Aathi Marathal Munodiyan Kali temple in the village. On June 16, Karuppaiya was allegedly assaulted by a group of people belonging to the other community as he had touched their hand while handing over ‘vibuthi’ (holy ash). They had also abused him for not using the ‘archanai plate’ for handing over the vibuthi. Following this incident, her husband lodged a complaint with the police. Though an FIR was registered, no action was taken against them. Based on a false complaint, a counter case was registered against Karuppaiya. Alleging that her husband was murdered due to caste animosity and it was made to look like a suicide, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking CB-CID probe and also sought to perform a re-postmortem as several injuries were found in his body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dsp-to-probe-death-of-temple-priest/articleshow/87745406.cms||---

---||Nagpur||MCA yet to de-flag DIN, but Mehadia re-elected as president of NVCC||Nagpur: The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) is yet to de-flag the director identification number (DIN) of Ashwin Prakash Mehadia, which is mandatory for becoming a director in any company registered under Companies Act 2013. However, Mehadia was still re-elected as president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), apex body of 13 lakh traders of the region. Mehadia was elected president of NVCC in the 77th annual general meeting of NVCC held a day ago. This is the third consecutive time he has been elected as president of NVCC. TOI had on October 30 highlighted that Mehadia was elected and worked as president of NVCC for two years despite even though his DIN was under disqualification. His DIN 0291003 was under disqualification from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2021. The MCA website showed on Tuesday his DIN is still under disqualification. MCA has displayed a public notice on its website. The public notice reads, “MCA had flagged DINs of directors found to be disqualified under sub-section 2 (a) of section 164 of the Companies Act-2013 with effect from November 2016 for a period of five years. This is for the information of all the concerned that DINs eligible to be de-flagged on expiry of the period of disqualification are in the process of verification. Necessary action shall be taken shortly.” A company secretary said, “MCA website did not accept form for directorship of Mehadia on Tuesday for some technical reasons. He is yet to become director.” As per articles of associations of NVCC, the board of directors (BoD) shall manage the business of the company (NVCC). The BoD shall consist of president and nine more posts. Advocate Anil Kumar Mulchandani said, “Any member should first become director and then get elected as president as per articles of associations of NVCC. Mehadia is yet to become director as MCA will not accept the form till DIN is de-flagged. When he is not a director, electing him as president itself is illegal.” Asked for a comment, Mehadia sent to TOI the same public notice posted on MCA website. “I lodged a complaint with MCA on November 1 and received a reply. MCA also displayed similar notice on its website on November 10. Now, there is no issue regarding my DIN. Therefore, I am becoming director today itself,” he said. One of his advisors said, “Mehadia’s disqualification period has come to an end. Therefore, now he is eligible to become director. But for some technical reasons, the process of de-flagging is yet to be completed and also the process of becoming director is pending,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mca-yet-to-de-flag-din-but-mehadia-re-elected-as-president-of-nvcc/articleshow/87745343.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In his written objection to the registrar, Prof Singh said that for the meetings scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday, he was informed through a letter sent as a message on WhatsApp on Sunday evening, instead of being informed 15 days in advance as per rules. This, he said, was violation of university statutes, hence he could not attend the meeting and suggested rescheduling it with a proper time frame. On similar grounds, dean arts Prof Shashi Shukla had submitted a note of dissent in the meetings on Saturday and Sunday for promotions in five departments under arts faculty. Denying the allegations, LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “The deans of science and arts faculties were informed via letter and not on WhatsApp. They had taken part in guest faculty and contractual appointments held two weeks ago under a similar situation.” In fact, he added, 81 teachers were promoted about 10 months ago through selection committees and everyone in LU had then turned up at short notice. “The selections are being done as per university statues. The rule to inform 15 days in advance existed earlier, which has been amended following a government order dated October 15, 2019. This has no time-frame binding,” said. A selection committee is chaired by the vice-chancellor and comprises three experts, besides head and dean of the department and faculty concer ned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-profs-object-to-appointment-process/articleshow/87746142.cms||---

On April 2, 2004, the MLA during an election campaigning near Chandrayangutta allegedly made an inflammatory speech, prompting the Chandrayangutta police to take a suo-moto action and the then sub-inspector of police Ashok Kumar filed a complaint against Owaisi saying that he tried to instigate the public. A case in Cr.No. 77/2004 under section 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) 1860 and Representation of Peoples Act 1951 was registered. Later in 2010, the then AP state law department (director of prosecution) granted its nod to prosecute Akbaruddin Owaisi in the hate speech case of 2004. The Hyderabad city police on June 26,2004 sought permission from the government to prosecute Akbaruddin Owaisi. It is mandatory for the investigating agency to obtain prior permission from the government to prosecute any person booked under 153(A) sections.

Demanding that the minister be sacked, Fernandes wondered why chief minister Pramod Sawant was quiet on the development. “We were hoping the chief minister would react to this, but there is no reaction from him. Why is he quiet? Is BJP being run by the narco-money?” Fernandes was speaking to reporters in the presence of former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira. Fernandes said that from the statement made by Paliencar on Sunday, it was clear that he is referring to ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo. “This is a serious allegation. We expect the chief minister to sack him immediately and conduct an inquiry,” he said. Fernandes also slammed his own Congress functionaries for considering admitting Lobo in the party. “I would like to ask our party functionaries if they are in talks with him. We strongly object to this. I will write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and others that this is what is happening. Some of our party members are not giving the high command a clear picture,” he said. He said he will also be writing to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-demands-probe-into-paliencars-pablo-escobar-allegations-against-bjp-min/articleshow/87746175.cms||---

He also sought a CBI inquiry into the entire episode of December 6, 2019. Krishnamachary, who is representing the relatives of the four encounter victims, Md Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, started the oral arguments on Tuesday after the completion of depositions by witnesses summoned by the panel. Accusing the cops of illegally arresting the four accused, the counsel for the families said that the cops had bypassed laid-down procedures and also suppressed the juvenile status of three of them. Questioning the police claim of keeping the accused in a safe house, he said: “The safe house story is false. The four were detained at Shadnagar PS.” The advocate dubbed the entire police story of the day of the alleged encounter as cooked up. He said that police claims of injuries, weapons being snatching by the accused, firing by police party in the direction of sound and recovery of Disha’s articles from the encounter site were all fake. Krishnamachary said that the police claim of accused throwing soil in their eyes was also bogus as the field was covered with grass. “The 10 police personnel involved in the encounter are eligible for prosecution and the entire thing was planned by VC Sajjanar. I request the inquiry commission to recommend criminal proceedings against the police persons involved in the incident, CBI inquiry and departmental action,” Krishnamachary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-encounter-story-is-fake-only-cbi-probe-can-unravel-dec-6-events/articleshow/87745450.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Pune||MSEDCL offers to waive up to Rs 4,000 crore dues for 12L farmers||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) is offering a waiver amounting to Rs4,000 crore on pending agricultural pump electricity bills to farmers in Western Maharashtra. According to a statement issued by the power distribution company, the farmers across western Maharashtra owe a total of Rs8,007 crore on current power bills. If these farmers clear their unpaid bills, they will be given a 50% rebate, leading to the rebate to amount to a total of Rs4,003 crore. Meanwhile, as many as 5.52 lakh farmers in Western Maharashtra have availed the benefit of the amnesty scheme to clear their power dues for agricultural pumps. These farmers have paid a total of Rs359 crore on current bills and Rs409 crore on past dues. According to the MSEDCL statement, farmers from the Baramati circle topped the bill repayment with 3.76 lakh settling their dues, while from the Kolhapur circle 1.42 lakh farmers have settled dues. The Pune circle has recorded a low response with only 32,683 farmers coming forward to settle their dues. TOI had earlier reported that 51,529 farmers in MSEDCL's Aurangabad zone have availed the benefit of the amnesty scheme. The defaulter farmers have together paid Rs 9.42 crores towards their current and outstanding dues. The MSEDCL said it is reeling under tremendous financial strain and appealed to the farmers to clear their pending power dues at the earliest. It warned that the power connections of those who fail to clear their bills on time will be snapped. As part of the new agriculture pump policy announced on December 18, 2020, interest and delayed payment charges on power dues towards agriculture pumps have been waived. Under the scheme, farmers can get a rebate of up to 66% on past dues depending on how they choose to clear the arrears. According to an MSEDCL statement, agricultural pump consumers paying arrears in the first year will be given a 50% discount on revised basic arrears, and interest and delay charges will be waived, which eventually means the consumers who clear all arrears in the first year will get a 66% discount. Those who pay arrears in two years will get a 30% rebate on revised principal arrears and those who pay arrears in three years will get a 20% discount. Of the amount paid under the agricultural police 2020, 33% will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in the gram panchayat areas of the consumers. Another 33% will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in the respective districts. The MSEDCL has also said that farmers can find out about their arrears towards agricultural pump dues by visiting the closest office or entering their consumer number on the power utility’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-offers-to-waive-up-to-rs-4000cr-dues-for-12l-farmers/articleshow/87745455.cms||---

The state transportation has a strength of 92,266 employees, of which 84,643 have still struck work, shows official data. By Tuesday afternoon, different MSRTC depots across Maharashtra could witness operations of 23 buses, which commuted total 282 passengers. It included 3 Shivshahi buses on Aurangabad-Pune route with occupancy of 131 passengers. MSRTC spokesperson said state transport minister Anil Parab has already expressed willingness to consider the proposal for offering salaries to the employees on a par with the employees of the state government. “As asked by the judiciary, a panel has already been formed to look into the demand for merger of MSRTC into the government. The employees are requested to join work for the benefit of passengers, who are facing huge inconvenience,” the spokesperson said. The MSRTC strike started amid partial response from Marathwada and Vidarbha since October 27. The agitation later evoked cent per cent response by end of Diwali, causing inconvenience to the public during the festive season. A leader of one of the workers unions said more MSRTC staff was expected to rejoin work in next few days. “The employees are agitating for a period of more than fortnight now. While the government is adopting time-killing tactic to end the strike, staffers are losing their patience. Some suspensions handed out during the strike has also caused some effect,” he said. Notably, MSRTC had incurred Rs 400 crore monthly losses throughout the pandemic, which further afflicted its already weak financial condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/8-msrtc-employees-back-at-work-in-state/articleshow/87743825.cms||---

Due to the brutality, her genitalia was damaged which resulted in infection. On Tuesday, the pain and infection eased due to antibiotic medication. She was put under anaesthesia for proper assessment of her injuries to see if a reconstructive surgery was required. “We have cleaned the infection and managed the tear for now. Antibiotics and painkillers have given some respite. She does not need corrective surgery as of now. We will keep her under observation for a couple of days and will follow up her condition after discharge. It appears she may not need reconstructive surgery even in future,” said Dr JD Rawat. Meanwhile, medical staff, patients and their attendants prayed for the speedy recovery of the infant. Police had arrested the accused on Monday and is collecting evidence. A case under charges of rape, sexual assault has been registered and he has been booked under the stringent POCSO Act. “We have taken up this case on priority. We will file the chargesheet in two weeks and ensure conviction and maximum punishment at its earliest,” SHO, Saadatganj, Brijesh Kumar Yadav. In another case where a six-year old girl was raped in Saadatganj, police said the accused had been sent to jail and chargesheet against him would be filed within two weeks.

The complainant had initially reported the matter to the cyber police for verification following which the Chikhli police registered a formal FIR on Monday. Police said during chats, the ‘NRI woman’ told the complainant that she wanted to visit India. Later, another woman called and represented herself as customs official. She told the complainant that his `NRI friend’ had been detained at the Delhi airport with a substantial amount of UK Pound Sterling and need to pay the charges and fines for the same. Following talks with the two women, the complainant made three transfers to the accounts given by them, but when they asked for more, he sensed something fishy and approached the police. Cybercrime cell’s investigating officer and assistant inspector Pramila Kshirsagar told TOI, “While working from home during the pandemic, the complainant had serious differences with his wife, and they decided to separate. He registered himself with a matrimonial website for divorcees. In July, the `NRI woman’ contacted him and evinced interest in his profile.” The officer said that in total, the complainant transferred Rs14.32lakh to the fraudsters. Kshirsagar said that the probe has so far revealed that the amount was transferred to three bank accounts in New Delhi. “We have obtained the details of the account holders. Our probe is on,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nri-woman-dupes-techie-of-rs-14l-in-matrimony-fraud/articleshow/87745472.cms||Mihir Tanksale

A colony comprising about 30 houses, this pocket has, over time, come to become synonymous with the sewage issue."Even cab drivers identify the location as the place that has drain water running through its road; that's how grave the problem is.  The drain nearby is blocked with garbage and the excess water runs right onto the road outside our homes," said the citizen journalist who aired the grievance through the TOI app.  He added: "Over the last many years, we have voted to power representatives from various parties, reached out to multiple civic authorities, submitted representations with all concerned officials, but nothing has yielded any result." Locals in the area say that the stench from the sewage overflow has become unbearable and is even leading to health issues now. "Only recently, a neighbour died of dengue. Officials visited the area then and did some temporary work, but the problem resurfaced shortly after that. It is about time that the problem is fixed for good and residents are allowed to live a hygienic life," Sambodhi added. When TOI reached out to water board officials, they claimed that the L Shankar Nagar project has been cleared and will be rolled out soon. "We have already got a sanction of about Rs 15 lakh for the work. We will change the entire pipeline there very soon," said Ramana Reddy, general manager, HMWS&SB, Marredpally division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/marredpally-resident-fights-for-a-clean-road/articleshow/87745486.cms||---

---||Kolkata||For many second-year students, it’s the first taste of life on campus||Kolkata: Cooped up in their homes for almost two years, college for two batches of undergraduate students had so far meant lectures on smart devices. On Tuesday, those allowed in-person classes, stepped into their college and university campuses for the first time, sat in real classrooms and met their classmates they had only seen online. Rohit Roy, a first-year post-graduate geography student at Presidency University, who had lost both his legs to polio, did not want to wait til hostel accommodation to visit the campus. On the first day of reopening, his mother, Reba, steered him into the campus in his wheelchair for his practical classes. The mother and son, residents of Nabadwip, took a train and then a bus to the university. “He has applied for hostel. We wanted to waited till he got one, but he was so eager to visit the university that I had to bring him,” said Reba. At another end of the Presidency campus, Tisha Haldar, a second-year sociology student, was seen chatting with her classmate, Ankita Sarkar. Though it was their first visit to the university, the two had bonded in online classes. Like all their classmates, the two were elated when told their semester could go in for in-person classes. They did not even dither over whether to go or not. “This is my first day on the campus. Today, I visited to see Presidency and feel the legacy of the building. I have visited all the classrooms and every corner of the campus,” said Tisha. Her friend, Ankita, said, “We have been attending online classes for more than a year. We have been communicating over phone and social media but today, we met each other. I’m super excited.” The curiosity of how her college looked like could not keep Vidyasagar College first-year student, Piyali Dey, away though she was not scheduled to visit. “We’ve not been instructed to come to the campus but I wanted to have a look at the college building from outside,” she said. It was also the first day for Manisha Dutta, a zoology third-semester student at Scottish Church College. After her practical classes, she said, “Finally, I was able to touch the laboratory instruments and look down the microscope. I am so excited that I can’t explain in words.” Gargi Naskar, a Bengali first-year PG student at Bethune College, was in two minds initially. She was torn between her urge to visit the campus and the fear of the novel coronavirus and at the end, “college life” won. “I am elated to see the campus and meet new friends. I have taken admission to post-graduation. However, I am a little anxious because I have got only one dose of the Covid vaccine.” Swapna Roy stood outside Bethune College as her daughter stepped into the college for the first time. “Her excitement also rubbed off on me. But I wanted to be very cautious, so accompanied her the first day,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-many-second-year-students-its-the-first-taste-of-life-on-campus/articleshow/87745477.cms||---

The BJP government has jeopardised national security, the interests of the Indian Air Force and caused loss worth thousands of crores of rupees,” alleged Pawan Khera at a media conference in Hyderabad. Despite the fact that two former union ministers submitted documents to the CBI revealing corruption in the Rafale aircraft deal, the Modi-government has remained silent on it for the past three years, he alleged. The AICC leader demanded an independent investigation to bring out the truth. “While the previous UPA government had negotiated the price of a Rafale fighter aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526 crore through a tender, the Modi-government purchased the same without a tender and without a clause for transfer of technology for Rs 1,670 crore. This has led India paying up an additional Rs 41,205 crore towards purchase of 36 fighter aircraft,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-scared-of-ordering-probe-into-corruption-charges-in-rafale-deal/articleshow/87746173.cms||---

Ruling on the PIL filed by Howrah resident Ajay Dey, division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastav and Justice Rajarhi Bharadwaj directed the state to ensure that Covid SOPs are followed during celebration of all festivals in future. The state pollution control board had announced a window of 35 minutes from 11.55pm to 12.30am for bursting of environment-friendly crackers during Christmas and New Year. The Calcutta HC had earlier banned the bursting of all crackers but the Supreme Court subsequently reversed the order, by saying only green crackers could be used during the celebration. Last year, the Park Street Carnival was held with 50% seating capacity but food stalls were not allowed inside Allen Park. This year’s carnival is still in the works. The first meeting has happened but choirs and programmes are yet to be lined up. “There will be music but celebrations might have to be low key if the HC orders so. Crowding will definitely not be allowed,” said Fr Dominic Gomes, vicar-general of the Archdiocese of Kolkata, a key member of the Carnival planning committee. Last year. midnight mass did not happen and mass had to be completed by 8pm at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary of the Roman Catholic Church. “The CM had attended it. We are in the process of planning this year’s mass and will abide by the court’s directives,” Fr Gomes said. At St Paul’s Cathedral, 50% seating capacity was followed for the Christmas Eve mass last year. This year’s plan is yet to be firmed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/follow-covid-rules-on-christmas-new-yr-hc/articleshow/87745488.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: KGMU strike hits patient care, many forced to return||LUCKNOW: Patient care services in the out patient department (OPD) were impacted at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) on Tuesday after the university employees went on an indefinite strike demanding higher pay scale. After holding talks, the strike has been put on hold for a month. While several patients had to return without consultation even after taking an appointment weeks in advance, the university claimed no surgeries were affected and patients were taken care of in the OPD. After the day-long strike, the employees and KGMU administration held a meeting on Tuesday evening following which the employees decided to hold off their protest for the next one month based on assurances made on the day. KGMU employees, under the leadership of their association president Pradeep Gangwar, have been demanding pay scales at par with their counterparts in SGPGI. In a letter by the directorate of medical education (DGME) to KGMU registrar on the day it was conveyed that cadre restructure of KGMU employees is in process at the government level. “Against the university’s list of 42 cadres, government order has been received for two cadres. The status of restructuring 14 other cadres is in the final stages which will be completed in the next one month. The process to expedite decisions on the remaining cadres is also being tried,” the DGME’s letter read. The day’s protest became a huge problem for several patients who had come to KGMU from far and wide, many of whom had to return without getting any consultation. Jitendra Pratap Singh, who came from Rae Bareli to get a consultation in the neurology department OPD, said, “I made an appointment two weeks ago. Now I am being told that OPD is not functional. I am at a crossroad now not knowing what to do,” he rued. Similarly, Keshav Chandra from Gorakhpur said, “I had to wait for three hours to get my registration done to consult with doctors, but there was nobody at the counter to start the process. I had traveled with great difficulty on Tuesday and had to return without any respite with an aggravated abdominal pain. No one heard my requests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-strike-hits-patient-care-many-forced-to-return/articleshow/87746187.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA govt anti-Hindu, backs crime, criminals, graft, says BJP||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government is “anti-Hindu and against ‘Maharashtra dharma,’” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar in his resolution on criminalisation of politics in the state at the BJP’s state executive committee meeting held in Dadar on Tuesday. “Sharjeel Usmani receives red-carpet treatment while charges levelled against Mehek Prabhu for raising boards reading ‘Azad Kashmir’ are withdrawn,” he said, adding people are banned from celebrating festivals like Dahi Handi and Ganeshotsav and ‘varkaris’ are stopped from going to Pandharpur. “Things concerning Ram Mandir and its subscription are being ridiculed. Hence we believe that Hindus are not safe in Maharashtra, and neither is Maharashtra dharma.” The resolution was passed along with that on the political situation in the state and another appalauding PM Modi. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil called for a ban on Raza Academy for being the “mastermind” behind Friday’s riots in Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon. “Following rumours of an incident which never happened in Tripura, riots took place in Malegaon, Amravati and Nanded in which mobs took to the streets and attacked the police. Following this, spontaneous reactions emerged from Hindus, for which BJP was accused,” he said. BJP state in-charge and national general secretary C T Ravi said Hindus were being persecuted in the land of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray under the MVA government. “The ruling party has left Hindutva and has become a ‘parivar’ party. They are working for the development of their families at the cost of Maharashtra,” he said. Terming Uddhav Thackeray as “a part-time CM,” Ravi demanded the government dissolve the assembly and hold elections. “BJP will emerge victorious,” he said. Former finance minister Sudhir Mungatiwar moved the resolution on the current political situation in the state, highlighting “the increase in incidents of extortion, rape, payment for transfers/posts, corruption and support to drugs.” The committee also approved the party’s support to the strike by state transport workers and their demands. The resolution on criminalisation of politics highlighted the state government’s “support initially to crimes and later criminals followed by terrorism, separatists and now anarchists.” Citing an instance of support to crime and criminals, the resolution highlighted the attack on a police personnel in Amravati, the accused person’s conviction and the government’s refusal to demand his resignation from the cabinet. Shelar said complainants, witnesses, officers are unsafe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-govt-anti-hindu-backs-crime-criminals-graft-in-mumbai-bjp/articleshow/87746768.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: VAT on petrol cut by Rs 4, diesel Rs 5 from today||JAIPUR: In a major relief for citizens reeling under inflation, the state cabinet which met on Tuesday decided to reduce VAT by Rs 4 per litre on petrol and Rs 5 on diesel. The decision will come into effect on Wednesday and cost the state exchequer Rs 3,500 crore. Effectively, VAT on petrol will decline by 4.96% to 31.04% from 36% and on diesel the state tax will drop by 6.7% to 19.30% from 26%. For consumers, petrol prices will come down from Rs 111.10 a litre to 107.10 and diesel price will fall to Rs 90.71 from Rs 95.71 a litre as per Tuesday's prices. Despite a possible loss of Rs 1,800 crore to the state's revenue due to the reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel by the central government, the cabinet took this decision keeping public interest in mind, said a government statement. Due to the continuous increase in prices of petrol and diesel by petroleum companies, the relief given by the central and state governments to the common man has been diminishing, the meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, noted. The central government had consistently reduced the basic excise duty on auto fuels from 2016 as well as its share from the divisible pool shared with states. Due to this, the share of the states has come down. The special and additional excise duty has, meanwhile, been increased continuously. But the states do not get any share of this. This move by the Centre is against the spirit of financial federalism, said the meeting. Following the Covid lockdown on May 6, 2020, the central government had increased the excise duty on petrol by Rs 10/L and diesel by Rs 13. This year also the price of petrol has increased by about Rs 27 and diesel by about Rs 25. The Centre recently announced a relief on petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10 by reducing excise duty. This reduction in excise duty by the Centre is insufficient and the public will not get permanent relief from it, the meeting said. It noted that the excise duty increased by the Centre during the Covid period has been reduced significantly, while the VAT increased by the state government has almost come back to the pre-corona period. It was also informed that VAT on petrol and diesel accounts for more than 22% of the state's total tax revenue. Due to the global pandemic, there has been a huge reduction in the revenue of the state by Rs 20,000 crore till the month of October in the current financial year. The non reimbursement of Rs 5,963 crore by the Centre to Rajasthan has also resulted in the huge revenue deficit. The cabinet said that in order to give real relief to the common folk, it was necessary that the central government should reduce the additional excise duty and basic excise duty going to the central pool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/vat-on-petrol-cut-by-rs-4diesel-rs-5-from-today/articleshow/87753467.cms||---

---||Kolkata||The second coming: Seniors set foot on college ground after counting time for 20 months||Kolkata: Saptarshi Roy had just started his third-semester classes in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out and his college was shut down. His professors had assured of reopening shortly but the possibility seemed to grow fainter as Covid cases grew and stricter restrictions were imposed. When the second wave struck, Saptarshi gave up all hopes of returning to the campus ever as he was also nearing the end of his college life. On Tuesday, it seemed too good to be true when he saw the familiar faces of his professors and met his friends after the Covid hiatus. TimesViewBoth schools and colleges may need to tweak a few things after the first day's experience. There would have been a little bit of chaos on campuses — plus a lot of euphoria and some amount of wariness — but the focus must be on Covid-safety measures so that there is no spike. Bringing back those who have not yet been able to return to campus should be the ultimate aim.Priyanka Dastidar, a sixth-semester student, had reconciled to the fact that she might graduate without going back to her college again. During their chats online, Priyanka and her friends would often make plans of meeting outside the campus, given the bleak chances of institutes reopening amid the pandemic. It was a huge surprise when she received the first message of the possibility of campuses reopening. Shortly, she received a series of reopening messages, rekindling her hope of returning to the campus. Saptarshi and Priyanka are not alone. Several thousands of students, who had assumed that they would finish their college without being able to go back, were thrilled to meet their professors and friends again on Tuesday. Bhaswar Haldar, a history honours student at Presidency University, was in his last UG semester when campuses shut down. “Now, I have reached the last year of PG. I was certain I would have to complete my PG online because there was no sign of educational institutes reopening. I have only a few months left but something is better than nothing,” Bhswar said. His apprehension was not unfounded as some students had to make do with online farewells. Even now, several institutes have not called junior students to the campus. Those in senior classes and those with lab-based subjects have been given the priority. Some may not call first- and second-semesters to the campus before January. “When our seniors passed out, we thought even we would not be able to return to college. Thankfully, colleges have reopened. But we will have to be careful as any spike in Covid cases may lead to another closure,” said Neha Singh, a Jaipuria college student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-second-coming-seniors-set-foot-on-college-ground-after-counting-time-for-20-months/articleshow/87745490.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Though I come from a family of non-musicians, I have always been a music lover. I grew up listening to soft music along with classical. I have even pursued classes till my 10th grade. But as time passed by and other responsibilities took priority over this passion, this passion for music took a back seat. Somewhere deep down in my heart, though, the disappointment for not being able to devote time for the sacred art always haunted me. With the pandemic things have changed as people have started working from home, are able to take up new hobbies, revisit old hobbies etc. And that’s true for me as well. I have joined my music classes back over the weekend and I cannot express how happy I am. What makes me happier is that my aptitude has been inherited by my elder son and he too has started taking music classes and being appreciated by friends and family. I am now hoping that this continuity will last. (The writer is an IT company employee) Poetry marathon sharpened my pen By Bhanu Sree Since I was a student of literature, poetry has been on my mind since my college days. But I never really got the opportunity to pursue it with all sincerity. In the chronicles of time, life had become a river meandering its way with its flow. However, the recent pandemic abruptly stilled life and brought everything to a grinding halt. Suddenly there came a huge lull in my otherwise busy routine. Initially it felt a little insane as to what to do with the time in abundance at hand. There was nowhere to go and nothing much to do. Eat, read and sleep is all I could do. At first, I felt if eating is all I can do then let me whip out some new dishes. So, I turned to YouTube and it became my teacher and the kitchen my experimental lab. From cakes to Dalgona coffee, exotic starters to haleem, I tried my hand at everything. Some were hits and some very flops. The hits found their way to my social network spaces and the flops went to the dustbin along with frowns from my husband and kids. However, soon it felt tiring and not satisfying enough. This was when I casually penned a poem titled 'Being Me', a poem on me in specific and women in general. I casually shared it with my friend who appreciated it and instantly invited me to join her poetry club. This was enough to bring out the poet in me and it soon turned into a passion. So much so that I even took part in the poetry marathon penning a poem for eight continuous days. I now have 100 poems to my credit on different subjects like art, nature, human emotions, learning disability, child abuse, child labour, beggary etc. I feel writing itself is a beautiful medium to express your inner self and poetry is even more beautiful and creative too. It contributes to self-awareness and has a therapeutic effect. Presently, even as life has got back to normal again, I keep penning poems to destress myself.

What’s driving fans crazy is ‘Hitman’s’ debut in Jaipur on Wednesday as the full-time T20I India captain. The first match of the India-New Zealand series is a sold out show, and it is Rohit Sharma ruling the box office at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium. Rested for the T20 series, Virat Kohli, the first Asian celebrity to reach 150 million followers on Instagram, may have several million followers more than Rohit, but the latter is a blockbuster player with more power to attract crowds into the stadium, fans feel. “I have bought the tickets to watch Rohit. Look at his range of shots and daring game, I want to see that live at the stadium. But what makes the occasion more special is that we will get to see him leading the side wearing the India jersey as a full-time skipper,” said Sarthak, a Class XI student. Standing next to him in the queue for the tickets, Sambhav Sharma was quick to react with, “of course Rohit for me as well”. “In T20s who else? I hope I will get to see an entertaining innings from the new captain,” he added. The last time the dashing India opener played here in India colours was in 2013. He lit up the stage with an unbeaten 141 off 123 balls in an ODI match against Australia. This piece of stats adds up to the build up. The small merchandise vendor outside the stadium confirms that it is Rohit’s jersey that has maximum demand. “Everyone asks for the captain’s t-shirt. Since other players are not in as much demand, I got more Rohit jerseys today to make sure I don’t run out of stock,” said Promod Jat. The fact that an international match is being played here after eight years has also driven the ticket sales up. “It is huge for us that we finally get to see an international game in Jaipur. It is a great stadium where MS Dhoni has scored 183. I hope more matches come here and we get to witness such special knocks,” said Jaipur resident Anuraj S Dhankar. Cricket enthusiasts and those from the fraternity feel that in the IPL they can afford to miss one match and watch another, but an international match is a rare thing that makes it a grand event. Cricket commentator Devender Kumar, who has closely observed state cricket over a decade, feels international action after long years is a sign of good things to follow in future. “The return of international cricket to Jaipur is great news for cricket enthusiasts and players alike after so many years of political infighting. Considering the ground conditions and practice facilities, it's a matter of time before SMS Stadium in Jaipur is granted Test status,” he said. Clearly, the excitement is everywhere!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/captain-hitman-rohit-rules-box-officeas-intl-action-returns-to-sms-stadium/articleshow/87746192.cms||Mandakini Shalya

The clerics have asked for an FIR to be lodged against Rizvi for derogatory remarks and activities against Islam, the Quran and Prophet Mohammad. Rizvi has recently authored a book on the Prophet which has brought the ire of the clergy and members of the Muslim community. Several protests have been held and statements have been made against Rizvi across the state and country for allegedly fabricating stories about the Prophet, spewing insults and making unacceptable remarks against the Islamic personalities. Jawad also sought a ban on the publication of Rizvi’s book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/clerics-submit-plaint-against-waseem-rizvi/articleshow/87746194.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Eggs, non-veg off street menu despite ‘clarification’||AHMEDABAD: One day after the civic body’s town planning committee announced a “massive drive” against non-vegetarian street food in Ahmedabad, the BJP leadership on Tuesday clarified that the drive should not be “misconstrued” as targeting “non-vegeterian food” but it would be against those encroaching on footpaths and constricting thoroughfares. Despite the assurances, many food carts selling egg and meat items remained off the streets in Ahmedabad to avoid confrontations. At places like Rambaug Crossroads, LG Corner, and Nathalal Jhagada Bridge, five illegal carts were removed while 12 carts were removed from Anandnagar Road, Corporate Road, Jodhpur, Isckon Circle and from near YMCA Club in the South West Zone by estate department teams. Some 30 carts were removed from Ashram Road. While in some places, egg vending carts at Law Garden kept doing business as they have contracted the space from the AMC itself. The AMC’s estate department in its press release did not differentiate between vegetarian and non-vegetarian. When told that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was closing non-vegetarian eateries, Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil said, “They (AMC) must not have been removed over the issue of veg or non veg. There must be some other reason. They must be operating from footpaths and must have been asked to find another place.” Paatil clarified after CM Bhupendra Patel on Monday evening said at a function in Anand, “People can eat vegetarian or non-vegetarian food. The state government has no objection whatsoever in this matter.” However, senior AMC officials were skeptical about the drive as many vendors were being enrolled under the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Yojana for providing affordable loans of Rs 10,000 to street vendors to re-start their businesses that had been adversely affected due to the lockdown. “We faced problems as many of the vendors we had enrolled were evicted. This is creating confusion. Also many vendors are eligible under the Street Vendors Act. There were many conflicting issues in the whole drive itself. The premise that such food carts can be removed from near schools and colleges did not stand as most non-vegetarian joints operate in the evenings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eggs-non-veg-off-street-menu-despite-clarification/articleshow/87745509.cms||---

---||Delhi||Make it large: Delhi restaurants cheer new policy||NEW DELHI: As the new excise policy comes into effect, every restaurant messaging group is abuzz with talk about the ease of getting liquor licence, permissions to use open areas in eateries, regularised licence fees based on area rather than seats, serving alcohol in bottle at the table and operating till 3am and eventually reducing drinking age to 21 years. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has held multiple meetings with various authorities about the industry's concerns, and its past and incumbent president have termed the new policy as “pathbreaking”. With the new policy having a clause reducing the number of dry days as in Haryana, Punjab and UP, the city’s restaurants can serve alcohol after 5pm even on Republic Day and Independence Day. Permission to transfer the liquor licence to another company on the same premises and allowing 5-star hotels to serve alcohol all 24 hours have also been welcomed. With the new policy coming into effect from Wednesday, NRAI hosted a virtual session with restaurateurs to inform them of what to expect when migrating to the new excise regime. Restaurateur Rahul Singh of Beer Café said the new policy would mean more liquor retailers spread evenly across the city rather than being clustered in some pockets. He said the policy also inspired the opening of premium liquor stores that would bring in more brands to the city. Singh added that with no compulsion on restaurants to buy from select people or in a particular quantity, eateries can now buy from local liquor vendors — even a single bottle if needed rather than in bulk as earlier. This, he said, would enable smaller establishments to improve their offerings. Getting an excise licence has also become easier and quicker. "With its huge population, Delhi only has 516 licensed places serving alcohol,” said Singh. “Under the new policy, within a year the city can have over 2,000.” Restaurateurs were of the view that proper implementation of the new policy would lead to bars staying open till late and more people drinking at safe and licensed spots. Bar owners also rejoiced at having nothing more to do with a daily licence to host events in the open with a flat annual fee now. However, many restaurateurs and bar owners have faced problems in registering for licences and getting new challans issued online. Many other things also remain unclarified, such when the date from when they can remain open till 3am. They also are unsure if they can procure liquor from anywhere in the city or whether it has to be from a seller in their particular zone. Also, with only 250-odd new shops of the newly licensed 850 opening initially, availability of liquor would be hit across the city. A restaurateur noted too that the new tax regime will cause the prices on the menu to rise. Khan Market restaurateurs who did not have fire-safe certification and for which some of them were involved in litigation, weren’t able to procure new licences. They hope for clarification on the issue from the authorities at the earliest. One lingering concern was about the reduction of drinking age to 21. The matter is sub-judice. Since only provisional licences are being issued right now, with the final dependent on site inspections by officials, most business owners desired clear timelines rather than be at the mercy of officials during the festive season. Sanjeev Goyal of Essex Farms has been in touch with various departments and will update fellow restaurateurs on the legalities and developments to aid them transition to new policy with ease. Both Singh and Goyal said disruptions were normal during policy changes and said things were moving very quickly. Licences were being quickly issued and almost 150 brands were already registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-it-large-restaurants-cheer-new-policy/articleshow/87746237.cms||Amin Ali

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad has issued a yellow warning for many parts of Telangana, including Hyderabad, till November 19 as rainfall activity is expected to continue. Under the influence of a low pressure area over south-east Bay of Bengal and adjoining parts of north Andaman sea, the city is likely to witness light to moderate rains over the next two days. Rainfall activity commenced in eastern and southern suburbs of Hyderabad following an overcast day. Areas such as LB Nagar, Malakpet, Hayathnagar, Vanasthalipuram, Saroornagar, Dilsukhnagar, Balapur among others received light showers. Meteorologists predict that active north-east monsoon conditions will prevail over south India, triggering thunderstorms in many parts of Telangana. “A trough is extending from the low-pressure area over east central Arabian Sea to north Odisha across Karnataka Rayalaseema and Telangana. Light to moderate rain may occur over Lakshadweep, remaining parts of Telangana, south Konkan and Goa and Madhya Maharashtra,” stated a weather report issued by Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency. IMD, Hyderabad predicts that the onset of winter is still a few days away as more weather systems are likely to form in the Bay of Bengal. “The onset of winter over Telangana may only occur by the first week of December. For the next few days, mercury levels are expected to be normal or above normal. The temperature will only drop once the northerly winds from Himalayas start penetrating into Telangana,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, IMD, Hyderabad. On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was 28.6 Celsius and minimum temperature was 22.9Celsius — five degrees above normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/light-showers-over-city-winter-still-a-few-wks-away/articleshow/87745305.cms||---

The AQI, which was in the ‘moderate’ category ever since the south-west monsoon weakened, is now at ‘satisfactory.’ AQI levels between 0-50 are categorised as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor, and 401-500 is categorised as severe. According to figures from the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, as of November 12, AQI at Bolarum was 138, University of Hyderabad was 121, ICRISAT was 137, Pashmylaram was 144, Sanathnagar was 182 and Zoo Park was 156. The AQI has now improved to 40 at Bolarum, 44 at University of Hyderabad, 34 at ICRISAT, 76 at Pashmylaram, 32 at Sanathnagar and 79 at Zoo Park. While other cities such as Delhi NCR, Bhopal, Indore, Jaipur, Lucknow are reeling due to ‘severe’ AQI levels, Hyderabad is breathing relatively easy as a result of the change in weather conditions. “Movement of winds is dispersing the pollutants in the air over the city. Therefore, the pollution levels have dropped over the past few days. Once the movement of the winds stops or slows down, the AQI level may climb back to moderate category,” said an official from TSPCB. The air quality index (AQI) has now improved to 40 at Bolarum, 44 at University of Hyderabad, 34 at ICRISAT, 76 at Pashmylaram, 32 at Sanathnagar and 79 at Zoo Park||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-aqi-improves-following-rain-spell/articleshow/87745310.cms||---

It will now be drones that will be taking up the job of inspecting these towers and lines. The Telangana government on Tuesday said the emerging technologies wing of its ITE&C department along with Hyderabad-based startup Centillion Networks has concluded the pilot of an aerial survey of EHT transmission towers & lines using drones and artificial intelligence (AI). In the pilot project, that commenced in August 2020, Centillion Networks’ drones inspected, monitored and patrolled EHT transmission towers, lines, and substations with a 4K resolution camera and AI image recognition system in around 20 minutes. “It is estimated that automated inspections using drones can reduce the man-hours and costs by approximately 50%, in addition to reducing the potential life risk that is posed by manual inspection of high-tension lines,” the state government said, adding that the project is expected to be scaled up soon. Commenting on the development, Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary for IT and industries said, “Telangana is one of the leading states in leveraging drones across various use-cases, and the inspection of towers for TS-TRANSCO is one of the most innovative of them. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-drones-to-survey-high-tension-lines-in-t/articleshow/87745337.cms||---

Even knee-replacement surgery on both legs has not slowed down the spunky septuagenarian. Pande, who is from Malkajgiri, won four medals for Telangana at the first National Veterans Sports & Games Championship held at Nasik, Maharashtra, from November 11-14. He won gold in 30 km cycling and bronze medals in 10 km run, five km run and five km walk. The event had participants from 17 states. A retired employee of the South Central Railways (SCR), Pande’s mantra to stay healthy is simple: Be active. “From very early in life, I was told that those who stay active steer clear of diseases. I have two meals a day and ensure that I keep myself active by not only going for my regular walks but by also engaging myself in household chores,” said Pande. It hasn’t been an easy path to the podium for the gritty senior citizen. In 2016, he had knee replacement surgeries on both legs and was told that his running days were over. Today, the man not only runs but also cycles and walks for long distances. “Since childhood, I have cycled to school, college and even office. I would travel long distances without any hindrance. Cycling was always an integral part of my life. Even today, I cycle every weekend for about 10-20 km,” said Pande, who is also a member of cycling groups in the city. Pande said that while in SCR he was into weight-lifting too. After his medal haul, Pande has no intention of hanging up his boots as yet. Next on his target is the National Master Athletic Association meet in Varanasi on November 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gritty-75-yr-old-cycles-to-gold-after-knee-surgeries/articleshow/87745342.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Chandigarh||‘In reopening, BJP building confidence among Sikhs’||Jalandhar: The reopening of Kartarpur corridor appears to be a confidence-building measure by the central government to reach out to Sikhs, as the community has been sore over the corridor’s closure and the ongoing farm movement has added to the bitterness. For some time, BJP has been projecting the Prime Minister’s relationship with Sikhs and the steps he had taken for the government, but these were not cutting much ice with Sikhs as the corridor was closed even as everything else had already been opened and big political gatherings had already been taking place. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah want that relations between their government and the Sikhs as a community should remain good, and the irritants causing bitterness should be removed. In our meetings, especially with Shah, we have been getting the impression that he and PM were very clear that in what directions their relations with Sikhs should go,” said a senior BJP leader from Punjab. Another BJP leader said a major part of the community was still unhappy with the BJP because of the farm laws and the step to reopen the corridor might not result in any electoral dividends for it in Punjab. “But this would help reduce the bitterness, even if they (Sikhs) do not warm up to the party in these elections,” said the leader. The BJP leader added that though farmers from all communities and from Haryana and western UP had also been participating in the farm movement, Sikh community had contributed heavily to the movement. “The agitation close to completing a year and Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which four Sikh farmers, along with a local journalist, were mowed down by a convoy belonging to the son of a Union minister of BJP had increased the bitterness. Opening corridor was a genuine demand and it can also be a first step towards removing at least one irritant,” the BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-reopening-bjp-building-confidence-among-sikhs/articleshow/87746217.cms||IP Singh

Patel’s whirldwind tour began from Godhra followed by Savli, Lunawada and Vadodara and also addressed four gatherings of party workers in the region on the day. At all places, he addressed sizeable gatherings in the form of ‘Sneh Milan’ events for the Gujarati new year. With such event on a mass scale being an exception, most believe that the BJP is in the election mode already. In his speeches, Patel said that the party workers should aim at winning all 182 seats. “We should look at it with positivity. We do not want to defeat someone, we should aim for winning,” Patel said, adding that the workers had worked hard during the Covid-19 pandemic and remained in the midst of people. “The result of your hard work was seen in local body polls,” he said. Speaking in Vadodara, Patel said that he received such a welcome for the first time after becoming the CM. He said that following the event he had a bigger responsibility towards the city. Patel said that if plans of works in the city were brought to him, he will take them up. “We will make arrangements for such work in the budget too,” said Patel. In Godhra, Patel assured that he would look into the issues of irrigation in the district. Godhra MLA C K Raulji had raised the issue in his speech. He had pointed out that farmers in Panchmahal were able to take only one crop a year. Similarly, Patel promised to look into the need of a dairy cooperative, a industrial estate and railways in Mahisagar district during his speech in Lunawada. The gatherings, however, also sparked resistance. Activist Shwejal Vyas from Vadodara had on Monday threatened to file a suit if Covid guidelines were violated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aim-to-win-all-182-seats-cm-tells-workers/articleshow/87745002.cms||---

Paytm was also told pay Rs 1,000 as costs to the complainant. Vivek Dixit’s ordeal began after he had added Rs 6,865 into his Paytm account on May 8 and May 10, 2018, as payment for an online purchase. Dixit said he initiated the return process as he was not happy with the product and the online firm confirmed that Rs 6,865 was credited back. With no sign of the amount in his wallet, Dixit said he raised multiple requests with Paytm but reached nowhere. After several follow-ups and email/telephonic discussions, Dixit said that a Paytm executive called him and admitted the amount had gone into someone else’s account. The executive claimed it was due to a bug and assured it would be fixed, Dixit said. After waiting for over a year, Dixit filed a complaint with Hyderabad consumer forum-II in September 2019. Paytm in its written version contended that the complainant never availed any services from them with respect to the said transaction. They further added that after receiving the complaint, they had intimated that money was successfully added into a source wallet (But it was a different Paytm account, and not Dixit’s). After going through documentary evidence submitted, the bench said the refund was added to the wallet of one ‘Kancherla Sridhar’. “On hearing the conversations, it is clearly admitted by the opposite party’s executive that the amount was credited to the account of one Kancherla Sridhar, who is in no way related to Vivek Dixit. The opposite party failed to establish its claims and also did not resolve the issue,” said the bench in its verdict on October 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/online-wallet-co-penalised-for-refund-into-wrong-a/c/articleshow/87745291.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Confirming the development, a senior official of the institute said, “We are planning a soft launch by the end of the month.” The surgery block of AIIMS was planned as a separate unit over a decade ago, but the construction took longer than expected. The 200-bed facility has 12 operation theatres and provision for state-of-the-art ICU facilities. Officials said once operational, the new block would help the institute perform more surgeries and it would help reduce the waiting time for critically ill patients requiring surgery. At present, there is a wait time of up to three years for many surgeries at AIIMS, including those for cancer. Earlier, in July this year, AIIMS partially opened the newly constructed mother and child block for the public. It has 400 beds and 12 operation theatres, among other facilities that are dedicated solely for mother and child care. The mother and child block of AIIMS was also conceptualised over a decade ago to decongest the main OPD. In 2014, its foundation stone was laid to start the project. However, due to various factors such as paucity of funds and then the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said, operationalisation of the project got delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-to-open-its-surgery-block-from-november-end/articleshow/87746230.cms||---

Surrounded by sugarcane farm fields, the site saw nearly two lakh farmers witness thundering low fly-pass of jets over their farm fields with bated breath. While the ‘cobra and charlie’ maneuver of the flanker (Su-30 MKI) electrified the air, Balakot Phantoms’ Mirage 2000 bombers left the sky boom with sonic sounds. “TV pe dekha tha Balakot wala Jahaj, aaj gaon me aapni ankho se pehli bar dekha (For the first I saw the jet with my naked eye in the village, it’s the same which was in Balakot),” said 45-year-old Manju, who came from Amrupur village. She along with 150 women and men left their homes in the wee hours to reach Kurebar. The 45-minute air show also showcased special forces paratroopers taking tactical positions on air strips after short landing of AN-32 transport aircraft and Hercules C-130, which brought PM Narendra Modi to 341-km Purvanchal Expressway for inauguration. Kusumlata, who came from Ayodhya with her entire family and village, said, “We came to see Modi. We were told that his aeroplane will land on a newly constructed road (Purvanchal expressway). We have never seen Modi or aeroplane in real life so this was our golden opportunity.” The Uttar Pradesh government had arranged over 2000 buses to gather a massive crowd to witness the inauguration event. Large screens were installed to let the audience watch the live air show and expressway inauguration. Still, thousands of local villagers also climbed atop their houses, and at nearby trees and sat along the service lane to witness the event. “We could never have imagined this (airshow) in our village. There was a time when the public used to demand proper roads to travel, but now jet fighters are landing. Indeed development is reaching in far corners of the state. Now, we hope such infrastructure would help villagers to grow,” said Rajaram Kumar, who was preparing jaggery along with his family members in his farm field located right beside the service lane of expressway where jets were landing. The inauguration event had turned into a fair as well. Many had opened snack stalls and branded their products in the name of Modi, Yogi as well as IAF birds. For instance, Balram sold Rs 10 a glass of Tejas sugarcane juice, while Himmat sold puffed rice with fried gram mixture in the name of ‘double engine’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/spectacular-sight-of-hercules-sukhoi-mirage-thrills-public/articleshow/87746223.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Addressing a felicitation programme held for state teachers in Jaipur, Gehlot asked them if they had to pay money for transfers and the teachers responded with a unanimous “yes”. Gehlot looked at Dotasra, who was sitting on the dias, and reacted by saying that it was bad and promised to bring a concrete transfer policy soon, which the government employees have been demanding for decades. When Gehlot completed his speech, Dotasra rushed to the mike and claimed that he and his staff were clean. “Everyone sitting here knows the fact that I have never accepted one cup of tea. But we need a good transfer policy which will soon be worked out,” said Dotasra. Reacting to the allegation of corruption in transfers, BJP state president Satish Poonia said that corruption had become the basic “etiquette” in the state. "Corruption has become a new normal in the state. The state campaign 'Prashashan Ke Sang' has become 'Prashashan Risthedaro Ke Sang' and doesn't need any proof," said Poonia. He said that Congress MLAs Bharat Singh, Hemaram Choudhary and Deependra Singh Shekhawat were given evidence of corruption many times. Taking a dig at the Gehlot government, former education minister Vasudev Devnani also tweeted that teachers alleging corruption in front of Gehlot showed the true governance in the state. About 99 government teachers were felicitated by the government with a certificate and Rs 21,000 cash prize each. During his speech, Gehlot also said that the establishment of Mahatma Gandhi English medium schools in the state was a revolutionary step in the field of education. With the opening of these schools, the dreams of children of farmers, the poor, and labourers living in villages to study in English medium has come true. The chief minister directed setting up of good faculties in English medium schools and called for quality education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-teachers-allege-bribe-for-transfer-leave-min-red-faced/articleshow/87746211.cms||---

It is conservatively estimated that the sale of at least 100 tonnes of meat is reported in Ahmedabad every single day, say suppliers. “Based on rough sale estimates, one can say that at least 100 tonnes of chicken, 40 tonnes of mutton and seafood is supplied across Ahmedabad every day. Amdavadis also consume an estimated 15 lakh eggs daily,” said Mohammad Farooq, one of the largest suppliers of meat and poultry in the city. “Hotels and restaurants are the largest consumers of meat followed by sale over retail counters. On an average, a given hotel places an order for at least 100-150 kg meat daily. A huge volume of order also comes from street joints and independent caterers who cater at events and weddings,” he added. Even as the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation began cracking the whip to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food on main roads, industry experts say that consumption by local residents has increased over time. “A large volume of meat is consumed across restaurants and the number of such eateries have grown in the city over time,” said hotel and restaurant industry players. “Over the past 8-9 years, at least 500 restaurants selling non-vegetarian food have started in Ahmedabad. With app-based food delivery aggregators, even cloud kitchens preparing and serving non-vegetarian food have come up. These food ventures are doing brisk business driven by Amdavadis as well as migrant population that consume non-vegetarian food. Youths from the city, who travel a lot, are also increasingly open to trying non-vegetarian food and eventually become regular consumers,” said Rohit Khanna, co-founder, Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (FEA) – Ahmedabad. “Prices are usually up in the winter. Now, in a couple of days, prices have reduced due to the civic body announcement,” said Mohammad Ali, a chicken and meat trader. Prices decline, procurements hitA day after the civic body announced that non-vegetarian food joints on main roads would be removed, the prices of chicken and meat took a major hit. Estimates by meat traders in Ahmedabad suggest that procurements have been marginally affected due to which prices fell. Chicken price fell from Rs 200 a kg to Rs 160 a kg, whereas meat prices dropped from Rs 640 a kg to Rs 620 a kg, according to estimates by traders.Meat procurement took a hit from street-side joints, according to traders. “We have reduced procurement of birds for the time being, anticipating a slight slump in demand. Overall consumption of chicken in Ahmedabad is good with a lot of hotels and gourmet retail stores,” said Sultan Darbar, an Ahmedabad-based supplier of meat to organised retail stores, hotels and restaurants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-100-tonnes-a-day-non-veg-sales-are-meaty-in-city/articleshow/87745520.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Pollution & weather change spike woes of respiratory illness patients||LUCKNOW: The constant spike in air pollution is choking the city, leading to a steep rise in the number of patients with respiratory problems visiting outpatient departments (OPDs) of city hospitals. According to doctors, the condition of those already suffering from respiratory diseases has aggravated due to rise in air pollution before and after Diwali and change in weather. “Pollutants like particulate matter PM 2.5 and PM 10 stick to the windpipe and lungs hindering proper respiration. Our immune system gets activated against these foreign objects which results in inflammation. In this fight between foreign objects and our immune system, remodelling of our airways takes place which, in the long run, may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cancer, asthma and other respiratory tract problems,” said Dr Ved Prakash, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine department at KGMU. Track the pollution level in your city“There is an increase in COPD patients. Air pollution, dryness in the air and seasonal shift are contributing to the growth of virus and bacteria in our respiratory tract,” he added. At Lok Bandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, doctors have found a considerable rise in the number of respiratory patients just before and after Diwali. “From an average of nearly 70 patients a day, the number has gone up to 90 patients a day. Most of these patients already have comorbid conditions,” hospital director Dr Ajay Tripathi said. At TB hospital in Thakurganj, the average number of patients has gone up from 30 to 45. “Most patients complain of breathlessness and burning sensation in the eyes in the morning and evenings. Not only elderly patients, but middle-aged and young people are also visiting us with this problem,” said hospital director Dr Anand Gupta. “Every year we see a surge in the patients of COPD, asthma and bronchitis because of pollution and season change, especially after Diwali. The trend is increasing with each passing year,” said medical superintendent at BRD Hospital in Mahanagar, Dr Manish Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pollution-weather-change-spike-woes-of-respiratory-illness-patients/articleshow/87746204.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BJP instigating violence in Maharashtra, says Nana Patole||MUMBAI: State Congress president Nana Patole on Tuesday accused BJP of instigating violence in the state and dared it to dissolve the Narendra Modi-led government and hold elections afresh with ballot papers instead of targeting the state government. “Ever since the democratically-elected Maha Vikas Aghadi government was formed in the state in November 2019, the BJP has been threatening to dismiss it. If BJP has the courage, it should first dismiss the NDA government and hold elections with ballot papers,” Patole said. Patole said it was “out of frustration” that comments on dismissal of the MVA government had been made. “BJP will never succeed. We have reports that BJP was instigating violence across the state, but we will not allow it to take law into its hands,” Patole said. Patole said that from recent developments across the state, it appears that senior BJP leaders “have gone berserk” because the party made umpteen attempts to dislodge the MVA government but did not succeed.” He alleged, The BJP used Raj Bhavan, but to no avail.” Further, Patole pointed out that after it failed to overthrow the government, the NDA government roped in the CBI, ED, the I-T department and NCB to register “false” criminal cases against cabinet members and politicians associated with MVA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-instigating-violence-in-state-says-nana-patole/articleshow/87746787.cms||---

City-based gaming companies have also made the best of the market opportunities during pandemic and 45 new companies have chosen Hyderabad as their destination in last two years taking the total count of gaming companies to 80 here,” KTR said while delivering the keynote address at the four-day IndiaJoy 2021 event that kicked off in the city. KTR pointed out that Telangana is one of the major contributors of VFX outsourcing to Hollywood and regional film markets due to its comprehensive ecosystem. The city has 20 academies creating a world class talent pool in the industry and over 40 production houses employing close to 30,000, he added. Rajiv Chilaka, mentor of Telangana VFX, Animation and Gaming Association, and founder & MD of Green Gold Studios, the maker of popular cartoon ‘Chhota Bheem’, said the last two years have been challenging for the gaming, animation and VFX industry. “While animation suffered a 20% decline in revenues, gaming took a hit of around 10%,” he said, adding that the period has been effectively used by the sector to invest in intellectual property and this is expected to reap rich dividends in future. Biren Ghose, country head of Technicolor India and chairman of CII’s National AVGC sub-committee said the state government must focus on creation of infrastructure and skills to attract investments in the state and grow the overall ecosystem. KTR informed that the government is working towards setting up the IMAGE Tower and though its development had slowed down due to the pandemic, the construction of this 1.6 million sft facility is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vfx-gaming-cos-thriving-in-hyd/articleshow/87745223.cms||---

Paytm was also told pay Rs 1,000 as costs to the complainant. Vivek Dixit’s ordeal began after he had added Rs 6,865 into his Paytm account on May 8 and May 10, 2018, as payment for an online purchase. Dixit said he initiated the return process as he was not happy with the product and the online firm confirmed that Rs 6,865 was credited back. With no sign of the amount in his wallet, Dixit said he raised multiple requests with Paytm but reached nowhere. After several follow-ups and email/telephonic discussions, Dixit said that a Paytm executive called him and admitted the amount had gone into someone else’s account. The executive claimed it was due to a bug and assured it would be fixed, Dixit said. After waiting for over a year, Dixit filed a complaint with Hyderabad consumer forum-II in September 2019. Paytm in its written version contended that the complainant never availed any services from them with respect to the said transaction. They further added that after receiving the complaint, they had intimated that money was successfully added into a source wallet (But it was a different Paytm account, and not Dixit’s). After going through documentary evidence submitted, the bench said the refund was added to the wallet of one ‘Kancherla Sridhar’. “On hearing the conversations, it is clearly admitted by the opposite party’s executive that the amount was credited to the account of one Kancherla Sridhar, who is in no way related to Vivek Dixit. The opposite party failed to establish its claims and also did not resolve the issue,” said the bench in its verdict on October 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/online-wallet-co-penalised-for-refund-into-wrong-a/c/articleshow/87745249.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

K Murali Kumar, a student then, submitted to the Hyderabad-II consumer forum that he had visited the pizza outlet on Shivam Road and ordered pizzas and other food items for Rs 983.5 on September 16, 2019, for takeaway. Kumar claimed that he was charged Rs 7.62 for a plastic carry bag, which had a logo of Domino’s printed on it. He claimed that he was not informed beforehand that the carry bag was plastic and a logo was printed on it and that he noticed it only when the order was ready to carry it away. He further submitted that he requested a carry bag without a logo, but was not provided with one or given any alternative and was compelled to purchase a printed carry bag. The complainant said that he faced “harassment” due to the acts committed by the eatery and added that he was treated as an advertisement agent, which caused mental agony, as he had to walk on the streets by advertising the brand name. The opposite party, in its written version, denied insisting that Kumar purchase the carry bag bearing the logo of the company and added that he had done it out of his free will. They claimed the complainant was not under compulsion to buy a carry bag as pizza was provided in a card box container, and that he could have opted not to buy a carry bag. During the trial, the bench said that the opposite party is not supposed to collect the cost of the bag having a “company logo” from consumers and that it cannot use the consumer as their advertising agency. After the trial, the forum ordered the outlet to pay Rs 11,000 to the consumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pizza-outlet-directed-to-pay-rs-11k-for-forcing-man-to-buy-its-bag/articleshow/87745280.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

At present, there is only one centre functioning at Muvattupuzha Government Hospital (MGH). The plan is to set up one each in Tripunithura, Kalamassery and Fort Kochi. The work of the centre to be set up at Tripunithura Taluk Hospital is underway and the centre will have a dedicated inpatient facility for women and children too. The project reports for the centres to be set up in Fort Kochi taluk hospital and Ernakulam Government Medical College Hospital (EGMCH) in Kalamassery are under scrutiny and are likely to be approved soon. Vimukthi has one de-addiction centre each in all districts besides several counselling centres. Though the centre functioning at one of the buildings of MGH has inpatient facilities, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced authorities to use the space as an isolation ward for Covid patients. “Around Rs 8 lakh has been sanctioned for the setting up the centre at Tripunithura and the works are proceeding. There will be 20 beds and 10 out of them will be dedicated to women and children exclusively,” said a Vimukthi source. The centre to be set up at EGMCH in Kalamassery will have an ICU facility too and it will be functioning in association with the psychiatry department of the hospital. “There will be four ICU beds in addition to 20 beds. The project cost is estimated at Rs 40 lakh and it is yet to be approvedA 10-bed centre is planned in Fort Kochi and the project report has already been submitted,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-de-addiction-centres-to-come-up-in-district-soon/articleshow/87744695.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Nagpur||19.2km Wirur-Manikgarh third line to boost train traffic||Nagpur: In a major boost to smooth flow of train traffic, the Indian Railways has commissioned a 19.2km third line and electrification between Wirur-Manikgarh stations. With this, a total of 84km between Kazipet and Ballarshah has a third line facility now. The significant third line project in the Grand Trunk route between Kazipet-Ballarshah covers Telangana and Maharashtra. The section between Kazipet-Ballarshah under the South Central Railway (SCR) is a vital rail link connecting the northern and southern regions of the country. The mainline section under the GT route has been witnessing continuous growth of both passenger and freight traffic leading to over saturation of this section. To decongest this vital section, initially, tripling works between 33km Raghavapuram-Mandamarri was completed in 2016. The 202km third line project (Telangana 159km & Maharashtra 43km) was sanctioned in 2015-16 at an estimated cost of Rs2,063 crore. Of this 202km, 31km between Potkapalli-Kolanur-Raghavapuram and 34km Raghavapuram-Mandamarri has already been completed. Now, the third line works between Wirur-Manikgarh (19.2km) have been completed giving a boost to socio-economic development of this region. Gajanan Mallya, general manager of SCR, complimented the entire team from the Secunderabad division and construction wing, which completed the tripling and electrification works. “Completion of Kazipet-Ballarshah tripling project will ease congestion in this over saturated route will facilitate handling of more number of trains effectively,” Mallya said. “Manikgarh station is the interchange point with Central Railway and it is the junction connecting several cement and coal sidings. Commissioning of third line on this stretch will ease congestion for both freight and passenger trains,” said Rakesh Kumar, CPRO of SCR. “Execution of third line works of the entire project is being taken up simultaneously in different sections and the works in stretches of both Telangana and Maharashtra region are progressing at a fast pace,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/19-2km-wirur-manikgarh-third-line-to-boost-train-traffic/articleshow/87743873.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kochi||Canal rejuvenation project yet to get green clearance||Kochi: Even two years after awarding the work on integrated urban rejuvenation and water transport system (IURWTS) project, the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) the nodal agency is yet to secure environmental clearance for the project from Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA). Though KCZMA has asked KMRL to “submit details and data regarding the implications of regulating water flow by the canal lock gates” on July 2, 2021, the Metro agency is yet to submit the details. When the Rs 1,528 crore IURWTS project, which was designed for cleaning and beautifying six canals in Kochi and making them navigable, was launched in November 2019, the plan was to start the work within six months. “The project was expected to be a permanent solution for waterlogging in the city. Another purpose of the project was to make the waterbodies in the city navigable,” said BJP district committee member T Balachandran. “The government has already issued orders banning construction on the banks of six canals, which are included in the project. Still, big sharks continue with construction works on the shores of these canals,” Balachandran said. Similarly, eviction of encroachments on the canals are yet to be started. Even if all the permissions are obtained, the work can be started only after evicting encroachments. “It was in July we got the requisition for acquiring land for the project. After completing various procedures, we are now conducting a joint survey with the support of KMRL to mark boundaries of these waterbodies. We are all set to lay boundary stones of Edappally canal,” district collector Jafar Malik said. “Moreover, the land acquisition wing of KIIFB-funded projects in Kochi is overburdened. There are just 12 officials in the team which is to take care of land acquisition of all the KIIFB-funded project. So we have written to the government requesting a separate land acquisition team headed by a deputy collector for IURWTS project,” the collector said. Though TOI contacted KMRL officials seeking reasons for the delay in completing the procedures and starting work on the project, they didn’t respond. “The detailed project report is not in the public domain. Their priority seems to be navigation through these canals. The canal gates are required for ensuring minimum depth of water in the canal so that vessels can move through the waterbody,” said K T Cheshire, an activist. “But, KMRL is unable to allay the concerns raised by KCZMA regarding the implication of canal gates on the flow of water. There should be a proper report on the impact of canal gates,” Cheshire said. “Irrigation department, which is the owner of these canals, should be a party in implementing the project,” Cheshire said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/canal-rejuvenation-project-yet-to-get-green-clearance/articleshow/87744656.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||New Covid patients not experiencing hypoxia||Ahmedabad: On Tuesday, the number of active patients in Ahmedabad district touched 100 after four months. In July, the city was still reeling from the impact of the devastating second wave. But in the subsequent months, the city recorded zero cases on five days as the number of cases remained relatively low. With impact of festivities, the city has again recorded upward trend in daily cases with Tuesday hitting 18, the highest in the past four months. So how do new cases measure against the ones seen in the first and second wave? Dr Maharshi Desai, a city-based internal medicine specialist and member of state’s task force on Covid, said that the stark difference is in lung involvement. “The patients that we are seeing now are not turning hypoxic – out of breath or starving for oxygen – as we saw specifically during the second wave. It’s perhaps the direct impact of Covid vaccination that we don’t see any critical patients with high lung involvement. So far, none of the patients we have seen required oxygen,” he said. Experts from the city added that the direct impact can also be seen in very low hospitalization rate even among Covid patients. But a large number of patients have direct travel history or have contact with someone returning from a trip – something that was seen at the start of the pandemic. Dr Vivek Dave, a critical care specialist, said that due to very similar symptoms, the patients that come with possibility of seasonal flu are sometimes suggested RT-PCR to rule out Covid. “Almost all Covid patients we received are vaccinated, and they don’t show severe symptoms,” he said. “It’s following the same pattern as last year when cases are rearing its head after the season of going out and major social gatherings. While the symptoms are the same of Covid-19 and seasonal flu quite prevalent right now, it should be taken seriously even by those who are fully vaccinated,” said Dr Nirav Visavadia, a critical care physician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-covid-patients-not-experiencing-hypoxia/articleshow/87745546.cms||Parth Shastri

Manpreet also urged for special economic packages like its immediate neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and UT Jammu and Kashmir during a virtual discussion with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to step up investment, infrastructure and growth across the country. He strongly pushed Punjab’s case for special packages to wean away the agrarian state to industries stating that Punjab is a landlocked state. The state finance minister also urged the central government to extend its helping hand to Punjab stating that the state is facing new age challenges in transition of agriculture. He urged Sitharaman to come out with some schemes like production linked incentive which was given to industry so that Punjab can successfully migrate to other crops or animal husbandry from paddy-wheat crop pattern. He added that such a step will not only increase farmers’ income but also help in conservation of ground water and solve the problem of stubble burning which is again a burning issue. Manpreet also sought the allotment of a pharma park, a food park and a textile park for Punjab. “Punjab is the farthest destination from coal mines and actually we want to switch from fossil fuels into either solar or gas if possible. If we can somehow retire our coal-fired power stations, power will become cheap in the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/must-consider-punjabs-security-in-fund-allocation/articleshow/87746241.cms||---

Congress councillors protested the AMC’s move by showering flowers on the mayor. On Monday, the AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch a drive to remove all carts selling non-vegetarian food from main roads, or near schools and colleges, religious places and community halls. “Removing food carts from public roads is a violation of Article 19 (1) G of Constitution of India which provides the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business to all citizens. It also violates a citizen’s right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India under Article 19(1 )(e),” said Shamshad Pathan, president of AIMIM Ahmedabad. Congress councillors Iqbal Shaikh and Shehzad Pathan, after showering flowers on mayor Kirit Parmar and standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot, said remoiving non-vegetarian or vegetarian food carts is anti-poor. “Instead of implementing the Street Vendors Act 2014 and providing vendors sites to carry out their business, the AMC is snatching away their livelihood,” Shehzad Pathan told the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aimim-congress-councillors-protest/articleshow/87745544.cms||---

The family claimed that Kamani Bhandari was issued the boarding pass after the security check. But while she was about to board the flight, Air India did not allow her saying, “We are overbooked and have an unserviceable seat.” The woman is now waiting for another flight to travel to Jodhpur. The family also sought intervention from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the ministry of civil aviation, terming the action as “irresponsible decision” and said it deserving “accountability”. On Tuesday, TOI spoke to the woman and her son for details of the incident. “My mother Kamani Bhandari (85) was taking a flight from San Francisco to New Delhi on Monday, scheduled to depart at 8.30pm and reach New Delhi on November 17 at 1pm. After I dropped her, she went through the security check and was carrying a valid Covid negative report. She was given a boarding pass. However, some minutes prior to boarding, she was denied by authorities at the airport who said that they were overbooked and seats were unserviceable. My mother was clueless and then they intimated me,” said Sanjay Bhandari, an IT professional based in San Francisco. “She is a US citizen and has an OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) card and was visiting our home town Jodhpur,” he said. He added that he pleaded with the authorities to put her in any next flight, but was given the option of a flight to Delhi without further connecting flight to Jodhpur. “Who is accountable for this? I have tweeted and tagged the PMO and the ministry of civil aviation,” he said. Sanjay said that they were hoping the airlines would come up with a viable option to enable her to fly to Jodhpur. “She is waiting. Despite all these hurdles, we hope they provide us with a viable option,” he said. “I was clueless of what had happened. My son came to the airport and I breathed a sigh of relief,” said Kamani Bhandari. Prem Bhandari, a US green card holder who helps NRIs and Indians stuck in various countries with various problems, said, “This is condemnable. Action needs to be taken against those responsible for this kind of negligence.” When contacted, an Air India spokesperson said, “The flight was full and one seat was unserviceable. We had requested If anyone could postpone his or her trip since the flight was overbooked and one seat was not serviceable. With the concurrence of her son she was offered another arrangement. The Air India's airport manager at San Francisco facilitated the passenger in getting another flight on a different airline which was slated to depart on Tuesday evening. However, since Air India does not have a daily flight to Jodhpur, we are trying to make an alternative and comfortable arrangement for her at the earliest. Also, as per US department of transport (DOT) rules, we are paying her $1,550 for this inconvenience.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/ai-denies-85-yr-old-raj-woman-seat-on-flight-from-us/articleshow/87746247.cms||Ashish Mehta

The searches had begun on Monday. “Searches are being conducted at about 77 locations including Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh; Delhi; Jalaun, Mau, Varanasi, Noida, and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh; and Junagadh, Bhavnagar, and Jamnagar in Gujarat,” said a CBI statement. The statement said that searches were also being conducted in Punjab, Bihar, Haryana, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu. Places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra were also being covered, the CBI said. The CBI as a National Central Bureau (Interpol-India) is uniquely placed to coordinate such matters that have national and international ramifications, said the statement. A special unit called ‘Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/ Investigation (OCSAE)’ was created in the CBI for matters pertaining to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. Apart from coordination with various agencies, the unit is undertaking investigations of various offences related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. In a nationwide, coordinated crackdown on crime related to online child sexual abuse material, the CBI registered 23 separate cases on Sunday against 83 accused on the allegations related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. It has been alleged that various syndicates of individuals based in different parts of India and foreign countries were circulating, storing, and viewing Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) through various social media platforms or groups. The accused persons were disseminating child pornography material by sharing links, videos, pictures, texts, posts, and by hosting of such content on social media groups and platforms and third-party storage and hosting platforms. A number of electronic gadgets including mobiles and laptops have so far been recovered during the searches. It is revealed that some individuals were involved in trading CSEM material. According to the initial information collected, there are more than 50 groups with over 5,000 offenders sharing child sexual abuse material. Many of these groups also have the involvement of foreign nationals. Nationals of about 100 countries spread across various continents may be involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/child-porn-cbi-cracks-down-in-state/articleshow/87745553.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: New liquor regime comes into effect||NEW DELHI: All government-run liquor shops shut down on Tuesday night, marking the exit of Delhi government from the alcohol retail business. From Wednesday, swanky private stores will take the orders of liquor lovers. However, a short scarcity looms on the horizon with only a few dozen of the newly mandated private liquor sellers prepared to operate from the day the new policy comes into force. In the new regime, 850 new showroom-like stores are to be opened across Delhi. These will each have a minimum of 2,000 sq ft of carpet area and will offer an array of brands. “The usual scene of people crowded into tiny vends is a thing of the past,” said one licence holder. “There will be enough space in the shops now for the customers to explore and purchase the brand of their choice. All the shops will have mechanised billing too.” The city has been divided into 32 liquor zones and each zone comprising 8-10 municipal wards will have 27 liquor stores. This is meant to ensure equal distribution of liquor shops in the capital. The government has till date given provisional licences to around 350 retailers. A government official said 206 alcohol brands had been registered and the 10 wholesale licence holders had already procured 9 lakh liters of liquor of various brands so far. However, a trader claimed that around 400 brands were registered under the earlier regime so those who patronised the remaining 190 or so brands were likely to be disappointed. In many stores, the civil construction work wasn’t finished on Tuesday evening, while many others were giving final touches to the setup. A dozen shops which were fully finished showcased empty shelves because they were yet to procure the liquor from wholesalers. “We will be able to open our shop for the public by the weekend,” said one provisional licence holder in south Delhi. There is some apprehension among the new shops because there have been sporadic protests against the new excise policy. For some days now, liquor consumers have been feeling the pinch, with many government alcohol vends no longer replenishing stocks because they were in exit mode. A government official assured that all efforts had been made to prevent a liquor crisis. While prices are expected to go up 5-10%, the government has also said there could be discounts offered by individual stores to attract customers. In the early days, however, discounts are improbable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-liquor-regime-comes-into-effect/articleshow/87746271.cms||AlokKNMishra

Ironically, as he watches his crop, the ‘Chettivirippu’ variety that was sent from his yield last year to a couple of farmers in 24 Parganas in the Sundarbans region has given them a good yield. For the farmers in that area, which was devastated by the cyclone Yaas and the land declared unfit for farming this year, pokkali seeds were sent on an experimental basis through Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), an all-India NGO that works for scientific thinking. “It was during one of our discussions that our counterparts in West Bengal mentioned about the sea level rise and post-cyclone effect on their farm. We suggested them to try out our variety. Chandu gave the seeds from his last harvest,” said Francis Kalathunkal, general convener of pokkali samrakshana samithi. Basudev Pattakkare, a farmer, planted10 kg of pokkali seeds in a 0.55-acre field and then transplanted the seedlings on July 28. It was harvested 110 days after sowing. There was no need for fertilizers and pesticides as this variety has a natural property of resisting salinity up to 8 parts per million (ppm) while the salinity of seawater is 35ppm. The crop was successfully cultivated in Dhosa village of Jaynagar Assembly constituency in 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. Karthika Sasamal and Prabhakar Meetti, farmers in Debipur village west of Kultali assembly constituency in 24 Parganas district, are also participating in the pilot venture under the guidance of IISER scientist Dr Soumitro Banerjee, who is also general secretary of BSS, Kolkata. But for Chandu, the struggle is not over until the crop has been harvested. “We might have to advance the harvest due to high tides. This year, we could sow only in August and there was a severe delay in dewatering too,” said Kalanthunkal. The samithi organized a ‘vigil’ meet on Tuesday to raise awareness on protection of the pokkali crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chandu-stares-at-uncertainty-while-his-pokkali-grains-take-root-in-bengal/articleshow/87744710.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All Harbour trains to Andheri to be extended till Goregaon||MUMBAI: Central Railway (CR) has decided to extend all its CSMT-Andheri and Panvel-Andheri services till Goregaon, thus allowing more passengers to travel by the Harbour line. Currently, 21 pairs or 42 services run between CSMT and Goregaon and 9 pairs or 18 services between Panvel and Goregaon. A senior official said, “We are working on a new timetable, according to which the existing 22 pairs of services that run between CSMT and Andheri will be extended till Goregaon from December. Similarly, 9 more pairs of services that run between Panvel and Andheri will be extended as well.” There will be the added operational benefit of running all Harbour services on the Western Railway route from Goregaon instead of Andheri. Earlier, there was a terminating platform, beyond which the trains did not run on the Harbour line at Andheri. Now, since the line has been extended, there is no terminating platform at Andheri. Operating Andheri services means the trains first run on the down track and then have to be brought on the up track to travel towards CSMT. This also keeps one platform occupied, thus blocking movement of trains. More Goregaon services would mean that not only passengers at this station but those from Jogeshwari, Ram Mandir and even Malad can use the trains. If a significant number of commuters from Malad-Goregaon shift to Goregaon locals, there would be more relief to Borivli and Kandivli commuters as they can get adequate space in their dedicated services. Harbour line services were extended till Goregaon on March 29, 2018. Not all services were extended till Goregaon though, due to crew management issues as trains are operated by both CR and WR. Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC) has now firmed up plans to extend the Harbour line till Borivli. Work is expected to start soon as tenders are likely to be floated in a few weeks. The Harbour line’s extension till Borivli has been planned under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3A at a cost Rs 825. 6 crore. This project will be executed by WR and the entire corridor will come up on the western side of the existing tracks. Malad station on the proposed Harbour line extension will be at an elevated level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-harbour-trains-to-andheri-to-be-extended-till-goregaon/articleshow/87746802.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||40% of Gujarat is non-vegetarian: Survey||AHMEDABAD: Around 40% of the population of Gujarat eats eggs or meat. The state has more non-vegetarians than states like Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. More men are non-vegetarians than women in the state. Government officials say 38% of women in the state are non-vegetarian. Proportionately, Gujarat is 55% more non-vegetarian than Rajasthan, the most vegetarian state in India, where only 25.1% are non-vegetarian. Officials said this data is from the sample survey of 2014 and today the number may be much higher. Gaurang Jani, a sociologist, said, “From Independence, Punjab has been a vegetarian state and it is also woven into religion. In Gujarat, we are yet to acknowledge the fact that the state has lots of non-vegetarians. Gujarat has a large coastline and from Surat to Kutch, the population along the coast and those involved in fishing are non-vegetarians. “The Koli community, adivasis and most OBC communities are non-vegetarians. These three groups make up the majority of the population and along minorities we can easily say that Gujarat is a non vegetarian state,” he said. He said in past centuries, the elite of Gujarat imposed their food preferences and since then the state has been more vegetarian. “What is interesting that even entertainment has associated Gujaratis with dal-bhat (pulses and rice) and fafda and dhokla. As people tend not to disclose that they eat meat or eggs, the numbers are under-reported in surveys. We are yet to accept that we are a non-vegetarian state,” The younger generation, irrespective of caste or community, consume non-vegetarian food. Many sects in Gujarat are advocating vegetarian food and are even against the eating of onion and garlic, he said. Consumption of non-veg food in Gujarat is on the rise, Jani said. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in egg production in the state. Production of eggs in the state in 2019-20 was the highest ever, the socio-economic survey found. Egg production in Gujarat was 192 crore eggs in 2019-20. Egg production increased from 185 crore in 2018-19 to 192 crore in 2019-20, according to the Integrated Sample Survey (ISS) of major livestock products, the survey found. A state government report had stated that 43% of eggs produced in Gujarat are consumed within the state and the rest is sent to other states. However, Gujarat also gets eggs from neighbouring Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-of-gujarat-is-non-vegetarian-survey/articleshow/87745555.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Amritsar||On website, Pakistan government hails Navjot Singh Sidhu for Kartarpur corridor role||AMRITSAR: Pakistan has conspicuously given reference to cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is now Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president, in its website kartarpurcorridor-.com.pk and has eulogized his role in the opening of the corridor between the two nations. Pakistan’s credit comes at a time when BJP Punjab chief Ashwani Sharma has claimed that the initiative for opening the corridor was started by the BJP government at the Centre soon after it came to power in 2014. The website stated that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, a friend from the cricketing days of Sidhu, had decided to open the Kartarpur corridor on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev during his swearing-in ceremony and shared the same with Sidhu, who had arrived in Pakistan to attend the ceremony. The homepage of the website reads: “The idea (opening of Kartarpur corridor) was shared with Indian legend Sikh cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister of Pakistan. On November 28, 2018, Prime Minister Imran Khan and Navjot Singh Sidhu attended the groundbreaking ceremony of Kartarpur corridor.” On November 26, 2018, India Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu had laid the foundation stone of the corridor on the Indian side. On November 28 same year, Khan performed the groundbreaking ceremony on the Pakistan side. The website has also prominently published an article titled ‘Kartarpur Sahib Corridor: Interfaith Harmony in Pakistan’, which reads: “This step (Kartarpur corridor) was perceived as a sincere effort of Imran Khan, (Pakistan Army chief) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Navjot Singh Sidhu. Sikhs and Muslims believe that these three leaders have honoured Guru Nanak Dev in a true sense and his followers by creating a facilitative environment which helped permit Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims to have a visa-free visit to Kartarpur Sahib.” It also talked about Sidhu gaining popularity among Punjabi voters that could pave the way for him to the chief minister’s office. “If it happens, this will set in a new era of social, cultural and political history of the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/on-website-pak-govt-hails-sidhu-for-corridor-role/articleshow/87746252.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC says it’s ready to conduct ward reservation lottery in December||MUMBAI: Even as questions have been raised on whether there’s enough time to redraw the ward boundaries for the civic elections to be held in February, the BMC said that it is “well prepared” to hold a lottery for ward reservation even in December, once the process of suggestions and objections for the reorganization of the electoral seats is completed. However, political parties and sitting corporators and aspirants, who have already begun their campaign and preparations keeping in mind the existing electoral wards, are on tenterhooks. They fear that if the reservation for a seat changes, a new candidate will have to be nominated. “We also fear that the authorities may take time to draw out the changes in ward boundaries, which may then leave us with little time for campaigning in case the elections are held on time,” said a corporator from the western suburbs. Another corporator pointed out that the slum population—a major vote bank—has increased in many wards in the suburbs, and if the new boundaries drop out a particular slum pocket from an electoral ward, the entire dynamics would change. “Therefore, it’s important that we know which areas will be covered in our wards so that we can tap our vote base as early as possible,” the corporator added. Last week, the Maharashtra cabinet decided to increase BMC’s strength of corporators from 227 to 236. The last time electoral wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. Reservation of corporator seats are changed every five years through a lottery system. During the previous BMC elections, the reservation of wards was completed by October 3, 2016, and the polls were held in February 2017. “Once we get a communication from the state government [on redrawing ward boundaries], it will take the civic administration one week to complete the progress of reorganization of wards,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, in charge of the civic election department. “While previously the average voter count in each ward was around 54,685, this time it could be around 52,000. From our side there will be no delay; we will be ready to hold the lottery for seat reservation even in December,” he added. Kakani further said that the reorganization would be done through GIS mapping and physical verification would be called for wherever required. Officials said that considering the Covid-related works on in the city, primary health care staff would not be allotted any civic election-related work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-says-its-ready-to-conduct-ward-reservation-lottery-in-dec/articleshow/87745559.cms||Richa Pinto

The entire cabinet, elected representatives and Rythu Bandhu Samithi workers will participate in the dharna. This would be the party’s second protest programme in six days. The ruling party hit the roads on November 12 demanding that the Centre procure paddy/rice produced in the Rabi season. “BJP is adopting a dual policy on paddy procurement. The Centre should clarify the extent of paddy (target) for the entire year, the quantity of raw rice they want to procure in the coming yasangi (rabi) season. I’m going to write a letter to PM Narendra Modi and PDS minister to spell out their stand,” TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said at a press conference on Tuesday. The chief minister declared that the pink party would introduce resolutions in the state assembly against new farm laws and ‘black laws’. He said the party’s elected representatives would question the Centre at various fora till its gives clarity. The decision was taken at the TRS legislature party meeting on Tuesday. The TRS legislature party meeting was convened by KCR to discuss the paddy issue and chalk out the future course of action, mainly to counter BJP’s attack on the TRS government. After the dharna (11am and 2pm), TRS leaders would submit a representation to governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Attacking BJP state president Bandi Sanjay, KCR said he was spreading all lies and creating confusion among the farmers. “Let Sanjay get an official order from the Centre that they will purchase paddy in the next agriculture season. If he fails to get any assurance from his party’s government, he should seek an apology from farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-to-hold-maha-dharna-tomorrow-2nd-in-6-days/articleshow/87746804.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||Indian council of agricultural research looks at new rice to beat climate change||PANAJI: A hardy rice variety, ‘Jaddu Batta’ from Karnataka’s Shimoga district with exceptional tolerance to prolonged submergence under water offers hope for developing a foolproof climate-resistant crop that may help food security. With extreme weather events already registering an increase and problems of salinity, flooding and irregular rise in temperatures having disastrous effects on crops, scientists face a challenge in developing suitable climate-resistant crop varieties. At the Indian council of agricultural research (ICAR), Old Goa, agriculture scientists say they have already standardised and developed salt-tolerant rice varieties - Goa Dhan 1, Goa Dhan 2, Goa Dhan 3 and Goa Dhan 4 - on salt-affected soils of Goa and parts of coastal Karnataka. “Jaddu Batta is grown by the riverside in Shimoga and it can rejuvenate even after 15 days of being underwater,” senior scientist (plant breeding) at ICAR-Old Goa, KK Manohara said. “We are in the process of crossing saline-resistant rice varieties, Goa Dhan series – which are also high-yielding - with Jaddu Batta for its high tolerance to prolonged submergence. This will help tackle problems of both salinity and submergence due to climate change,” Manohara said. This year unprecedented flooding, one of the worst in 40 years, caused massive loss to agricultural crops due to waterlogging for many days. Stress caused by influx of salinity from estuaries and creeks hits paddy productivity and income. “A package of crop management practices - nutrient management, salt-tolerant rice varieties and other aspects have been developed and demonstrated on farmers’ fields. These practices give higher yield and income up to 20% to 25% over the farmers practices,” scientist for soil census at ICAR, Gopal Mahajan said. The institution in collaboration with the directorate of agriculture and progressive farmers are producing quality seeds of these four salt-tolerant varieties and supplying to farmers in khazan areas. “These four varieties are producing 60% to 80% more yield than the locally grown varieties like Korgutt,” director, ICAR, Parveen Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/icar-looks-at-new-rice-to-beat-climate-change/articleshow/87746273.cms||---

An IAF aircraft flies past during the air show in Sultanpur on TuesdayYogi also trained the spotlight on religion saying his government gave due respect to the ‘faith’ of the people. The CM, in fact, gifted PM Narendra Modi a handmade model of the upcoming Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “This is a picture of the new Bharat…picture of a new UP,” Yogi said, stressing that UP will play a pivotal role in turning PM Modi’s dream of making India a global economic superpower. Asserting that his government embarked on focussed development, Yogi cited the examples of the upcoming expressways, executing Metro rail in four cities, and making nine airports functional under the UDAN scheme of the Centre. Yogi said besides its focus on infrastructure development, his government also extended benefits of all schemes related to health and education to all ‘without any discrimination’. The chief minister further said that work on Bundelkhand Expressway connecting Chitrakoot with Etawah, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ballia link expressway is being carried out on a war footing, while work on the 594 km Ganga Expressway connecting Meerut with Prayagraj would begin soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-e-way-will-be-east-ups-economic-lifeline-devpt-axis/articleshow/87746256.cms||Pankaj Shah

According to SAFAR, a system of air quality and weather forecasting and research developed by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Mumbai’s air quality will remain in the ‘poor’ category for the next couple of days. Though Colaba once again recorded an AQI of 353 (very poor) on Tuesday, more than Monday’s 345, it remained lower than Delhi’s 379. According to experts, low wind speed, low temperature, cloudy weather and high humidity along with vehicular pollution prove to be a “lethal combination” for Mumbai, a feature during winter.

---||Dehradun||Day after Khurshid’s house vandalised, no arrests made yet||Nainital: A day after former Union minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s house in Satkhol area of Ramgarh block in Uttarakhand’s Nainital district was vandalized and torched by right-wing protestors on Monday, an eerie calm prevailed over the area.  A forensic team, which spent around four hours at the site on Tuesday, has found nine cartridges, one among them a live cartridge, eight 32-bore bullets, stones, ashes and remnants of inflammable material from inside the house. Broken glass from window panes were also found, with traces of blood on them. Samples of the blood have been sent for examination. Caretaker of the house Sundar Ram, who was present at the house when it was attacked, had said that the protestors, a group of around 20 people, had vandalized the house, fired six to seven rounds at the house and burnt down a door after pouring petrol on it. They had also burnt an effigy near the house on Monday, shouting "Jai Shri Ram, Salman Khurshid murdabad" etc.  Currently, two personnel of Nainital district police have been deployed to guard the house. Khurshid has also sent two people to stay at the place. The house, built across 120 square kilometre (approx) has suffered an estimated damage worth around Rs 50,000. Ram, who has been the caretaker of the house since 2001, when Khurshid had the property constructed, said that his family was still in a state of shock. He had told TOI on Monday that a few members of the mob had pointed a gun at his daughter-in-law before firing bullets at the house. Station officer Bhowali Asif Khan said that none of those booked have been nabbed so far. On Monday, a case for rioting, trespassing and other IPC sections had been filed against 20 unidentified persons and one accused identified as Rakesh Kapil. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book. Hours after Monday’s incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-khurshids-house-vandalised-no-arrests-made-yet/articleshow/87744740.cms||---

In his complaint with Sarkhej police, Milan Vaghasia said he owned Axis Engineering Service India. “I contacted Mumbai residents Iqbal and Zain Nathwani of Bombay Tools and Poles Infra LLP Limited in Mazagaon area of Mumbai to order electric poles in August 2018. I placed the order through mail and paid Rs 9.91 lakh in instalments. However, despite completing the payment, the duo failed to deliver the goods.” The Sarkhej police have registered a case of breach of trust and cheating against the duo. In another case, Rukshmani Koshti, a 68-year-old resident of Ramol, in her complaint with Navrangpura police on Monday stated that Vejalpur resident Laxman Ahir and Ambawadi resident Navin Goriya had cheated her of Rs 2.7 lakh. She stated in her complaint that between September 12, 2008 and Monday, the two persuaded her to invest in a cooperative society for class IV employees and promised her interest on her investment. She stated that the cooperative was registered so she invested Rs 2.7 lakh. She told police that the two neither gave her any interest nor returned her the amount she had invested. So, she lodged a complaint of breach of trust and cheating on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ambli-man-duped-of-rs-10-lakh/articleshow/87745566.cms||---

In areas such as Vastrapur, Prahladnagar, Satellite, Vasna, Paldi and Vadaj, food cart owners were told to move to arterial roads from main roads. “As many as 40,000-50,000 food cart owners, selling vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, kept their business closed on Tuesday as they feared that their carts would be seized by the estate department,” said Rakesh Maheria, president of the association. He said there are 1,10,000 street vendors and food cart owners in the city of whom 42,000 have been given cards by the AMC authorizing them to do business.

Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and AICC incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary were also present on the occasion. “The list of district presidents is ready and will be announced soon. Even party spokespersons will be named. Soon you will see Congress in action across the state,” Sidhu announced. He had earlier resigned on September 28 against the appointment of officials made by his party’s state government led by Channi. Chaudhary said, as of now, there is no talk of alliance with any party, but Congress is always open to tie up with like-minded parties. Asked about the CM face of the party, he said for Congress every Punjabi was the chief ministerial face. “What has not been achieved in four years has been done in the last three months.. We will be judged on performance,” he said, adding that the announcements being made turn out to be long term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/winnability-to-be-key-to-poll-tickets-sidhu-resumes-office/articleshow/87746266.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP usurping others' initiatives, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Taking a jibe at what he described as the tugof-war within the BJP to claim credit for the Purvanchal Expressway which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav described the project a classic example of how the BJP ‘usurps’ the initiatives of others. Before the PM reached Sultanpur to dedicate the Expressway to the people, Akhilesh took to twitter to slam the BJP for tussle to claim credit for the project. “The ribbon came from Lucknow and the scissors from Delhi. There is a tug-of-war to claim credit for SP’s project,” a part of his tweet in Hindi said. Later in the day in a press statement Akhilesh said it would have been better had the Prime Minister, while dedicating the project to the people of the country, mentioned that it was conceived and initiated by the SP. “It was the SP government which announced that budgetary provisions will be made for the expressway while laying its foundation at a gala event held outside UP Vidhan Sabha in December 2016,” he said. “It was the SP government which released money for acquisition of land for the project,” he added. He said the SP government got the Agra-Lucknow expressway completed within 22 months which was a record in itself. The SP had claimed BJP was five years behind SP in terms of providing landing and take-off facility for fighter aircrafts on Expressway that the BJP tried to showcase by way of an air show. “We did it five years ago when fighter jets touched down on Agra-Lucknow Expressway,” he said. Over a dozen IAF planes, including Mirage-2000 fighters and Sukhoi 30s, besides C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, took part in the exercise near Bangarmau about 65km from Lucknow in December 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-usurping-others-initiatives-akhilesh/articleshow/87746269.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The admission committee has also decided to extend the deadline for admission from November 15 to November 20. Commerce colleges affiliated to GU have been asked to fill vacant seats on their own. “A total of 8,651 seats have been vacant after several rounds of admission. This includes 368 BBA and 273 BCA seats, as well as 3,951 seats at grant-in-aid and government-run commerce colleges,” a source said. So far, 33,799 students have enrolled in colleges. In the earlier rounds, colleges were allotted to 39,000 candidates for BCom, BBA and BCA courses on the basis of their choice filling. Of the 56,613 candidates who participated in the admissions for commerce courses at Gujarat University affiliated colleges, 28,000 candidates were enrolled in the first two rounds, sources said. In September, there was an uproar at Gujarat University on the release of the final merit list for commerce courses. In many instances, it showed that students were allotted colleges not affiliated with GU. GU will hold a reshuffling round on October 2 and October 3, where students will be allowed to change their college selection. In the first round, colleges were allotted to 39,000 candidates for BCom, BBA and BCA courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-empty-seats-gu-allows-intake-increase/articleshow/87745571.cms||---

However, the large gap between the minimum and maximum temperatures (31.2 degrees celsius) of 13 degrees remained, making citizens feel the change of season. The weather is likely to get trickier from Wednesday, with light to moderate rainfall forecast in the majority of coastal districts along and in some districts of central Gujarat due to a system in the Arabian Sea that is travelling north-westwards. Dr Dhirendra Sanandiya, president of the Ahmedabad Family Physicians’ Association (AFPA), said that the changing season is giving citizens a slew of health conditions ranging from seasonal flu to congestion, head and body aches, fevers and the odd reaction to allergies. “Fever is very common even as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are on the decline compared to October,” he said. “We are advising those with a history of travel to undergo RT-PCR tests to rule out Covid-19.” Experts said there is a need is to remain on guard for those with lower immunity and existing health conditions. “The conjunction between monsoon and winter is often marked by large temperature differences with hot days and much colder nights, causing a slew of infections,” said Dr Pragnesh Vaccharajani, a city-based general physician. “We are getting a similar number of patients as immediately after the monsoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-of-season-making-many-sick/articleshow/87745567.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Industries oppose local quota in private sector||Chandigarh: Punjab industrialists have come forward to oppose Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s proposal to fix the job quota for Punjabis in the private sector in the state stating that the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the state have over 70% migrated workers and proposed law is unconstitutional. All Industries and Trade Forum has written a letter to the chief minister requesting him to refrain from coming up with the local Punjabi workers’ quota law in the private sector stating that the industries will be forced to close down if the government forces them to fix the quota for local workers. President of the forum Badish Jindal, in his letter, mentioned that industries of Punjab are fully dependent upon the migrated labour. “There are around 30 lakh migrated workers in the state and around six lakh have settled their families permanently in Punjab,” said Jindal. He added that as per a study carried out by the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies of the Punjabi University at Patiala, 70% of the people coming to the cities are from outside the state and only 30% belong to the rural Punjab. Jindal informed the chief minister that the MSME sector in Punjab is having 70% to 90% migrated workers, while the large and medium industries have 30% to 60% migrated workers in their industries. “The 90% of unskilled workers in industries are migrated and almost 60% are semi-skilled and 30% skilled workers are migrated labourers. They have been working in Punjab since decades and now their second or third generations are working in industries in Punjab,” he added. Jindal also apprised the chief minister that industries feel it is convenient to hire migrated labour due to their cost and work efficiency and even the migrated workers are hardly involved in the trade union politics in Punjab. “The proposed law is not only against constitutional provisions but also sovereignty and basic principle of meritocracy that Act as the foundation for businesses to grow and remain competitive,” said Jindal. He added that almost 20% of Punjabis are working in other states and overseas countries so such policies may also impact the future of migrated Punjabis staying in other parts of the country or in other countries. Jindal also said that even the same quota politics was tried by the Haryana government by fixing the quota of 75% for local workers but that was strongly opposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/industries-oppose-local-quota-in-private-sector/articleshow/87746277.cms||---

In the melee, a police officer suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. It all started in Chivvemla village, where Sanjay first went to meet farmers and talk to them about the procurement of paddy. While TRS activists raised slogans against Sanjay, BJP activists too arrived at the spot and both clashed with sticks, prompting police to resort to mild lathicharge. Later, when Sanjay arrived in Atmakur mandal, the TRS activists followed him there too. While TRS and BJP supporters gathered in large numbers at the procurement centre, they attempted to outwit each other, when a reserve police inspector Srinivas suffered a heart attack and was immediately rushed to a hospital in Suryapet. Sanjay could meet a handful of farmers and attempted to pacify the angry BJP activists. Speaking about the incident, Nalgonda SP A Venkata Ranganath said the BJP chief did not have a permission for his visit, and it is also not permissible due to the enforcement of election code. “We have booked cases against him and other BJP leaders for the same reasons, we booked cases against activists of both parties,” he said. Security was tightened in border areas of Nalgonda and Suryapet, and several BJP leaders were arrested before they arrived at the locations where Sanjay was speaking to farmers. Later in the evening, Sanjay cancelled his journey to the Jangaon district since police refused to give him permission due to clashes between TRS and BJP activists. TRS supporters arrived from Tirumalagiri in Suryapet to Jangaon. Sanjay had scheduled a district party meeting in Jangaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suryapet-on-the-boil-as-clashes-mar-bandis-visit/articleshow/87746831.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The special operations group (SOG) of the Ahmedabad rural police on Monday held nabbed the two and seized narcotics and psychotropic substances worth Rs 3.52 lakh from their possession. Police confirmed that Vandit Patel, who runs Rexon Salon and Nails, was caught with 300 gm of hybrid ganja, 501 gm of American charas, 221 gm of charas balls, 224 gm of magic mushrooms, and 43 gm of shatter. Patel’s journey into the drug world began when he began consuming drugs in 2012 and met various suppliers in the city. Later, in 2016, he went to Singapore to study diploma in tourism in Singapore where also he consumed drugs and met various international suppliers. In 2018, he returned to the city and opened his salon in South Bopal. “To earn more money, he decided to sell drugs and contacted international drug mafias. He began obtaining drugs through air cargo since 2019,” said a police officer. For payment, he used to contact dealers and agents of various crypto currency providers. Patel used to give these agents and dealers cash or send it through angadias. The agents used to give him an ID and password for payment in crypto which he provided to the dealers. According to police officers, Patel brought drugs worth Rs 1-2 lakh through air cargo but his consignment was never caught at the airport. “Patel confessed that he used to smuggle the drugs in household articles like microwave oven wrapped in a particular paper that would hinder screening of materials inside,” said a police officer. Police officers believe that Patel used to supply drugs to various areas in the western parts of the city and also in other cities like Surat. He had six aides who worked as suppliers and cops have been trying to nab his suppliers also. Police booked Patel and his aide Parth Sharma, 32, a resident of Vejalpur, under the NDPS act and investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/salon-owner-aide-held-in-drug-bust-in-south-bopal/articleshow/87745587.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa got another opportunity now to win ISL: Brandon Fernandes||Panaji: Brandon Fernandes has set his sights on the Indian Super League once again. Now into his fifth season at FC Goa, the star midfielder has already lost one final and knocked out in the semifinals on three occasions, including last season. The desire to win the biggest prize in Indian football is now more than ever before. “It is disappointing, but we got another opportunity now,” Brandon told TOI on Wednesday. “We are working as a group. We are more or less the same team from last season. We have to rectify things that we didn’t do last season, but we can do better now. All the players are hungry this time. We are going to take game by game and obviously the objective is to win the ISL.” The 27-year-old has lit up the league with his performances and holds the record for the highest assists by an Indian, a total of 18 in 64 games to be precise. Only former FC Goa star and current ATK Mohun Bagan attacker Hugo Boumous is ahead in the all-time list with 24 assists in 58 games. The number can increase this season with the league allowing only four foreigners in the starting line-up, a decision Brandon feels will help Indian players to step up. “Having one less foreigner than last season, it is more important now that we can contribute more to the team. We have four foreigners and it’s good to have them because they help us a lot. This is going to be like a new challenge for all the Indian players this time,” said Brandon. Brandon will once again pair up in midfield with captain Edu Bedia, the club’s longest serving foreigner, and Alberto Noguera, who got most assists last edition. Then there is Glan Martins, Princeton Rebello and a bunch of new talented youngsters who adore the midfielder. “My role will be to help the youngsters. Some of them will be playing their first ISL and it will be a new experience for them. They need to learn everyday, improve everyday and just wait for their opportunity and grab it when they get it,” said Brandon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-got-another-opportunity-now-to-win-isl-brandon-fernandes/articleshow/87767235.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

She claimed that the family had sent her to her parents’ house in April, promising to call her back once things settled but never did so. In her complaint with Chandkheda police, she told police that she got married in June 2019 and began staying with her in-laws. After a few months, her husband, his father, mother and sister began fighting and abusing her. She alleged that when she complained about their behaviour to her father-in-law’s elder brother, he also got angry and abused her. The complainant claimed that she was taunted that her father never wanted her to marry in the family but the complainant was ready to marry despite his reluctance. The family on several occasions asked her to get out of the house and her husband was pressured to seek divorce with the complainant. She stated that on April 29, 2020 her father-in-law and his elder brother dropped her at her mother’s house. She stated that since April no one came to take her back, but she was informed that her husband has filed a divorce petition in the family court. On November 4, she went to her in-laws and tried to persuade them but instead of talking to her, the family abused her.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pinarayi, FM lash out at CAG’s observations against KIIFB||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at the observations made by the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) against the functioning of KIIFB. The detractors of KIIFB are sadists who want to derail the state’s progress, he said. “Some are trying to prevent Kerala from going forward from the present situation. They are happy if we go back a little bit. The government will not stop any work which has been started. Sadistic people are trying to destroy KIIFB,” he said, in an apparent dig at CAG and also the opposition parties which are criticising KIIFB. The chief minister was responding to the latest CAG report on Kerala finances that found serious constitutional issues in the functioning of KIIFB. He was speaking at the Chancellor’s Award presentation held at the Raj Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. He said there are several attempts to defame and degrade KIIFB from various quarters. The attempt is to sabotage the state’s progress, he added. “The state is facing a serious resource crunch. We are not rich in resources. There are weaknesses. But if we fail to strengthen various sectors, including education, citing weak resources we would be doing an injustice to the future generations,” he said. Vijayan made it clear that the state cannot progress on the strength of its own budgetary resources alone. For this, the government will have to opt for alternative paths. “Our general education sector was strengthened only when KIIFB resources supplemented government money. We are now reaping the benefits of such a move. We now have to use the KIIFB route to augment our higher education sector,” he said. The KIIFB resources were necessary to improve the faculty and infrastructure facilities like labs and libraries in the higher education sector, he added. Finance minister K N Balagopal too came out against CAG and said it was creating unnecessary controversies against KIIFB. “Whatever has come as special report were just queries raised during the audit and KIIFB has given its clarifications. No such final report has been received by the government. If there are any anomalies in the functioning of KIIFB, the government has no hesitation in probing it,” he said. The finance minister accused CAG’s special audit report of being an attempt to stoke a controversy. The present attempt is to create controversy based on a report which has not been submitted before the government so far. The chief minister and finance minister came down heavily against the CAG as the opposition demanded a probe into the findings made by CAG in the appointments done at KIIFB and also in the disbursement of salaries and allowances without the government’s consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-fm-lash-out-at-cags-observations-against-kiifb/articleshow/87745598.cms||---

Taking cognisance of the complaint filed by 14 senior citizens from Palmar Colony at Bambolim, the commission had sent a notice to the PWD, which, in its reply, denied that the National Highway Authority changed the original highway widening plan to save one commercial building and that work was ‘ill-planned’, which had led to dust and noise pollution. They had also complained about the unnecessary breaking of the major district road from Santa Cruz to Bambolim, and an illegal ‘No Entry’ sign installed near an automobile showroom at Bambolim, due to which, light and heavy traffic were plying through their residential colony. K L Bhagat of the PWD denied diverting traffic through the colony road. He said the colony has not erected any compound wall or gate or fencing to prevent trespassers and that the internal roads of the colony are wide open. The PWD stated that the national highway work is being taken up and the Santa Cruz-Bambolim road is being used as a diversion and will be restored once the work is completed. The PWD stated that it has taken measures to avoid noise and air pollution and that once the project is completed all complaints will stop and that the complainants will be able to avail benefits of the road widening project. “There is no dispute that the housing colony is not surrounded by any compound wall and the roads passing through the colony from the district road are wide open. The commission finds that due to the construction of the four lane road of the national highway at Bambolim, the respondent had used the Santa Cruz-Bambolim other district road as a diversion road,” the commission stated, adding that the complainants failed to make out any violation of their human rights or negligence by the PWD in prevention of such violation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-human-rights-violation-by-pwd-at-bambolim-panel/articleshow/87746326.cms||---

He had visited the ashram between November 3 and 11. According to the police, the man identified as Vijay Yadav had come to the ashram to attend a shibir along with his 10 friends. Police said that Yadav had last contacted his family on November 9 after which he went missing. However, when all his friends returned home and he did not, Yadav’s family became anxious. As they could not contact him, they reached Ahmedabad on Monday and sought information about him from the ashram people, said deputy commissioner of police, zone-2, Vijay Patel. He said that his family members called up the police control room and sought help. Following this a team of Chandkheda police registered a missing person complaint and started an investigation. Patel added that Yadav had told some disciples and locals that he wanted to go to Jodhpur. Sources in the police said that Yadav might be under influence of Asaram so that he was telling everyone that he wanted to go to Jodhpur in Rajasthan where the godman, accused of raping a minor girl, is lodged in jail. Police have begun checking CCTV footage from the ashram to get clues about Yadav. The Motera ashram of Asaram was mired in controversy when two young boys Dipesh and his cousin Abhishek Vaghela had gone missing from the ashram in 2008 and later their bodies were recovered from the riverbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hyderabadi-inmate-missing-from-asaram-ashram-in-motera/articleshow/87745597.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Worried Telangana farmers sell paddy in Karnataka below MSP, incur losses||HYDERABAD: Even as the turf war between TRS and BJP over paddy procurement continues with BJP chief Bandi Sanjay’s tour of districts to inspect paddy procurement sparking off fresh tensions, farmers in the border areas of Gadwal and Kothakota in the erstwhile Mahbubnagar district, as well as some villages of Nalgonda district, have started resorting to distress sale of paddy and rice in neighbouring state of Karnataka, mainly Raichur. The farmers are selling the parboiled rice at a much cheaper price of Rs 1,300 per quintal when the minimum support price is Rs 1,940. “Thankfully, the fine variety is getting a price of Rs 1,800 as against the government’s MSP of Rs 1,960 per quintal,” said Kotha Ganesh, a paddy farmer from Gadwal district. He said farmers who are financially stable may wait, but was quick to add that those who have taken huge loans and need money right away were transporting the paddy to the neighbouring state as a desperate measure. Mohammad Ghouse, who planted paddy in 17 acres in Kollampally village in Narayanpet district, told TOI, “Since the paddy crop is not ready in Raichur and other border areas of Karnataka, we are shifting rice and selling it at a low price. Once their paddy is ready, there would be additional problems.” He demanded that the state government establish paddy procurement centres run by self-help groups again. Some farmers believe that if the government is willing to provide good market linkages, they will switch over to other crops. “However, not all land parcels are eligible for this paradigm shift to other corps. Firstly, such land parcels should be mapped,” G Venkanna, farmer from Khammam, pointed out. Meanwhile, taking advantage of the situation, some local dealers are purchasing paddy from desperate farmers at a reduced price. “Since it is raining in spells, several farmers are leaving massive heaps of paddy at the procurement centers. Traders are approaching us for selling paddy at Rs 1,500 per quintal. Though many of us are refusing to sell at a lower price, some helpless farmers are resorting to distress sale,” SK Ravi Reddy, a farmer from Vikarabad, said. Urging the authorities to bail them out, Ravi Reddy said: “We are hoping that the state government will procure our paddy and provide us some relief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/worried-t-farmers-sell-paddy-in-ktaka-below-msp-incur-losses/articleshow/87746846.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Goodbye to Crater Mumbai? EEH, WEH to be concretised||MUMBAI: The MMRDA on Tuesday gave its approval to the extension of the Eastern Freeway till Thane and concretisation of the Western and Eastern Express highways. Motorists using the WEH and EEH are promised a pothole-free experience by 2025 as MMRDA has given its approval to concretise these arterial stretches. The approval came in the authority meeting chaired by urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday. Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said, “We have given approval for concretisation of both these roads.” MMRDA officials said only a 14km, 5-plus-5-lane stretch of the 26km Western Express Highway (WEH) will be concretised between Andheri and Dahisar for now. The 10km stretch between Bandra and Andheri will not be taken up now as it has been asphalted and is still under the contractor defect liability period. This stretch will be concretised in Phase II. On the Eastern Express Highway (EEH), only two lanes each on either side of the median will be concretised between Sion and Mulund. Srinivas said, “On EEH, there are utility lines beneath the main carriageway. Hence, only those lanes are taken which do not have utilities underneath.” On WEH, the utilities are underneath the service road, hence it is feasible to undertake concretisation on all lanes. Work on WEH will cost Rs 750 crore while EEH expenditure is estimated at Rs 300 crore. Tenders are likely to be floated soon and work is expected to commence in March 2022. The work is expected to be completed in 2 years. MMRDA will divide the work in 5 stretches so each package has adequate deployment of men and machinery to complete the work in time. MMRDA has been given the mandate to maintain both EEH and WEH as some stretches on these roads are witnessing Metro-related works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/goodbye-to-crater-mumbai-eeh-weh-to-be-concretised/articleshow/87746850.cms||Manthank Mehta

But he was captured by the cops of the local crime branch of Ahmedabad rural police who found him with the help of CCTV footage of a hardware shop. He had bought a saw and a trowel at the shop to break the glass of the window. “The accused, Motisingh Chauhan, worked at the house of Mohit Maradia in Basant Bahar Society in Bopal about two years ago,” said a police officer. “He had vital information such as the place where valuables were stored and the location of the CCTV cameras. He also knew that the high-tech digital door could not be broken.” Chauhan, who was working as domestic help at another person’s house on Sindhu Bhavan Road, decided to shed weight to slip inside his target’s home through the kitchen window. “He told us that he had food just once a day for about three months to reduce his weight from 75kg to 65kg,” said the officer. “His current employer told us that Chauhan used to skip dinner citing his diet.” Chauhan entered Maradia’s house on November 5 and stole valuables worth Rs 37 lakh. As he was not caught by the CCTV cameras, cops used human intelligence and found his footage from a hardware shop in Bopal. Later, on the basis of Chauhan’s cellphone location, cops caught him from SP Ring Road when he was about to board a bus to his native place in Udaipur. He had the loot with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/to-fit-opportunitys-window-he-lost-10kg-for-rs-37l-booty/articleshow/87745616.cms||---

During an interaction, Sisodia highlighted the achievements of AAP government in Delhi, saying if voted to power, the party will ensure a business-friendly government in Uttarakhand as well. "Delhi government ended the ‘raid raj’, saving traders and businessmen from harassment caused due to raids. We believe if the traders progress, the people too progress," Sisodia told traders. While seeking cooperation in forming a government in Uttarakhand, Sisodia said, "Since AAP came to power in Delhi, traders need not go to any office in the national capital. There are 125 departments in Delhi, where government employees themselves go to people’s doorsteps and provide necessary documents." He further added that Delhi's capita income has increased to Rs 3,54,000, resulting in overall development of people of Delhi and increased tax revenue. "We are going to introduce a single-window system in Uttarakhand if AAP government comes to power," said Delhi deputy CM. On Wednesday, Sisodia will take part in a roadshow in Uttarkashi district and will hold meetings with party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/if-voted-to-power-ukhand-will-have-business-friendly-govt-sisodia/articleshow/87744785.cms||Gaurav Talwar

As AICC has declared an organizational poll and the membership drive has begun for this, Chandy is of the view that there was no point in going ahead with the appointment of the new secretaries for KPCC and also the new committees in state districts. Senior leaders like Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala are upset with the way KPCC president K Sudhakaran is going ahead with the restructuring of party committees. “There are certain grievances and complaints regarding the party's revamp. All such issues will be discussed and a solution will be evolved soon,” said AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, who is in charge of Kerala affairs, when asked about Chandy’s meeting with the AICC president. However, state leadership is unhappy with the way senior leaders like Chandy and Chennithala are approaching the AICC against party revamp. “AICC has not stopped party restructuring. It has given the go ahead and KPCC executive committee has also taken a decision on this. These are enough for party revamp,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan, while reacting to Chandy’s scheduled meet in Delhi. It is learnt that Chennithala is also reaching New Delhi this week to meet the AICC president with the same grievance. Both leaders are upset with the state leadership since KPCC president had agreed that he would go ahead with the party revamp only after having consultations with the AICC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/speculations-arise-over-chandys-delhi-visit/articleshow/87745625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A decision to this effect was taken by the UPCA in a meeting held here on Tuesday afternoon . The persons who would be sent for quarantine have been asked get prepared as they would be isolated from all others, including their family members. As soon as the two teams will arrive in the city, the quarantined persons will join the bio bubble with them, said venue director UPCA, Dr Sanjay Kapoor . Talking to TOI he said, “Since the visiting team had shown great concern about precautionary measures for Covid-19, UPCA has decided to send the staff and volunteers, who would join the two teams, for five days quarantine. The players who would reach the city on November 19 would isolate themselves for three days and will be allowed to come on field for activities on November 23.” He informed that in the apex council meeting, the bio bubble issue was discussed prominently and it was decided to adhere to the guidelines issued by the administration and medical team. A team of the volunteers was also picked and where they would assist was also discussed by the members. The organizing committee was asked to coordinate with civic authorities for the successful organization of the match, he added. UPCA would arrange a special stand for its former and present Ranji trophy players, Kapoor said. It was also decided that UPCA would give match passes to the affiliated member units seeking them.

---||Pune||Vax count in Maharashtra surges again after a month’s low||PUNE: After almost a month of low vaccination rate since mid-October, inoculation count in Maharashtra has surged once again with the state administering the highest daily jabs in nearly a month, on November 13,15 and 16. Health department vaccination data showed that the per day jabs administered crossed 7 lakh for the first time on Saturday and Monday since October 18. The state administered 6.6 lakh shots till Tuesday evening. The daily jabs in the past few days, barring Sunday (usually a lean day), have thus been highest since some time now. State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI that the current target was to complete all the first doses in Maharashtra by November-end. “Accordingly, a daily target of 10 lakh jabs is being kept in sight,” he said. Currently, the state is yet to cover nearly 24% of its 9.14 crore eligible population with first jabs. Dr Desai said, “In the last two days, Maharashtra’s daily jabs have increased, the average being higher than almost a month. The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme was started last week and took some time to pick up momentum as the districts were still collating data on the left-out beneficiaries. We have covered 76% of the eligible population with first doses in the state, and aim to cover the rest by this month-end. Maharashtra is expected to keep up the current level of daily jabs.” The daily average for shots administered in the state had plunged to 3-4 lakh since October third week, owing to the festive season and the huge gap (84 days) between the first and second doses of Covishield and fall in beneficiaries’ footfalls at the inoculation sites. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, however, said the number of jabs administered in Pune in the last couple of days had not shown any major improvement, being nearly 35,000 on average. “However, conditions may improve during the next four to five days not only as the pace of the programme picks up but also because the November-end period is likely to see a huge number of beneficiaries becoming due for their second shots,” he said. An official from the district health department, Thane, said the district administered over 64,000 jabs on Monday, with the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme being on. “Surveys are on at the village and city level to find the first and second dose beneficiaries. We are organizing separate vaccination camps in areas that have a higher number of beneficiaries for the pending vax doses. The programme picked up pace since Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-count-in-state-surges-again-after-a-months-low/articleshow/87745609.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Covovax trial includes kids aged 2-6 years||PUNE: Covishield maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has scaled up the paediatric trial of Covovax by including children in the two to six years age bracket across 10 sites in India, including Pune. The vaccine maker started off Covovax trials among children in August this year. Initially, the trial enrolled adolescents in the 12-17 years category and was later expanded by enrolling children in the 7-11 age group. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax will have a total of 920 children — 460 in the 12 to 17 years category, 230 in the 7-11 age group and another 230 in 2-6 age group. “As per the trial design, we have been expanding the trial after ensuring the vaccine safety among 100 children from each group in the reverse order of age. We first did that in adolescents and then included children in the 7-11 age group. Now, we have started enrolling children in the 2-6 age group after seeking due regulatory permissions,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India this year and for children by April 2022. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculating with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “We enrolled the first child in the 2-6 age group in Pune on November 11. We intend to enrol 25-30 kids in this (2-6 years) age cohort.” Earlier, Bharati Hospital had enrolled 35 children in the adolescent age group and 21 children in the 7-11 age bracket for the Covovax trial. KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covovax-trial-includes-kids-aged-2-6-years/articleshow/87745603.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||I like when people say FC Goa are the favourites: Juan Ferrando||Panaji: The word everywhere is that FC Goa are among the favourites to win this edition of the Indian Super League. There are stronger teams like Mumbai City and ATK Mohun Bagan, who finished top two last season. Others have strengthened themselves considerably, but Goa – with almost the same squad as last season and few additions – should fancy their chances, given how they performed in the AFC Champions League. Coach Juan Ferrando has heard all the talk. “We are the team to get the trophy,” Ferrando told reporters on Wednesday. “I like when some people talk about FC Goa like that. It is good words for FC Goa. Most important is thinking about the first game.” Goa have been the most consistent team in the ISL but have never won the trophy. They lost two finals in 2015 and 2018. Last season, they lost in the semi-finals against eventual champions Mumbai on penalties. This season, Ferrando wants his players to be on the same level when they start their campaign against the defending champions on Monday. The Spaniard believes his ideology will be the key factor to help the team deliver good results, if there’s injuries and suspensions. “In case of cards and injuries all the players should be ready, and the level of the team is more or less the same. I understand the technical details might not be the same. But about football, controlling the spaces, time of the press for me is very important,” said Ferrando. Goa started pre-season in August itself and then took part in the month-long Durand Cup in Kolkata. Winning Asia’s oldest tournament has boosted their morale and made them hungry for more. Goa missed key players like Brandon Fernandes, Glan Martins and Seriton Fernandes in the last-four stage of the competition as they were on national duty. But Ferrando is proud of how other players stepped up in their absence. “I think the word is to improve. Because of course our target is for the team to play in one style, one methodology. I want to help the players this way. My point of view and of the club is the big success to see the team play on the same level in case of injuries,” said Ferrando. Goa return to the ISL after more than eight months. While most teams have been out of competitive football, Ferrando’s team was engaged in the AFC Champions League and the Durand Cup which gave the players more exposure. Along the way, Goa handed debuts to their developmental team players and unearthed talent such as 19-year-old Mohammed Nemil. The arrival of India U-17 World Cupper Anwar Ali has created plenty of buzz too. While Goa have certainly improved, others are not too far behind. “When I see the players of the squads, I know the league will be very competitive. For me this season 11 teams will be striving to be in the playoffs. We have a very good squad, but in the end, we will see if we make the play-offs. After four-five games, we will see what happens in the ISL,” said Ferrando. Unlike last season, mere semifinal appearance won’t be enough for the fans. The expectations from fans are high. At least, that’s the word everywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-like-when-people-say-fc-goa-are-the-favourites-juan-ferrando/articleshow/87767299.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Police said that the seized 127 plants weighed over 240 kg with a market value of over Rs 24 lakh. Sildar will be produced before a special NDPS court on Wednesday and his remand will be sought to investigate who had supplied the marijuana seeds to him and to whom he was planning to sell the drugs. In the last month, this is the fifth arrest of a farmer in Chhota Udepur for growing marijuana in their farms and backyard. Earlier, police had arrested four farmers in different parts of the district and seized marijuana worth Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmer-held-for-growing-marijuana/articleshow/87745018.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BJP trying to play communal card ahead of Uttarakhand polls: Harish Rawat||In an exclusive conversation with TOI, former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat slammed the BJP for trying to create a Hindu-Muslim rift ahead of the upcoming assembly polls. The senior Congress leader also cleared the air on CM Pushkar Singh Dhami's recent allegation that "a former CM had announced a holiday on Fridays for namaz” saying no such government order was issued during his tenure as CM. Excerpts from an interview with Kautilya Singh: Q. You have been targeted by Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Dhami over Friday namaz holiday? The formula of playing the communal card is a tried and tested one for BJP, and it is trying to do the same in Uttarakhand ahead of the assembly elections. Rather than talking about development and work done by the BJP government, top BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, are levelling baseless allegations against me. Currently, they have all the power and wherewithal to find out the facts. I challenge them to produce a copy of the so-called government order -- which they say was issued during my tenure as CM --- that made Friday a holiday for facilitating people to offer namaaz. Q. You are claiming that no such government order was issued during your tenure? Has anyone in this country – with the exception of a handful of top BJP leaders – ever heard about Friday being declared a holiday by a government? How can a government take a decision when there was no such request from any section of the citizens? During my tenure as CM, there was a request for a holiday on the occasion of Parushram Jayanti but no request was made for making Friday a holiday. Some media channels tried to highlight the issue, but there was no truth in the matter. BJP leaders are free to speak to the departments concerned to get a copy of the order. They do not talk about facts. This is just an attempt to spread hatred and hide the BJP government’s failures on issues such as employment, migration, anti-people decisions and the deteriorating economy. Q. Will going to the Uttarakhand polls without a CM face hurt Congress’s prospects? I have given up on the issue. Earlier, I had made my stand clear and cited the importance of going into an election with a CM face. I had highlighted some examples in some states where the party had performed well in an election by projecting a CM face. During election campaigns, we make promises to people and someone should be made accountable for fulfilling those promises if the party is voted to power. It is now up to the party leadership of Uttarakhand to convey to the national leaders whether we should go with or without a CM face. Q. The way AAP and BJP national leadership is targeting you, is it turning out to be a fight between only you and them? BJP is well aware of the fact that the party is on its way out in the state. AAP’s top leaders come to Uttarakhand to spend a few days at picturesque locations as tourists. I am their target as they are well aware of the ground reality. Had BJP worked for five years, its senior leaders would have focused on development in their speeches. So, they are relying more on levelling baseless allegations against me rather than projecting development activities, if any, carried out by them. Similarly, AAP is aware about BJP’s dismal performance and regards me as a challenge. It is not Harish Rawat versus others, but Congress versus others. Being a senior leader, I am often on the receiving end of other political parties. Q. Recently, you have locked horns with CM Dhami and other ministers over the issue of employment? During the previous Congress regime, employment was provided to 32,000 youths. Now, the BJP is not able to reach anywhere close to that number. A few months back, the BJP government announced to provide 24,000 odd jobs, but how many people will actually get jobs before the state polls. Failure on the part of the BJP government to generate jobs forced people and talented youths to migrate from the state. A state minister did come up with some numbers regarding jobs given by the government, but it is a late effort to hide the BJP government’s failure. Q. After Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s announcement in UP, will 40% tickets be given to women candidates in Uttarakhand as well? It is the responsibility of party seniors like me to create an atmosphere where more and more women can be encouraged to enter politics. My daughter Anupama has written to the national and state leadership regarding 40% reservation of seats for women. Because of the vision of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, women got reservation in panchayat elections. Q. Has the tiff in Punjab Congress ended? Will the issue impact the party in state polls? I have already said that “all is well” in Punjab Congress. We will collectively fight the Punjab assembly elections. The party has given a very good chief minister to Punjab in the form of Charanjit Singh Channi, and the party is confident that he will take decisions related to public welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-trying-to-play-communal-card-ahead-of-uttarakhand-polls-harish-rawat/articleshow/87744795.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Petition against TTD: Cannot interfere in temple rituals, says SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that constitutional courts cannot interfere in daily rituals and practices in a temple on the basis of a writ petition and said that if any devotee is aggrieved by any deficiency or violation of rituals she/he has to file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum seeking relief. "If a devotee is aggrieved by non-performance of any daily ritual properly or deviation from daily practices in a temple, he/she can file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum for grievance redressal. The high courts and the Supreme Court cannot deal with it," said a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli. The ruling came on a petition filed by Srivari Dadaa, who had accused the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Trust Board of deviating from daily rituals. The Andhra Pradesh HC had on January 5 rejected the petitioner's PIL and said, "procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others". TTD is an independent trust that manages temples including the famous Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple at Tirumala. Daadaa has alleged that the temple authority has been performing sevas - Abhishekam Seva, Thomala Seva, Arjitha Brahmotsavam, Yekanta Utsavalu and Maha Laghu Darshan - in a "wrongful and irregular procedure". However, the apex court clarified that if a Devaswom Board or temple administration is failing in its duty to make proper arrangements for the devotees or indulging in maladministration of the temple, then a devotee could be permitted to seek redressal of her/his grievances before the HCs or the SC through a writ petition. Agreeing with the AP HC, the CJI-led bench said, "the constitutional courts cannot start interfering with the daily rituals of the temple and its customs and practices, as it is not judicially manageable. Can we manage daily puja? Which law mandates that constitutional courts can interfere in daily rituals. Can we dictate to the temple authorities how a coconut is to be broken in front of the deity? Can we tell the priests how to carry out aarti? This appears to be a publicity interest litigation. If you have any grievances about the carrying out of sevas, then file a suit before an appropriate court seeking redressal by leading evidence." About the petitioner's allegations regarding discrimination of devotees and denial of "darshan", the SC asked the TTD to respond to the petitioner's representation listing out the deficiencies. "The temple administration is directed to give a proper response within eight weeks to the petitioner. If he feels his grievances have not been addressed properly by the authorities, then he can seek appropriate remedy before a suitable forum," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/petition-against-ttd-cannot-interfere-in-temple-rituals-says-sc/articleshow/87746848.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Acting on an anonymous call, a team comprising inspector of police P Azeem, Savai Child Line coordinator M Ashraf Ali visited a temple at Melakalkandarkottai where the marriage was to be held in the morning and stopped it. The marriage was planned between a 17-year-old-girl and a 25-year-old man. After confirming their age, police produced her before the children welfare committee (CWC). The enquiry by the CWC revealed that the girl was a resident of Viralimalai in Pudukkottai district and the man was residing in Melakalkandarkottai. Both of them were in a love affair. They were also relatives. After coming to know that they may elope, the parents decided to marry her off to the man on Monday. But, the ChildLine helpline 1098 received a call on Sunday night informing about the marriage. As per the orders of the CWC in Trichy, the girl was sent to the CWC, Pudukkottai for further decisions.

Doctors too were surprised when the ultrasound revealed Sarita’s first prenatal sonography since she conceived. Childless since 18 years, the couple had lost hopes of becoming parents. They never thought the pain Sarita was going through during the last nine months could be due to pregnancy. The team at AIIMS provided multi-disciplinary care with cardiologists, anesthesiologists, neonatologists and obstetricians pitching in to conduct this unique experience of managing a patient who had undergone a cardiac bypass surgery and still delivered a healthy baby. Such a case is rarely reported in literature, claimed doctors at AIIMS. “Almost 17 years ago, Sarita had a pregnancy that ended in the 5th month. She never got pregnant since then. She developed a heart disease later and had to undergo bypass surgery (CABG) 4 years ago. She was on treatment for chronic hypertension and diabetes. After tests, we decided to go for an elective cesarean,” said Dr Shuchita Mundle from the team of obstetricians at AIIMS. The team also had Dr Anita Yadav and Dr Neha Gangane. Cardiologist Dr Gunjan Ghodeshwar looked after the heart condition of the patient. The C-Section was done on October 27 and a healthy girl weighing 3.2kg was born. The happy and grateful mother and baby were discharged recently with certain gudelines to be followed. According to neonatologist Dr Nishant Banait, many things were unknown about the baby. Throughout the pregnancy, the mother was taking medication for her heart condition and diabetes, which are known to be harmful to a growing fetus. “Fortunately, the baby was born with a good size and without any malformations. However, there was a hick-up when the baby dropped its sugar levels within the first 24 hours, which was taken care of swiftly by our NICU team,” said Dr Banait. One of the challenges was continuing the mother’s medication while she continues to breastfeed her baby. The team had a discussion with the child’s parents and informed them about the benefits of breastfeeding the baby versus the chances of harm caused by medication (a low probability) the mother is receiving. Parents took an informed decision and the baby was allowed to breastfeed. Dr Avinash Prakash, assistant professor, department of anaesthesiology said it was challenging to provide anesthesia to the patient. “Apart from hypertension, diabetes, and bypass surgery, the patient also had a history of lumbar spine surgery some 8 years ago,” he said. Maj Gen Dr Vibha Dutta, sirector, and CEO of AIIMS, said it was teamwork that handled such a rare case. “AIIMS is committed to provide safe maternity and child care in a most modern and well-equipped birthing centre. To take care of the need of infertile couples, AIIMS is going to start an ART centre which will provide services like embryo culture, embryo transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unaware-of-pregnancy-woman-with-bypass-history-delivers-healthy-baby/articleshow/87745629.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Only 81% HCWs in district administered first shot||PUNE: Ten months after the vaccination drive against Covid-19 started, only 81% of healthcare workers (HCWs) have received their first shot in the district. A District Health Office (DHO) report stated that out of the 1.98 lakh target HCW beneficiaries, 1.61 lakh have been administered the first dose, and 1.39 lakh have taken their second shot. The HCWs were the first beneficiaries with whom the vaccination drive had started across the country from January 16. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of Hospital Board of India of Indian Medical Association, said most of the healthcare workers in the region have been vaccinated, and there could be other reasons why it is not reflecting in the beneficiary list. “There is a possibility of overlapping of beneficiary names in the database of the civic body and that of the district health office. Also, the registration of the HCWs had started before the vaccination, which was closed soon after. The closed registration forced many HCWs to take the jab under the regular category of their respective age.” “Had there been a few special sessions when the vaccination was made open to all, it would have been easier to ascertain the exact data of the HCWs vaccinated,” he said, adding that most of the HCWs have been vaccinated across the district. Suryakant Devkar, the chief immunisation officer of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said they have vaccinated almost all the beneficiaries from the respective categories, but if someone is yet to get one they can visit the designated vaccination site across the civic limit. On the 74% first dose vaccination of HCWs in the civic limits, Vikas Dhakane, the additional commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said the number could be different from the DHO and he will check the data of the PCMC health department. On Tuesday, around 40,044 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district at 649 sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-81-hcws-in-dist-administered-first-shot/articleshow/87745624.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Obstetricians in the city have launched initiatives to address vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women and have been counselling them to get the jab. “About 80% of my patients have taken both doses. We are increasingly seeing vaccine hesitancy diminishing among pregnant women, as we have been telling them about the serious implications of contracting Covid during pregnancy,” Sunita Tandulwadkar, president of Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society , said. Tandulwadkar, who is also chief IVF consultant and endoscopist at Ruby Hall Clinic, said most of her patients seeking in vitro fertilization too were vaccinated. “Obstetricians and gynaecologists at city, state and national levels are working hard to promote vaccination among pregnant women through webinars, live programmes and awareness campaigns,” she said. FOGSI vice-president Bipin Pandit said vaccine hesitancy had crept in among pregnant women due to erroneous messages on social media and other platforms. Pandit said 100% of his patients were vaccinated. Senior gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte, owner and medical director of Gupte hospital, said obstetricians play a major role in ensuring their patients were jabbed. “Patients always ask us before opting for vaccination and thus, doctors have a big role to play..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-hesitancy-among-pregnant-women-shrinks/articleshow/87745613.cms||Neha Madaan

The PMC had set up 20 Covid care centres, but none of them is occupied now, forcing the civic body to close them, officials said. According to PMC data, 13 Covid care centres were developed during the second wave, comprising around 4,700 beds. Ten more facilities were set up later, but were kept on hold due to poor demand. They have the capacity of 4,200 beds. “The demand for these facilities has reduced over the months. Even during the second wave, there was hardly any demand for the beds in these centres. So, PMC has decided to shut them,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior official of PMC. As per civic officials, the issue of manpower to run these facility had cropped up they were set up. The PMC had planned to rope in staff to keep this facilities running, but due to lack of demand, recruitment was kept on hold. The civic administrations had given extension to some medical staff members, who were working on contract at the civic centres. These contractual employees have now been given the responsibility of other civic medical services. “Some of the Covid centres were functioning in the dedicated Covid hospitals. Four of these hospitals have now been opened for other patients,” said a PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-shutting-down-covid-care-centres-as-cases-drop/articleshow/87745618.cms||---

The award will be given at the 24th session of the UNWTO general assembly on December 2, in Madrid. “On behalf of the people of Pochampally and the people of Telangana, I am grateful that this award has been bestowed on the village of Pochampally. I am also grateful to the ministry officials for presenting the case for Pochampally and other entries effectively,” G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of culture, tourism and development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), said. The best tourism villages by UNWTO pilot initiative aims to award those villages which are outstanding examples of rural destinations and showcases good practices in line with its specified evaluation areas. It also aims to support villages to enhance their rural tourism potential through training and access to opportunities for improvement. The ministry of tourism had recommended three villages for the award -- Kongthong in Meghalaya, Ladhpura Khas in Madhya Pradesh and Pochampally in Telangana. Pochampally is about 50 km from Hyderabad and is often referred to as the silk city of India for the exquisite sarees that are woven through a unique style called Ikat. This style, Pochampally Ikat, received a Geographical Indicator (GI status) in 2004 and is also known as Bhoodan Pochampally to commemorate the Bhoodan movement that was launched by Acharya Vinobha Bhave from this village on April 18, 1951. The ministry of tourism said it has drafted a rural tourism policy which will not only promote tourism within our villages but also revitalise local arts and crafts and promote the rural economy. “It will help redevelop and rebuild our villages and rural life and the residents of the villages will also get an opportunity to engage and interact with people from outside,” Kishan Reddy added. He urged the citizens to include rural destinations such as Pochampally that have a rich cultural heritage in their travel itinerary and explore the beauty of the villages in our country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pochampally-indias-silk-city-is-worlds-best-tourism-village/articleshow/87746860.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The valuation has been given in the final report submitted to the investigation team. MVD valued all eight vehicles, belonging to Mavunkal at his house in Kaloor. The highest price put for a vehicle is around Rs 14 lakh for a Land Rover and Rs 12 lakh for a five-seater Land Cruiser with Madhya Pradesh registration. “We already said in the primary report that the ‘luxury’ vehicles are altered/modified ones. A Mercedes Benz has been altered into a Porsche and we put the value at Rs 2.5 lakh for that. Since all these vehicles have not been used on roads, we do not find any offence regarding motor vehicles rules against him,” said an official. The value of a Limousine, which was converted from Benz, has been put around Rs 4.5 lakh. Of the total 38 vehicles possessed by Mavunkal, 30 are in Cherthala. Of these, 25 in Cherthala police station and all got damaged in the flood. Three vehicles are in workshop and two at his house at Cherthala. A crime branch officer, who is part of the investigation, said they received the MVD report on Tuesday and need to study it before taking another step. “Suspicion has been raised regarding the engine number of a vehicle, which we need to verify. He is not the RC owner of all the 38 vehicles. He possessed the vehicles paying only a few lakhs as all the vehicles are very old,” said the official. Currently, Mavunkal has been lodged at Kakkanad district jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/value-of-monsons-luxury-car-pegged-at-just-rs-1-5-lakh/articleshow/87745668.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Post rain, stray cattle causing accidents every day on NH 81||TRICHY: The national highway 81 (NH 81) connecting Trichy and Thanjavur districts has of late become an accident-prone stretch as cattle stray into the carriageway throughout the stretch hindering vehicular movement. On an average, the past month has reported more than 30 incidents involving a vehicle colliding with cattle and in most of the events, the animals were reported dead. Starting from Palpannai in Trichy city, NH 81 passes through Thiruverumbur and Thuvakudi urban areas as well as Devarayaneri and Asoor rural areas, where cattle menace is a common trouble for commuters. Cattle which are reared as livestock are let by owners into the NH to feed on the grass and plants that have grown in the recent monsoon. With at least 20-30 cattle flocking the highway at a time, instances of traffic getting affected are common, even near the NHAI toll plaza at Vazhavanthankottai. Regular commuters on the stretch which is dotted with National Institute of Technology (NIT) Trichy and Sastra university have complained of frequent non-fatal incidents disturbing the traffic during the night. “All on a sudden, a calf ran into the road and rammed my car even as I slowed down. I had to shell out Rs 20,000 to repair my car. ,” K Shyam Sundar, a research scholar in Bharathidasan University, said. As the cattle in bulk sleep near the medians and vacant space adjacent to the motorable way, two-wheeler riders are most vulnerable to a fatal fall. Villagers on the NH said that the usual grazing field in their hamlets was inundated in the recent rainfall and as the river beds are witnessing water flow, they lack adequate space to rear the cattle. However, even the urban parts of the stretch covering Ariyamangalam and Thiruverumbur witness similar nuisance. Commuters lamented that neither Trichy corporation nor the traffic police understand the severity of the cattle menace on the NH. Apart from the highways, even city roads including Karumandapam, Bharathiar road and Cantonment live with similar stray cattle menace. “We will discuss with other stakeholders to communicate with the panchayats and other local bodies to take action on the cattle intruding into the NH. Accidents due to cattle are reported on a daily basis,” an official source with NHAI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/post-rain-stray-cattle-causing-accidents-every-day-on-nh-81/articleshow/87745637.cms||Deepak Karthik

Recently, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) cleared Vinay Pratap Singh’s name for Chandigarh DC. The order issued by Haryana government reads, “In pursuance of MHA’s order, the Governor of Haryana is pleased relieve Vinay Pratap Singh, 2011 batch Haryana cadre IAS, with effect from November 17 to assume charge of the post of deputy commissioner, Chandigarh, on inter-cadre deputation from Haryana cadre to AGMUT cadre (Chandigarh segment).” In August, the UT administration recommended the name of Vinay Pratap Singh for the post of Chandigarh deputy commissioner to the Centre. The name was recommended to the Centre after approval of former Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore. In July, Haryana government sent a panel of three IAS officers for the post of deputy commissioner to the Chandigarh administration. The post is reserved for a Haryana-cadre IAS officer. The panel consisted of Prabhjot Singh, a 2010-batch Haryana cadre IAS officer; Vinay Pratap Singh, 2011-batch Haryana cadre IAS officer and Mukul Kumar, 2011-batch IAS officer.

Due to the copious flow of water in the canal, people take baths and clean their vehicles on the banks, but now, residents have urged the forest department to be on vigil and monitor the canal. Vayalur Road residents near Somarasampettai spotted a 4-5ft long crocodile swimming in the water on Tuesday morning. Few days ago, residents near Uyyakondanthirumalai locality and suburban Trichy also reported sightings of a crocodile. Forest officials said that freshwater crocodiles usually migrate along the irrigation canals that originate from the Cauvery river. While some of the crocodiles will stay for a significant period in the canals adjoining Kulumani, Koppu and Ettarai villages during the monsoon, most of the crocodiles would migrate to the Cauvery river near Grand Anicut in Thanjavur district, forest officials said that. While the officials said that the crocodiles were harmless and there was no record of attack on humans or cattle in the city for the past 10 years, residents opined that kids enjoying a leisure dip in the river are at risk. “People are taking a pit-stop on the banks of the canal to spend some time after visiting temples with families. We cannot take any chances, the forest department can sensitise the local people about the movement of a crocodile,” Jai Ganesh, a resident of Vayalur Road said. As the canal is passing through several residential localities including Kuzhumayee Amman temple, Raja Colony, Alwarthope and Anna Nagar, local people expressed their fear over the possibility of the crocodile straying into residential areas. “We will place boards and sensitise people along the canal. The crocodiles will not stray in the area that has human movement, however, we will monitor the areas where the sighting was reported,” an official with the forest department said. The officials said that if spotted, the crocodile would be rescued and left into the Kollidam river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crocodile-spotted-in-uyyakondan-canal-in-trichy/articleshow/87745644.cms||---

He was taken off ventilator and moved to the general ward from ICU of medicine department on November 12. “He is maintaining on 2 litre oxygen and would be gradually made to breath on his own,” said associate professor Dr Milind Vyawahare, who led the team. Dr Prashant Patil, head of the department, said this is one of the many success stories of the medicine department. “We are working tirelessly with limited resources,” he said. The team comprised Dr Vyawahare (ICU in-charge), Dr Archana Aher, Dr Abhishek Pande, Dr Riya Saboo, Dr Shrijan Khandelwal, Dr Suraj Hiwarkar, Dr Saurabh Meshram, Dr Tushar Khadase, Dr Pooja Borlepawar, Dr Pradnya Gavit, Dr Saurabh Sharma, Dr Shital Bharsad and sister in-charge Geeta Kannake. Anand belongs to Gadchiroli where he was admitted to a local hospital following fever due to reaction of drugs given for epilepsy treatment in July. The fever went out of control and he developed blisters all over his body, besides breathlessness. He was shifted to GMCH on July 29. “He was denuded as his skin vanished due to merging of blisters. This is called Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, a skin disorder) overlap. He also had mucosal lesions (inside the mouth),” said Dr Vyawahare. Since the skin, which protects from external organisms, peeled off, it turned a source of entry for organisms leading to infection (sepsis). “Anand developed sepsis which caused multiorgan failure. Lungs were affected due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He was unable to breath as the lungs got swollen. His kidney got injured and BP was low,” said Dr Vyawahare. Anand also had thrombosis in cereberal venous sinuses. He was having continuous convulsions. “Anti-convulsion drugs may have aggravated SJS. So, we had limitations. We managed him on ventilator and controlled sepsis, ARDS, convulsions and renal functions,” he said. Dr Vyawahare said that before this, they have given prolonged ventilatory support to multiorgan dysfunction patient almost up to 5 months but those patients could not be saved and died. “This time, we saved this patient and successfully weaned him off from ventilator after 107 days with normal functioning of his vital organs,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-ventilator-for-107-days-gmch-docs-save-multiorgan-failure-patient/articleshow/87745660.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Nehru also directed the district administration and Trichy Corporation to construct new bridges to replace the damaged link roads across various canals. “Retaining walls with shutters will prevent the overflowing water from the Uyyakondan canal to the adjoining residential areas. In Lingam Nagar, retaining walls will be constructed at a cost of Rs 50 crore to prevent water overflowing from the Kodingal canal,” the minister said. Four vulnerable points in the city including Beschi Nagar in Woraiyur will undergo civil works to strengthen the canal bunds without affecting the public movement. Speaking about the encroachments on waterbodies, Nehru said that people are not cooperating with the eviction drives even if the authorities have a court order. “The smart cities mission programme mostly focussed on new public parks and multi-level car parking in particular areas. If they (previous government) had done their work properly in addressing the basic needs, such situation would not have come,” Nehru said. Later, inspecting the Karumandapam locality, the minister instructed the corporation and state highways department to widen the drain channels carrying surplus water from E Pudur and Kollankulam tank to the Koraiyar river. He also inspected the bund strengthening work underway along the Koraiyar river. The work on the Trichy side will prevent inundation in Selva Nagar, RMS Colony and Vasantha Nagar localities, the minister was told. He also instructed the PWD and the corporation to clear the weeds on the banks of channels and canals and desilt the waterbodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retaining-walls-to-be-built-along-trichy-canals-to-stop-inundation/articleshow/87745653.cms||---

This has left the parents worried as the state government had already allowed schools to reopen with 100% capacity from November 15. The state government guidelines do not direct schools to continue online classes for students who are still scared to come to school amid mild rise in Covid cases. Majority of the schools have discontinued online classes after the government gave permission to reopen with 100% capacity, even as parents are demanding online classes to continue. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh, said they were getting complaints from parents from all across the city that they were forced to send their wards to school as online classes had been stopped. “After Diwali, there has been a rise in Covid cases in the state. How can the government guarantee social distancing for the small kids? They are playing with lives of students who are vulnerable. The government should make it clear its stand on online classes. They should not leave this discretion in the hands of private schools who are here to reap benefits,” said Bittu. Parents association have given a seven-day ultimatum to the government to issue order to implement online classes as well or they will take to streets to protect their rights. Last year, seven teachers tested positive during complete lockdown when a private school called teachers to school to take online classes. For schools that do not have adequate facility for online classes and parents coming from lower income backgrounds cannot afford gadgets, offline classes are the only option. Majority of parents from that social background are relieved that schools have opened up and education of students can finally take a step forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-students-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/87746330.cms||---

TP executive officer Maheboob Jeelani has constructed a badminton court in his office premises by spending his money. This is to improve the efficiency among the staff members by helping them unwind. Now, they play badminton before and after the office hours. Jeelani has also decorated his office with the portraits of great personalities. Jeelani told TOI: “All this is to ensure people get better services from the office. Our staff would be tired after working from morning till evening, prompting some of them to smoke or booze to unwind. But if they are made to involve in any physical activity, they get rejuvenated without having to surrender to bad habits. If they go home smiling, their family members too will be happy, and this collectively get them ready for the next working day. In the larger iterest of the public, I have built this court.” When asked about the cost of his pet project, the officer said he did not keep account of the expenses on what he termed ‘love’s labour’. “It did not cost me big,” he added. He has also beautified the interiors of the office. “Photos of great souls were stored in a room. We cleaned the entire office and put those photo up on the walls. They are needed to celebrate the birth anniversary of great personalities as per the government order,” he stated. Rajanikant Nimbalkar, manager of the office, said higher officers usually do not think about keeping their subordinates rejuvenated. “With our executive officer motivating us to play, many staff members are coming early to office and play badminton. Some play after the office hours. We feel more energised to perform our duties,” he said. Suresh Kolakar, Jumanal GP member, said the Vijayapura TP office has donned a new look after the new EO assumed charge recently. “The office staff have turned courteous towards the public. It has also made them efficient — speedy disposal of files and hastening of works of gram panchayats stand testimony to that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/tp-officer-builds-badminton-court-for-his-staff-to-unwind/articleshow/87743991.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The government college teachers are facing many problems here. There are not adequate numbers of staff, and full-time faculty are on deputation to colleges,” said a senior PU lecturer. Regarding the difficulties, the lecturer said that offline classes in colleges began 45 days back, however, the DPUE has stated that close to 60% of the portion will be covered in the mid-term examination. “How is it possible to cover 60% of the syllabus, when classes have hardly been held for 45 days? The evaluation of government college students are done by private college teachers. This is not fair, as there is a huge learning gap among private and government college students,” the lecturer said. Another lecturer said, “It has been announced all of a sudden, and there is insufficient time to prepare for the examination. Most of the government college students who work on weekends prepare for examinations only after December.” “The department has asked lecturers to evaluate 30 papers a day, and also conduct classes after the mid-term examination. This is impractical,” said a PU lecturer. Karnataka PU College Lecturers Association president Ningegowda A H, in a letter to the DPUE, has expressed concern over the shortage of manpower for the midterm examination. “The department should have announced mid-term examination plans during the start of the academic year. It is cumbersome and unscientific to evaluate examination papers as well as conduct classes. Evaluation by guest faculty is not a welcome move. The department has not yet uploaded model question papers, and it would have saved more time if mid-term examinations of both I PU and II PU were conducted simultaneously,’’ he said. C D Jayanna, DDPU, Dakshina Kannada said that they have not received any memorandum from government college PU lecturers regarding the inconvenience. Meanwhile, PU students, including those from private colleges have also opposed mid-term examinations, which have been announced in a hurry. The DPUE has proposed to change the midterm examination pattern this academic year, where it will prepare question papers, and instead of at the district level, there will be centralised evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pu-lecturers-students-oppose-ii-pu-mid-term-examination/articleshow/87743982.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Chief minister M K Stalin has announced a compensation of up to Rs 20,000 per hectare for crops that were damaged during the recent rains. The government also announced to provide agriculture input to farmers. A statement issued by K Balakrishnan said that the heavy rain and floods have completely damaged the crops ready for harvest and the recently transplanted samba nurseries in the delta districts, which caused great economic loss to the farmers. He welcomed the chief minister’s visit to the rain-affected areas and his consoling of the farmers. However, the relief announced by the government for crop loss is not sufficient, he said. Farmers have to spend Rs 50,000 to raise paddy crops in a hectare and up to Rs 20,000 per acre. So, the amount announced would in no way compensate for the loss incurred by the farmers in delta , Balakrishnan said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cpm-seeks-to-enhance-compensation/articleshow/87745664.cms||---

---||Lucknow||It’s an expressway for development of the new Uttar Pradesh, says PM Modi||LUCKNOW/SULTANPUR: Hailing the Purvanchal expressway as a medium to take the state towards a brighter future, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he could not have imagined that he would land on the same expressway of which he laid the foundation stone three years ago. Speaking after inaugurating India's longest functional expressway (341 km), he said: “It is an expressway for development of new UP, a reflection of modernized facilities and a certification of turning Sankalp into Siddhi," recounting various upcoming expressways including Ganga expressway, Bundelkhand expressway, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ballia Link expressway. He said that the development of the state was planned not just for five year but keeping in mind the entire decade. He also witnessed the Airshow on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Expressway in Sultanpur district. The event at Sultanpur ended with an air show by Mirage, Jaguar, Sukhoi & AN-32 before the PM took off for Delhi in a C-130J HerculesIAF jets perform aerial stunts during inauguration of Purvanchal ewayModi said that the state was poised for a balanced development with “samman” (respect) for West UP measuring equally with the “prathmikta” (priority) for east UP. “Purvanchal Expressway has not only filled the gap between east and west but will also facilitate movement of people from Bihar and Delhi,” he further said. Modi stressed that the expressway will also bring enormous employment opportunities through the industries which are proposed to be set up in the Purvanchal Expressway Industrial Corridor, underscoring that the project will especially be of great help for the areas which are still “underdeveloped”. The PM lauded CM Yogi Adityanath and his team, and the people of UP on the completion of Purvanchal Expressway. He also thanked the farmers whose land was acquired for this project. He lauded the workers and the engineers who were involved in the project. The PM remarked that the security of the country was equally important as the prosperity of the country. He said that keeping that in mind, emergency landing provision for fighter jets is made while constructing the Purvanchal Expressway. He said that the roar of these planes will be for those who ignored the defense infrastructure in the country for decades. Modi said that with the active participation of the people, the dream of development of UP was now visible. "New medical colleges are being built, AIIMS is coming up, modern educational institutions are being built in UP. Just a few weeks ago the international airport in Kushinagar was inaugurated," he said. The PM said it was also a fact that parts of a vast state like UP were earlier cut off from each other to a great extent. People used to go to different parts of the state but they were troubled due to lack of connectivity. For the people of East Uttar Pradesh, even reaching Lucknow was quite a task. He noted that for industrial development of Uttar Pradesh, excellent connectivity is necessary, every corner of UP needs to be connected. He said as expressways are getting ready in UP, the work of the industrial corridor has also started. Very soon new industries will start coming up around Purvanchal Expressway. He said that the Defence Corridor being built in UP was also going to bring new employment opportunities here. He said these infrastructure works in UP, will give new heights to the economy in the future. The PM said today the double engine government in UP was working considering the common people of UP as their family. An environment is being created for new factories. He said keeping in mind the needs of this decade, infrastructure is being built to build a prosperous Uttar Pradesh. The PM also lauded the Government of Uttar Pradesh for its excellent work done for Corona Vaccination. He lauded the people of UP for not allowing any political propaganda against the vaccine made in India to propagate. He said the government is working day and night for the all-round development of UP. Along with connectivity, top priority is also being given to infrastructure in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-its-an-expressway-for-development-of-the-new-up/articleshow/87746361.cms||Pankaj Shah

Having been dubbed as possessed, he was at the mercy of the village godman for his treatment, which however, showed no hope. In 2000, he reached the free epilepsy camp run by a neurosurgeon of Jodhpur and underwent treatment, which lasted for over five years. “He is leading a normal life working at a salt company in Saurasthra with his wife and two children,” said Nagendra Sharma, whose camps have affected the lives of 80,067 such patients since the inception of his free medical camps back in 1999. This is just one example. In these 22 years, over 8,000 patients are fully cured and came out of the trauma of ostracisation and social stigma of having ‘mirgi’, as epilepsy is commonly identified as. Sharma decided to hold these camps seeing the absence of proper treatment for the poor patients and their falling into the trap of village godmen due to widespread superstitions linking the disease with ‘possession by spirits’. Considering the inability of the poor rural patients to afford the treatment, which cost around Rs 800 for a month’s dose, he arranged for free medicines for them so that they could continue the treatment. One of his camp coordinators Kishan Prajapat said that in these 22 years of journey, many have gotten married and settled in life, many started working to lead an independent life and many children were enabled to resume their education, which they were forced to quit due to bouts of fits. Sharma said that the camps and these success stories have brought a huge change in the perception of the disease, especially among the villagers and they have started frequenting these camps for treatment instead of approaching godmen and have been recovering. He has also been running awareness campaigns in villages with literature printed for distribution. He has also written two books on epilepsy. His team has also started an initiative for financial independence of these patients, which are normally not accepted by the society. They have arranged for their vocational training as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/this-surgeon-cured-8k-epilepsy-patients-at-free-camps-in-22-yrs/articleshow/87746348.cms||---

The party would prepare a vision document, (Sankalp Patra) for the 2021 MC elections based on these suggestions and aspirations, Sood said. Addressing a press conference, Sood said the ongoing farmers’ stir would only affect small pockets rather than the entire city and the party was prepared for that. Responding to a question, Sood said that farm leader Rakesh Tikait did not have a standing in Chandigarh. Recently, Tikait urged people not to vote for the BJP in the forthcoming MC elections. Sood said this statement would not affect Chandigarh residents. On the contrary, he said, wherever Rakesh Tikait or “so-called” farmer leaders issued a statement against the BJP, the vote share increased. He said this was last seen in Haryana’s Ellenabad by-election, where Rakesh Tikait and farmer leaders’ statement was followed by increase in BJP’s vote count by 15,000. He claimed the rate of inflation was under control in comparison with the situation under the Congress regime. Sood said the BJP wanted to ensure public participation in the process of making Chandigarh a world class city .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-movement-will-not-impact-entire-chandigarh-arun-sood/articleshow/87744872.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Farmers said a breach on the banks of Konakadungalaru had caused the situation. They are struggling to drain the rainwater to save standing crops. Following the rain, a 20-foot-long breach occurred on the banks of Konakadungalaru near Varagur and Aimbathumel Nagarm in Thiruvaiyaru taluk. Rainwater flowed through the breach and submerged crops raised on about 1,500 acres in Aimbathumel Nagaram, Kadambangudi, Varagur, Nadukavery, Anthali and Kuzhimathur villages. The 15-day transplanted nursery also submerged in water, farmers said. Konakadungalaru takes a course from Vennaru river near Agarapettai and merges with Vettaru near Nagathi village. The river irrigates about 3,000 acres of agricultural land in its path. Farmers said a huge growth of hyacinth accumulated on the upper stream of a causeway that bridges Aimbathumel Nagaram and Anthali villages.Thiruvaiyaru tahsildar Nedunchezhian and VAO Rajesh arrived at the spot and expedited the removal of hyacinth with the help of around 50 farmers.

The remark came after the central government informed the Supreme Court that the contribution of stubble burning was a mere 4%. “There was a debate among experts, media and people throughout the day about the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution. The Centre submitted two contrasting statements in a single affidavit. While one page mentioned the figure as 4%, another page said the share was 35-40%. Both statements cannot be true. Therefore, I request the Union environment minister to clarify the facts and statements publicly,” said Rai. Showing the data of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), Rai said, “The average contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 from November 4 to 14 was around 31%. SAFAR is a central government organisation and the data was also submitted to the court by the Centre. I request the Union environment minister to give a clarification at the earliest so that we can devise the right strategy regarding pollution and in the future we can all come together to find an immediate and permanent solution to it.” Track the pollution level in your cityCommenting on the joint meeting taken by the Commission for Air Quality Management with the states on the order of the Supreme Court, Rai said, “In this meeting, on behalf of the people of Delhi, we proposed that work-from-home be implemented and all construction work and industries in Delhi-NCR be shut. The other states presented their proposals too. We are awaiting the minutes of the meeting. We hope that this meeting will result in a joint action plan for reducing pollution levels.” The environment minister said as the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign was coming to end on November 18, Delhi government had decided to run its second phase from November 19 to December 3 considering the prevailing pollution situation and for reducing vehicular pollution. Just like the first phase, 2,500 civil defence volunteers would continue to create awareness among people at 100 traffic intersections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-must-clear-the-air-on-share-of-farm-fires-in-delhi-pollution-rai/articleshow/87745705.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Schools face Rs 1 lakh fine for not introducing mandatory Marathi||NAGPUR: The state education department has asked all its divisional-level officials to start issuing notices for a Rs 1 lakh fine to those schools that haven’t implemented Marathi as a mandatory subject yet. Marathi has been mandatory in all schools across the state, regardless of the affiliating board, but in a phased manner which means only specific classes come under its ambit at present. In 2020, the state legislature passed a bill to make Marathi mandatory in all schools. The law also has a provision of a fine up to Rs 1 lakh for non-compliance. From the 2020-21 session, Marathi became mandatory for Std I and VI. Then every academic year, the next level of class comes under the purview of this rule, thus giving majority of non-Marathi speaking students ample time to prepare a foundation. But now in the second year of implementation, the education department has recieved complaints that Marathi has still not been introduced as a mandatory subject in some schools. Due to the pandemic and schools being closed in many places, there was no aggressive follow up. State education director (primary) Dinkar Temkar wrote to all deputy directors of education on Monday, saying that it’s time to act against such erring schools. “Action can be taken against these schools as per section 12 of our bye-laws. Send a showcause notice to these schools asking why we should not levy a Rs 1 lakh fine on them. Hear their side first and if their reply is not satisfactory or if they have not even started the process of introducing Marathi as a subject then under section 12 (2), even the district-level officials can act,” said Temkar in his letter. The letter cites multiple bye-laws and clauses so as not to keep his directives vague or receive letters from local officials about not having powers to levy such hefty fines. “Under section 12 (3), local officials can send the full report to the education director for recovery of fine from such schools,” said Temkar. Local education officials will now start enquiring with schools about the status of their Marathi subject implementation. An official said, “Once the data comes in then action can be taken against schools that have not complied with the law.” Similarly, citizens too can inform the education department if schools are not following the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-face-rs-1-lakh-fine-for-not-introducing-mandatory-marathi/articleshow/87745683.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Where do we go now? AQI third worst in country||NEW DELHI: Air quality in the city slipped into the “severe” category again on Tuesday after hovering in the “very poor” range for the past two days. Experts see no relief any time soon. With an AQI of 403, the capital stood the third-most polluted city in the country next only to Jind (AQI 428) and Manesar (AQI 410), data from Central Pollution Control Board showed. PM2.5 levels remained over three times the safe limit. Experts said the city was in dire need of emergency steps to curb further accumulation of pollutants. On Tuesday, the meteorological conditions allowed further accumulation of pollutants with low mixing height keeping them below the surface, calm winds failing to ventilate the area and low temperature making air heavy and holding the pollutants tighter. Weather analysts expect the wind speed to drop further. “The wind on Tuesday was northwesterly and the speed was not strong enough to disperse pollutants. The wind may turn easterly, but the speed will be low and unfit for dispersion of pollutants. A combination of other meteorological factors will restrict improvement in the air quality,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. “Wind speed on Wednesday is likely to be around 4 kmph and minimum and maximum temperature may hover around 8 and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively,” said an India Meteorological Department official. SAFAR said the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s PM2.5 on Tuesday came down to 8% against 10% on Monday. Surface winds were likely to remain very low for the next few days. However, the number of farm fires may drop too. “Surface winds are likely to be very calm with a low ventilation index, pushing AQI to fluctuate between severe to the upper end of the very poor category till November 18. The peak in fire count appears to have reached last week and stubble burning is now showing a declining trend,” added SAFAR. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “What the city actually needs is a long-term action plan to curb pollution throughout the year, but it also needs to stop further accumulation of pollutants through emergency action plans because the ventilation is low.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/where-do-we-go-now-aqi-third-worst-in-country/articleshow/87745690.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The MSEDCL also took away the electricity meters of around 128 schools over pending bills. Pune zilla parishad (ZP) vice-president Ranjit Shivtare said the pendency was due to the closure of schools because of Covid-19 and the non-receipt of grants from the Centre. He said the local panchayats had been asked to help pay the electricity bills for their respective schools. Pune ZP has 3,639 primary schools under its umbrella while around 2,680 secondary schools belong to private managements or trusts. “The electricity meters of 128 ZP schools were removed and power was snapped to over 500 primary schools. During our review meeting, we learnt that the Central government grant (Rs5,000-10,000) under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan had not been given to schools for the past one year. This is the money the schools use for paying bills, among other dues,” Shivtare said. “We have requested the respective gram panchayats to pay off bills in instalments wherever they can within the next three weeks. We will hold a review again next month to check the status and decide on further course of action. The pending electricity dues are to the tune of Rs 2.28 crore. We had initially written to the government and the electricity board to waive off the amount, but that may not be possible,” Shivtare added. An MSEDCL official said that it was true that electricity dues had increased in the rural parts of the region which had resulted in connections being snapped. But now that the ZP officials have said they would be paying up, the power connections would be restored, he said. The official said that urban or corporation areas usually make consistent payments with regard to power dues of schools and other civic facilities. However, pendcy in rural areas in terms of schools, water supply or street lights are generally high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/power-snapped-to-1-8k-schools-in-dist-over-dues/articleshow/87745686.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Curfew in Amravati to continue till next week: Police||Amravati: Even as situation in the violence-hit city is limping back to normalcy after November 12-13 flare-up, the police administration said on Tuesday that curfew will be extended till next week and restrictions on internet services will continue for two more days as a precautionary measure. “We are granting relaxation in curfew, but lifting the prohibitory order totally is currently out of question. It will continue till next week,” said additional DGP of Maharashtra Rajendra Singh while addressing a press conference at CP office here on Tuesday. CP Aarti Singh was also present at the time of briefing. Police had clamped the curfew on Saturday for four days after stones were hurled at shops during the bandh called by BJP, a day after incidents of stone-pelting took place during a rally called by a Muslim organisation in protest against purported communal violence in Tripura. On Tuesday, police relaxed the curfew for two hours from 2pm to 4pm. The relaxation may continue on Wednesday as well for two or four hours. Singh said police have registered 11 offences in connection with November 12 violence and 24 cases in connection with November 13 rioting and arrested 188 accused till 12 noon of Tuesday. When asked how BJP leaders including former minister Anil Bonde, Amravati mayor and others could get bail when non-bailable offences had been registered against them, Singh refused to comment saying it was court’s decision. “The process of identification of the accused persons and arrests is on. Everything is under investigation. Police are also looking into conspiracy angle,” Singh said. He thanked citizens for cooperating with the police in establishing peace and urged them to maintain communal harmony. “Differences must be sunk and no provocative language should be used,” he said. Singh praised police for acting in time during the turbulent period to establish normalcy. “We did not use any lethal weapons to tame the miscreants. We achieved peace using the least force. Today, around 2,500 cops are keeping the situation normal in the city,” he said. Speaking at a gathering of party functionaries and MLAs in Mumbai on Tuesday, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the objective of the violence was to polarize society. “The violence seen in cities like Amravati and Malegaon was part of a planned strategy to push society towards communal polarization. It was an experiment to test people’s response. We have to be careful about this in the coming days,” he said. “There were seven companies of the State Reserve Police Force in Amravati on the day violence erupted. But these were not even used. Why didn’t the state government issue orders to these companies,” asked the leader of opposition in the state assembly. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “Local police confirmed that they had given permission for a rally of 200-300 people on Friday. But more than 20,000 people were on the streets and it created a law and order situation. Was it an intelligence failure?” Some shop owners had been asked not to remain open that day, which means the rally had been planned, he alleged. ‘Somaiya agreed to put on hold Amravati visit’ Singh also told media persons that BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has accepted the request of Amravati CP Aarti Singh to withdraw his proposed tour of Amravati scheduled for Wednesday. Singh said the CP had written to Somaiya not to visit the city in view of the curfew situation. “He has agreed to the request and decided to withdraw his tour,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curfew-in-amravati-to-continue-till-next-week-police/articleshow/87745704.cms||---

Around 5 am, the fire broke out in the sanctum sanctorum of Ashapura Temple. The priest Munna Maharaj, who sleeps inside the temple, was stuck when the fire started as the temple was locked from outside. The priest started shouting for help hearing which his family members sleeping in a room adjoining the temple woke up and called the villagers. The villagers broke the lock to rescue the priest and also tried dousing the blaze. However, the fire had engulfed a large portion of the temple following which fire brigade from Karjan municipality and Vadodara city were called in. The fire was brought under control after a fire fighting operation of two hours. Firemen said that preliminary investigation points at short-circuit as the cause of the fire. Karjan police are investigating the case. Villagers said that the temple will now be restored to its original form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/close-shave-for-priest-after-fire-breaks-out-in-temple/articleshow/87745030.cms||---
---||Dehradun||To plug gaps, health dept chart a way forward for rehab registration||Dehradun: Finding operational gaps following an RTI query that revealed the state machinery lacked any data on rehabilitation centres or the rules governing them, Dehradun health department has now started working on registering these establishments. Backed by information obtained through the RTI query -- filed by advocate Shiva Verma on August 6 -- TOI had reported that the state machinery has no data repository. Following the revelation, centres in Dehradun have been under the scanner. A few women at the centre in Clement Town, on the outskirts of the city, have even alleged sexual exploitation by the manager. On October 24, a 30-year-old man had died after his health deteriorated at the rehab centre in Nehru Colony. The family had later lodged an FIR pressing murder charges against the management. Following these incidents, district administration has issued guidelines for registering these establishments. "We will now start writing to de-addiction centres operating here to register themselves with us earliest by next month. This will ensure better monitoring and accountability. The administration is already carrying out inspections. Some of the shady centres have begun to shut operations for fear of legal action. We believe that with the registration process, we will be able to weed out several others and only genuine bodies will remain active," said Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer. De-addiction centres are generally registered as trusts. Under the new guidelines, they will be registered as part of the Clinical Establishment Act and Mental Healthcare Act. The centres will be required to pay a one-time registration fee of Rs 50,000 and an annual fee of Rs 25,000. Following the registration, health department teams will inspect the centres and report lapses, if any. Most rehab centres are in favour of the new guidelines. "The recent incidents have brought to light issues with some of the centres. It is good to have regular checks. All these institutions rely heavily on couselling and emotional support, and if the government can get work on these areas, the centres will thrive," said Uday Singh, who runs a centre on Sahastradhara road. Management of these centres is also on board with random inspections by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-plug-gaps-health-dept-chart-a-way-forward-for-rehab-registration-/articleshow/87744876.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Mangaluru||Parents allege harassment by pvt school over fee||Mangaluru: Several parents of students admitted to a private school here have alleged that the school management is harassing them over non-payment of fees, and targeting them for speaking up against the institution. The private international school in Adyar is now allegedly asking parents, who earlier protested against the school, to pay fees in its entirety. The school management allegedly told the parents that their wards will not be allowed to use the school bus service, and also threatened to not allow them to appear for examinations, if they failed to do so. Mohammed Sadiq, a fish vendor and resident of Thumbe, whose son studies in class III, said that he had been paying fees in instalments since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Last year, when the management demanded full fees, the government guidelines allowed to collect only 70% of tuition fee for 2019-2020. This year, the school is asking us to pay full fees, including that of last academic year. When we said we were unable to pay the same, and requested to pay in instalments. They prevented my child from using the school bus service, and also threatened to not allow him to appear for the examination which is scheduled on November 23,’’ he alleged. “There are parents who have not paid a single penny in fees last year, but their children have been allowed to attend classes. Me and a few other parents became the victims of a witch-hunt, because we questioned the wrongdoing of the school management. The school bus did not pick up my child on Friday, and he was left on the road. The school management, during admissions, had promised many facilities, however, till date it has no amenities, including a mandatory playground for children,” he said. When TOI contacted the school manager, he maintained the school is not forcing anyone to pay fees. “We are only collecting 70% of last year’s and 85% of this year’s fees from parents, and have not stopped any child from appearing for examinations, even if they have not paid fees,’’ he said. DDPI Malleswamy warned that schools have no right to stop a student from academic activities. “The aggrieved parents can approach our office and lodge a written complaint. We will take necessary action in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/parents-allege-harassment-by-pvt-school-over-fee/articleshow/87743994.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Previous government had handed over Uttar Pradesh to mafia, poverty: PM Modi||LUCKNOW/SULTANPUR: Unleashing a frontal attack on the Samajwadi Party, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the leaders of the previous state government did not even wish to stand along his side “fearing loss of vote bank”. “Un logon ko mere bagal mein khade rehne mein bhi dar lagta tha…ki kahi vote bank ka nuksaan na ho jaye,” Modi said, after inaugurating the 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway in Sultanpur. Modi averment marked a pointed offensive at Akhilesh Yadav-led SP which has been positioning itself aggressively against the BJP to thwart its bid of coming back to power after 2022 assembly elections. His reference to “vote bank” was also seen as an indication of BJP lending traction to a potential bipolar electoral contest with the SP which is markedly backed by Muslims and OBC, mainly the Yadavs. Stepping up the aggression further, Modi said that whenever he used to visit UP, they (leaders in SP government) used to “vanish” after “receiving him”. “Unko itni sharam aati thi....kaam ka hisaab dene ke liye unke pass kuch tha hi nahi (they didn't have anything to show in the name of work),” he said. In fact, the PM said, the state was subjected to “punishment” by “handing it” over to the “mafia and poverty” decades after decades. “Akhir UP ko kis baat ki saja di ja rahi thi,” he asked, stressing that after becoming the PM and as an MP from the state, he started delving deep into the causes of backwardness of the state and started many efforts including providing houses, toilets and electricity. “But the then state government did not help me and continued to do injustice to the people,” he said, recalling how various schemes brought by his government were kept in abeyance by the previous SP dispensation. In an apparent swipe at the Congress and SP, Modi said that both Delhi and Lucknow were largely dominated by “Parivarwadis”. “Their partnership kept trampling the aspirations of the people of UP,” he charged. Terming the opposition ranks as being only inclined to restrict “development” to their “own family and house”, the PM said that people of UP banished “such people” forever from the developmental trajectory of the state. “Aur 2017 mein aapne Yogi ji (CM Yogi Adityanath) ko…aur Modi ji (himself) ko apni seva karne ka mauka diya,” the PM said. Modi also hit out at the SP accusing it over the `frail’ law and order situation, prolonged power outages and lopsided industrial development. “UP mein raah nahi hote thi raahjani hoti thi (UP did not have the roads but road holdups),” he said. “Now those involved in street crime are in jail and new roads are being constructed in villages and cities,” he said, lauding the Yogi Adityanath government for putting the entire state on a growth pathway without "nepotism” and without any discrimination in terms of caste and region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/previous-govt-had-handed-over-up-to-mafia-poverty-says-modi/articleshow/87746371.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Knot ‘6Z’: From Russia with love||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s birdwatchers had reason to cheer when for the third year in a row, a great knot (Calidris tenuirostris), a shorebird tagged in Russia and code-named ‘6Z’, returned to the coastal village of Balachadi in Jamnagar district. Re-sightings of the shorebird for three consecutive migratory seasons may be a strong sign of Balachadi being a favoured wintering ground for these birds. Many experts now hope that Gujarat and India’s long coastline will provide a safe haven for the waders amid their habitat loss in China and Africa. "The great knot uses both the Central Asia Flyway (CAF) and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) for migration. Due to depleting mudflats in parts of China, there is a hypothesis that an increasing number of shorebirds could be using the CAF over EAAF," said Dishant Parasharya, an ornithologist working with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The intertidal mudflats provide critical habitats for shorebirds for roosting and foraging. Parasharya said much research needs to be done on both the flyways before one can arrive at any strong conclusion. The CAF covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and Indian Ocean and the associated island chains. The EAAF is the name given to the route flown annually by Australia’s migratory shorebirds to and from their breeding grounds above the Arctic Circle in Alaska and Siberia, and it extends from Arctic Russia and North America to New Zealand. The re-sighting of the 6Z for three successive migratory seasons lays to rest any doubts about Balachadi being only a stopover site for this bird. An iconic bird among waders, the great knot is a species of concern amongst the shorebirds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status of the species has been revised from that of ‘Least Concern’ in 2014 to Endangered in 2019. It has been identified among Top 20 priority species for conservation in the Central Asian Flyway for India according to the National Action Plan (2018).  Tagged in Kamchatka he large-scale loss and degradation of important resting habitats along their migratory journey, notably at the Yellow Sea in China, is widely thought to be driving the general population decrease in migratory shorebirds and especially in great knots, says Yashodhan Bhatia, an avid birdwatcher who spotted the ‘6Z’, and who along with Ashish Pankhania had visited the intertidal area of Balachadi coast on October 6, 2019 when they had first spotted the bird. The duo was photographing and observing flocks of waders where they spotted around 20 great knots in a mixed flock that also had bar-tailed godwits. They were surprised to find a leg band on one of the great knots. "On further observation and after some more clicks, we noticed that there were two leg flags on the tibia of the left leg of the bird. A black flag without any number was placed over a yellow band which had ‘6Z’ engraved on it in black. A metal ring on the right leg was also visible," says Bhatia. Through a shorebird tagging protocol chart, they concluded it might be a bird tagged in Russia. With the help of BNHS, the duo mailed photographs to researchers working in Russia and East Asia. They received a message from one Dmitry Dorofeev that this individual had been tagged in Kamchatka in far Eastern Russia by him on July 17, 2019. Habitat threat from nearby ship-breaking yard?The frequent occurrence of globally endangered species on the west coast of the country evidently proves the importance of the suitable habitat conditions for the species here. Bhatia says that in the past, the great knot was documented in detail from southern parts of India with its population, status and other data. However, from the west coast, the reports have increased significantly for the last one decade. Last year, another great knot, with a green over orange band on its right tibia was sighted at Akshi Beach near Mumbai. It was probably tagged in August 2020 at Yalujiang, China. "There are sporadic reports that show that the bird is increasingly moving westwards rather than along its earlier path southwards. There was the report of a great knot tagged in Russia being sighted in UAE last year," says Bhatia, who is planning to publish a research paper on the 6Z. The Balachadi site that is home to shorebirds like bar-tailed godwits, great knots, grey plovers, crab plovers, Eurasian curlews, whimbrels, terek sandpipers, lesser and greater sand plovers, and is part of the Marine National Park and sanctuary is facing a potential threat from a ship-breaking yard at nearby Sachana. The Gujarat government had last year given a green light to restart the yard after issues pertaining to environment clearances were resolved, said sources. "The work in the yard has been slow due to the pandemic. Also, the plot numbers and their sizes are very small compared to the Alang Ship Breaking Yard near Bhavnagar, on which it is modelled," said government sources. Parasharya of BNHS said there is a need to study the long-term impact of the ship-breaking yard on the bird population at Balachadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/knot-6z-from-russia-with-love/articleshow/87745716.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jobseekers fume as Saudi collects Rs 800 as ‘passport sanitisation’ fee||MUMBAI: Indians seeking employment in Saudi Arabia have strongly protested against collection of Rs 800 as “passport sanitisation” fee before every visa application is processed. Recruitment agents here said the Saudi consulate has outsourced the “sanitisation” work to some private agencies in the city. “It is a racket to fleece the jobseekers who are already financially weak due to the lockdown and are desperate to get jobs in oil-rich Saudi,” said a major recruitment agent in the city requesting anonymity. Two months ago, Mohammed Ghufran (name changed on request), a carpenter, approached a recruitment agent with a request to find him a carpenter’s job in Saudi Arabia. “There was a vacancy, but the agent told me to deposit Rs 1,50,000, including Rs 800 for passport sanitisation, before I was given visa and a ticket. I couldn’t collect this huge amount as I was jobless during the lockdown and have no source of income. I don’t understand why I have to pay Rs 800 for sanitisation of my passport while sanitisation of my hands everywhere is free,” said Ghufran. Despite a call and an email, the Saudi consulate in Mumbai could not be contacted for a response. Abdul Karim, president of the Indian Personnel Export Promotion Council (IPEPCL) that represents around 450 registered recruitment agents from across the country, said he has written to the Indian government to raise the issue with the Saudi authorities and work towards removing this need for “sanitisation of passport” as part of compliances for visa application. “Why should jobseekers be given this extra burden? We hope the Indian government will get this revoked by the Saudi authorities soon,” said Karim. He added that before the lockdown, 28 lakh Indian expats were in Saudi Arabia. Around four lakh came back because of the changed employment rules. “Out of the 24 lakh Indian expats in Saudi Arabia, around two lakh who came to India in pre-Covid days on leave and got stuck here now want to go back,” said Karim. But before entering Saudi Arabia, travellers from India have to quarantine for 14 days in a third country. “The jobseekers have to pay for their 14-day stay in, say, Dubai, Uzbekistan or Russia before they are permitted to travel to Saudi Arabia,” said Fahad Ahmed, PhD scholar and a student leader at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) whom some unemployed youths looking for jobs in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, have approached to fight on their behalf. A source in the recruitment industry said recruitment agents are asked to deposit the job applicant’s passports with the “sanitisation agencies” which, after taking Rs 800 per passport, returns the passports in sealed envelopes with a direction not to open them but hand over the passports to the Saudi consulate. “The visa is processed only after the consulate receives passports in sealed envelopes,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jobseekers-fume-as-saudi-collects-rs-800-as-passport-sanitisation-fee/articleshow/87745709.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

H K Aggarwal (85), a resident of Sector 54, Mohali, who led the effort, said that both stray and pet dogs caused problems like loud barking and open defecation. In the letter to the CM, he said that no local body or the state government had done anything about the issue despite it being part of candidates’ manifesto at the time of local body elections. Aggarwal, in his letter to the CM, stated, “My appeal to the chief minister Channi is to please fulfill the promise of tackling the 24-hour burning issue of menance created by stray as well as pet dogs, as this was a priority agenda of the ruling party in the manifesto of all the winning candidates in the local bodies' elections held last February, 2021.” He complained that the elderly need peaceful sleep but were disturbed by the barking and howling of stray dogs. The MC has no count of stray dogs on the streets of Mohali. Five years ago, an estimate was made and it was believed that there were around 4,000 stray dogs in Mohali. By 2021, the number crossed 7,000 despite the fact that the MC had outsourced the stray dog sterilisation work. As of now, the process of stray dog sterilisation has been halted for the past five months for want of fresh tendering process. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said fresh tenders are being called and soon, tenders would be allotted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stray-dogs-make-residents-uncomfortable-in-mohali/articleshow/87744881.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The court also set aside an order of the Central government issued on June 5 last year, saying the Kendriya Vishwavidyalaya had directed HNBGU to cancel affiliations of all its colleges. Following this, orders had been issued by the university’s registrar to cancel all affiliations. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma gave the Centre and the state two months to respond. Dehradun resident Ravindra Jugran, as well as some others, challenged this order in separate PILs at the high court. The petitioners argued that only the Central University Grants Commission (UGC) or the university, on order of the UGC, can take such a decision, not the government. The petitioners called the government’s 2020 order unconstitutional and said that the state should not be paying for the colleges affiliated to HNBGU, the centre should.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-sets-aside-centres-order-cancelling-affiliations-of-garhwal-university-colleges/articleshow/87744887.cms||---

---||Nagpur||India’s renewable power targets will lead to earlier phase-out of coal||Nagpur: The announcements made by India at the recently-concluded United Nations COP26 summit in Glasgow are all set to mark a historic beginning towards terminal decline of coal. Even though the country opposed the commitment to phase out coal, latest analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) reveals that the country’s target of renewable power generation capacity of 500 gigawatt (GW) by 2030 will likely provide all of India's additional electricity demand without increasing power generation from coal. According to the report titled ‘Powering Down Coal — COP26’s Impact on the Global Coal Power Fleet’, coal-fired generation of electricity will likely increase in the next few years in India, and then peak and decline as the addition of clean energy capacity accelerates towards the target. “This means that there is no case for adding new coal-fired power capacity. Also, the 500 GW target will already start the phase-down of coal in the country,” the analysis stated. Researchers further highlighted that the country’s 2070 carbon neutrality target date leaves ample space for existing coal power plants to run until their conventionally assumed operating lives, implying no early retirement. “The target of reaching renewable power generating capacity of 500 GW by 2030, up from 100 GW currently, will likely provide all of India’s additional electricity demand without increasing power generation from coal,” they said. The global climate meet COP26 witnessed strong opposition to the inclusion of ‘accelerating phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies’ — mainly from India and China. Both the largest coal consumers pledged carbon neutrality targets but refrained from any commitments on their domestic coal power sectors. As per researchers, this is unlikely to be a major cause of concern for India as its non-fossil electricity targets will “phase down” coal before 2030. “Phase-down or phase-out does not really matter much. Coal is on a terminal decline. Phase-down is also a step towards phase-out. We will see this change, not just on paper, but in the real world over the next year and more importantly, this decade” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA. The study further found that that the announcements and pledges made at Glasgow climate summit will directly impact 80% of planned coal-fired power plants around the world. “Glasgow climate summit might have failed on several fronts, including on loss and damage fund as well as on adaptation. However, COP26 has taken historic steps towards ending coal. This is not just optics, announcements and pledges made at Glasgow have real world consequences on the global coal industry” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at CREA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/indias-renewable-power-targets-will-lead-to-earlier-phase-out-of-coal/articleshow/87745712.cms||Manka Behl

The firm has already installed the chargers in 20 housing societies, with the company’s co-founders claiming that any hesitancy among housing society residents and office-bearers about the charging station safety, are being won over by safety measures in their chargers. “Safety is a genuine concern when it comes to installing chargers on society premises. We have multiple circuit breakers inside and outside the charger to account for power fluctuations, and we have been certified by the Automotive Research Association of India. It is also compatible with all well-known EV models,” Dheeman Kadam, co-founder of goEgo, said. Kadam added that its initial target of around 100 societies over the next three months may be achieved owing to the enquiries. goEgo rolls out its chargers on a security deposit and subscription model, with societies contractually bound to host the chargers for five years. Users are required to pay a per-unit fee through an app, with the company also rolling out a pay-and-go facility for non-society residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/startup-plans-ev-charging-stations-in-100-societies/articleshow/87744883.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The accused had raped the woman on October 27 and had threatened to kill her husband and children if she will approach the police. Two days after the incident, the woman lodged the case. According to police, the accused identified as Rakesh Bairwa had entered into the house of the woman while she was alone and raped her on October 27. “He had threatened her to keep mum else he will kill her husband and children. However, realising that the woman was upset, her husband enquired and that’s when she told him about the incident. Thereafter, the woman along with her husband approached us and narrated her plight and lodged a case of rape and criminal intimidation,” said a senior police officer of Kolwa police station of Dausa. Woman had also alleged that the accused had raped her four months ago as well but during then she was scared as he had threatened to kill her whole family. Soon after a case was lodged that accused escaped and was on the run. “We had constituted a special team of six policemen and also put his mobile phone on surveillance. On Tuesday, our cyber cell team gave an input that his location was somewhere near Jaipur. A team was sent and he was arrested,” the officer added.

The Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Act was introduced in June 2020. While state board schools were teaching Marathi, non-state boards—Central Board of Secondary Education, Council of Indian School Certificate Examination, Cambridge Board International General Certificate of Secondary Education, International Baccalaureate and National Institute of Open Schooling—have to introduce Marathi for classes I to VI, in a phased manner. In this academic year, Marathi has to be taught to classes I, II, VI and VII. The law has a provision of a fine up to Rs 1 lakh for non-com-pliance. But in the second year of its implementation, the state has received complaints that Marathi has still not been introduced as a mandatory subject in some schools. As physical sc-hools were closed during lockd-own, there was no follow-up. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-schools-face-rs-1l-fine-for-not-making-marathi-language-must/articleshow/87746879.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Lucknow||Promote public transport in NCR districts to control pollution, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: With air pollution levels on the rise, CM Yogi Adityanath held a meeting with senior officials on Tuesday morning and directed them to promote public transport over private transport, especially in the national capital region districts. Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday also informed the Supreme Court-appointed air monitoring committee that it was not in favour of a lockdown to control pollution levels. “The CM has asked for planned action at a local level to deal with pollution levels, especially in areas like Noida and Ghaziabad which are adjoining Delhi where pollution levels are in the severe category. In light of that, he said that they should be encouraged to use public transport,” said a government spokesperson. “Farmers are also to be sensitised about crop burning and told that it will harm not just them but also increase pollution,” said a government spokesperson. Additional chief secretary (environment), Manoj Kumar, said that during the meeting with the SC-appointed committee, the government laid out the various steps it is already taking to control pollution levels and is not in favour of a lockdown. “The SC had specifically mentioned two issues on which deliberations were needed. One was a lockdown and the other is stubble burning. UP is not in favour of a lockdown as it will impact our field officers who are tasked with enforcement work. Whatever work they are doing right now will also stop. Meanwhile, we are taking other steps like sprinkling of water on medians, roads and trees, planting grass where paving has not taken place, impounding vehicles which are older than 10-15 years, cracking down on illegal disposal of construction waste etc,” he said. An official said that UP was witnessing downward circulation of air which was bringing particulate matter from Punjab and Haryana where large scale farm fires were being reported from. The official said that UP had negligible stubble burning though recently, chief secretary RK Tiwari had written to district magistrates to crack down entirely on stubble burning. “The problem is that the wind velocity is negligible right now and will remain so till November 20. Because of this, there is no dispersal of PM, leading to high pollution levels. Despite that, UP is still only in the very poor category of air pollution,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/promote-public-transport-in-ncr-dists-to-control-pollution-yogi/articleshow/87746384.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kochi||Kerala: Accused in RSS worker’s murder under police protection, alleges BJP||PALAKKAD: The state treasurer of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and vice-chairman of Palakkad municipality E Krishnadas alleged that the accused in the murder of RSS worker Sanjith A is under police protection. Addressing media persons here on Tuesday, E Krishnadas and BJP national executive committee member PK Krishnadas said that SDPI terrorists are behind the murder of RSS worker Sanjith. “There is an unholy alliance between SDPI, CPM and its government in Kerala. The silence of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who holds the home ministry and the CPM state secretary is evidence of it. Such incidents show that terrorism is growing in Kerala,” said PK Krishnadas. Meanwhile, police recovered four swords abandoned in a gunny bag near the national highway at Kannanur near here on Tuesday. Blood stains were found on one sword. Forensic experts are conducting a detailed investigation to find out whether these weapons were used in Sanjith’s murder on Monday at Kinassery, said police. Ashitha, wife of Sanjith, told media persons that there were five assailants. While travelling on a bike they were hit by a car and when they fell down on the road one person dragged her to the canal and others hacked Sanjith in front of her. She said that she can identify the assailants who came in a Maruti Alto car. She and her husband shifted to her house two days ago as Sanjith had been receiving threats, she added. Seven teams have been formed to investigate the case and efforts are on to nab the accused, police said. Political enmity is the likely reason for the murder, police added. Earlier, there were clashes between RSS and SDPI in which Sanjith was injured. RSS had retaliated against SDPI too. These cases are under investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-in-rss-workers-murder-under-police-protection-alleges-bjp/articleshow/87745751.cms||---

For the purpose of encouraging people, the health department will do the marking on houses and also it will take help of religious leaders, NGOs and social activists to boost Covid-19 vaccination. “Har ghar dastak” campaign was launched on November 4 nationally, and now 13 days have passed of launching the campaign, but its impact on vaccination has not changed much. From November 4 to November 16, the doses administered to the beneficiaries were around 18 lakh. In 13 days (October 22to November 3) before the launch of Har Ghar Dastak, the number of doses administered were around 18 lakh. So, no big impact of the campaign has been seen yet.

Piaggio launched new vehicles under its premium sports two-wheeler Aprilia brand — the SR 160 and the SR 125, priced Rs1,17,494 and Rs1,07,595 respectively. Piaggio India’s chairman and managing director Diego Graffi, at the launch, said the new scooters are the first-in-segment to boast of features like ABS, and a 160cc engine, among others. The company conceded that a switch to electric vehicles was inevitable but said it would adopt a watch-and-evaluate measure for the Indian market. “We are monitoring the EV space as the market is still in its nascency and will decide the future course of action in around 6-8 months’ time,” the head of the company’s two-wheeler business, Sudhanshu Agrawal, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monitoring-nascent-ev-market-in-india-piaggio/articleshow/87744889.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Ahmedabad||Habitat threat from nearby ship-breaking yard?||The frequent occurrence of globally endangered species on the west coast of the country evidently proves the importance of the suitable habitat conditions for the species here. Bhatia says that in the past, the great knot was documented in detail from southern parts of India with its population, status and other data. However, from the west coast, the reports have increased significantly for the last one decade. Last year, another great knot, with a green over orange band on its right tibia was sighted at Akshi Beach near Mumbai. It was probably tagged in August 2020 at Yalujiang, China. "There are sporadic reports that show that the bird is increasingly moving westwards rather than along its earlier path southwards. There was the report of a great knot tagged in Russia being sighted in UAE last year," says Bhatia, who is planning to publish a research paper on the 6Z. The Balachadi site that is home to shorebirds like bar-tailed godwits, great knots, grey plovers, crab plovers, Eurasian curlews, whimbrels, terek sandpipers, lesser and greater sand plovers, and is part of the Marine National Park and sanctuary is facing a potential threat from a ship-breaking yard at nearby Sachana. The Gujarat government had last year given a green light to restart the yard after issues pertaining to environment clearances were resolved, said sources. "The work in the yard has been slow due to the pandemic. Also, the plot numbers and their sizes are very small compared to the Alang Ship Breaking Yard near Bhavnagar, on which it is modelled," said government sources. Parasharya of BNHS said there is a need to study the long-term impact of the ship-breaking yard on the bird population at Balachadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/habitat-threat-from-nearby-ship-breaking-yard/articleshow/87745756.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Naxal encounter in Gadchiroli: 27th body found, another top leader dead||NAGPUR: The number of casualties on the Maoist side in Gadchiroli encounter rose to 27 on Tuesday when body of rebel leader Sukhlal Parchapi was found on the hilly and forested terrains of Mardintola near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border in north Gadchiroli. On November 13, C60 jawans of Gadchiroli police had recovered 26 bodies of Maoist cadres, including that of top rebel leader Milind Teltumbde, from the same area. Police claimed Parchapi’s body was found stuck between two rocks and it was discovered after considerable search on the basis of inputs from a C60 jawan who had spotted him hit by bullet. Parchapi was promoted to the ranks of Dandakaranya special zonal committee a few months back entrusting him with the responsibility of a bigger region due to his seniority and “effectiveness”. It was earlier assumed that Parchapi may have fled from the encounter spot. Police are yet to arrive at any conclusion regarding the possible reason behind the Maoists of the two states, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, camping at the spot in such substantial numbers. On Tuesday, Gadchiroli police managed to identify seven bodies, which also include that of another bodyguard of central committee member Teltumbde. The bodyguard was identified as Somda alias Naresh Uika, a native of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh. Earlier, bodies of two bodyguards of Teltumbde had been identified. Police have so far ascertained the identity of 23 slain rebels, including 14 from Chhattisgarh. Four bodies are yet to be identified. SP Ankit Goyal said the neutralized cadres from Chhattisgarh were being identified on the basis of inputs from the police of that state and also records available with the district police headquarters. It’s learnt seven bodies have been handed over to family members of the deceased while rest have been kept in mortuary of the Gadchiroli district general hospital. Goyal said families of the neutralized cadres from Chhattisgarh are being contacted through the local police, which is taking time owing to their remote locations. “We will cremate unclaimed bodies after a certain period as per law,” he said. In response to some media reports, Goyal did not rule out the possibility of some part of the encounter spilling over to Chhattisgarh due to hilly terrain. “The Maoists were spread over a substantial area as several dalams and formations were present when the encounter took place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/c60-jawans-retrieve-27th-body-from-gadchiroli-encounter-site/articleshow/87745754.cms||Soumitra Bose

A new rule has been added to the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1992, providing registration reports of foreigners to be submitted electronically. Any application or information under the rules can be filed online , after which the registration officer will verify its genuineness. Only if necessary will the applicant or informant be called for a personal appearance for the purpose of this rule. “The purpose of the amended rules is to ease travel and stay by foreigners in India by eliminating the outdated procedures and replacing them with digitised formats. The initiative fits in with the ‘ease of living’ and ‘ease of doing business’ theme of the Modi government,” said a spokesperson for the ministry. The latest amendments in the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1992, according to a gazette notification dated November 12, omits Rule 7(1) specifying the procedure of registration and to whom the registration report must be presented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-now-takes-foreigners-registration-process-online/articleshow/87747596.cms||---

According to the fire brigade, the fire was reported around 4.45am in the electricity meter room of Rakhma Society by few residents who alerted their neighours and the civic officials. However, the residents were unable to exit the structure as the blaze had engulfed the common exit passage trapping them within the structure. Meanwhile, the fire fighters managed to douse the blaze and evacuated the residents as a precautionary measure. A preliminary inspection by the civic officials revealed sixteen electricity meters to have been completely destroyed in the fire. “Luckily, no one was injured in the blaze as the residents were shifted out in time.

---||Nagpur||Confrontation, counselling, vaccination: Har Ghar Dastak teams set out to jab all||Nagpur: Surjit Singh (53) claims his doctor has told him not to take Covid vaccine due to his renal problems. When additional chief medical officer Dr Narendra Bahirwar asks for the doctor’s number to verify the basis of the medical advisory, Singh gives evasive replies, making it clear he was trying skip the jab on flimsy ground. A few homes ahead, auto driver Azhar Ali (21) says he is afraid of the vaccine as he believes it may “leave him dead”. Surprisingly, family members of both Singh and Ali are already vaccinated! That does not stop Singh from raising his voice to tell the NMC team to leave, and not pester him. The team marks the number of vaccinated people at home and moves ahead. Zonal medical officer Dr Ateequr Raheman Khan is able to allay Ali’s fears, though, and a few moments later Ali takes his first jab. He delayed it by nearly five months after the government opened the drive for 18+ population. “I know it is compulsory but I had been told bad things about the vaccination. I thank the health team and NMC for helping us get jabbed at home,” Ali says. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has formed over 500 teams under the government’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive. Each team comprises a nurse and two Asha workers; assigned a daily target of 200 persons. Expecting hurdles, NMC initiated the drive from November 15 to complete first dose of 18+ people by November 30. On Tuesday, TOI accompanied a Mangalwari zone team going door to door in New Colony. Dr Bahirwar and Dr Khan paid a surprise visit to check the drive’s progress. Every alternate household presented a mix of apprehension, reluctance and adamant individuals refusing to get jabbed when the team visited them. Some relented following persuasion by the senior officers. The team quietly marks ‘P’ (protected) outside homes having fully vaccinated members or cross marks (X) signifying unvaccinated homes. As the team moved to nearby Goa Colony, a group of men and women charged at the Asha workers, who knocked on the door to ask if anyone was yet to be jabbed. Dr Bahirwar and Dr Khan intervened to stop the residents from bothering the health teams. “Some don’t even let us mark their homes,” said Asha worker Chandrakala Bhalavi. Nurse Bakuli Armarkar, and other two Asha workers Geeta Thulkar and Jayshri Gaikwad said the locals didn’t turn aggressive on Tuesday. “It is not an easy task. The threat of getting attacked is always there. Today, seniors are here so locals are not reacting much,” they said. Despite the odds, the team jabbed nearly 150, including 104 first doses, after reaching out to over 700 homes by the end of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/confrontation-counselling-vaccination-har-ghar-dastak-teams-set-out-to-jab-all/articleshow/87745795.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Lisa Pingale, owner of the art gallery, said, “Venues have not been functioning for close to two years due to the pandemic. While some hosted online art shows, I believe that art is tangible and must be seen up close to be properly appreciated. We have some big names from the art world showcasing their works at this event, which has garnered a lot of interest in the city’s art circuit.” The exhibition will feature notable contemporary works such as a large triptych by Satish Gupta called ‘Abundance’ from his Zen series and another piece inspired by his visit to Tirupati. “I wanted to capture the divine energy of Vishnu by going through the whole colour pallete to represent each of the 1,000 names given to the deity. For example, Tejas is represented by a fiery red,”said Gupta.

The municipality generates nearly 12 tonnes of wet waste and has increased its manure production by adding more units. Within six months, the city municipality will be able to process all the wet waste on its own without transporting it to Pachanady. CMC commissioner Rayappa said that the urban local body has been processing both dry and wet waste, generated by about 65,000 residents. “In another six months, no waste will be sent to Pachanady. While dry waste in the municipality area is being recycled, wet waste is being converted into manure and is being used by farmers in and around Ullal. In the past six months, the city municipality has collected segregated waste from houses and commercial establishments. Awareness is being created to encourage people to segregate waste at the source,” he said. The municipality does not accept mixed waste, he added. The municipality was converting an average of four tonnes of wet waste into organic manure a day. An average of four tonnes of manure is being produced every month. The city has nine educational institutions that process wet waste at the source. Meanwhile, a private firm has started processing chicken waste to manufacture feed for animals. Waste processing units are being opened in each ward and initiatives are being taken to clear all black spots, where people dump waste, he said. Mangaluru MLA UT Khader launched Ullal Brand organic manure recently. The manure is sold to farmers at Rs 10 per kg and is available in packs of 10 kg. Demand for the Ullal Brand manure is increasing considerably, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ullal-to-become-self-sufficient-on-solid-waste-management-in-6-months/articleshow/87744071.cms||---

The truck was moving in the second lane and there were many vehicles ahead as well as on the left lane. The driver took a sharp right turn and crashed into the divider to avoid these vehicles,” the officer said. The impact was so intense that the truck broke a 10ft long stretch of the cement railings and the iron crash barriers. Assistant inspector Prashant Kanase told TOI, “The container of the truck occupied a major area of the carriage width of the bypass. Its cabin occupied a lane leading to Satara. In this way, the movement of the vehicles heading towards Satara as well as Mumbai was blocked.”  There was a traffic snarl between Dari Pul (Viaduct) near New Katraj tunnel and Dukkarkhind near Chandni Chowk. The situation became normal around 11.30am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/container-crash-blocks-traffic-on-katraj-dehu-road-bypass/articleshow/87745791.cms||---

Specifically constituted health teams are knocking the doors of eligible recipients to get them vaccinated. The ground health workers, after conducting a detailed survey, have prepared a list of eligible recipient’s village and block wise with an aim to cover the eligible recipients of all age groups. Moreover, senior health and administrative officials are too visiting villages to review the vax drive daily. Additional CMO and Nodal Officer (Vaccination) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “We have taken up a door-to-door vaccination drive in some remote areas where eligible beneficiaries are being covered by the health teams.” “Department aims to cover each and every eligible recipient in remote areas and for that, ground health workers, along with CHO (community health officer) are running from pillar to post get each and every recipient covered under the vax drive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/door-to-door-vaccination-drive-in-remote-villages/articleshow/87745805.cms||---

Surendran called on governor Arif Mohammed Khan with a request for intervention in the matter. The demand for NIA probe was made in view of the state police’s failure in nabbing the culprits even 24 hours after the brutal killing of RSS worker Sanjith in Palakkad on Monday, said Surendran. “To resist SDPI’s attempts to make Kerala a battleground, all cases in which SDPI workers are accused should be handed over to NIA,” he said. “It has been proven in Sanjith’s postmortem report that he was hacked to death by trained assailants. It was a planned murder and there was largescale conspiracy behind it. Police did not do anything even when there were attempts on Sajith’s life by SDPI from 2020. Police are reluctant to name SDPI in the murder of Baiju in Chavakkad too. Police are acting in a partisan manner,” he said. Surendran claimed that the modus operandi of the murder in Palakkad shared similarities in killing patterns reported from Bangalore and elsewhere in the country. “Government has done nothing even as SDPI workers committed 10 murders, including that of SFI leader Abhimanyu, in recent times. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is helping SDPI politically. It’s with SDPI’s support that CPM rules Shoranur municipality, which is close to where Sanjith was killed,” Surendran added. He said that the governor has given assurance to intervene in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nia-must-probe-all-cases-involving-sdpi-surendran/articleshow/87745812.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said the victim is the son of deputy chief of the city unit of a political party. The family owns two flats in the same building. “The victim, his wife, parents and two children were in one flat around 11.30am when he went alone to the other flat,” Bahirat said, citing an initial statement by the family during an inquest panchanama. “Around 2pm, when the victim did not respond to their calls, the family members decided to check the other flat. They broke into the room and found him hanging from the fan,” Bahirat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/co-op-bank-exec-takes-own-life-in-khadak-area/articleshow/87745801.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BEST employees demand budget merger with BMC||MUMBAI: After MSRTC, it is now BEST workers who are demanding a “merger” of the undertaking’s budget with the BMC budget so that it ensures higher pay scales and Diwali bonus, among other benefits. The issue was brought before the BEST committee by BJP members at the budget meeting on Tuesday. Corporator and panel member (BJP) Prakash Gangadhare also warned that if the “merger issue” was not taken by the Shiv Sena-led panel on urgency, there could be protests from workers supported by BJP. He said that a few years back, the panel had agreed on the merger, which could drastically reduce losses of the undertaking and benefit 36,000 employees. “But nothing happened so far and this is unwarranted,” he pointed out. The situation is similar to MSRTC workers who are protesting, demanding the merger of the bus corporation with the state government. The strike of more than 84,000 workers entered its twentieth day on Tuesday as talks with the management remained inconclusive. A three-member government-appointed committee headed by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte met representatives of one union today at Mantralaya late afternoon. The committee will hear grievances of 28 unions over the next few weeks before presenting its report to state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “We have started the process of hearing demands of the unions. We will be speaking to all the unions before a final report regarding our recommendations is presented to the CM,” said a senior official. The CM will submit his report along with his views/opinion on the recommendations made by the panel to the high court. The entire process will be completed within 12 weeks, as per court directives. Transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab has assured police protection for those coming back to work, and also warned of “loss of pay” for those staying away from essential duties due to which lakhs of commuters are inconvenienced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-employees-demand-budget-merger-with-bmc/articleshow/87745819.cms||Somit Sen

The deputy collector had held a meeting to examine the documents before clearing the compensation in lieu of the trust land the government had acquired for Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government had announced Rs 8.76 crore compensation to the land owner, Tabut Inam Endowment Trust. A case registered at Bundgarden police station in Pune states two accused had approached the collector’s office claiming to be the trustee and secretary of Tabut trust and claimed the compensation. They produced an alleged fake NOC of Waqf Board to support the claim. The deputy collector released Rs 7.9 crore in the name of the trust through a demand draft. Since the account number on it was wrong, the deputy collector released another demand draft that the accused deposited in their account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waqf-case-pune-dy-collector-summoned-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87745811.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Delhi||Delhi, Pune cops bust gang that duped people via online services||New Delhi: In a joint operation, Delhi Police’s Special Cell and Pune police busted a gang that used to dupe people online. The gang members used to send fake screenshots of excess payments to the targets and ask them to refund the amount. The arrested people included H Meena (23), AK Meena (22), BL Meena (32), R Meena (23) and HM Meena (23), all residents of Rajasthan. The fraud came to light when a woman from Pune filed a complaint with cyber police. She said she gave online tuition for which her students paid through Google Pay. “On November 11, a woman, Muskan Meena, contacted her on her Instagram page to participate in a class and inquired about the fees. She was told that the fee was Rs 1,800 per month. Muskan then sent a screenshot of Rs 18,000 of Google Pay. She requested the tutor to refund the extra amount paid by mistake. The complainant, without checking her account, returned Rs 16,200 to Muskan via Google Pay. Later, she realised that she had been cheated,” said DCP (Cyber Cell) KPS Malhotra. After registering a case, Pune cops contacted the Cyber Crime Unit of Delhi Police because Muskan had provided her address as Dwarka in Delhi. “The address was found to be fake. Technical inquiry revealed that the suspect was operating from Jaipur. A team was sent to Jaipur and five gang members were arrested,” said the DCP. During interrogation, the five accused disclosed that they had created different Instagram IDs. They would visit shopping pages, take screenshots of the products and ask the sellers their cost via direct message. “They would then send a fake payment receipt and ask the seller for a refund saying that by mistake they had sent an excess amount,” Malhotra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-pune-cops-bust-gang-that-duped-people-via-online-services/articleshow/87745815.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NCP, Sena looking to expand base in Vid before civic polls||Nagpur: NCP supremo Sharad Pawar’s Vidarbha tour from Wednesday after a gap of almost two years is seen as the party’s efforts to focus on Vidarbha, where it badly lacks its base, ahead of next year’s civic elections in Maharashtra. Similarly, Shiv Sena is also eyeing the region and has already started consolidating its base, after breaking away from its saffron partner BJP post 2019 assembly polls. The region holds the key to government formation with a large number of 62/288assembly seats, besides 10 Lok Sabha seats. Both parties badly lack base in the region, barring certain pockets. According to poll analysts, the parties played second fiddle to Congress and BJP all these years, particularly in Vidarbha, and to some extent in Marathwada till the 2019 elections, which saw breaking of their 25-year-long saffron alliance. On the other hand, Congress and BJP still hold the grip over Vidarbha with a maximum of parliament and assembly seats divided between them. In fact, the region was a bastion for the grand old party till 2014 general and assembly elections before the beginning of Modi era. With the fast-changing political equations and new Congress leadership under state president Nana Patole insisting on contesting all polls on their own, NCP too seems to be gearing up for going solo. The party already has a strong base in western Maharashtra and has won more seats than Congress in 2019 assembly polls. Now, it wants to focus on Vidarbha and Pawar’s three-day visit was part of that exercise, according to party workers. Winds of change were also felt in Sena’s local unit after the introduction of MLC Dushyant Chaturvedi as local publicity chief. Even chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is personally paying attention to completion of major projects like Samruddhi corridor and Gorewada Zoo, along with Gosikhurd, and also visited the city a couple of times for reviewing the schemes. He also renamed Samruddhi and Gorewada projects after party founder Balasaheb Thackeray. The party’s senior leader Eknath Shinde, also the state urban development minister, is regularly visiting Gadchiroli, where he is making efforts for the district’s development. “In Nagpur, we have made full preparations for forthcoming NMC polls. As soon as prabhag limitations are declared, we would be taking interviews of candidates for contesting all 151 seats till any decision is made by the CM to forge an alliance with MVA partners,” Chaturvedi says. Before Pawar’s arrival, senior leader and MP Praful Patel was regularly visiting various areas of Vidarbha and conducting meetings with its office-bearers. “We would be expanding our base in the region, irrespective of the coalition, and will contest all forthcoming elections. Pawar’s visit in that direction will be boosting the morale of our party workers. From one seat in NMC, we will be aiming to significantly boost our tally,” NCP city chief Duneshwar Pethe says. Already many popular names have joined the party ranks, like former Sena chief Shekhar Sawarbandhe, corporator Abha Pande and others. “Pawar is a highly experienced leader having deep knowledge of politics and his visit would be a big morale booster for our activists. We’ve already started preparations for expanding NCP’s base in the region. Senior leaders like Patel, Anil Deshmukh, Ramesh Bang and Babarao Atram are working to bring more cadres under its fold,” former MLC Prakash Gajbhiye says. Eyeing the region All these years, both flayed second fiddle to Congress & BJP Both hardly have any base in Vidarbha, barring a few pockets Political equations drastically changed after 2019 polls Sena broke away from saffron alliance post polls PCC chief Patole insisting on going solo in future NCP started consolidating its base by expanding cadres Leaders like Praful Patel regularly meeting workers here CM Uddhav Thackeray personally focusing on projects here Sr minister Eknath Shinde regularly visiting Gadchiroli Region has 62 assembly & 10 Lok Sabha seats||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ncp-sena-looking-to-expand-base-in-vid-before-civic-polls/articleshow/87746458.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Patole flays NCP, says it hardly has any presence in Vidarbha||Nagpur: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole once again courted controversy by saying that its ally NCP hardly has any presence in Vidarbha and may lose its lone seat in Buldhana. Patole was indirectly referring to food and drugs administration minister Rajendra Shigane, who won on the NCP ticket from Sindhkhed Raja in the district. Questioning the NCP leadership, the former speaker said the NCP lost its Pandharpur seat despite campaigning by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and party president Jayant Patil. “The loss indicates that the party (NCP) is fast losing its base in western Maharashtra despite the presence of senior leaders. In Buldhana, it has only one ‘Dukan’ (seat) and it may lose that seat also (in the 2024 polls),” he said. Patole’s veiled barb against the ally of over two decades came while addressing Congress workers in Buldhana a couple of days ago. However, it once again brought differences between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents to the fore. This is not for the first time that the former speaker has targeted its Democratic Front ally. On July 15, Patole had launched a veiled attack against the Sharad Pawar-led outfit, stating that it had betrayed the Congress in the 2014 assembly polls. Two days earlier, he had claimed that he was being snooped by the government’s home department led by NCP minister Dilip Walse Patil. The former speaker is always vocal about going it alone in next year’s civic polls by leaving its former ally NCP and the new one Shiv Sena. His views, however, are not endorsed by other Congress leaders like revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and PWD minister Ashok Chavan. The Sakoli MLA again endorsed his statement against the NCP during a Congress meeting to celebrate the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at Devadia Bhavan in the city on Sunday. He, however, refused to take TOI’s repeated calls for his comments. To mark the occasion, the grand old party launched the Jan Jagaran Abhiyan against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA government at the Centre for rising inflation and fuel prices. The activists led by Patole and other leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Tariq Anwar, MLC Abhijit Wanjari, former minister Anees Ahmed and former MLA Virendra Jagtap took out a protest rally. While addressing workers, Patole targeted the BJP, accusing it of fomenting trouble between Hindus and Muslims as part of a larger conspiracy to win the assembly elections in many states next year, including Uttar Pradesh. He further accused BJP of defaming Maharashtra by instigating people to carry out riots in many places. “This is an old game of the saffron party to divert votes by dividing people. However, voters have realized their tactics and will not fall into their trap,” he said. NCP flays Patole, says doesn’t have stature to comment on Pawar, Patil The NCP strongly countered Patole’s attack by asking him to remain within limits before commenting on its party leaders. “Such comments coming from a senior leader referring NCP’s victory as Dukan is very unfortunate. He should not forget that our party has played a big role in his closely fought victory from his constituency in Bhandara. Pawar and Patil are our senior leaders and Patole does not have the stature to comment on them. If he is feeling so insecure with our coalition then he should ask his high command to move out of MVA,” said NCP general secretary Pravin Kunte Patil. Asking the MPCC chief to tender an unconditional apology, Patil, also the party’s spokesperson, reminded Patole that the MVA’s architect was senior Pawar. “His statement smacks of arrogance of power. He seems to have taken ‘supari’ from the BJP for making such statements,” said Patil. Backing Patil, city NCP chief Duenshwar Pethe said Patole should understand that a ‘Dukan’ is run by a ‘baniya’ and not by political parties. “His statement is best termed as immature and reflects ego. I have never seen a Congress leader making such irresponsible statements. It was never their party’s tradition. We have been allies since the last 22 years and making such comments creates distrust. Voters very well know whose party is on the decline and who is at number four in terms of assembly seats,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-flays-ncp-says-it-hardly-has-any-presence-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87746462.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Court on booked cops: Had no reason to help ‘rapists’||MUMBAI: In a case where three cops were booked for forcing a 12-year-old gang rape victim to marry one of the two alleged perpetrators in 2012-13, a special Pocso court in its recent judgment against five others observed that the police and other accused had no reason or interest to help the alleged rapists. There is no cogent evidence that the survivor’s father was being pressurised by the police or the other accused, it added. “…further it can be seen that there is inordinate delay in lodging of the report. Father of the victim does not appear to be under constant threats or pressure. In fact, report is lodged against him for extortion. Then he lodged report,” said the court. It also held that the survivor’s evidence did not appear to be truthful. In 2019, the Pocso court had directed the inclusion of three police officials as accused. When they challenged it, the case against them was stayed by Bombay high court. The trial continued against the two alleged rapists and three others, also accused of forcing a marriage. Last week, the special court sentenced a 41-year-old to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment for raping the girl. DNA evidence showed he was the father of the survivor’s baby boy. The court said medical evidence proved the minor was sexually assaulted, but there was no evidence on record to show she had been given a spiked drink and gang raped. It acquitted the 37-year-old co-accused alleged to have been part of the gang rape. He had married the girl and abandoned her. “Performing marriage will not prove his complicity in the absence of other cogent evidence on record,” the court said. His brother and two locals were also acquitted. The survivor’s father told the court that he had not lodged an FIR initially as the cops and others pressured him on marriage to secure the girl’s future and that of her child. The FIR was finally lodged in 2014. The court held that the father had tried to shirk his responsibility by saying he was under pressure. In a city like Mumbai, NGOs are active in helping people. “There is also active media which highlights such issues. There are state and district legal services authorities providing free legal aid... There are also women’s commissions and higher police authorities. But the complainant does not approach anyone,” said the court, wondering whether he had been to the police and narrated the incident. The judge also doubted whether the survivor’s real age was disclosed by her parents to the kazi performing the marriage. They had claimed that the girl was 18 when a sonography was first done in 2013, the court pointed out. “From the evidence it is reflected that since beginning, the father was not inclined to lodge report. I find it highly improbable that a father would yield to pressure when his daughter was subjected to such heinous crime,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-on-booked-cops-had-no-reason-to-help-rapists-in-mumbai/articleshow/87746935.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The OT was rendered non-functional due to the fire on September 15 last year. On Monday, the PCB signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a software company, which has committed Rs1.2 crore for the restoration work. Pune’s Members of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat and Congress Member of Legislative Assembly (MLC) Sharad Ranpise, who passed away recently, had earlier donated Rs25 lakh and Rs15 lakh, respectively, for this project from the local area development funds available to them. “We hope to complete the restoration work by January 26, 2022,” said Amit Kumar, PCB’s chief executive officer (CEO). As per cantonment records, the hospital had performed 580 major surgeries of different types and 380 minor surgeries in 2019. “We have adequate specialised doctors at the hospital.The revamped facility will benefit patients from humble family backgrounds in the cantonment,” said Usha Tapase, resident medical officer, PCB. “Most importantly, the patients will get health benefits under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) scheme of the state government here, so the number of surgeries will increase,” Tapase added. Cantonment officials and Tapase also said a team of doctors from the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) will join the hospital soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-year-after-fire-pcb-manages-funding-to-restore-its-general-ot/articleshow/87745817.cms||Sandip Dighe

The notional income was fixed at Rs 15,000 annually in 1994 and somehow, the same is continuing in the statute without any amendment for the last 27 years. The inflation rate since has gone up manifold resulting in depreciation in the value of the rupee but the notional income has not been increased and the compensation is being calculated on the basis of that income. While allowing a plea for enhancement of compensation for the death of a five-year old in a road accident in 2004, a bench of Justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy increased the notional income to Rs.25,000 annually and awarded total compensation of Rs 4.7 lakh to the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hike-notional-income-for-computing-road-crash-compensations-sc-to-government/articleshow/87747616.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Delhi||Minding the gap: Class XII exams start on cautious note||New Delhi: The offline board examinations for CBSE’s Class XII students started on Tuesday with utmost caution. A gap was left after each desk and there were very few students in a classroom. It was a skill subject paper opted for by fewer students, and schools didn’t find it difficult to take printouts. Many schools are, however, worried about more popular subjects. Every student wore a mask and was checked and sanitised on entering the premises. Delhi government school students who had entrepreneurship, and beauty and wellness had to go to other schools as they did not have home centres. A government school had accommodated 67 students on Tuesday, but its principal is stressed about the Sanskrit exam as over 900 students from three schools will appear for this Class X test at the institute. The Class X boards will begin on Wednesday with the painting test. “Even on Tuesday, the children were at the gate before we took the printouts as the link was uploaded late. As there were fewer students, it was not a problem,” said the principal. For the major subjects, the question papers will be made available at banks, but schools will have to print the OMR sheets. These tests will begin in December. “As it was the first time, there was a lot of stress and confusion. In my school, we have a good number of printers, but there are schools that are renting photocopy machines,” another principal said. Initially, the schools were to drop the OMR sheets at post offices, but now they themselves will deposit the answer papers at the CBSE headquarters every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minding-the-gap-class-xii-exams-start-on-cautious-note/articleshow/87745887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at a press conference in Kochi on Tuesday, SDPI state general secretary Roy Arakkal said it is a call for mob attacks on the lines of those in north Indian states. The statement that the party would pay back in the same coin is a challenge to the country’s judiciary, he said. But, the enlightened people of Kerala would discard the call, he added. “It is not up to the BJP state president to declare the names of culprits. It is the duty of investigating agencies to find the accused. BJP is trying to take maximum mileage out of political unrest,” said Arakkal. BJP tried to make the women’s entry to Sabarimala a golden opportunity for the party. The campaigns like love jihad, narcotic jihad, etc, didn’t help BJP’s growth in the state. So, the party leaders have come up with attempts to create violence,” said Arakkal. There is great divide within BJP in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/surendran-trying-to-stoke-communal-unrest-says-sdpi/articleshow/87745825.cms||---

Deputy superintendent of police P Sivakumar filed a petition before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court on Monday, seeking police custody of Thananayaka, a native of Colombo in Sri Lanka, and Gopalakrishnan, of Bengaluru. When the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday afternoon, advocate Malaravan, who is representing the Sri Lankan national and Jayapal, objected the petition and sought the court to quash it. He argued that Thananayaka and Jayapal were not involved in any cases in the state and the police had foisted false cases against them. After hearing the arguments from both sides, chief judicial magistrate M Sanjeevi Baskar granted five-day police custody of the duo and ordered the police to produce them before the court on November 20 before 11am. Police said Thananayaka was a close friend of Angoda Lokka and a wanted criminal in Colombo. Following the death of Angoda Lokka in Coimbatore city on July 3, 2020, Chanuka went absconding. However, the CB-CID police traced him to Bengaluru and arrested him on November 12. Police came to know Jayapal helped Chanuka during his stay in Bengaluru.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cb-cid-gets-custody-of-lankan-dons-aide/articleshow/87745831.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Dr Nitesh Vasave, the Akkalkuwa taluka health officer, since the setting up of the camp here a month back, over 500 migrant workers heading to Gujarat have been inoculated. “We stop the vehicles ferrying these migrant workers and seek information about the vaccination status. The unvaccinated or partially vaccinated workers having documents like the Aadhaar card are given the vaccination at the camp. We keep them here for about an hour after the shot, before allowing them to proceed with their journey,” added Vasave. The Nandurbar administration has started the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (door-to-door) Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district from November 10 to increase the vaccine coverage in the tribal-dominated district. District collector Manisha Khatri has ordered the officials to continue this special Covid-19 vaccination drive till the end of the month. The health workers, with the help of other departments like revenue and police, have stepped up vaccination drive in the district. The unvaccinated and partially vaccinated beneficiaries are being identified and given the shots. Even the NGOs and social outfits are rendering help to the administration for the same. In Nandurbar, out of 5.45 lakh beneficiaries, 62% have taken their first shots and around 44% are fully vaccinated. Similarly, out of 3.85 lakh beneficiaries from the age group of 18 and 44 years, around 44% are partially vaccinated and 23% are fully vaccinated. “We are making efforts to ensure improvement in the vaccination coverage by November 30 when the special drive ends,” ZP officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandurbar-admin-sets-up-vaccine-camp-at-guj-border/articleshow/87743453.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Kottakkal police on Tuesday arrested six relatives of the woman, including her father, uncles and cousins, in connection with the attack which took place on Monday. Police identified the injured as Abdul Aseeb, hailing from Kottakkal who is currently admitted to a hospital with multiple injuries, including a broken nose. The arrested are Cholappurath Majeed, 38, Abdul Jaleel, 34, Shafeeq 34, Kizhakkeparamban Shamsudheen, 45, the father of the woman, Shafeer Ali, 31 and Musthafa, 62. Police are looking for the remaining accused, Latheef, who is absconding. They have been booked under IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), abduction, threatening, assault etc. Kottakkal inspector of police M K Shaji said that the accused barged into the RTO consultancy office run by the Aseeb at Changuvetti and thrashed him and forcibly dragged him into their car and took him to the woman’s house at Othukkungal where they beat him up demanding divorce by pronouncing triple talaq and asking him to give it in writing. “Police reached the spot within 30 minutes and we rescued him from the custody of the accused. There were some issues between Aseeb and his wife and she didn’t want to continue the relationship,” the inspector said. The nikah of the couple was held on April 5 and she was brought to Aseeb’s house in August but following issues between them, the woman had returned to her house in October. Aseeb said that his wife’s relatives had beaten him up with an iron rod and they threatened him by placing a knife on his throat and threatened with acid attack if he refused to pronounce triple talaq. He added that the attackers also filmed the attack and they even had kept an ink pad read to affix his fingerprint after getting triple talaq in writing on paper. He added that the attack happened even after he had agreed to amicably end the marriage and a mediation talk was scheduled to be held on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the woman’s family and their lawyer said that Aseeb had been torturing her and she even had to be admitted to a hospital recently. The Supreme Court had in 2017 declared the practice of instant triple talaq as unconstitutional and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 had made the practice a criminal offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-thrashed-by-wifes-relatives-demanding-talaq/articleshow/87745840.cms||---

The move follows an increase in complaints pertaining to encroachments of main roads, including TenderSURE Roads, in Hubballi-Dharwad. The officials of HDMC zonal offices will check encroachments and also verify whether buildings on either side of roads have taken permission, violated permission rules and other norms, including tax payment. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said they have been receiving complaints pertaining to encroachments. “We will check and initiate stern action against encroachers. Instructions have been given to all zonal assistant commissioners to start the survey for the measurement of roads,” he said, adding: “Our officials will check if the building owner has taken necessary permission. If any violation is found during the drive, they will issue notices to the violators as per rules. Action will be initiated without yielding to any kind of pressure.” The civic body has received many complaints pertaining to encroachments of many roads, mainly those in commercial areas like Station Road, Koppikar Road, Dajiban Peth, Janata Bazaar, Subhash Road, and TenderSURE Road. Also, the civic authorities have been facing flak from the public for not allegedly attending to their complaints and for allegedly not initiating action against the violators. Recently, HDMC had acted against the complaint of encroachment on TenderSURE Road and also cleared it. This had raised questions as to why only the commercial hub in Vidyangar was considered. Following demand for such action against many other commercial establishments that have encroached pavements, HDMC officials swung into action. They will take measurements of roads and pavements and slap notices to the violators, sources said. It is said the drive will start from TenderSURE Road, after which other stretches will be covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-to-survey-roads-to-check-for-encroachments/articleshow/87744183.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Coimbatore||Assns ask govt to ease subsidy norm for micro units||Coimbatore: The federation of Coimbatore industrial associations (FOCIA) asks the state government to exempt micro industries from providing mandatory ISO certification to claim 25% subsidy for purchase of machinery. During a meeting on Monday, all the 19 industrial associations, which are part of FOCIA, resolved that they would approach the state government regarding the issue. The federation is also planning to announce an agitation seeking attention of the state government for appropriate measures to bring down the escalating cost of raw materials. Coordinator of FOCIA J James said the companies with up to Rs 1 crore turnover which are termed as micro industries were given a 25% subsidy for purchase of machinery. But in recent times, micro units were asked to provide ISO certification to claim subsidies. While most units are operating from smaller spaces and do not have ISO certification, they will be forced to spend more on machinery, if denied subsidy. To rescue these ancillaries from incurring losses, the state government should intervene, he said. James said about a 100% increase in the cost of raw materials in the past 12 months has forced the industries to bring down their production. The ancillaries which are depending on these industries for job works are in dire straits already. Unless there are measures from the government to regulate the cost of inputs, the market may not stabilise leading to the closure of micro units. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/assns-ask-govt-to-ease-subsidy-norm-for-micro-units/articleshow/87745859.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Geeta was the sister of Haryana Police ADG OP Singh, who is the brother-in-law of late Sushant. Those who died in the accident included Geeta’s husband Laljit Singh (75), his two sons Amit Shekhar Singh alias Nomani Singh (52) and Ramchandra Singh (37), daughter Baby Devi (42), niece Daisy Devi (40) and driver Pritam Kumar Singh (29). The accident took place on NH-333A near Pipra village under the Halsi police station area in Lakhisarai district around 6am when their SUV collided head-on with a truck loaded with empty LPG cylinders, police said. The truck driver and co-driver escaped. Halsi police station SHO Awadhesh Kumar said Laljit belonged to Bhandra village under the Khaira police station while his daughter Baby was from Malaypur, niece Daisy from Ratanpur under the Giddhaur police station area and driver Pritam belonged to Sonpeh, all in Jamui district.

Lakhisarai SP Sushil Kumar, who received a call from the Haryana ADG after the accident, said the SUV was overloaded and eyewitnesses said it was at a high speed. He said the NH was single-lane where the accident took place. “Either the driver dozed off or he failed to control the vehicle due to high speed and rammed into the truck,” the SP said.

Three of them on Monday night forced their hapless victim to transfer Rs 13,000 to one of their bank accounts using GPay. But the laugh could be on them as the cops can easily nab them by tracing the bank account. Police said Ajith Kumar, 24, of Kalaignar Nagar in Kunrathur, was on his way to meet a friend in Poonamallee when a well-dressed man flagged him down at Avadi and asked for a lift. The man told him there weren’t any autorickshaws around and that he would get off further down the road. An unsuspecting Ajith obliged. A couple of kilometres further on, two men standing by the road waved to them to stop. Ajith Kumar slowed down and the men jumped in front of his bike and started assaulting him. The pillion rider also joined in. The robbers cut Ajith Kumar with a knife, drawing blood and snatched his phone. They then checked if Ajith Kumar had GPay on his phone. They forced him to use his password and transfer whatever money he had in his account, which was Rs13,000, police said. An investigating officer said the three men did not even ask him for cash but straightway checked if he had GPay. The trio then pushed Ajith Kumar off the road and fled on his bike with his mobile phone. Ajith Kumar managed to reach the Avadi police station with the help of a passer-by and lodged a complaint. Police have launched a hunt for the robbers using details of the bank account to which the money was transferred and footage from CCTV cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-robbers-force-youth-to-transfer-money-via-google-pay/articleshow/87745863.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Arthur Road, Byculla inmates jabbed with both Covid vaccine doses||MUMBAI: All inmates of the Arthur Road Jail and Byculla District Prison have been vaccinated with both doses against Covid-19. Project Mumbai, an NGO, had carried out the vaccination drive inside the prisons along with the municipal corporation. As on Friday, a total of 3,400 inmates from Arthur Road Jail and 900 from Byculla Prison have completed their vaccination schedule, Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai, said. “The prisons are extremely crowded spaces, and it was important to complete the vaccination process in prisons as early as possible since maintaining social- distancing wasn’t possible there,” he said. Volunteers from the NGO said they were pleasantly surprised to receive a helping hand from inmates at the time of registering their names on CoWin. Atharv Kulkarni, a volunteer with the NGO, said that a young businessman, who was well-versed with Excel, helped them in filling out details and carrying out pre-vaccination documentation. “Many came in pairs, holding hands since they feared getting jabbed. We counselled them,” Kulkarni said. The BMC had created special sessions for prisons. Inmates from foreign countries were particularly apprehensive. “They had read about the fake vaccine scams and were worried if they were getting the right vaccine. We explained to them that the vials had come straight from the corporation,” Kulkarni said. A senior Byculla jail officer told TOI that all inmates, both male and female, who were given first dose of vaccine inside the jail earlier have now completed the second doses as well. The Byculla jail houses men and women in separate sections. “Some inmates took their first dose in the jail and were later granted bail. They were given a printed vaccination certificate so that they could take the second jab outside,” the officer said. New inmates, who had already taken one shot before coming to the jail, were given the second shot after their certificates were checked. The officer said that if the number of newcomers swells, the NGO will be roped in again, and if there are fewer inmates, jail officials will contact BMC’s E ward office for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-arthur-road-byculla-inmates-jabbed-with-both-doses/articleshow/87746956.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “A doctor at heart, always! Great gesture by my colleague @DrBhagwatKarad.” The incident made its way to social media and the minister was praised for his intervention. The incident took place on IndiGo Delhi-Mumbai flight 6E-171, which departed Delhi around 1.40am and landed in Mumbai at 3.22am. Sources said about 40 minutes into the flight, the passenger complained of feeling uneasy and giddy. A cabin crew member made an inflight announcement and the minister came forward to help. “The aircraft’s emergency medical kit was brought and the minister gave the passenger an injection. He took the passenger’s pulse, had him raise his feet, and change his position frequently. The aircraft didn’t need to be diverted. After the aircraft landed, the passenger was again given medical care,” said a source. One Amit Chavan tweeted a photo that showed the minister taking the passenger’s pulse. “Hon.MoS Finance, Dr Bhagwat Karad, a doctor by profession helped a fellow passenger on an IndiGo flight who had complained of giddiness and is a hypertension patient. MoS immediately rushed and helped him out. The co-passenger appreciated the minister’s gesture,” he tweeted. IndiGo responded: “Our heartfelt gratitude and sincere appreciation towards MoS for ministering to his duties non-stop! Dr Karad your voluntary support for helping out a fellow passenger is ever so inspiring.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pm-lauds-union-min-a-doctor-for-tending-to-ill-flyer/articleshow/87745861.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Showcasing IAF heritage will help more reach for the sky||IAF HERITAGE MUSEUM IN PRESS BUILDING Reaching for the sky... By Rajnish Wattas There is a hidden aviator in all of us. Remember the thrill of flying kites, launching them into the wind, manoeuvring in the sky or perchance a ‘dog fight’ with another, brought down by your lethal string. The recent news that the Chandigarh administration and Indian Air Force (IAF) have reached an agreement to create an IAF Heritage Museum at the government press building in Sector 18 is very exciting. The IAF plans to “showcase its vintage aircraft, armaments and memorabilia from different wars, including the 1971 Indo-Pak War and Kargil War, at the museum.” Other attractions will be a flight simulator, audio video galleries and a space for showcasing documentaries related to IAF history. With the tricity of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula boasting a large population of defence veterans and many of its youth joining the armed forces, the museum will engender greater interest in the world of aviation and the glorious role of our defenders of the skies. The museum is to be housed in the city’s heritage Government Press Building, one of the earliest edifices that was built in Chandigarh in 1953. It was designed by Edwin Maxwell Fry, part of Le Corbusier’s four-member European team, which included Pierre Jeanneret and Jane Drew. Though the IAF will surely hire the finest of talent to develop its display of exhibits, some thoughts on the adaptive reuse of an existing heritage building merit consideration. Smithsonian Air and Space MuseumI would like to recall my visit to the world famous Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington. Its amazing exhibits, imaginative displays and evocative themes make it an experience beyond a mere walk through time and space of American aviation and space explorations. It engages the visitor, whether a curious child or a war veteran, with the same thrill and wonder. In 2018, the museum saw approximately 6.2 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. Though a comparison between the Chandigarh and the Washington museums is odious; sharing some ideas, display techniques and methods is worthwhile. Being located close to the National Mall, White House and the Capitol, the Smithsonian opted for a design that would be architecturally impressive but which would not impinge on the historic style of the national icons. Gyo Obata, an American architect of Japanese descent, designed the museum as four cuboid blocks with marble cladding, connected by three spacious steel-and-glass atria housing larger exhibits such as missiles, airplanes and spacecraft. As you enter the Museum from the muted exterior, you find yourself in a voluminous space with a full height glass wall. It is called the ‘Boeing Milestones of Flight hall’. Vintage aircraft hang from the glass ceiling, suspended in mid-air, simulating flight! My own favourite is Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo trip across the Atlantic in his Spirit of St. Louis! One had read so much about the legendary flight and seen movies about it. There are of course, many other milestone-making aircraft and spacecraft exhibited there. Then you move on to “The Wright Brothers & The Invention of the Aerial”. The 1903 world's first successful airplane serves as the centrepiece of this exhibition. The airplane has been displayed on the floor, so you can get a close-up, eye-level look at the historic craft that ushered in the age of flight. The other sections, ‘Moving beyond Earth,’ asks the question, what is the Universe like? It presents the Universe as discerned by the naked eye, then shows how the telescope, photography, spectroscopy, and digital technology revolutionised our view. The other significant sections are on ‘Space Race’ of the cold war era, and one on ‘Time and navigation’. Limitations and Constraints of Press Building While we cherish the heritage value of the Press Building, recognising that it was made in an era of concrete for a limited purpose, adapting it to a museum that requires large spans will not be easy. The building is built on a tight grid of columns and beams that allow very limited space to showcase full-size airplanes, even of the vintage era. At best, most displays inside will be of audio visual nature, photographs or replica models of air planes. Even outdoors, there is limited open space for full size displays. Then why not be little more innovative? Even the Smithsonian, when faced with the problem of exhibiting larger number of displays, established a second campus of the Museum at the Washington Airport. Why can’t we then not also think of building an additional campus of the proposed IAF Museum simultaneously? A location like the PEC Campus, which has large open spaces and established one of the first courses in aeronautical engineering would be ideal. A museum like this will not only strengthen the institution’s research base but also bring citizens in closer contact with the engineering and scientific marvels of the campus. In fact, the IAF Museum should not be limited only to the theme of exhibiting the history of IAF, but also rope in ISRO to help set up a ‘Space Gallery’. We should proudly showcase our recent scientific achievements in the realm of space exploration and beyond. This might inspire many more Kalpana Chawlas to emerge. The Press building can house the already proposed Heritage Furniture Museum and a Tree Information Centre in addition to the IAF Museum to make full use of the vacant building. Let Chandigarh, the ‘city of tomorrow,’ spread its wings to fly high in space. ______________________________________________________________ Rajnish Wattas is former principal Chandigarh College of Architecture, an author, critic & modern heritage expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/showcasing-iaf-heritage-will-help-more-reach-for-the-sky/articleshow/87745078.cms||Rajnish Wattas

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Road along Valankulam shrouded in darkness||COIMBATORE: Motorists have urged the city corporation to switch on the street lights on the stretch connecting Ukkadam Road and Trichy Road along Valankulam lake. The busy road provides the much-required connectivity to reach key hubs in the city, including the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. The lights were installed on the road when the city corporation beautified the lake under the smart city project at a cost of Rs 24.47 crore. “But they are never switched on. If they are on, we would be able to cross the stretch, measuring less than a kilometre, without any hassle,” a motorist said. Mohammed Hasan, a resident of Ukkadam, said many motorists hesitate to take the road when it is shrouded in darkness. “At night, it would be difficult to spot pedestrians at a safe distance. Apart from motorists, pedestrians also face danger at night,” he told TOI. “Tipplers camp on the bunds of Valankulam after it turns dark. They would be deterred if the area is lit up.” B Veerakumar, a commuter, said presence of cows and ponies makes the stretch more dangerous. “It is difficult to spot dark-skinned animals at night. The lights should stay on throughout the night to help people travel without any difficulty,” he said. An official with the smart city scheme promised to look into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/road-along-valankulam-shrouded-in-darkness/articleshow/87745869.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pay a bomb to draw cash outside Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: An airport that has started clocking near 50,000-plus footfall daily — 50,951 on Monday — doesn’t have a single ATM outside it. The nearest ATM kiosk outside the terminal building is located more than 600m away on Jessore Road, where one either has to take a cab or a rickshaw and shell out anything between Rs 100 to Rs 150 or take a 20-minute walk to withdraw cash. “Last week, I came out of the airport and realised I had little cash with me. I needed cash as the pre-paid taxi counter wasn’t accepting cards because of some glitch and the app cabs were refusing to ply without cash payment. But sadly, I didn’t find a single ATM anywhere nearby. I had to walk all the way to VIP Road and then further towards Jessore Road with two trolley bags before I could get a functional ATM and draw some money. How can an international airport even run like this?” said Dwaipayan Roy, who reached Kolkata from Bangalore. Soumya Mukherjee, another frequent flyer, said he had faced the issue numerous times amidst the pandemic. “It has happened to me twice that I had forgotten to withdraw cash from inside the airport and outside, I found none. I had no option but to book a dodgy cab from a tout agreeing to pay extra money only to stop at an ATM midway to my home at Hooghly to withdraw cash,” said Mukherjee, a management consultant. Rickshaw pullers conceded to mint flyers, agreeing to take them to a functional ATM outside the airport and bring them back for anything between Rs 300-Rs 350. “Passengers not habituated with the area seek our help to find an ATM and it is a set rate for us to take the passengers to an ATM out of the airport and bring them back,” said one of the rickshaw pullers near the Volvo bus stand. While harrowing passengers fume at the absence of such a basic facility, airport authorities plead helplessness claiming they have been trying to find a suitable bidder for the last one and a half years and have issued two different tenders, every time lowering the amount but haven’t found a bank who agreed to pay the quoted rent and operate an ATM at the two vacant spots opposite gate 2A/2B of the arrival terminal. Even inside the airport, there are only two functional ATMs operating currently with two other kiosks remaining empty. “It’s a troubling issue. There were three-four banks operating ATMs inside and outside the airport but during the pandemic, their contract ended and they never renewed. Since then, we have called tender twice but haven’t received any response. I have now approached the head office to reduce the rate further. We can’t just hand over the ATM to some bank. We have to follow certain procedures. With passenger footfall coming back to pre-pandemic level, we hope we will find a response this time,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pay-a-bomb-to-draw-cash-outside-airport/articleshow/87745083.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Srinagar||Controversy erupts as kin of 2 civilians slain in Kashmir encounter deny deceased were overground workers||SRINAGAR: A controversy broke out over the killing of two civilians who were among the four people slain in an encounter with security forces at Hyderpora, Srinagar, that ended Tuesday evening. The two slain civilian’s families said their kin were not overground workers (OGWs) for terrorists, as claimed by the police, and the niece of one of them alleged her uncle had been used as a "human shield". The families’ claims led to PDP, NC and People’s Conference calling for an impartial investigation. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said on Tuesday one foreign terrorist named Haidar, his local terrorist associate Aamir Ahmad, an OGW named Mudasir Gul, and Altaf Ahmad Bhat, the owner of the building in which the terrorists had been hiding, had been killed in Hyderpora. He said Altaf Bhat would be counted as a "harbourer" of terrorists, PTI reported. According to Kumar, Bhat was killed in the crossfire, and Gul, a non-practising dentist running a call centre and property business in the same building, was in fact harbouring Haidar, a Pakistani terrorist from The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba outfit. "It is not clear whether bullets fired by the militants or by the forces hit the civilian (Altaf Bhat). The terrorists were carrying pistols, investigations will make clear whose bullet hit him," the Kashmir police chief said. You killed my innocent uncle Mohammad Altaf Bhat in cold blooded murder In Hyderpora, you used him as human shield… https://t.co/C95GFL7dbB— saimabhat (@saimabhat) 1637003544000However, Bhat’s teenage niece disputed the claims made by the authorities and alleged that he was used as a "human shield" by the security forces. "You killed my innocent uncle Mohammad Altaf Bhat in cold-blooded murder In Hyderpora, you used him as human shield and now saying he was 'OGW' (overground worker), return us his body @JmuKmrPolice @SrinagarPolice @IGP," tweeted Saima Bhat. The IGP said Aamir Ahmad, a resident of Banihal, was also a terrorist working under Haidar’s command whose cover was a job as an office boy at Mudasir’s call centre, an unregistered business. "He (Bhat) had kept the tenants and the police had no information about it. The responsibility of the owner does not end with renting out the place... He should also check once in a while as to what is happening there," the IGP was quoted as saying by PTI. "Mudasir was running an unauthorised call centre. This way, he was an OGW and was directly involved in harbouring militants," IGP Kumar claimed. The IGP told reporters at Police Control Room (PCR) Srinagar that on Monday evening the police had received a lead about the presence of terrorists on a side road off the airport road. "Police, CRPF and the Army laid a cordon and, when they zeroed in on the spot, the terrorists fired indiscriminately at the forces," Kumar said, adding that the two terrorists were killed in the gunfight that followed. "Mudasir was also involved in ferrying Haidar from the recent attack site in Jamalata Srinagar, where a policeman was injured," the IGP said, adding that he was also involved in ferrying terrorists from areas in south and north Kashmir. Two pistols, two magazines, six mobile phones and a few computers were recovered from the encounter site, the police said. He said the bodies of Altaf Ahmed and Mudasair were not handed over to their families for the last rites as there were apprehensions of a law and order problem. Asked whether the police had clear evidence that Mudasir harboured terrorists, the IGP said they had digital evidence and would get further proof. Meanwhile, the families of Altaf Ahmed and Mudasir Gul urged lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha on Tuesday to help them get the bodies of their kin so that they could be given a proper burial back home. The daughter of Altaf Ahmad, the building owner, urged L-G Manoj Sinha 0n social media to "direct the police to return my father’s body so that we can see him one last time and give him a proper burial". The family of Mudasir Gul, a resident of Rawalpora, staged a protest at Srinagar’s Press Enclave and demanded the return of his body. "He has two little kids and we want to show them the face of their father one last time," his family said. Mudasir’s mother, weeping, claimed that her son was innocent. Other family members and relatives of Mudasir rejected outright the police claim that the slain man was an OGW, stating that "Mudasir had no militant links and was innocent". The authorities, meanwhile, constituted an SIT headed by a DIG to investigate the "high-tech" Hyderpora "call-centre" hideout from where mobile phones and computers were recovered. "They will also get into the details of whether the militants were in touch with any foreign country. The team will also look into the sequence of events that led to the killing of the building owner and militant associate," IGP Vijay Kumar said. PDP chief Mehbooba alleged on Twitter that the use of "innocent civilians" as human shields, "getting them killed in cross firing & then conveniently labelling them as OGWs is part of GOI’s rulebook now (sic)." She added that a "credible judicial inquiry" was imperative to establish the truth and "put an end to this rampant culture of impunity". People's Conference leader Sajad Lone also demanded a probe. "…the least we deserve is a transparent description of what happened by a neutral institution. This is neither the first time nor the last time. Manoj Sinha — you have the opportunity to assert that human lives matter," Lone said. National Conference’s Omar Abdullah tweeted: "There have been numerous instances of fake encounters in the past and the questions raised about this #hyderporaencounter need to be answered swiftly and in a credible manner." He added that an "impartial and credible inquiry" was necessary as "there are far too many questions being raised about the encounter and about the people killed". Lok Sabha members Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi also called for an impartial and time-bound probe, PTI reported.

---||Delhi||NIFT Delhi hosts its first physical convocation amid pandemic||Of all the joys that the pandemic has robbed us of, not having physical farewell and convocation ceremonies ranks pretty high for students. The outgoing batch of the National Institute of Fashion Technology’s (NIFT) Delhi campus was lucky enough to have a physical convocation. On Friday, the NIFT Delhi campus hosted its 27th Convocation Day and 336 graduates, post-graduates and PhD scholars from the 2021 batch received their degrees from Union Minister for Textiles Piyush Goyal. The convocation also had Minister of State for Textiles Darshana Vikram Jardosh as the guest of honour and Upendra Prasad Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Textiles, as the special guest. NIFT Students taking the graduation pledge In a 90-minute-long ceremony held at the college’s amphitheatre, the students began with the graduation pledge wherein they promised to uphold the sanctity and dignity of their profession. Students taking the graduation pledge At the end of the pledge, Jardosh remarked, “It is a testament to the changing face of India that we could hear more female voices than male ones during the pledge.” Goyal began his address to the students with a promise. “I was told that parents (of the graduating students) couldn’t join the ceremony today physically due to paucity of space. But hopefully, in the coming years, we should be able to offer you a bigger amphitheatre at Pragati Maidan, where you could sit with your families for future convocation ceremonies,” he said. Addressing the students, he asked them to “show the world India’s strengths in fashion technology,” before adding, “I’m sure that’s what each one of you will do. My best wishes for a wonderful career!” The outgoing graduates expressed their joy at having a physical ceremony. “Honestly, I didn’t think we would have a physical ceremony,” said Varnika Manraj from the Accessories Design Department, adding, “Due to COVID, last year was a virtual ceremony. I am just so happy to see my friends again and have a chance to share this moment with them.” Others talked about the significance of this moment for them. Harneet Singh from the Fashion Communication Department said, “For me, this is not the end of anything but the beginning of a new journey. That needs to be celebrated and I am happy to do it with all my friends.” The ceremony was also attended by many notable alumni from the institute, including designers Gaurav Jai Gupta, Suket Dhir, Manish Tripathi, Swati Kalsi and Roshan Baid. ‘Let’s make India the fashion capital of the world’In his speech at the convocation, Union Minister for Textiles Piyush Goyal touched upon the need to elevate India’s status in the global fashion fraternity and how the graduating students could play a huge role in it. “We need to promise ourselves that in the next five years, we will try to make India the fashion capital of the world. Let’s get luxury into handloom. Our Indian design products should be associated with luxury world over and brands promoted by you all should be known world over. It’s time India starts draping the world with the best of quality and best of products,” he said to the students. The minister also expressed a couple of wishes to the graduates and the institute as a whole. He said, “Hopefully, we should be able to designate NIFT as an institute of ational importance in the coming years. And I don’t know if we have the budget for it, but I hope to see a fashion show run by NIFT students at the Dubai Expo. Also, I would ask the NIFT management if they could think of weaving in some progam in their curriculum to give exposure to the students about handloom and handicrafts, and making them more aware about our traditional designs.” Minister of State for Textiles Darshana Vikram Jardosh also had a suggestion for the college. “We have the Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav coming up, where we will celebrate 75 years of independence. Our PM Modi may not need any fashion advice, but I hope that NIFT can take the lead and design a uniform for all the other politicians for that event,” she said.

---||World||Trial set for Texas officer who shot Black woman at home||FORT WORTH: A former Fort Worth police officer faces a murder trial early next year for fatally shooting a Black woman through a back window of her home in 2019 while responding to a call about an open front door.  A Tarrant County judge on Tuesday scheduled Aaron Dean's trial in the fatal shooting of 28-year-old Atatiana Jefferson for January 10, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports. Jury selection is set to begin six days earlier, although Judge David Hagerman indicated he's expecting Dean's lawyers to seek a change of venue.  A location change could further hold up a case, which has been delayed repeatedly over the more than two years since Dean shot Jefferson during a late-night wellness check at her mother's house. His case was among many that were postponed when the coronavirus pandemic caused courts across the country to postpone jury trials.  Dean, 37, resigned from the city police force two days after shooting Jefferson. He was charged with murder and released on a $200,000 bond.  Following the shooting, Fort Worth police released body camera footage that showed Dean walked around the side of the house, pushed through a gate into the fenced-off backyard and fired through a window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson to show her hands. Police went to the house after a neighbour called a non-emergency line to report that the front door was ajar.  Dean, who is white, was not heard identifying himself as police on the video. The city's police chief at the time, Ed Kraus, said Dean acted without justification and that there was no sign he or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door. Kraus said Dean would have been fired if he had not quit without giving a statement to investigators.  A judge has issued a gag order in Dean's case. He declined to comment to a Star-Telegram reporter in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trial-set-for-texas-officer-who-shot-black-woman-at-home/articleshow/87745914.cms||---

These include shutting down all except five thermal power plants within a 300km radius of Delhi till November 30; stopping entry of trucks in Delhi except for those carrying essential commodities; keeping diesel and petrol vehicles more than 10 and 15 years old, respectively, in NCR off the road and banning construction and demolition activities in NCR till November 21, except for some government and infrastructure projects. All educational institutions in NCR will remain closed till further orders with only online mode allowed. At least 50% of the government staff across NCR will work from home and private establishments will be encouraged to do so till November 21. Among other measures announced by the commission are banning of DG sets in entire NCR, except for emergency services, and ensuring that all industries in NCR with gas connections are run only on gas, failing which they are to be shut down. The ones using unapproved fuels shall be closed by the respective governments with immediate effect, and wherever gas is available, they will be shifted to that mode of fuel. This followed a meeting with NCR states earlier in the day with the focus on vehicular pollution, dust pollution from construction activities and roads, and emissions from thermal power plants and industrial pollution. It was pointed out by the met department at the meeting that the air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the “very poor” category on November 18 and improve only from November 21, owing to strong winds. Delhi’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday, again entering the “severe” category at 403. Of the 11 thermal power plants, the five that have been allowed to function are NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi, TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd TPS, Rajpura; and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa. The secretary, ministry of power, has instructed that if there is any shortfall, supply shall be provided from power plants located beyond the 300km radius of Delhi. Constructions related to railway stations, Metro, airport, ISBTs, national security, defence and projects of national importance have been exempted from the ban. The commission has asked for tightening of PUC checks in NCR with checking to be carried out at petrol pumps, ensuring smooth traffic flow, deployment of more CNG buses and tightening of dust control measures with anti-smog guns, water sprinklers and fire tenders. Hotspots are to be targeted at least three times a day. More road-sweeping machines must be procured and enforcement made more stringent with penalties and closure.

The move comes a few weeks after Merck also approached the Food and Drug Administration seeking a green light for its antiviral capsule against the coronavirus.  Experts see the oral medications as an invaluable addition to vaccines in the fight to end the pandemic.  "With more than five million deaths and countless lives impacted by this devastating disease globally, there is an urgent need for life-saving treatment options," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.  "We are moving as quickly as possible in our effort to get this potential treatment into the hands of patients."  Pfizer is seeking an emergency use authorization (EUA) on the basis of positive interim results from a mid-to-late stage clinical trial of hundreds of people, which enrolled Covid-positive non-hospitalised adults at high risk of progression to severe disease.  The data showed an 89% reduction in Covid hospitalisations or death when the treatment started within three days of symptom onset, with no deaths in the treatment group. Similar results were seen within five days of symptom onset.  Side-effects occurred in about one-in-five patients in both the treatment and placebo groups, and were mild in intensity.  The treatment is given over five days.  Pfizer has said it will deliver 180,000 courses of its Paxlovid pill this year and at least 50 million by next year.  On Tuesday it announced a deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to sub-licence production for supply in 95 low- and middle-income nations covering around 53% of the world's population.  Paxlovid is a combination of a new molecule, PF-07321332, and HIV antiviral ritonavir.  Both belong to a class of antivirals called "protease inhibitors", which block the action of an enzyme critical to viral replication.  President Joe Biden's administration is set to announce that it is purchasing 10 million courses of the pill, the Washington Post reported.  The US is also buying 3.1 million courses of the Merck pill, Molnupiravir.  Given the timeline between application for an EUA and subsequent authorisation, it could be available by late this year or early next.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-asks-us-to-authorise-covid-pill/articleshow/87746169.cms||---

The swearing-in of the city's first Asian-American mayor came two weeks after Wu won the city's mayoral election. Before Wu, Boston had elected only white men as mayor.  Wu, 36, takes over for a fellow Democrat - former acting Mayor Kim Janey - who was Boston's first woman and first Black resident to serve in, but who was not elected to the top post.  The swearing-in means Wu will now face the daunting task of trying to make good on a slew of ambitious policy proposals that were the backbone of her campaign.  To push back against soaring housing costs that have forced some former residents out of the city, Wu has promised to pursue rent stabilisation or rent control. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is the fact that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide.  Another of Wu's top campaign promises is to create a "fare-free" public transit system. Wu has said the proposal would strengthen the city's economy, address climate change and help those who take the bus or subway to school or work.  Like the rent control pledge, Wu can't unilaterally do away with fares on the public transit system. Wu has said she would try to work with partners in state government to make each proposal a reality.  Wu, whose parents immigrated to the US from Taiwan, grew up in Chicago and moved to Boston to attend Harvard University and Harvard Law School.  Wu, who has two small children, is Boston's third mayor this year.  "I know that Boston is in good hands and I am so proud to call you Madam mayor," Janey said moments before Wu was sworn in.  Janey had been president of the Boston City Council before taking over as mayor.  She rose to the top post on an acting basis when the city's previous elected mayor, Democrat Marty Walsh, stepped down this year to become US Secretary of Labor under President Joe Biden. Janey was sworn in March 24.  Janey attempted to use the status of the office in her run to replace Walsh, but she failed to garner enough votes to make it past the preliminary mayoral election that whittled the field down to two candidates - City Councilors Wu and Annissa Essaibi George.  Republican governor Charlie Baker, Democratic US Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and US Rep. Ayanna Pressley attended the swearing-in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/michelle-wu-sworn-in-as-boston-mayor-becomes-first-woman-to-be-elected-to-the-post/articleshow/87746170.cms||---
---||World||Biden bans entry of Nicaraguan president, officials to US||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Tuesday banned his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega and other members of his government from entering the United States as he issued a broad proclamation in response to an election that Washington has denounced as rigged in favour of Ortega. Biden's travel ban applied to all of Nicaragua's "elected officials", apparently including Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, in addition to security force members, judges, mayors and others seen as undermining democracy in the Central American nation. "The repressive and abusive acts of the Ortega government and those who support it compel the United States to act," Biden said in the decree. Biden's order came just a day after the United States, Britain and Canada imposed targeted sanctions on Nicaraguan officials in a concerted response to the November 7 election that many countries have called a sham. They took action after Ortega's re-election to a fourth consecutive term after jailing political rivals and cracking down on critical media. Ortega has derided his US critics as "Yankee imperialists" and accused them of trying to undermine Nicaragua's electoral process. Cuba, Venezuela and Russia have offered Ortega their backing. Previous sanctions and travel bans on certain Nicaraguan officials imposed by Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have failed to deter Ortega, and many analysts are skeptical whether new measures will have much impact. The Organization of American States (OAS) adopted a resolution on Friday saying Nicaragua's election lacked "democratic legitimacy". Twenty-five nations voted in favour and seven abstained, including Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-administration-bans-entry-of-nicaraguan-president-officials-to-us/articleshow/87746174.cms||---
---||India||Shut due to Covid, Kartarpur corridor opens after 20 months||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday announced the reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara corridor from Wednesday, ahead of Gurupurab — the November 19 birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The decision to resume movement of devotees through the corridor leading to the Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan’s Narowal “reflects the immense reverence of Modi government towards Shri Guru Nanak Dev-Ji and our Sikh community”, home minister Amit Shah tweeted while announcing the decision. The corridor was shut in March 2020, barely four months after it was inaugurated, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. The latest decision seemed on the anvil in the wake of a delegation of BJP leaders from Punjab meeting Modi recently to request him to reopen the corridor. Even the Pakistan government had last week urged India to allow devotees to visit the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara ahead of the Prakash Utsav celebration. The Centre’s decision can be seen to address many fronts with a state election coming up in Punjab and the PM’s repeated gestures to indicate his respect for the Sikh faith in the wake of the agitation of farmers’ unions, mainly from Punjab and Haryana and west UP, against the agri-reforms legislated by the Centre. "The nation is all set to celebrate the Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev-ji on November 19 and I am sure that Narendra Modi government’s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib corridor will further boost the joy and happiness across the country," Shah tweeted. There had been some concern, even before the pandemic, over the efforts of Pakistan agencies to use the pilgrimage to disseminate anti-India propaganda and look to "recruit" some impressionable pilgrims. Expressing gratitude to PM Modi and home minister Shah for the reopening, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday claimed to have personally taken up the issue with the central government. "This is a joyous occasion for the entire Punjabi community in general and Sikh brethren in particular," he said. On November 18, Channi will lead his entire cabinet to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib. Several senior politicians from Punjab including former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu too had on Twitter urged the government of India to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor in view before Gurpurab. Kartarpur corridor, called a "peace corridor" between India and Pakistan, had seen around 45,000 pilgrims travel through it between November 2019 and February 2020. The corridor allows Sikh pilgrims to travel visa-free to the Kartarpur gurdwara via the Attari-Wagah border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shut-due-to-covid-kartarpur-corridor-opens-after-20-months/articleshow/87746284.cms||---

Modi was addressing a rally in Sultanpur after the inauguration of India’s longest expressway, where he himself landed in a military transport aircraft on a 3.2-km stretch developed as an emergency air strip for IAF. The expressway begins from Chandsarai village on the outskirts of Lucknow and ends at Hadairia village on NH-31 in Ghazipur district. It cuts across nine districts, including Ayodhya, Amethi and Azamgarh. Watch: PM Modi lands on Purvanchal Expressway in IAF's C-130J Super Hercules planeModi said whenever he visited the state during SP’s stint in government, the party leadership would “vanish” after completing the formality of “receiving” him. “Unko itni sharam aati thi....kaam ka hisaab dene ke liye unke pass kuch tha hi nahi (they were ashamed...they didn't have anything to show in the name of work).” The PM said UP had been subjected to "punishment" under SP's governance. "Akhir UP ko kis baat ki saja di ja rahi thi (why was UP being punished)?" he said, recounting how one of the first tasks he undertook after becoming PM was to delve deep into the causes of the state's backwardness and initiating a series of remedies. "Our efforts included providing houses, toilets and electricity. But the state government did not help me and continued to do injustice to the people," he said. Referring to the Purvanchal Expressway as the route to a brighter future for UP, Modi said he couldn't have imagined he would land in a helicopter on the same expressway whose foundation stone he had laid three years ago. "It is an expressway to development of a new UP, a reflection of modernised facilities and a certification of turning sankalp (resolve) into siddhi (accomplishment)," he said after inaugurating India's longest functional expressway. Modi said the BJP government's development plans for UP were not just for five years but the entire decade. While lauding CM Yogi Adityanath and his team for the completion of the expressway, the PM also had a word of gratitude for the farmers whose land was acquired for the project. Taking a swipe at Congress and SP for their reliance on dynasties, Modi said both Delhi and Lucknow were largely dominated by such "parivarwadis". "Their partnership kept trampling the aspirations of the people of UP. But the people of UP have banished such people forever to keep the development trajectory intact," he said, highlighting why Yogi was elected in 2017 while he got a second stint as PM. The PM's reference to SP's alleged fear of losing its vote bank is being seen as an indication of BJP lending traction to a potential bipolar electoral contest with the SP, which is markedly backed by minorities and OBCs, mainly the Yadavs. Road to development: What the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway means for East UP, Bihar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-the-inauguration-of-indias-longest-e-way-pm-launches-into-sp/articleshow/87746454.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||India||Will throw out your deficient affidavit, angry SC tells government||NEW DELHI: Chafing at the lack of progress in framing a uniform scheme to ensure cooked food for the hungry and destitute across the states, the Supreme Court on Tuesday pilloried the Centre for filing a deficient affidavit, that too by a junior officer, before threatening to "throw out the affidavit" for the government's lack of respect to the highest court. The SC's earnest endeavour to make the Centre frame a uniform policy and the latter not keeping its solemn promise to work towards it irked a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli, which said, "You had promised to frame a uniform policy. There is not a word about it in the affidavit. Your secretary is so arrogant that he undermines the highest court by asking an undersecretary to file the affidavit. This cannot go on." Such was the intensity of questioning from the CJI and Justice Kohli that additional solicitor general Madhvi Divan had to repeatedly plead for permission to complete an argument on the difficulties faced by the Centre in framing a uniform scheme given the diversity of conditions in states, many of which are already implementing a scheme for highly subsidised cooked food for citizens. "We cannot thrust a scheme on community kitchens in the states," she said. Times ViewThe Centre can financially assist states, but given their diverse socio-economic realities, the purpose would perhaps be better served if states are left to devise their own schemes.As the ASG was finding it difficult to extricate the Centre from the situation, attorney general K K Venugopal intervened to calm frayed nerves, saying a uniform community kitchen scheme could be framed but only if the states agreed since the Constitution mandates poverty alleviation schemes and public distribution system implementation to the panchayati raj mechanism under the states. He said the country has 6.63 lakh villages and 2.55 lakh panchayats. "We will deal with the matter and come out with a concrete scheme after a thorough consultation with the states. The scheme involves taking care of huge logistics — foodgrains have to be transported to panchayats, storage space has to be created and kitchens have to be set up. We can come forward with a scheme while not violating the constitutional mandate about the three-tier governance system." The CJI-led bench said, "If you (the governments) want to take care of hunger, no Constitution or law will negate or impede it. Don't think that we want linking community kitchens with the schemes to provide nourishment to children. We are only concerned with hunger. We will grant you three weeks to call a meeting of all states and devise a uniform scheme. If you face objections or difficulties, bring it to our notice and we will sort it out through judicial orders." The AG said that many states have opened community kitchens and provide food to all at highly subsidised rates. "We cannot do that. We will ensure that the community kitchens cater to only the marginalised sections and those below the poverty line." The bench clarified that it was not insisting on any particular kind of scheme by the Centre. "What we want is that the scheme should provide succour to those hungry and those who are unable to make ends meet even once a day." The SC posted the matter for further hearing after three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-throw-out-your-deficient-affidavit-angry-sc-tells-government/articleshow/87746484.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||India resumes vaccine exports to 4 countries||NEW DELHI: Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal and Iran have been the first recipients of resumed vaccine exports from India almost eight months after they were halted due to rising cases of Covid-19. The government had stopped vaccine exports as the brutal second wave hit India in April-May this year. It’s only after India had administered close to a billion doses of vaccines did the government relax restrictions. Commercial contracts were also kept in abeyance as production was procured for domestic use. India resumed its exports to the Covax facility with the first lot of doses landing in African countries. Adar Poonawalla, chief of Serum Institute of India, was quoted by Axios news website as saying that by this week, he expected Covishield doses to land in African countries. “I think by the 10th of November, you’re gonna see the first — if not a bit sooner — you’re gonna see the first doses arrive in Africa,” Poonawalla told Axios. Once shipments begin, Poonawalla said around 30 million doses per month could be supplied to COVAX. India now has a long list of vaccines — Covavax, Corbevax, ZyCovD, Gennova’s mRNA vaccine — at various stages of regulatory approval. The first 50 million doses of SII-produced Covavax will make its way to Indonesia this week though the vaccine is yet to be greenlighted by India’s DCGI, the WHO or US FDA. While the government is focusing on getting more Indians covered by the second jab, it’s clear that supplies are no longer a constraint. Vaccine manufacturers are chomping at the bit, because they need to go out to the world with their exports. However, there remain fears about a third wave and a repeat of the shortages faced during the second wave as well as uncertainties about production volumes and timelines of manufacturers. Here, government sources say they were hobbled by the slow rollout of Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. Without the SII doing the heavy lifting (over 88% doses were Covishield), India would not have been able to ramp up its vaccinations as rapidly as it did. Until mid-October, Bharat Biotech had only supplied around 11 crore doses compared to the 40 crore promised by the government to the Supreme Court. Sputnik V, the third vaccine approved by India, stopped production because Russia just could not supply enough. Until mid-October, they had supplied only 45 lakh against the 10 crore promised. In fact, globally, Russia has promised one billion vaccines, but hasn’t been able to provide more than 5 million. This means large parts of Africa, Latin America and even Asia remain unserviced. China is moving aggressively, capturing markets, even though their vaccines have been shown to be well below par. Indian vaccine manufacturers are well-positioned to take a global lead on this. With the developed world going in for boosters and scientific evidence tilting towards giving vulnerable populations boosters after 6-8 months, it won’t be long before India too has to take a call on them. For government regulators, this is all the more reason to hold on to vaccines for Indians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-resumes-vaccine-exports-to-4-countries/articleshow/87746607.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Investigators claimed that the couple launched a mall project and took money from buyers on the pretext of giving them shops but they failed to deliver on their promise. Police said the two were directors of a company called JC World Hospitality Pvt Ltd and were living in Greater Noida. "We have arrested them from their residence," an officer said. According to police, one investor, Dhirendra Nath, along with a few others filed a complaint against the company and its directors. "Nath had booked two shops in a project named JC World Mall. It was launched by the accused in 2014 in Noida. He [Nath] had paid a sum of Rs 1.75 crore to the company in various instalments," additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh said. Singh said the company promised Nath that possession of the units would be handed over in 30 months from the date of the allotment letter. "Nath told us that the builder has not completed the construction work and no construction was going on at the site for the last 18 months," the officer said. Nath also claimed that several meetings with the directors had also been in vain. "We found that the company through its directors has cheated several complainants, buyers on the pretext of providing shops in its project," the officer said, adding that there were more than 30 complainants. During the probe, Noida authority informed police that the company had applied for approval of the building plan for the project in 2015, which was returned to them with some objections and they were directed to provide the relevant documents. "The company did not respond within the stipulated period and, hence, their application for approval of the building plan was rejected. It was also found that Rs 6 crore of buyers' money was given by the company to a sister concern," the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/daughter-son-in-law-of-jaypee-founder-held/articleshow/87746675.cms||---
---||World||On a New Hampshire bridge, Biden bets infrastructure beats political headwinds||Fresh from signing his signature bipartisan infrastructure bill, United States President Joe Biden on Tuesday trekked to New Hampshire, a key state in the 2022 midterms, to tout the bill's benefits and revive the party's slumping poll numbers. Biden and his Democratic Party are betting that bipartisan progress and popular policies like investing in infrastructure and creating jobs can win over voters. The opposition Republican party remains divided over former president Donald Trump, his supporters' January 6 attack on the Capitol, and whether to cooperate with Biden on regular governance. "Despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans, we can work together," Biden declared during an event staged on the NH 175 Bridge, which local officials have sought funding for repairs for years.  Biden said the last 20 years saw the "backbone of this nation hollowed out" by lack of infrastructure investments and that his $1-trillion package will help lift the middle class and make the country more competitive globally.  Republicans won key elections this month by warning about inflation and taxes under Biden, and stirring up anger on cultural issues, and Biden's poll numbers are in a slump.  New Hampshire is home to a key US Senate race and two congressional contests for positions now held by Democrats, in a midterm where Biden's party can afford barely any losses.  Biden goes to Detroit on Wednesday to tout investment in electric vehicles, while Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to visit Columbus, Ohio, on Friday to highlight the package. The busy travel schedule is intended to hammer home the message that Democrats delivered on their promises. Neil Levesque, the executive director at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said it's no secret that Biden is coming to New Hampshire to help stem the bleeding ahead of 2022.  "My latest poll shows that 68% of people here in New Hampshire believe the country's on the wrong track, and that's a very devastating number for people who are incumbents and are perceived responsible for that feeling," Levesque said. In February, soon after Biden took office, 55% did, his poll shows. Wider concerns Midterm elections are always challenging for the party that holds the White House. But losses for the Democrats this month in Virginia and New Jersey have raised wider concerns.  New Hampshire Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, up for reelection in 2022, could face a close race, analysts say, even though the expected top Republican rival, Chris Sununu, decided to seek reelection for governor instead of challenging her.  Hassan has raised record amounts of money in successive quarters and is leaning into the bipartisan infrastructure bill, crisscrossing the state in recent weeks to visit water treatment plants, solar farms and other projects to tout the need for public investment.  "The measures that I helped fight for in this bill will strengthen our communities, jumpstart our economy, and create good jobs, and I look forward to working with the administration to get these dollars to New Hampshire as quickly as possible," Hassan said in a statement to Reuters.  Biden's job approval rating in New Hampshire - which he carried by 7.4 percentage points in 2020 - sits at around 44%, according to the latest statewide poll conducted in October by Saint Anselm College.  The entire congressional delegation, all Democrats, are now underwater on job approval, the poll showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/on-a-new-hampshire-bridge-biden-bets-infrastructure-beats-political-headwinds/articleshow/87746847.cms||---
---||India||Kerala losing paddy paradise to floods and a silent farmer flight||NEW DELHI: Flooding has been an integral part of life in Kuttanad. The seasonal disruption it inflicts is more than compensated for by the mineral-rich silt it leaves behind in what has become the “rice bowl” of Kerala. But over the last decade, and more conspicuously since 2018, flooding has become regular and, worse, the water doesn’t drain. Experts attribute the flooding to unseasonal rains and to the lowland sinking even further — the first a direct consequence of deforestation of the Western Ghats, and the latter, a result of rising sea levels. The sea-level rise is still fractional but in Kuttanad, the only place in India of substantial size where rice is cultivated close to 10 feet below sea level, it might prove catastrophic. Hundreds of farming families, rooted to this place for generations, are abandoning ancestral hearths to move to farmlands less vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change or to towns. The “exodus” is still largely invisible, especially to government and official agencies. “After the 1924 floods, there was an influx into Kuttanad as the soil had turned fertile. But after the floods of 2018, people are now moving out… The rise in sea level is very minute but if the flooding of rivers is followed by tidal floods, it will be very dangerous,” says KG Padmakumar, director of International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming. In Kainakary in Lower Kuttanad in Alappuzha district, where it is taking longer and longer for the waters to recede after each flood, the options for farmers have been shrinking by the year. P Rajkumar owned 2 acres of paddy fields and till 2018, life was comfortable for his small family that includes his wife, 13-year-old son and elderly mother. All that changed after the deluge in August that year. “There was water in our house for days. No electricity, no cellphone reception and we were scared to go out fearing sudden surges in the water level. We couldn’t sleep at night as there was no one else in the neighbourhood. Most people had fled to their relatives’ houses,” he says. “Drinking water increasingly became hard to obtain. Toilets were a big problem. Nowadays, we face floods through the year,” says his wife Bindu. The family has bought 3.5 cents of land in Gurupuram, a locality relatively safe from floods, and built a house. “My mother broke down when we left our ancestral home. There was a generations-old ‘sarpa kavu’ (sacred grove) near the house which was close to her heart. Even that had gone under water,” says Rajkumar. Radhakrishna Panikkar, who lives in ward 14 of Kainakary panchayat, relocates to his daughter’s house in the nearest town, Changanassery, whenever there is a threat of floods. “I am lucky that my daughter lives in the nearby town. What about those who do not have any such option?” asks the 75-year-old. On a sunny day, the sea of green padasekharams (paddy field clusters), undulating in the breeze and intersected by streams, is a picturesque advert for the “god’s own country”. The fields are protected by earthen bunds but breaching is common now. L P Chandraprakash, who resides close to Meenappally padasekharam in Kainakary, says the cluster has been water-logged for a year now. “There is no longer any paddy farming here. Nobody wants to live here. Bunds have been constructed under the Kuttanad package only on three sides. One side is open which allows water to enter the fields,” he says. There are around 5,000 families in Kainakary panchayat comprising 15 wards. The exodus of locals is not yet part of any government study and officials are reluctant to discuss the issue. “On average, 20-25 houses remain permanently locked in a ward where there are about 400 houses,” admits Jayan Chambakkulam of Integrated Rural Technology Centre, citing data from Haritha Karma Sena (the green task force of every local body), though he is ambivalent on the reasons. He does admit, “There is no provision for the water to flow out of Kainakary. The number of canals has come down and the existing ones have narrowed and easily spill over.” M C Prasad, president of Kainakary panchayat and a CPM leader, says many of the problems will be solved with the implementation of the government’s much-hyped but elusive ‘Kuttanad package’. He, however, agreed, “the unexpected arrival of water during rains is turning into a regular phenomenon. The breaching of bunds is another concern.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-losing-paddy-paradise-to-floods-and-a-silent-farmer-flight/articleshow/87746865.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

That’s one of the takeaways from a new report by the research arm of consultants McKinsey & Co. that examines the national balance sheets of ten countries representing more than 60% of world income. “We are now wealthier than we have ever been,” Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, said in an interview. Net worth worldwide rose to $514 trillion in 2020, from $156 trillion in 2000, according to the study. China accounted for almost one-third of the increase. Its wealth skyrocketed to $120 trillion from a mere $7 trillion in 2000, the year before it joined the World Trade Organization, speeding its economic ascent. The US, held back by more muted increases in property prices, saw its net worth more than double over the period, to $90 trillion. In both countries -- the world’s biggest economies -- more than two-thirds of the wealth is held by the richest 10% of households, and their share has been increasing, the report said. As computed by McKinsey, 68% of global net worth is stored in real estate. The balance is held in such things as infrastructure, machinery and equipment and, to a much lesser extent, so-called intangibles like intellectual property and patents. Financial assets are not counted in the global wealth calculations because they are effectively offset by liabilities: A corporate bond held by an individual investor, for instance, represents an I.O.U. by that company. The steep rise in net worth over the past two decades has outstripped the increase in global gross domestic product and has been fueled by ballooning property prices pumped up by declining interest rates, according to McKinsey. It found that asset prices are almost 50% above their long-run average relative to income. That raises questions about the sustainability of the wealth boom. “Net worth via price increases above and beyond inflation is questionable in so many ways,” Mischke said. “It comes with all kinds of side effects.” Surging real-estate values can make home ownership unaffordable for many people and increase the risk of a financial crisis -- like the one that hit the US in 2008 after a housing bubble burst. China could potentially run into similar trouble over the debt of property developers like China Evergrande Group. The ideal resolution would be for the world’s wealth to find its way into more productive investments that expand global GDP, according to the report. The nightmare scenario would be a collapse in asset prices that could erase as much as one-third of global wealth, bringing it more in line with world income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/amid-surge-in-wealth-worldwide-china-leapfrogs-us-to-top-spot/articleshow/87746932.cms||---
---||India||Earlier, auditor was looked at with dread: PM takes dig at UPA||NEW DELHI: In an oblique reference to the previous UPA government attacking the federal auditor over its controversial reports on allocation of 2G spectrum and coal blocks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said there was a time when auditing in the country was looked upon with apprehension and dread with “‘CAG vs government’ becoming the common thought of our system”. “But today, this mindset has changed. Today, audit is being considered as an important part of value addition,” the PM said after unveiling a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the headquarters of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) here. Stating that the relationship between the government and the auditor has changed because his government has nothing to hide, Modi said, “Earlier, due to lack of transparency in the banking sector, various wrong practices were followed. The result was that Nonperforming assets of banks kept increasing... and were brushed under the carpet. However, we put the truth of the previous governments in front of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/earlier-auditor-was-looked-at-with-dread-pm-takes-dig-at-upa/articleshow/87746968.cms||---
---||India||BJP to retain UP, SP to be distant second: Survey||NEW DELHI: BJP is set to retain Uttar Pradesh with a comfortable majority in the state assembly elections due early next year, a Times Now-Polstrat opinion poll has projected. BJP is projected to win 239 to 245 of the 403 seats, with the Samajwadi Party finishing a distant second with 119-125 seats, though more than doubling its 2017 tally. BSP is projected to lose a significant share of its votes to both SP and BJP and finish third with around 30 seats, while Congress could end up with five to eight seats, not very different from the seven it won in 2017. If the projections turn out to be accurate, Yogi Adityanath would become the first chief minister in Uttar Pradesh to serve two consecutive terms. The opinion poll indicated strong support for the Yogi government’s hard-line approach on law and order as well as, to a lesser extent, for its legal route to countering ‘forced’ conversions. On the Citizenship Amendment Act, however, opinion was more equally divided, with nearly half of the respondents seeing the Yogi government’s defence of it as an attempt to promote communalism. The poll also suggests that BJP’s charge of “Muslim appeasement” against SP and Congress has found resonance among the respondents. The opinion poll was conducted between November 6 and November 10 with a sample size of 9,000 respondents. The margin of error for the data is 3% with a confidence interval of 95%. According to C-Voter survey, the BJP and allies are projected to win 213 to 221 seats in 2022 assembly polls. The SP and its alliance partners are expected to win 152 to 160 seats this time. The BSP is likely to win just 16 to 20 seats. Congress party is likely to grab 6 to 10 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-to-retain-up-sp-to-be-distant-second-survey/articleshow/87747004.cms||---

The HCs and the SC cannot deal with it,” said a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli. However, the apex court clarified that if a Devaswom Board or temple administration is failing in its duty to make proper arrangements for the devotees or indulging in maladministration of the temple, then a devotee could be permitted to seek redressal of her/his grievances before the HCs or the SC through a writ petition. The ruling came on a petition filed by Srivari Dadaa, who had accused the Tirumala Tirupati Devaswom (TTD) Board of deviating from daily rituals. The Andhra Pradesh HC had on January 5 rejected the petitioner’s PIL and said, “procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others”. TTD is an independent trust that manages temples including the famous Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple, in AP. Dadaa has alleged that the temple authority has been performing sevas in a “wrongful and irregular procedure”. Agreeing with the HC, the CJI-led bench said, “ the constitutional courts can’t start interfering with daily rituals of the temple and its customs and practices as it is not judicially manageable. Can we manage daily puja? Which law mandates that constitutional courts can interfere in daily rituals. Can we dictate to temple authorities how a coconut is to be broken in front of the deity? Can we tell the priests how to carry out aarti? This appears to be a publicity interest litigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-hcs-cant-interfere-in-daily-temple-rituals/articleshow/87747166.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This is not just another incident. It is a well-thought-out experiment to create polarisation,” he said, adding it was the Modi government that was the target. His remarks came a day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar accused BJP of fomenting violence in view of the approaching UP polls and ministers in the MVA government in state claimed BJP was instigating rioting with an eye on local civic body polls in Maharashtra. Accusing Congress member Rahul Gandhi of “leading” the polarisation, Fadnavis said Rahul was “well aware” that no masjids had been burned in Tripura, yet he had tweeted on November 8 that Muslims were being attacked in Tripura. “And on November 11, large processions are carried out in Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon,” he said. “How is it possible that these rallies are spontaneous, and if there was planning, how is it that the government and police intelligence (department) are unaware? These rallies were carried out with support from the MVA government. Shops owned by Hindus were burnt, and no leader from MVA spoke about it,” he further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-violence-experiment-to-create-anarchy-devendra-fadnavis/articleshow/87747208.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Bengaluru||NEP effect: Universities in Karnataka introduce UG programmes||BENGALURU: With the introduction of National Education Policy (NEP) in Karnataka, universities which had only post-graduate (PG) programmes on campus till now are opening up for undergraduate (UG) courses too. In a first, Bangalore University conducted counseling for UG seats on Monday and is opening up its campus for 18-year-olds next week. Bengaluru City University also started a constituent college to offer UG education this year and is expected to start UG programmes on its own campus in the city centre by 2022-23. As per NEP, the four-year undergraduate programmes have come into force in the colleges in the state. A student who completes four years can do a post-graduate programme in one year. If the student has taken a research component in the fourth year, he can directly enrol for PhD, even without a PG degree. Karnataka State Higher Education Council vice-chairman Thimme Gowda B said most universities in the state will start UG programmes by next year. "Students can save one year by directly entering PhD after the four-year UG programme. Moreover, the UG students will also have the benefit of senior teachers on campuses. While PG and PhD students manage more through self-study, UG students will need more of their guidance," he said. "The PG programmes have got sandwiched between the new UG programme and PhD, becoming weak and irrelevant. Research will move from PG level to UG level," said KR Venugopal, vice-chancellor of BU. BU has received 30 students each in its UG Science, Biological Science programmes and 20 in the Arts programme. "Our professors will find it interesting to teach UG students. They are usually much more responsive and enthusiastic than the older set of students," he said. Bengaluru City University will have its own UG programmes in all departments from next year. While it started a constituent college – Multi-Disciplinary Constituent College for Women -- in Malleshwaram, only BCom programmes have kicked off with 21 students in the first year. NEP envisages that the affiliating system should move over and more colleges gain autonomy and get a degree-awarding status depending upon their performance and NAAC accreditation. This will also change the roles universities will play in the future. MK Shreedhar, who was on the drafting committee of the NEP, said the distinction between UG and PG programmes will disappear in the days to come. "There will only be a change in the nomenclature. The critical matter is the learning outcomes. The universities should become lifelong-learning centres. As of now, we have a structural approach to education and life -- we start college around 18 years, move on to PG at a certain age and then on to a job. But NEP should be a gamechanger where people can exit and return to studies whenever they want. If that trend picks up, each class will have students of various age groups," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nep-effect-univs-in-ktaka-introduce-ug-programmes/articleshow/87747228.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The ordinance comes in the wake of the high court’s verdict in August that said the Palike had no legal sanction to levy such a fee.While the civic body was to lose the powers of levying fee, it had also faced the prospect of repaying the amount collected in the past (to the tune of about Rs 3,500 crore). Officials said the ordinance has been promulgated to circumvent the same by validating powers of the BBMP chief to levy such a fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/building-plan-fee-govt-issues-ordinance-to-validate-bbmps-powers/articleshow/87747246.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||State takes digital step to verify papers for jobs & edu||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government is inching closer to a paperless system by introducing digital verification of documents for employment and education purposes.Using the government of India application Digilocker, the e-governance department has more or less completed digitisation of 2.8 crore students’ education details, including marksheets from 80 educational institutions in the state for 2019-20 and 2020-21. These include secondary school leaving certificate (SSLC), pre-university course (PUC), professional courses like BE and MBBS, and pure science, commerce and arts courses.With Digilocker application already having a direct link with the government-issued documents like Aadhaar, PAN and driving licence, the department plans to get on board private companies to digitally verify documents for employment purposes.“We have roped in 49 departments in the Karnataka government to secure access under Digilocker for digital verification of probable employees’ documents. We are in the process of getting private companies as well for the purpose,” said HM Shreevyas, project director for Digilocker.The process is also expected to authenticate the education credentials of every aspirant on account of a digital signature. “We have provided the option of a digital signature to every education institution, which will authenticate the academic credentials of the candidate and weed out fake certificates,” said Shreevyas.Access to records will be available only with prior consent. For this purpose, the state government will bring a consent platform called e-Sahamati. DPAR additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said the Data Governance Committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify the approval for private companies to access digital records of prospective employees.“With data protection and privacy being of utmost importance, the e-Sahamati framework will assist the data fiduciaries to share it with private companies only on consent being given by the candidate,” said Chawla.Chawla said once the framework and its rules are ratified, the government will invite private companies to secure a licence under e-Sahamati and proceed further to secure the data.It is said the government will then equip every small and big private company to have a trained professional with access to data for accessing and downloading records for their verification. “The department will secure the details of one particular person, who will be notified by the company as the nodal officer and give him/her the technical education on how to use the application,” said officials.The department is confident of the depository and Digilocker being safe from hacking on account of the sophisticated encryption being similar to the one UIDAI used to protect Aadhaar details of citizens.The same access can also be used by educational institutions for enrolling students for higher education. The government is hoping to digitise all education records of students for up to 10-15 years, from 2006, thereby giving the departments a substantial pool of documents for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-takes-digital-step-to-verify-papers-for-jobs-edu/articleshow/87747247.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The bench also said that a drive should be launched to identify such vehicles and the authorities should submit a compliance report regarding action taken.The authorities were told to take into consideration the operation of night clubs and organisations in violation of Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000. Regarding the petitioner’s contention on allowing use of loudspeakers and public address systems at 15-odd religious places in Thanisandra and surrounding areas, the authorities were asked to state under what provisions of law permissions have been granted. They were also asked what action has been taken to restrict the use of this equipment in accordance with the rules. The religious institutions claimed they are permitted to use loudspeakers and public address systems by way of a circular issued by the Wakf board in 2017. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/identify-vehicles-with-modified-silencers-hc/articleshow/87747251.cms||---

On March 31, 2015, the state government issued a notification clarifying the rate of tax on M-sand is reduced to 5.5%. The same was interpreted by the finance department to mean that prior to the issuance of notification, M-sand was classifiable at a higher rate i.e., at the rate of 14.5% under residuary entry and a demand notice was issued for April 2014 to March 2015.The notice was challenged before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal which ruled in favour of the department. The assessee company then challenged the January 3, 2019 order of the tribunal holding that M-sand is not covered under entry 83 of Karnataka Value Added Tax Act-2013.Allowing the petition, the division bench pointed out that as per the records placed before the court, which included a report of a project sponsored by the department of mines and geology and conducted by the civil engineering department of IISc, both M-sand and the river/natural sand are having similar physical properties and hence, the same cannot be considered as excluded from entry 83 of schedule-III of the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/m-sand-must-draw-same-levy-as-natural-sand-says-court/articleshow/87747253.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Clerk who took bribe from deceased’s kin convicted||BENGALURU: An official who harassed the family of a deceased government employee to clear the file on compensation payable to the latter has been sentenced to four years in jail and fined Rs 20,000. A local court in Tumakuru on Monday awarded the sentence to 41-year-old K Ramesh, a second-division clerk in Kunigal town municipal council. He was caught red-handed in 2015 while accepting Rs 5,000 bribe, and Lokayukta police filed a chargesheet under the Prevention of Corruption Act. “Accused Ramesh is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of four years and has to pay fine of Rs 20,000. In case of default of payment, he shall undergo further simple imprisonment for two months,” read the order passed by S Sudindranath, VII additional sessions and special court judge. Ramesh was trapped while accepting the bribe from the bereaved family of a waterman, Krishnappa from Kunigal, who had died on duty in 2015. The government had appointed Krishnappa’s son Nagaraj to his father’s post on compensatory grounds. Nagaraj had approached Ramesh seeking his help in getting death benefits of his father. Ramesh demanded a bribe of Rs 10,000 to clear the documents. Though Krishnappa’s family requested Ramesh to decrease the amount owing to their financial status, the latter was adamant. Nagaraj paid Rs 3,000 as advance and the family approached the Lokayukta with a complaint. Special public prosecutor N Basavaraju said. “The trap was laid on December 9, 2015. He was arrested the same day and sent to judicial custody. Nagaraj had recorded his conversations with Ramesh, wherein he demanded the bribe and refused to decrease the amount when requested. The voice recordings played an important role in the conviction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/clerk-who-took-bribe-from-deceaseds-kin-convicted/articleshow/87747255.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The 19-year-old student had booked the cab to travel home from her educational institution near Yelahanka. “The cab driver asked me the pickup and destination details. He also asked me how many people would be travelling. When I said I would be alone, he used filthy words,” she said in her complaint. However, Poorvik brushed away the allegations. “She booked my cab and called me asking if I was coming or not. I replied that I was reaching the educational institution. She suddenly cancelled the trip without valid reason. I grew frustrated and demanded an explanation from her,” he told police.

---||Bengaluru||Poor civic infrastructure may force us to shut shop: Bengaluru traders||BENGALURU: With the poor condition of NR Road, SJP Road, SP Road and Avenue Road and adjacent stretches keeping away their customers, some hardware merchants are left with no option but to shut down their business. According to traders, the roads just don’t exist due to their repeated digging by the agencies, whereas streetlights are not operational. There are no public toilets either. They say their repeated requests to their MLA, MP and civic agencies have not been of much use. A TOI team visiting the area recently found that overflowing drains, broken pedestrian paths, open manholes and dug-up carriageways were common sights. BBMP records show SP Road was dug up in 2018 by BWSSB to fix underlying sewage pipes. The project was to be completed by the end of 2019, but was delayed. Later it was halted due to the pandemic. The stories of other roads in the area aren’t very different. Saifee Eripurwala, a trader, said he has two shops on the same stretch, but he is unable to visit them. “There are no footpaths and I cannot walk on the road because of potholes and stagnating sewage water. I am worried I might have to close the shop because of the poor civic infrastructure,” he said. According to Karnataka Hardware and Allied Merchants’ Association (KHAMA), there are 20,000 merchants in the area with each employing at least five people. Claiming that the area generates 42% of the state’s taxes, the traders wonder why they have to put up with such apathy. “Customers are hesitant to use these roads due to their poor condition. We are not demanding new roads, just patchwork would be helpful. We’ve met MLA Uday Garudhachaar, BBMP and Ben Smart City Limited (BenSCL) officials, but they pass the buck to BWSSB, which in turn blames BBMP,” Vikram Agarwal, president of KHAMA, told TOI. “Avenue Road has been closed for over six months now, and our trade has been affected badly,” Kiran Hebbar, a member of KHAMA. “Poor coordination between civic agencies is an issue,” said Rahul Goyal BK, secretary of KHAMA. Women staff are hesitant to work in these areas due to lack of toilets and streetlights, Goyal said, adding: “BBMP wants to develop Silver Jubilee Park. Why not divert the funds to provide us basic infrastructure.” Members of KHAMA and other traders have raised numerous requests on Sahaaya 2.0 and Namma Bengaluru application, but in vain.  BBMP officials said the fault lies with BenSCL and BWSSB. “We have issued notices to the civic agencies to complete the works fast and fix the roads.” BWSSB said it will fix the roads in 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/poor-civic-infra-may-force-us-to-shut-shop-traders/articleshow/87747258.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The passenger blamed the airline for careless handling of his expensive equipment and lack of uniform security rules to carry drones as it had been allowed as cabin luggage from Mumbai to Bengaluru.  Sabit Tisekar, 30, a filmmaker who travels across India on photography and film assignments, claimed he often carries his work equipment — DJI Mavic drone fitted with a hi-end camera — in his hand luggage on flights within the country. Last week, he came to Bengaluru for an assignment and his production manager flew down from Mumbai on November 9 with the drone camera. “He took the Air India flight and before boarding, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at Mumbai airport took a written undertaking at the security checks with regard to the drone and it was allowed in the hand luggage,” Tisekar said. On Sunday, the photographer was leaving after his work on Air Asia flight I5 1561 from Bengaluru to Mumbai. He reached the KIA by afternoon. “I was carrying the drone in my hand luggage but I was told to check in the device saying drones were not allowed onboard. Since the officers stood their ground and I didn’t want to miss the flight, I ran downstairs to the Air Asia counter and the ground staff advised me to check in the drone. They promised that they will personally look into it. They pasted a ‘fragile’ sticker on my bag carrying the device and also made me sign on it,” he said. However, Tisekar was in for a rude shock when he collected the bag after landing in Mumbai. “The lens was damaged which had happened during the baggage handling by the ground staff. I raised a formal complaint with the Air Asia personnel at Mumbai airport. But they asked why I didn’t carry the drone in hand on flight,” fumed Tisekar who lodged a complaint with Air Asia’s nodal officer. The photographer was also agitated over lack of a non-uniform rule in carrying drones at two different airports. “The CISF security officer in Mumbai said it’s OK to carry a drone in hand but his colleague from Bengaluru said otherwise. It is ridiculous,” he lamented. Sources with the CISF in KIA said as per the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security guidelines of 2020 that are applicable to all airports in the country, devices like drones must be carried only in the check-in luggage and the batteries need to taken in hand luggage. Also, during inspection by security personnel at the airport, the passenger must explain as to why he/she is carrying such batteries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2l-drone-cam-checked-in-at-kia-damaged-airline-blamed/articleshow/87747259.cms||Petlee Peter

The instructions were issued at a review meeting held to discuss the progress of various developmental works in Yelahanka zone. Gupta has been reviewing all peripheral zones in the city. The chief commissioner said that roads that have been cut for various reasons need to be restored on a war-footing. “I have instilled a sense of urgency among both BBMP and BWSSB engineers that restoration works has to commence. BWSSB has to give us a certificate stating that they have completed work and we can then start restoring the roads. Most of the time, they do not certify that a certain work is over and hence restoration process is delayed...” “Similar instructions have been given to engineers from other zones too. I have made it clear that even ground-level engineers should know what is to be done. This is to ensure coordination among various related agencies,” Gupta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/start-fixing-roads-bbmp-chief-tells-officials/articleshow/87747260.cms||---

The BBMP commissioner, Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner, BDA chief and BBMP special commissioner (revenue) were the members of the panel.Then commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad failed to hold even a single meeting and was later transferred to the revenue department. As the panel’s term was set to end on June 28, 2021, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta requested the urban development department to grant more time for the panel considering the pandemic situation. The department issued a circular earlier this month extending another six months for the delimitation committee, to complete the task by January 28, 2022. Sources in the committee said a proposal has been made to include 58 villages on the fringes of Mahadevapura, Yeshwantpur and Bengaluru South.“The rule doesn’t allow us to go beyond 1-km radius, but some MLAs are expecting us to include areas that are 5-10km away,” they said, adding: “We are getting applications from various organisations too, but it is not possible.”The committee is also looking at other consequences. “According to the rules, if a village is brought under the BBMP, the gram panchayat members concerned will become associate members of the BBMP council for the rest of their term,” said a member.Will up property tax: MinST Somashekar, minister for cooperation and Yeshwantpur MLA, said, “I understand it is not easy to bring in more villages under BBMP. But our intention was different. Adding more villages will increase property tax and augment the civic agency’s revenue.” The Supreme Court, meanwhile, is hearing the matter of elections to the BBMP on December 6. Expanding the BBMP limits and increasing the number of wards to ensure better administration were some of the reasons that the state government had cited to delay the polls. “We will wait for the Supreme Court hearing, see what it decides and if necessary, make preparation for the elections,” said senior officials from the Palike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/legislators-propose-to-add-more-villages-to-bbmp-officials-dispose/articleshow/87747261.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Granting four weeks to the respondents to submit their objections, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said that registrations done pursuant to the impugned notification would be subject to further orders.The petition was filed by Mohammed Dastagir, an advocate from Mysuru city who worked in the transport department before his retirement in 2014. “In order to facilitate dealer-level registration of motor vehicles, respondent number one (principal secretary to the transport department) issued a draft notification on October 26 proposing to amend rule 33 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. Only five days’ time was allowed for the public to file their objections and suggestions on the draft. The proposed amendment is ultra vires of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,” the petitioner said He said he submitted his objections on October 29, but they were not considered and the amendment notification was issued on October 31, a holiday. Dastagir claimed under the amendment, even an employee of a dealer with sufficient administrative experience and in regular employment can issue a certificate of registration under section 41(3) of MV Act. “Giving the power of registration to a dealer's employee will have far-reaching effects. All other subsequent actions, including insuring the vehicle, depends on the entries made on the certificate of registration. Any wrong entry, intentional or unintentional, can result in denial of insurance claim and ownership claim,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pil-challenges-registration-of-vehicles-by-dealers/articleshow/87747263.cms||---

Passengers inconvenienced by the flooding said no action has been taken by railway authorities to resolve the issue despite several complaints. “The leaking roof shows that one of the major railway stations in the city is poorly maintained. An inquiry should be conducted and action should be taken against staff found responsible,” said a passenger at the station. Videos of water gushing out of a drain spout also went viral. Umesh B Rao, co-founder of Institute for Research Development & Training of Construction Trades & Management, said the rainwater pipe’s placement on the platform is wrong. “Such a drainage system is unacceptable,” added the civil engineer. Rajkumar Dugar, founder of Citizens for Citizens, an NGO, said: “Cantonment is the oldest station in Bengaluru and is located in the heart of the city. Every year, it leaks during rain and railway officials are aware of the problem. But they haven’t fixed it so far. This is a huge let down for rail passengers.” Bengaluru divisional railway manager Shyam Singh was unavailable for comments. Revamp, suburban terminal proposals on paperSWR’s ambitious plans to redevelop Cantonment railway station and convert it into a suburban terminal remain on paper. In April 2019, the railway board sanctioned a new suburban rail terminal at Cantonment on the lines of Mumbai’s Victoria terminus. It was supposed to get five new stabling lines and four platforms. A suburban terminal will also help run additional Memu trains to places like Hosur, Devanahalli and Whitefield. Sources said the amount allocated for the suburban terminal was diverted to Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal (Byappanahalli third coaching terminal) after the project cost escalated from Rs 116 crore in 2012 to Rs 314 crore in 2021. Similarly, there was a plan to redevelop the station under the PPP model. In 2017, two-four acres of land at Cantonment was identified for the purpose. The land is now with Rail Land Development Authority, but the project has seen no progress. Though it adjoins SWR’s Construction Organisation’s headquarters, the station continues to be neglected. “This should be the fourth terminal of the city but no work has started even with the railway board sanctioning it. Track-quadrupling work between Bengaluru Cantonment and Whitefield is progressing so the terminal plan shouldn’t be delayed more,” said Dugar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/roof-of-cantt-railway-station-leaksafter-rain-passengers-rue-apathy/articleshow/87747264.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

There is nothing wrong in giving police protection to anyone. But the man never had any life threat in these years but has suddenly found enemies. I am presuming the Congress is in a much better position to explain the threat as they have the information,” he said.Opposition leader Siddaramaiah had tweeted that several influential people are involved in the scam, and hence protecting the accused was necessary. He claimed only Sriki knew the account details and nothing is written anywhere. The BJP went on the offensive against “unemployed” Siddaramaiah and said the entire case is being given the colour of scam in an one-upmanship tussle between the former CM and KPCC president DK Shivakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hdk-questions-cong-on-police-protection-demand/articleshow/87747248.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No recreational activities in forest area: HC||Bengaluru: The high court on Tuesday disposed of a PIL plea on shifting Atal Bihari Vajpayee Zoological Park from Ballari to Bilikallu reserve forest, Kamalapura, Hosapete, observing that no recreational activities should be allowed in the forest area and minimal construction should be carried out. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi also said clearance from the authorities is mandatory for shifting the zoo. Santosh Martin and Rajesh M Kurpad, two Ballari-based petitioners interested in wildlife preservation, contended that the authorities had not obtained permission from the apex court and there was also no environment impact assessment as per the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. They said the construction of a zoo close to the wildlife sanctuary with sloth bears would have an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive zone and could also increase the chance of conflict among animals, apart from reducing the sanctuary area. The authorities, however, said that zoo shifting is not a “non-forest activity” and hence no permission is required. They added that no recreational activity would be taken up at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Park in the forest area and minimum construction would be required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-recreational-activities-in-forest-area-hc/articleshow/87747249.cms||---

From the labour side, there is no place bigger for us. It remains our largest delivery organisation and the place where we see a ton of innovation coming out,” he said in an exclusive interaction with TOI. He described India as the company’s centre of skills. “It will be the place which will have a profound impact on our teams as we re-enter the broader market ecosystem,” he said. The managed infrastructure services company completed its separation from IBM earlier this month. The company has about 90,000 employees, of which a high proportion is in India. The company does not provide a geographic breakup of its workforce. Schroeter is moving fast. A week after the separation from IBM, Kyndryl and Microsoft announced a partnership under which they plan to launch a series of new managed services designed to accelerate hybrid-cloud adoption, advance artificial intelligence, enhance cybersecurity resilience, and modernise enterprise IT operations. Schroeter said the business was previously heavily focused on IBM, and part of the business’s mission was to help manage IBM technologies. “At the heart of us turning this business around is in our ability to participate in the broader ecosystem in a way that we couldn’t do before...We are going to have a substantial relationship with Microsoft and the Googles and AWSs of the world, and that’s what our customers are telling us – build capabilities and help them manage workloads. Up to this point, we didn’t have the investment to do it and the freedom of action to build relationships with them. You’ll see us move quickly here,” he said. Kyndryl has, as Schroeter has previously said, “a revenue growth problem, and...a profitability problem.” Revenues have been declining, and the company has been suffering a loss. The managed infrastructure services market as a whole is growing, he said, but Kyndryl has not been in that part. He thinks Kyndryl has a real opportunity to differentiate with its IP and data. “That sits at the heart of the platform we have. We are the biggest, so we have more data than anyone on how this version of SAP runs on that infrastructure with these other cloud providers. We are collecting all of that data, how they interact. We are just now starting to use that data in the right way to figure out what we can automate, what we can fix before it even becomes a problem, how we can help our customers really reduce their operational risk,” he said. Cloud, data (AI/ML), and security, he said, are the three top-of-mind things for customers, and the company is investing heavily in all of these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kyndryl-ceo-says-india-is-the-companys-centre-of-tech-skills/articleshow/87747316.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Mysuru||Karnataka takes digital step to verify documents for jobs & education||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government is inching closer to a paperless system by introducing digital verification of documents for employment and education purposes. Using the government of India application Digilocker, the e-governance department has more or less completed digitisation of 2.8 crore students’ education details, including marksheets from 80 educational institutions in the state for 2019-20 and 2020-21. These include secondary school leaving certificate (SSLC), pre-university course (PUC), professional courses like BE and MBBS, and pure science, commerce and arts courses. With Digilocker application already having a direct link with the government-issued documents like Aadhaar, PAN and driving licence, the department plans to get on board private companies to digitally verify documents for employment purposes. “We have roped in 49 departments in the Karnataka government to secure access under Digilocker for digital verification of probable employees’ documents. We are in the process of getting private companies as well for the purpose,” said HM Shreevyas, project director for Digilocker. The process is also expected to authenticate the education credentials of every aspirant on account of a digital signature. “We have provided the option of a digital signature to every education institution, which will authenticate the academic credentials of the candidate and weed out fake certificates,” said Shreevyas. Access to records will be available only with prior consent. For this purpose, the state government will bring a consent platform called e-Sahamati. DPAR additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said the Data Governance Committee will meet on Wednesday to ratify the approval for private companies to access digital records of prospective employees. “With data protection and privacy being of utmost importance, the e-Sahamati framework will assist the data fiduciaries to share it with private companies only on consent being given by the candidate,” said Chawla. Chawla said once the framework and its rules are ratified, the government will invite private companies to secure a licence under e-Sahamati and proceed further to secure the data. It is said the government will then equip every small and big private company to have a trained professional with access to data for accessing and downloading records for their verification. “The department will secure the details of one particular person, who will be notified by the company as the nodal officer and give him/her the technical education on how to use the application,” said officials. The department is confident of the depository and Digilocker being safe from hacking on account of the sophisticated encryption being similar to the one UIDAI used to protect Aadhaar details of citizens. The same access can also be used by educational institutions for enrolling students for higher education. The government is hoping to digitise all education records of students for up to 10-15 years, from 2006, thereby giving the departments a substantial pool of documents for verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/state-takes-digital-step-to-verify-docu-for-jobs-edu/articleshow/87753759.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Globally, GitHub has added 16 million new users in 2021. The ‘2021 The State Of The Octoverse’, the annual GitHub report released on Tuesday, says that almost 70% of active users in the code repository are now from outside North America. The fastest growing countries and regions outside of the US include Indonesia, Brazil, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, UK and China. JavaScript is the top language, while Python continues to be the second most widely used language, and Java the third. TypeScript, which moved up to the fourth position last year, maintains that position. In fact, of all the 10 languages surveyed, only Shell and C changed places from last year -- Shell climbed one notch up to 8th position, displacing C. According to the report, teams perform 43% better using automation. It says that automating software delivery is a key enabler in open source, and it is also helping teams go faster at scale. “Automation helps reduce repetitive tasks, redundancies and errors, allowing developer teams to focus on higher-value challenges, and drive innovation. Ultimately, automation aims at empowering developers, enhancing developer experience and productivity, and helping create the right environment for them to innovate, solve challenging problems, and make a difference,” said Maneesh Sharma, general manager, GitHub India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/githubs-active-india-student-base-grew-24-8-this-year/articleshow/87747320.cms||---

Search and rescue teams recovered the body of a woman from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Vancouver, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Staff sergeant Janelle Shoihet added that investigators have received two missing person reports, but that they believe "there may have been other occupied vehicles that were lost in the slide." "The total number of people and vehicles unaccounted for has not been confirmed," she said. The rains had let up by late Tuesday afternoon. But mudslides, rocks and debris washed out several highways leading to Vancouver, trapping hundreds of motorists who were rescued by military helicopters by nightfall on Monday. Local television showed video footage of the Trans Canada highway -- which connects the coastal city to the rest of the country -- inundated. A bridge was also washed out. Other routes have also been closed, according to Drive BC, which said on Twitter: "Highways are closed until further notice." As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver would have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada. Anyone taking this circuitous route, however, would have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test upon re-entry into Canada. Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports. "Both CN and CP Rail indicate that no rail traffic is currently able to transit between Kamloops and Vancouver," a port spokesperson told AFP. In Ottawa, prime minister Justin Trudeau said his government is "watching closely" the evolving situation in British Columbia. He was to speak with the province's premier, John Horgan, later in the day to see what federal help might be needed. "We'll be there to help in any way, shape or form," he told reporters. Record rainfallEnvironment Canada said up to 250 millimeters (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado. The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town. On Tuesday, thousands of British Columbians were unable to return to their homes due to evacuation orders still in effect due to flooding in a dozen communities -- including all of Merritt and parts of Abbotsford -- and as many as 9,000 homes were without power. In Merritt, flooding compromised the wastewater treatment plant, while thousands in Abbotsford reportedly slept in their cars on an elevated road overnight, as farms in the Fraser Valley were inundated. Others took shelter at emergency sites set up across the province, with some also sleeping in church pews or at schools, local media said. "Everyone's been very good-humored," Andrew Clark, a musician stuck with a thousand other travelers in Hope, 150 kilometers (90 miles) east of Vancouver, told public broadcaster CBC. "Everyone knows that we are in the same boat, so that's all quite good, but I think there's a sort of general air of disappointment that we can't find out more information about what's happening down the road," he said. "People are a little bit worried about how many nights we might be staying here."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/one-dead-in-mudslides-that-cut-off-vancouver-from-rest-of-canada/articleshow/87747321.cms||---

In the quarterfinals at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Tuesday, the hosts registered a five-wicket win to set up a clash with Punjab at the Alur cricket stadium on Thursday. Opting to bowl in a match which was delayed by 30 minutes and reduced to 48 overs a side due to overnight rain, Karnataka restricted MP to 169/9 before overhauling the target in 42.2 overs. Karnataka bowlers kept the run rate below four an over and reduced the opposition to 42/3 by the 14th over. Skipper Pooja Vastrakar (40, 75b, 3x4, 1x6) held up one end, while Soumya Tiwari top-scored with a patient 73-ball-45 to take the team to 169. For the bowling unit, spinner Chandu V continued with her fine form, claiming 2 for 25. Shreyanka Patil and C Prathyusha too chipped in with two wickets apiece.In reply, Karnataka lost the in-form D Vrinda (7) early in the chase but Shubha S (43) and G Divya (28) steadied the innings. There was a brief lull in Karnataka's victory march when they lost Shubha and skipper Veda Krishnamurthy (17) in quick succession. But the middle order withstood the pressure, with wicketkeeper-batter K Prathyoosha scoring a 58-ball 45 (4x4) to see her team through.Brief scores: MP: 169/9 in 48 overs (Pooja Vastrakar 40, Soumya Tiwari 45; Chandu V 2-25, Shrenya Patil 2-27, C Prathyusha 2-29) lost to Karnataka: 170/5 in 42.2 overs (S Shubha 43, G Divya 28, Prathyoosha 45 n.o; Anushka Sharma 2-34).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-quell-mp-challenge-face-punjab-in-semis/articleshow/87747324.cms||---

The state transport department has given its nod to the increased fares in response to the request made by private bus operators after a rise in fuel prices. The secretary of the transport department, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, told this reporter on Tuesday that the government would put up hoardings and banners everywhere so that “people know the exact bus fares”. “We had to fix the rates because the private bus operators were charging more money from the passengers. Now, if they ask for more money, people may lodge a complaint against them. We will take action against the violators and even cancel their permit,” Agarwal said, adding that all the regional transport officers would conduct meetings with the bus operators and discuss the new fares. Despite the transport secretary’s warning, private bus operators continued to charge exorbitant fares from passengers on Tuesday. Uday Shankar Prasad Singh, the president of the Bihar Motor Transport Federation, claimed, “We will not implement the new rates because we won’t earn any profit. Around 70% of us had suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and rise in fuel prices.” Earlier, the bus fares were revised in 2018. The new rates have been fixed under sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The government has implemented a hike of Rs 1.50/km for general buses, Rs 1.70/km for deluxe buses, Rs 2/km for deluxe AC buses and Rs 2.50/km for Volvo, Mercedes and similar buses. Besides, a hike of Rs 6.4 has been enforced for city buses for the first 4km and Rs 3 for the next 2km. Meanwhile, many passengers welcomed the new fares fixed by the government, but criticised the private bus operators for their arbitrariness. Aman Kumar, a bank employee, said, “The government rates are better than what the private operators are charging from passengers.” Bimal Kant, a resident of Lohanipur, rued, “Everything is costly now — fuels, bus fares and consumable items.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-tighten-noose-around-private-bus-operators-charging-high-fares/articleshow/87744143.cms||---

The year saw the burst of the disruptive second phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, pre-monsoon Amphan cyclone that damaged standing maize crops and four phases of floods with rain lashing the state as recent as last month, besides the hooch deaths this month, forcing the CM to go for a detailed review to overcome the lacunae and lapses in the implementation of the prohibition law that otherwise is deemed to be stringent on its own.  The ruling JD(U), of course, entered the Union cabinet, but it left heartburns. In the process, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) also got split that left Chirag Paswan, late Ram Vilas Paswan’s son and PM Narendra Modi’s self-declared ‘Hanuman,’ standing by the wayside -- a situation that was redeemed partly by the conferment of Padma Bhushan award to the senior Paswan, posthumously. The JD(U) overcame the initial hiccups by winning the bypolls for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats. The state also witnessed beating, manhandling and mistreatment meted out by the police to the opposition MLAs in the assembly for registering protests during the passage of the Bihar State Special Armed Police Bill, 2021. On the industries front, the state had its ethanol policy, and if the things kept going along the expected lines, Bihar could emerge as the country’s ethanol hub, as its manufacturing will be done by using (broken) rice and maize, besides sugar cane. Given the backdrop, the ruling and opposition parties reacted to the year gone by along expected lines with the ruling NDA combine seeing the glowing white on the curtain and the opposition the grim black patches on it. “CM Nitish Kumar has all along practised politics with a difference, as he not only has shown commitment to the state development consistently, but also prepares policies and plans to implement them and does not merely make announcements,” JD(U) chief spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar said on Tuesday. “He tackled the issues related to 32 lakh migrants who returned to Bihar from various states, and transferred money into their accounts under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method, which was also adopted by other states. The government went to the assembly elections last year with the second edition of the ‘Saat Nishchay’ prpgarmme and has also been implementing it,” Neeraj added. “The state government achieved vaccination of seven crore people and is also busy transforming the state into the ethanol production hub. The work is being done in infrastructure development and on improving health and educational facilities,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Chand Patel said. However, the opposition has remained unimpressed. “The government has failed to fulfill the promises as had been made by the JD(U) and its major allies in their poll manifestos. Neither jobs have been given to the unemployed, nor employment opportunities created,” RJD senior MLA Bhai Birendra said. “There is no control on law and order, prohibition has failed and the old disease of making transfers of officials for money minting has still been going on,” he alleged. On the other hand, while enumerating the government failures, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra also pointed to the “regular expressions of disagreement on policy matters,” including from the BJP, that, as he said, was the “manifest sign of lurking political instability in the ruling combine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nda-hails-opposition-assails-one-year-of-nitish-govt/articleshow/87744155.cms||Abhay Singh

Nitish took oath as the CM on November 24, 2005 and since then he has been continuing on the post, barring the nine months’ tenure of Jitan Ram Manjhi as the CM from May 20, 2014 to February 22, 2015. “The party has decided to organize special programmes at its state headquarters and all district offices on November 24 to mark the Nitish Kumar’s good governance in the state,” JD(U) chief spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar said at a press conference here on Tuesday. Neeraj said the party would organize discussions/symposiums on the social impact of the schemes launched by CM Nitish and other achievements of the JD(U)-led government. “JD(U) will also launch a new slogan –“Incomparable 16 years of impartial leadership and inclusive growth” on the completion of 16 years of the Nitish government,” he said. Neeraj also said Nitish is the only leader in the country’s political arena who does not believe in merely making announcements, but takes resolutions to execute his visions. “The 'Saat Nischay' (seven resolves) programme is an example of his strong commitment towards inclusive development,” the JD(U) leader said. Speaking on the occasion, JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha said coincidentally CM Nitish completed one year of his fourth term on Tuesday itself. Nitish took the oath as the CM for his fourth term on November 16, 2020. But he will complete 16 years on November 24. Kushwaha said the state government under Nitish Kumar has achieved several milestones in the field of development and progress. The party leaders would celebrate the day (Nov 24) by propagating the good works of Nitish Kumar among the masses. JD(U) state general secretary Mrityunjay Kumar Singh and state secretary Basudev Kushwaha were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-celebrate-16-years-of-nitishs-governance-on-nov-24/articleshow/87744170.cms||Madan Kumar

Under the instruction of the Calcutta High Court, the complaints of aspiring teachers are being heard by the SSC. We are trying to resolve the issues fast. For this, we have created a special cell. Apart from hearing the cases, we are also taking legal advices from lawyers,” said Basu. The minister added that they were doing exactly what the Calcutta High Court had asked them to do. “The HC gave us three months. Six senior officers of the SSC were hearing the cases daily. We will submit the report to HC. For job creations, we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the desire of chief minister Mamata Banerjee,” he said. Meanwhile, fire minister Sujit Bose faced the ire of assembly Speaker Biman Bandyopadhyay when he said that he had no figures of the fire incidents and deaths in such mishaps.

On the face of it, it may all look fine. But they might be laced with toxic chemicals that may eventually harm your health instead of providing you the necessary nutrients. A report prepared by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on groundwater contamination in Vadodara has revealed that toxic pollutants are not only causing adverse environmental impact but also entering the human food chain. This is happening in Padra, the vegetable bowl of Central Gujarat, located at the doorstep of Vadodara city. The central pollution watchdog has prepared a report on groundwater contamination due to poor operation of the Vadodara Effluent Channel Project (VECL) and contaminated industrial sites in Vadodara’s Padra and Bharuch’s Jambusar areas. Based on a complaint filed by Farmers Action Group (FAG), CPCB’s regional directorate at Vadodara along with officials from regional office of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) had started random sample survey and monitoring of VECL’s channel earlier this year. VECL is an industry-supported body responsible for conveyance of treated wastewater from industrial units in and around Vadodara district through a 55 km long channel into the Gulf of Khambhat. The report has revealed gross mismanagement of industrial effluent which has severely contaminated groundwater in Luna, Umraya, Dudhwada and Pilodra village of Vadodara’s Padra taluka and Jambusar taluka of Bharuch district. Analysis as well as physical appearance of 11 groundwater samples collected from Luna, Umraya, Dudhwada and Pilodra villages of Padra taluka and Jambusar has shown significant contamination due to mismanagement of industrial effluent. “The groundwater is being used for agriculture and livestock feed and hence besides ill environmental impacts, toxic pollutants entering into human food chain is a serious issue of concern,” the report stated. The report states that CPCB’s monitoring between 2015 and 2019 had consistently found that VECL did not comply with the prescribed discharge standards at J-Point, the final discharge point in the estuarine zone of Mahi river. “The effluent having concentration of parameters much higher than the prescribed standards is being discharged by VECL in the estuarine zone of Mahi river,” the report further states. Environment activist Rohit Prajapati said that the report implies that GPCB continuously ignored violation of environment norms by VECL. “It had issued a so-called non-serious closure notice last year and which was not implemented leading to such a grave situation where you find chemical oxygen demand (COD) as high as 1,482 mg/l in Dudhwada village which is highest in the country,” Prajapati said. “At the same time, pollution of Mahi river stands fully exposed. Around 60 % of Vadodara depends on Mahi river’s water. Groundwater contamination had started with Luna and now has reached Dudhwada. Days are not far when borewells in Vadodara city will start seeing the impact of this contamination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/barodians-consuming-veggies-laced-with-toxins/articleshow/87744894.cms||Prashant Rupera

The blast had taken place on a plot left vacant by one Suleiman Ansari (80) behind his residence at Sultanpur Mirzatoli under the Danapur police station area in western Patna at around 2pm on Sunday. One Ayaz Khan’s (64) residence is located beside Suleiman’s house. Suleiman’s wife and his two grandsons and Ayaz’s wife were injured in the blast. Police had detained Sulieman’s 2 sons and one of Ayaz for interrogation, but set them free on personal bonds. Danapur SDPO Syed Imran Masood told TOI over the phone that they were still not certain what resulted in the explosion. “Test reports of the samples collected on Tuesday are expected in two to three days. The forensic test reports would decide further course of investigation,” he said. In reply to a query, Masood said explosive forensic experts were not available on Sunday due which their counterparts had collected samples. Probability of cooking gas leakage or large amount of cracker gunpowder are among the possible reasons behind the explosion. Meanwhile, the explosion spot is being guarded round the clock by police personnel. SI Dhirendra Yadav, who responded to Danapur police station SHO’s official cellphone, said the three persons who were set free on personal bonds have been directed to remain stationed in Patna till further investigation in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/forensic-experts-revisit-danapur-explosion-site/articleshow/87744192.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures invests in tech startup Velocity||Chennai: Revenue-based financing startup Velocity.in has raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based VC firm. Velocity has established revenue-based financing as an alternative to venture capital and traditional bank debt for e-commerce businesses in India. The company has over Rs 1,200 crore of fundable revenues connected to its platform and has already processed 250+ investments across 175 companies. The round brings Velocity's total equity raise to $30.3 million as it raised around $10.3 million in seed round earlier this year. The startup aims to deploy over Rs. 1,000 crore towards 1,000+ e-commerce businesses backed by the new funds. Velocity leverages this digital data to evaluate an application across 50+ parameters and extend up to Rs. 3 Crore of financing within 5 days. Velocity does not take any collateral, personal guarantee, or equity dilution and only charges a fixed fee of 4-8% on the deployed capital. As repayments are directly linked to a company’s revenues, Velocity has a skin in the game to support the revenue growth of its portfolio companies. Co-founder Abhiroop Medhekar says that an angel investor in the company connected them to Peter Thiel and Valar Ventures earlier and the firm had then taken a small position in their seed round and had kept in touch about the progress of the company since then. "Valar Ventures is a high conviction investor and they move very fast if they believe in the opportunity. For that reason, just as we were initiating our Series A fund raise process, Valar offered to lead the whole round instead," Medheker said. While increased internet penetration and widespread use of digital payments has resulted in growth in order volume on D2C websites, out of the 75,000+ independent e-commerce businesses being built on Shopify and WooCommerce in India, less than 0.5% have raised any equity funding, as per Velocity. "If you are generating healthy revenues, you don't need to dilute your equity, especially for repeatable and low-risk spends like marketing and inventory. Revenue based financing offers a much faster, flexible and dilution free alternative to keep growing your business," Medheker notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/peter-thiels-valar-ventures-invests-in-tech-startup-velocity/articleshow/87745073.cms||---
---||Business||RBI fund sets up 2.5L PoS terminals||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that nearly 2.5 lakh card point-of-sale terminals and over 55 lakh QR code-acceptance points have been deployed using money from a Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF). The PIDF was operationalised in January this year to subsidise deployment of card-swipe machines and QR codes among small merchants and in remote areas. The need for this was felt after debit card issuances crossed 90 crore, but merchant acceptance did not pick up. Traditionally, banks have been eager to issue debit cards as they got a fee on every transaction. Also, encouraging debit transactions meant that money remained longer in the bank as customers did not have to withdraw their weekly or monthly cash requirement. But the number of card-swipe machines were low as the revenue did not justify the capital expenditure. The RBI therefore created the PIDF with contributions from the central bank, card-issuing banks and payment networks. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the RBI said that Rs 613 crore was collected in the fund of which Rs 210 crore came from card-issuing banks, Rs 153 crore from card networks and Rs 250 crore from the RBI. Close to 40% of the machines were deployed at tier-3 and -4 centres, while another 35% was in tier-5 and -6 centres, 7% was in the northeastern states and 18% with small merchants in larger cities under the PM SVANidhi scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-fund-sets-up-2-5l-pos-terminals/articleshow/87745400.cms||---

---||Business||Bikebazaar plans fund-raise to expand used two-wheeler sales & service||Mumbai: Bikebazaar, the brand used by the company WheelsEMI for its online two-wheeler financing and trading business, is set to close a series-C funding round soon. The company, which claims to have cracked the two-wheeler financing market, is positioning itself as supporting the two-wheeler lifecycle by financing both new and old vehicles and also facilitating their sale, purchase and servicing. WheelsEMI , which is founded by three veterans from the two-wheeler industry, currently has the financing business as its mainstay with Bikebazaar the portal as its subsidiary. Last year the company disbursed loans over Rs 326 crore and has assets under management of over Rs 400 crore. Besides lending on its book, the company has co-lending arrangements with Yes Bank and electric two-wheeler manufacturer Greaves. The company was founded by K Srinivas, former president of Bajaj Auto, V Karunakaran also from Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance and Ratheesh Bharatan who was also with Bajaj Finance earlier. It has already raised capital from Elevar Equity and Faering Capital who have invested Rs 230 crore. Karunakaran told TOI that the company has an asset-light model and operates out of 12-14 branches across the company. Besides this, it has a large presence through a representative in a dealer’s offices. The company has built the capability to extend loans to anyone with the ability and willingness to pay within a 50-80 km radius of their representative. “We are in the final stages of a fund-raise, we have a verbal offer from one investor and expect to get a term sheet and close it in the next two weeks,” said Karunakaran. He said that the funds would help to bring down the cost of funds in two ways. First by making available funds for lending and second by improving the company’s credit rating above the current BBB level. An ‘A’ rating would sharply bring down the cost of funds for the company. The pandemic had put pressure on margins as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) doubled to nearly 6%. However, with the second wave receding the gross NPA numbers are also on a decline. However, unlike other lenders, WheelsEMI has been highly successful in recovering through the repossession of vehicles. “We refurbish these vehicles and sell them through the Bikebazaar portal. Our average loss for the vehicle was around Rs 10,000, which has come down to Rs 4,000 because we can sell the vehicle ourselves instead of dealers,” said Karunakaran. Given the integration between the verticals, the company expects to have a gross merchandise value of Rs 3,000 crore worth of vehicles by FY25. The used two-wheeler sales are also expected to feed into the third vertical of Bikebazaar service. According to Karunakaran, for customers, the USP of the portal would be the three Ts – transparency, trust and timeliness. Transparency would be ensured by adopting scientific methods for assessing engine conditions including an analysis of the sound and emission. The company would also ask for fewer documents and take a quick credit decision. The fourth vertical for the company is electric two-wheelers. “We strongly believe that electric two-wheelers are going to be the future. We want to get into the leasing of swappable batteries, which can cost up to 40% of vehicle cost,” said Karunakaran. He added that the company already had a partnership with Hero Electric, Okinawa and Ampere, which is owned by Greaves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bikebazaar-plans-fund-raise-to-expand-used-two-wheeler-sales-service/articleshow/87745500.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Amid market frenzy, Sebi looks to tighten IPO rules||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi has proposed to tighten the rules for initial public offerings (IPOs), which are currently witnessing hectic activities. Sebi, in a discussion paper, has suggested that at least half of the number of shares allotted to anchor investors should have a lock-in of 90 days or more, up from 30 days. The regulator has proposed that a company aiming to tap public money should be more specific about the fund-raise, rather than just stating ‘for future acquisitions’ as one of the objectives. In effect, the regulator seeks to cap the amount of money that companies could raise through IPOs for funding inorganic growth. However, going by precedents, any change in rules may not be effective within three-four months. The objective of the consultation paper is to seek comments from the public on certain aspects of Sebi’s Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) regulations relating to IPOs, Sebi said in the paper. Specifically, the proposed changes to the rules are relating to the objects of an IPO where the aim of the fund-raising is to make future acquisitions/strategic investments without identifying specific targets, conditions for offer for sale (OFS) by significant shareholders, lock-in of shares allotted to anchor investors and monitoring of funds raised for general corporate purposes. In the paper, Sebi said that a combined limit of up to 35% of the money raised by a company through an IPO could be deployed towards inorganic growth initiatives and general corporate purpose (GCP), where the target for the acquisition or the strategic investment is unidentified. This limit will not apply in case the target for acquisition or strategic investment is already identified and disclosed in the offer document. The proposed rule change may make it tough for startups and new age technology companies to raise funds. “It is seen that lately in some of the draft offer documents that new age technology companies are proposing to raise fresh funds for objects being termed as ‘funding of inorganic growth initiatives’,” Sebi said in the discussion paper. The regulator also proposes that companies should make detailed, quarterly disclosures about usage of funds raised for GCP. At present, companies could set aside up to 25% of the funds raised for GCP but are not monitored as strictly, Sebi said. The regulator seeks that, in IPOs of companies where there are no identifiable promoters, divestment of stake by all types of shareholders holding more than 20% could be capped at 50% of their pre-issue holding. In addition, their shareholding should be locked in for six months after the IPO, it said. Sebi is also looking at some lock-in for significant shareholders in companies without identifiable promoters. Currently, when promoter-driven companies go for an IPO, the shares held by promoters are locked in for 18 months. “It is meant principally to ensure skin in the game for the promoters to inspire confidence while approaching the public shareholder to raise fresh capital,” Sebi said. “There may therefore be a need to bring some parity to inspire confidence amongst the investors by existing shareholders, who are having significant shareholding. This may be specially required for loss-making companies coming up with IPO,” the paper noted. Sebi has sought public comments on these proposals till November 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amid-market-frenzy-sebi-looks-to-tighten-ipo-rules/articleshow/87745388.cms||---

A recent McKinsey report talks about mixed emotions amidst employees as they prepare to get back to different degrees of offsite-onsite work patterns. While 19% of those surveyed felt that a return to office will have a positive impact on their mental health, 49% felt that it could have a significant negative impact. Devastating as it has been, the pandemic has had a silver lining too. Emotional well-being at work has been finally given its rightful place, and organisations and individuals have stepped up to look for the sweet spot of connections that lend motivation to work. And that brings us to the one aspect that weaves the threads of purpose, belonging, collaboration, excitement and emotional stability into the fabric of happiness at work — kindness. The question is, how can we integrate kindness into an organisational culture to bridge and merge business performance with people happiness? A meaningful antidote to uncertainty In the Indian context, it is estimated that the second pandemic wave caused a loss of at least 7.4 million jobs. Besides the bleakness for those who are unemployed, it also places stress and uncertainty for the rest of the workforce, who have held the fort with extra tasks and responsibilities — not knowing when the situation will ease, and whether they will retain their employment. It is here that kindness as an organisational culture becomes critical. A research study by the Association of Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (APEX) showed definite links between a respectful & kind environment and solid business outcomes. Employees were found to be 26% more energetic, 30% more motivated to upskill & reskill themselves, and more open to new possibilities. In fact, they expressed 36% more satisfaction and 44% more commitment. These are exactly the emotions that will effectively neutralise the trail of uncertainty that the pandemic has left behind, as companies strive to deal with a disrupted normal. When broken down into points of action and acts, kindness can foster strong social connections, and create huge positivity across the entire organisation. In an unfolding scenario of remote work, kindness can increase camaraderie among employees, and make them feel that they are in control of what they do. In short, it creates a positive mindset and an environment where people are highly engaged to deliver outcomes of productivity, creativity and collaborative problem-solving. Creating an organisational culture of kindness The spirit of kindness starts with leaders — in fact, it is a leadership skill that cascades down the workforce to define the organisational culture. As Simon Sinek so beautifully puts it, “Leadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.” Leaders need to hone their emotional intelligence and self-awareness to create positive compassion in their interactions. Barring direct reports, leadership moments with the rest of employees are short, and it calls for authenticity to make them meaningful. It can be a simple but genuine “How are you?”, or taking time and effort to give an employee valuable feedback and advice. It can also be about complimenting people on the quality of their recent work, or remembering to enquire about a family member. The impact of such kindness is amazingly huge. Similarly, meetings and team huddles — be they in person or virtual — are excellent platforms and spread kindness. They occur regularly and offer relevant opportunities to connect with empathy and positive affirmation. Randstad India’s report ‘The Future of Work’ has revealed that virtual work is the preferred mode for consulting firms, technical service providers and digital media. Even for companies with static work requirements (such as banking, hospitality, healthcare, infrastructure and manufacturing), while 100% virtual working cannot be a reality, it will hover in the range of 30-50%. In such a redefined normal of hybrid work structures, HR and leadership teams must bring in measures to: * Integrate kindness intentionally into the workplace culture * Create a safe workplace that empower employees to be themselves at work with confidence, and without the fear of criticism * Enable the organisation to share information and create constructive dialogue with respect * Create opportunities for kindness through effective engagement policies and dedicated kindness calendars * Provide managers the resources and tools to support and celebrate a ‘kindness culture’ Creating a culture of kindness is an investment that can bring tremendous meaning in our professional lives. Its cascading effect is immense, as it encourages the payback of kindness to create outcomes of productivity, efficiency, collaboration and innovation — which are just the right ingredients for happiness at work.

Their teachers will, however, be trained first. Sanjay Kumar, the additional chief secretary of the education department, told this reporter, “Although English teaching starts from Class I in schools, many children fail to have a clear understanding of the language. This special programme will make them self-confident.” With a view to achieving this target, a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the State Council of Educational Research and Training and Leap for Word, a Mumbai-based organisation. Now, the teachers of elementary schools in the state will undergo a virtual training programme on YouTube or WhatsApp and help children improve their knowledge of English.  The other agencies involved in the programme will provide technical assistance to the schools. According to the agreement, the specially-designed English literacy programme will make government schoolteachers learn simple techniques that they will use to develop reading, writing, sentence construction and comprehension skills among children. The trained teachers will also be given certificates in the end. “The training programme, which starts next month, will be implemented in phases in three years,” said an education department official. The English literacy programme has already been successfully implemented in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-to-launch-english-literacy-programme-in-schools/articleshow/87744017.cms||B K Mishra

Chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, said that a decision will only be taken by the weekend, after discussing the taskforce recommendation with PTAs and other stakeholders. He said that a final decision by the government is yet to be taken and that the taskforce’s recommendation is not binding on the state government. Sawant said that the safety of children in high enrolment schools is a major area of concern for him. He said that he has asked director of education Bhushan Savaikar to submit a plan to him, outlining how social distancing will be implemented in schools with over 500 enrolment. “There are schools with almost 1,000 students and I am very much concerned about that. Taskforce has said there should be staggered timings, no assemblies, etc. But children are not vaccinated yet, which is my concern,” the chief minister said. Nearly two lakh children are enrolled from Classes I to VIII in schools across the state. Sawant said that after consultation with PTAs and other stakeholders, if the government feels it right, it may take a decision contrary to that of the taskforce. “Just because the taskforce has recommended it, does not mean the government should implement it. As chief minister and education minister, I can take a decision. The main problem is complexes like Cujira. There are schools with more than 500 students,” he said. Sawant said 15% of the eligible population has also not taken their second dose of the vaccine and many of them may have children in their families. He said that this was also an area of concern for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taskforce-for-reopening-schools-from-mon-cm-says-final-call-soon/articleshow/87746351.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna’s air quality turns ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate with fall in temperature||PATNA: The city air quality turned ‘poor’ on Tuesday and is likely to deteriorate further with the fall in temperature and calm wind. The air quality index (AQI) in Patna at 4pm was 242, considered ‘poor’ as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin. The environmentalists assert that the air pollution, mainly PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5microns) and PM10 (particulate matter less than 10microns), increases during this period of the year with fall in temperature and wind speed and rise in anthropogenic activities. Track the pollution level in your cityThe Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has predicted further rise in pollutants in the air due to climatic reasons. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials stated that the overall AQI of 242 for Patna was the average of AQI level at BIT-Mesra, Patna (318), Eco Park (303), SK Memorial Hall (286), DRM office-Khagaul (164) and Patna City (142). An AQI is considered good if it is between zero and 50, ‘poor’ between 201 and 300, ‘very poor’ between 301 and 400 and ‘severe’ in case of being in 401-500 range. A ‘poor’ AQI essentially means that people may suffer from breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure to such air. BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said wind velocity and its direction, weather conditions, anthropogenic activities and local conditions of adjoining areas (vehicular movement, construction work) decide the pollution level of the particular air monitoring station area. “That’s why the AQI level of some areas are more than the others. Besides, the temperature has started falling by 2-3 degrees Celsius with the onset of winter,” he told this newspaper. “Due to weather transition, there is formation of thermal inversion (soil is cooler than the air) in the atmosphere, which has lowered the vertical wind movement causing very low dispersion of pollutants, especially particulate matters,” he added. Several studies have found that states across the Indo-Gangetic plain, including Bihar, endure maximum exposure to particulate matters, because of its geographical area. To curb the pollutants in the air, the pollution board has decided to take measures to control different sources of the pollution, including open construction work and movement of open construction materials, conversion of brick kiln into zigzag setting and biomedical waste management. Ghosh said the BSPCB will send letters to all the district magistrates to ensure that screens are used in construction activities and materials be covered during transportation. “During winter, the construction activities increase but no one use the screens which lead to rise in PM2.5 level. We will impose environmental compensation (EC) on those who violate the norms. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given the rights to the boards to impose EC on violation of the norms. So, we will strictly implement this,” he said. “As far as the brick kilns are concerned, almost 5,000 of them have been converted into green technology. No other state has achieved this feat. The remaining kilns will be converted soon. We are also promoting fly ash and the state government has also announced that all the government buildings will be built by using it. Fly ash, the remains of coal, is the problem for thermal power. So it has decided that these ashes will be sued to make bricks for use in building construction,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-turns-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-with-fall-in-temperature/articleshow/87743932.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||No GST on top-up cover cost employees pay: AAR||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra bench of the GST Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has held that recovery of an amount towards top-up of medical insurance and parental insurance premium from employees is not a supply and hence not subject to goods and services tax (GST). The AAR held that Tata Power, which had sought this ruling, is not rendering any service of health insurance to its employees or their parents and there is no supply of insurance services. Hence, the issue of levy of GST does not arise. However, it should be noted that the company had not availed of input tax credit for the GST charged by the insurance company. In this case, the AAR bench relied on a similar ruling given in 2018 in the case of Posco India Pune Processing Center. Lately, several AAR benches have adopted a similar stand that GST cannot be levied in cases of recovery of sums from employees for a wide range of services, such as a nominal amount recovered for canteen services or even parking. As reported by TOI earlier, the Gujarat bench of the AAR had held in the case of Tata Motors that GST would not be levied on the nominal amount recovered from employees for canteen facilities, which is passed on by the company to the third-party caterer. However, it had also added that input tax credit would be blocked. According to indirect tax specialist Sunil Gabhawalla, “The correct view is that there should be no recovery on nominal sums received from employees as there is no taxable supply. If this line of argument does not hold good, it can be argued that the company is acting as a pure agent and the value of ‘services’ should be taken as nil.” To illustrate, in the case of Ion Trading, a Noida-based subsidiary of a UK company, the UP bench of the Appellate Authority for Advance Rulings had held that the parking charges collected from employees and passed on to the building authorities was a service. However, it went on to add that the company qualified as a pure agent. Thus, there would be no GST levy on sums collected from employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-gst-on-top-up-cover-cost-employees-pay-aar/articleshow/87745404.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Business||Identify cos that are not viable: RBI governor to banks||MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday asked lenders to proactively identify loans to firms that have turned non-viable but not yet recognised as a non-performing asset (NPA) due to the special dispensation during Covid. The governor also asked banks to review the usability of capital for absorbing losses during a crisis. Pointing out that numerous high-frequency indicators are showing that economic recovery is taking hold, Das said that there have been several resolution frameworks announced in the wake of the pandemic. “As the support measures start unwinding, some of these restructured accounts might face solvency issues over the coming quarters. Prudence would warrant proactive recognition of such non-viable firms for pragmatic resolution measures,” said Das. Speaking at an economic conclave organised by the State Bank of India, Das noted that banks have weathered the Covid shock better than expected and, according to early trends, their bad loans and capital position has improved in September 2021 from their levels in June 2021. He said that the profitability metrics of banks were highest in several years. However, the improved parameters partly reflect regulatory relief provided to banks during Covid as well as fiscal guarantees and financial support given by the government, he said. “Certain concerns have re-emerged from the crisis which warrant our attention. Most importantly, we are faced with the question of capital and provisioning buffers of banks, their adequacy and resultant usability during a crisis,” said Das. He urged banks to focus and further improve their capital management processes to envisage the capacity for loss absorption as an ongoing responsibility of the lending institutions. In his speech, the governor also cautioned banks on the “technological invasion” that they face. “A word of caution is in order: Globally, the ‘phygital’ revolution has played out into several collaborative models between banks, NBFCs and fintech players such as incubation, capital investment, co-creation, distribution and integration… it must be recognised that the risks ultimately lie in the books of banks and NBFCs and hence the collaboration should be appropriately strategised,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-guv-to-banks-identify-cos-that-are-not-viable/articleshow/87745435.cms||---

These include IndiGo’s flights from Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad to Patna. According to sources, the Delhi-Patna flight arrived at the city airport at 12.50am on Tuesday night and left at 1.30am while the Bengaluru-Patna flight landed at the airport at 1.35am and left at 2.05am. The Hyderabad-Patna flight, on the other hand, reached the city at 1am and left at 1.40am. The Airports Authority of India had recently conducted a preliminary meeting to discuss the arrangements to be made at the Patna airport for tackling the problem of delay in flights due to foggy weather during the winter season. The airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), Santosh Kumar, told this reporter on Tuesday that a final meeting would be held with all the stakeholders in the next few days where issues like fog formation, safety measures, flight diversion and delays would be discussed. “The airport will take all the precautionary measures to ensure that passengers do not face any inconvenience during the winter season. Now that the terminal building has been renovated and expanded, we have a lot of space to accommodate more flyers,” Santosh said, adding that extra chairs would be placed in the security hold area if required. Meanwhile, depending on the climatic conditions, different airlines have also decided to reduce the number of flights operating in the morning and the evening hours. An employee of GoAir said, “At present, we are operating nine flights between 7am to 10pm. However, their timings have been changed under the winter schedule as the city is likely to experience foggy conditions in the next few days.” The Patna airport handles 50-56 flights every day, including 26 of IndiGo, 13 of SpiceJet, nine of GoAir, seven of Air India and two of Vistara. Its daily passenger footfall has also reached 14,000-15,000. As many as 14,249 flyers arrived at and left the airport on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-airport-no-late-night-flight-operations-from-today/articleshow/87743958.cms||Faryal Rumi

She said many of the private hospitals don’t share information on dengue. “Apart from sharing the information with the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), fogging in the identified localities is also being done by the health department,” she said. A total of 249 dengue cases have reported to the CS office till Monday evening. Three patients were undergoing treatment in the paediatrics ward at AIIMS-Patna and five in the department of medicine at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH). PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said rosterwise fogging in all localities was being done regularly. However, the localities identified by the health department as hotspots were taken for intensive fogging. “The PMC has 75 hand-held machines and 40 vehicles for fogging by using malathion as effective insecticide. Sanitiser machines are also being used with larvicide for destroying the breeding sites of mosquitoes which carry the dengue virus,” he said. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said some patients with symptoms of dengue also visit the medicine OPD, but they don’t meed hospitalisation and are sent back home.  “Dengue is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and the best protection from it is to keep the areas around you clean and dry. Its symptoms also vary from headache and fever to bleeding from nose or with urine. Timely medication is necessary for early recovery,” said Dr Satish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/249-dengue-cases-reported-in-patna-surrounding-areas/articleshow/87743978.cms||VK Tripathi

Besides extending a helping hand to the farmers through the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) across the state, he said the government was also coming to their rescue at the time of distress, including disasters. He said the government had paid a compensation of Rs 645.99 crore to 8.34 lakh farmers who lost their crops due to Cyclone Nivar in November 2020. The compensation was paid in December 2020, he added. With the latest Rs 22 crore, the government has in total paid Rs 1,071 crore to the farmers during the last two years towards compensation, he said.

The SIPB, which met at the chief minister’s camp office in Tadepalli on Tuesday, cleared the proposals, which will provide indirect employment to 7,683 persons. An Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd unit would come up at Pulivendula in Kadapa district at a cost of Rs 110 crore. This will provide direct employment to 2,112 persons for the manufacture of jackets and trousers. Century Ply would establish a plywood unit at Badvel in Kadapa district at a cost of Rs 956 crore, providing direct employment to 2,266 persons. The unit would also encourage farmers to grow eucalyptus on 22,500 acres. The unit is also expected to buy Rs 315 crore worth eucalyptus trees from the farmers for the unit. AIL Dixon Technologies Limited has also come forward to invest Rs 127 crore to establish a camera manufacturing unit in Kopparthy industrial cluster in Kadapa district. This unit would provide direct employment to 1,800 persons, the SIPB said. AIL Dixon Technologies would also establish a laptops and tablet manufacturing unit with an investment of Rs 80 crore. The unit would provide direct employment to 1,100 persons, the SIPB said. The SIPB also cleared the proposal to establish a unit to manufacture industrial chemicals by Grasim Industries. The firm would invest Rs 861 crore and provide direct employment to 400 persons. The SIPB, however, has not cleared Grasim’s proposal to establish a thermal power plant due to local opposition. While addressing the meeting, the chief minister told the officials to be cautious while allocating land for the industries. He also told them to consider land allocation for the existing industries wherever land is available. He directed officials to provide basic infrastructure in the area before giving permission to any industry. He also asked them to ensure that environmental precautions are strictly followed.

Palavalasa Vikranth, Devasani Chinna Govinda Reddy and Ishaq Basha filed nominations before the returning officer for the three MLC posts to be elected by MLAs. Deputy chief minister Dharmana Krishna Das, ministers Botcha Satyanarayana, Seediri Appala Raju, government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy and party leaders were present. Earlier in the day, all three candidates met chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at his Tadepalli camp office and received the party B Form from him to contest the MLC election. They thanked the chief minister for nominating them to the Upper House. The three posts fell vacant on May 31 this year with the retirement of MA Shariff from the TDP, Somu Veerraju from the BJP and D C Govinda Reddy from the YSR Congress. The ruling YSR Congress had nominated Govinda Reddy for another term, while the TDP and the BJP have lost the chance even to field their candidates as they have no required strength in the assembly. There were no other nominations for the three posts except those filed by the YSR Congress nominees. It is likely that the three candidates would be declared elected unanimous. Meanwhile, the YSR Congress is also set to win all 11 vacancies in the legislative council representing the local bodies. The ruling party had already named its candidates and it is likely that they would also be elected unopposed as the TDP or the BJP have no strength to field their candidates.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, new road work bids 20% below cost estimate||MUMBAI: The BMC, which had re-tendered road work contracts last month, has once again received bids that are below estimates. Municipal officials said that unlike the previous Rs 1,200 crore road work tenders, where contractors quoted up to 30% lower than the estimated cost, this time the bids are around 15%-20% below estimates. A municipal official said that by the month-end, the proposals will be brought before the civic standing committee for approval. TimesViewThe modus operandi of road contractors quoting rates below the official estimate has been happening in the BMC for over two decades. If a contractor is willing to do a job worth, say, Rs 100 for Rs 85, it hints at cutting corners. That is why freshly laid roads develop potholes with the first rain shower. The administration must break the cartel formed by some contractors.“Previously, when some of the bids were 30% below estimates, it was very obvious that no quality work could have been done. We have worked out the current estimates and found that satisfactory work could be done at the current rates quoted,” said a BMC official. This time when the BMC re-tendered the road works of Rs 1,200 crore along with it, it also tendered for another Rs 800-900 crore of road repair works, including those in Mhada layouts. This, therefore, has taken the total cost of repairs to about Rs 2,000 crore. Of the total 2,000km of road network in the city, as much as 275km is proposed to be repaired. Some of the repair works are likely to start by the end of December if the standing committee gives its approval in time. Corporators said that the entire process of re-tendering has only wasted time as bidders have again quoted below actual costs. “This has caused an unnecessary delay as we have already lost two months of ‘fair’ season work time. The taxpayers who pay for getting good quality of roads are being deprived of it owing to these administrative hassles,” said Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator. The opposition alleged that this has been a tactic to delay actual works as BMC did not have the funds to pay for these works in this financial year. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said funds meant for important works like road repairs were diverted to grand projects like cycle tracks or upkeep of penguin enclosures at the zoo. “Even if contractors have quoted below estimates, it is essential that the BMC seizes their security deposits if they find that the work being executed is not at par with what they have proposed. Besides, civic engineers should also ensure that regular supervision is undertaken to keep a check on quality,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-new-road-work-bids-20-below-cost-estimate/articleshow/87746998.cms||Richa Pinto

Vice-chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy interacted with the new faculty members on Tuesday. “The university has long-term vision and goals. The new faculty members should work towards achieving the objectives of the university. I thank chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and special chief secretary (higher education) Satish Chandra for deputing the faculty members from aided colleges to the university,” said Prof Reddy. He asked them to be part of curriculum designing, syllabus preparation and introduction of new-age courses. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Federation of University (Contract) Teachers Association took exception to allowing aided college faculty members to join Andhra University as assistant professors. “This is a gross violation of status quo orders given by high court of Andhra Pradesh. This also goes against the AP University Act 1991,” said Dr K Arjunudu, president of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/aided-colleges-faculty-join-au-as-asst-profs/articleshow/87744415.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Govt in Catch-22 situation over clouded GST, VAT issues||GANDHINAGAR: Even as the ruling BJP government is gearing up to face a crucial assembly election next year, it finds itself in a Catch-22 situation. Even as the government has begun making preparations for the 2022-23 budget, there is looming uncertainty over continuance of GST compensation from July 2022 and ending of Value Added Tax on petroleum products by bringing these under the GST regime. Key sources close to the development said, “The state finance department has started planning for 2022-23 budget presuming that the five-year term of GST compensation will end on June 30, 2022 and that petroleum products will be included within GST from the next budget.” “At present, we get around Rs 20,000 crore as GST compensation per annum against loss of revenue due to adoption of GST regime and have around Rs 25,000 crore per annum income from VAT on petroleum products. If we do not get these two resources in 2022-23 budget, we may have to cut our budget size drastically,” sources informed. Explaining the predicament of the state government, sources said, “The state government has limited scope to mop up income to match loss of resources coming from GST compensation and VAT on petroleum products. It is likely that GST on petroleum products may not even be half of the actual income of VAT on petroleum products.” Sources added that the government cannot cut budgets allocated to ongoing schemes or resist announcing new schemes as next year will be a crucial poll year. “For the moment, it is a tight situation for the state government and we hope the Centre will address this concern,” said sources. Kanubhai Desai, finance minister, when asked about the planning for alternate financial resources in case the Centre stops giving compensation against loss of income from July 1, 2022 and if the Centre brings petroleum products under GST regime, said, “These are national level issues. All states are facing the same situation like us. Centre has always cared for Gujarat’s interest and we are sure it will do what is best for the state.” Desai avoided any specific comment on whether the Centre will be requested to extend GST compensation deadline beyond June 30, 2022 and not include petroleum products under the GST regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-in-catch-22-situation-over-clouded-gst-vat-issues/articleshow/87745620.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Visakhapatnam||Will the police’s new project usher in ‘Parivartan’ in Visakhapatnam's Agency, AOB?||VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam, Agency areas in East Godavari and the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) have emerged as the single largest region in the country in ganja cultivation. Though enforcement agencies are chalking out plans to root out the crop, the task is proving to be a daunting one that requires efficient coordination and educating ganja cultivators, who are mainly tribal farmers in remote regions. An interstate coordination meeting on strategies to combat narcotics trafficking saw the southern states come together to tackle the problem. DGP Gautam Sawang has said Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka will work with Andhra Pradesh and Odisha to combat narcotics trafficking, with a special focus on cannabis cultivation and smuggling in Vizag Agency and the AOB. In fact, ganja cultivation has grown in Visakhapatnam and along the AOB. The area under the crop is estimated to be over 10,000 acres and is spread across 200 to 250 villages in the region. Seventy-five per cent of the area under cultivation lies in the AOB while the rest is distributed between the Agency in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari. The banned CPI(Maoist) holds sway in some of the areas. “We have launched Operation Parivartan, under which we destroy the ganja crop, create awareness on the consequences of the illegal trade and provisions under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, besides educating ganja growers on alternative crops,” said deputy inspector general (Visakha range) LKV Ranga Rao. “We are hoping the Odisha government will also destroy the ganja crop on their side of the AOB,” he added. “Destroying ganja crops in AOB areas by deploying workers and armed forces is not an easy task because of the presence of Maoists. Moreover, it’s not easy to enter the AOB without coordinating with the Odisha government,” said a senior police officer, who pointed out that, “the smuggling network has been developed over the years by middlemen from various states and the system now works like a well-oiled machine that includes ganja growers, carriers and other persons.” “The government must understand why tribals take to ganja cultivation. We observed that ‘poddu’ cultivation and growing of paddy is not possible in many areas in the Vizag Agency and AOB and so some tribals have taken up ganja cultivation for a livelihood. Some educated tribal youth are also attracted to ganja cultivation for money to continue their studies. We are appealing to the government to come up with a sustainable action plan that will provide alternate livelihoods and employment in the hilly areas,” said the convener of the Joint Action Committee of Adivasi Organisations, Ramarao Dora. “Though enforcement agencies are destroying ganja crops in some areas, it is a temporary solution as the growers will plant them again and it is not that easy to destroy the crops in the remote areas of AOB,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/will-the-polices-new-project-usher-in-parivartan-in-agency-aob/articleshow/87744459.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Charges over ganja trade fly thick and fast||VISAKHAPATNAM: The high extent of ganja cultivation in the Maoist-affected areas of the Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) has seen the police and Maoists locked in a blame game. While cops accuse the rebels of ‘encouraging’ the illegal trade as a source of funds, the Maoists have denied links to ganja cultivation and smuggling and claimed that enforcement agencies are collecting bribes from smugglers. DGP Gautam Sawang has said that most of the ganja is cultivated along the AOB and in areas that have a CPI(Maoist) presence. However, the state’s handling of left wing extremism would pay dividends in the coming days, he added. The ganja trade is one that involves multiple players, starting from cultivators, financiers, seed and fertilizer providers, local transporters, local traders and ending with interstate smugglers. Business depends on a chain system for transporting the weed from remote areas to metros and other cities across the country. Dismissing the allegations of the police, Maoists alleged the ‘men in khaki’ of being hand-in-glove with the ganja mafia and collecting monthly kickbacks from smugglers. Adding that tribals are made victims, they alleged that ganja is a source of income for traders, middlemen and enforcement officials. Recently, a police constable, GA Naidu, attached to Koyyuru police station, was arrested for his involvement in the ganja trade in Visakhapatnam district. In 2015, an inspector of prohibition and excise in Narsipatnam, M Jaganmohan Rao, was suspended for pilferage of ganja worth over Rs 6 crore that had been seized from smugglers. Jaganmohan Rao had sold the ganja back to smugglers. “the ultimate victims in the ganja business are innocent tribal people. Many of them are now behind bars. The government has to understand the various aspects of the ganja menace to come to a suitable solution,” said convener of Joint Action Committee of Adivasi Organisations, Ramarao Dora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/charges-over-ganja-trade-fly-thick-and-fast/articleshow/87744478.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Boipara happy to see regulars back||KOLKATA: The reopening of educational institutes has given a new lease of life to Boipara on College Street and several iconic hangouts that are frequented by students. On Tuesday — the day when schools and colleges reopened after a gap of 20 months — several book vendors and traders experienced a rise in footfall, all of which did not convert to sales. However, traders hope that the return of regulars to Boipara will boost the sales of books. There are close 15 colleges and universities, nine schools and several coaching centres within 1km radius of College Street. The closure of educational institutes in March 2020 due to the pandemic had affected the business at Boipara. “Since afternoon many students came to Boipara, either to purchase or enquire about books. Sales went up by almost 15% on Tuesday, which may not be very high but indicates that once all the institutes start functioning fully, our business will return to the pre-pandemic level,” said Suranjan Ghosh, a book vendor at College Street. The pandemic-induced lockdown as well as two cyclones in two years damaged the business and the stock of booksellers at College Street. Even the big traders were affected too. Students of different colleges and universities started crowdfunding to help out the vendors. “The livelihoods of several lakhs of people are associated with the book trade. As the students had been attending classes online during the pandemic, the demand for reference books had dipped, which in turn hit our business. We anticipate that from now, the sales of books will improve. We request the regulars to buy books from small vendors as this will help them financially,” said Pratap Das, secretary of Sir Ashutosh Booksellers’ Association. The iconic Coffee House too reported an increase in footfall on Tuesday. “After the pandemic started, this place would remain half empty in the first half of the day because colleges and universities were shut. Usually, students and teachers come here for coffee and sandwiches in between classes. On Tuesday, we saw a few groups coming in. Business will get better when the campuses reopen fully,” said Tapan Kumar Pahari, secretary of Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society Limited that runs the Coffee House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/boipara-happy-to-see-regulars-back/articleshow/87745151.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kochi||Kerala: Cops question hotel owner over Vyttila car accident||KOCHI: Police probing the Chakkaraparambu accident – in which three persons, including two models were killed–took the statements of the owner of the hotel, where the victims had attended a party on the night of the accident. Roy J Vayalat, owner of No 18 hotel, Fort Kochi, appeared before the investigating officer at the office of assistant commissioner on Tuesday after a summons was issued to him on Monday. Vayalat also produced a digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV cameras installed inside the party hall and parking area. The DVR was missing when police had carried out an inspection at the hotel. Though police said that nothing suspicious was found, sources said that some of the video footage is missing. Moreover, it was earlier found that two DVRs were missing from the hotel but Vayalat produced only one before the police. He was asked to submit the second one too. Sources said that Vayalat stuck to his earlier statements that all the four passengers of the car, including the driver Abdul Rahman, had consumed liquor at the party and he had advised them against driving in an inebriated condition. He also said that out of concerns for their safety, he had sent his friend Shaiju to follow the car. The police have already identified that Shaiju, who drove an Audi car, was seen driving close to the ill-fated car and that he had attended the same party at the hotel in Fort Kochi. Vayalat told the police that he moved the DVR from the hotel fearing action by excise department for serving liquor beyond permitted time. “He said that excise department has been probing reports of liquor being served at the hotel late into night. After the accident, he feared that if the CCTV visuals of the bar and party area, which shows late-night liquor serving, was found, it would lead to the cancellation of the hotel’s bar licence,” said a police source. The investigation team, which checked the DVR in Vayalat’s presence, said the statements given by the latter need to be verified and the missing DVR needs to be submitted for inspection. “He was allowed to go after interrogation. We have not booked him and further probe is needed,” said Ernakulam ACP Y Nizamudeen. Motorcyclist to file petition Meanwhile, Dinil Davis (32), the motorcyclist who was knocked down by the car before it crashed, may file a new petition. The private company executive said the FIR missed the fact that he was knocked down by the speeding car and he raised concerns that it might affect his accident insurance claim. He has sought legal opinion to file a petition. Davis was on his way home (Kanjoor) from the firm’s head office in Perumbavoor when the car knocked him down before it rammed a tree around 12.45am. He escaped with three stitches on his leg, a few minor wounds and bruises on his chest and shoulder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-question-hotel-owner-over-vyttila-car-accident/articleshow/87745900.cms||---

The leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly said that he and the other opposition leaders have been providing “positive feedback” to the CM, but the efforts lead to nowhere. The CM, at least, should heed the words of advice given to him by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal with regard to the prohibition policy and its implementation. Tejashwi alleged that as many as 80% of police personnel, including senior district level officials, and politicians associated with the ruling JD(U), have been consuming liquor that is otherwise banned in Bihar. Tejashwi also said in the past, he and the opposition had provided evidence in this regard in terms of video clips, but the government did not take any action. “Why the lower constabulary suffer the brunt of punishment by way of suspension and then they are also put on duty again after the revocation of their suspension order. No middle-rung police officer has been suspended or dismissed,” Tejashwi said, adding that if a few mafia elements were arrested and jailed in the past, they also got freed later for lack of evidence in the court. Tejashwi also said he had presented evidence on the floor of the state assembly against land reforms minister Ram Surat Rai and his brother, but no action was taken in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-calls-nitishs-review-meeting-on-prohibition-a-sham/articleshow/87745088.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Patna: Honeytrapped jawan leaked sensitive details to Pakistan intelligence||PATNA: The jawan, who was honeytrapped and arrested at Khagaul in western Patna on Sunday, had leaked the highly sensitive information to a Pakistani intelligence operative (PIO) through WhatsApp, including about the fighting formation called order of battle (ORBAT) of the units under the Southern Command and deployed on the western frontier in Rajasthan and the location of all military hospitals (MHs) across India, reliable sources told TOI on Tuesday. Sources said the Army’s top brass is trying to neutralise the effect of the information leaked by jawan Ganesh Kumar to the Pakistan army as the enemy can take advantage of it in case of a war. These espionage details surfaced after the preliminary investigation and interrogation of Kumar, intelligence sources said. “Kumar leaked the information during his posting at Jodhpur Military Hospital reception from January, 2019 to September, 2020 when he got access to several documents containing information about the location where the officers or jawans had come from for admission or check-up. The PIO, who had honeytrapped Kumar while posing herself as the Indian Navy medical team staff posted at Kochi hospital, asked him how he filled the details in admission papers as some of the jawans and officers at her hospital did not mention all these. Then Kumar used to click the documents and shared them on WhatsApp with the PIO. The Pakistan intelligence used to join the dots to know about the deployment of Army units,” a source said. “Kumar was later transferred to Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, in September, 2020. The PIO then extracted information from him about the military hospitals across the country,” the source said. The action against Kumar, who served the Indian Army Medical Corps, was based on specific information from the Lucknow-based Military Intelligence (MI) unit and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). He had come under their surveillance several months ago. Kumar, a native of Asthawan village in Nalanda district, was arrested by the Bihar police anti-terrorism squad with the help of IB and MI when he was going by a train to join duty in Pune. He has confessed to sharing information related to national security with the Pakistan operative. Police and intelligence agencies also found sensitive documents from his cellphone and forwarded him to judicial custody on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/honeytrapped-jawan-leaked-sensitive-army-details-to-pakistan-intelligence/articleshow/87745101.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Total 109 cases of child abuse have been reported across the state out of which 77 are against girl child and 33 are male child between July to September 2021. The highest number of child abuse cases were reported at Mapusa police station (24), followed by Calangute police station (10) and eight at women police station. The least number of cases have been registered at Margao, Agasaim, Anjuna, Quepem and Saligao. Sexual abuse cases among teenagers were the highest in the state, followed by domestic violence, kidnapping, assault and cybercrime, according to the Victim Assistance Unit (VAU) report.  The VAU was set up in April 2014 and has successfully completed six years of providing service 24x7 to children who encounter the police and who come to the unit directly. VAU coordinator Emidio Pinho said that besides handling cases of abuse, the unit has also conducted various training as well as awareness sessions to different stakeholders. A few months ago, chief minister Pramod Sawant drawn sharp criticism on social media platforms and demands for an apology soared after he said in the House that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. He had also said, “When 14-year-olds stay on the beach the whole night, the parents need to introspect. Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police.” He was referring to the gangrape of two minor girls at Benaulim beach. Last week, Sawant had said that the state government will soon take more steps towards ensuring women’s safety and security. He said that the government is contemplating to have a pink force to tackle crime against women. While he said that he felt upset when crimes were committed against women in the state, the chief minister maintained that Goa leads other states where crime detection is concerned. “Goa has a crime detection rate of 93%. One can compare this with other states. We will take more steps towards the safety and security of women in the coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/six-cases-of-child-abuse-every-week-in-goa-from-july-to-sept/articleshow/87746316.cms||Murari Shetye

Apparently, on November 14 when the Congress launched a statewide agitation against spiraling prices of petroleum products in Mumbai, supporters of Jagtap abused and heckled Siddiqui, a charge denied by the Mumbai Congress president. It was Siddiqui’s second letter in the recent past to Gandhi against Jagtap. In his letter, Siddqui has stated that when he participated in the morcha, Jagtap made derogatory remarks against him in the presence of AICC general secretary K C Venugopal. “Stern action should be taken against Jagtap in view of his rude behaviour,” Siddiqui said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cong-hit-by-infighting-complaints-reach-sonia/articleshow/87745893.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Kolkata||Families wake up to early mornings||KOLKATA: Parents and children had to reset their alarm clocks as they struggled to go back to the old school routine — getting up early, getting ready for school, preparing lunch and then keeping the extra time in hand to travel to school — on Day 1 of reopening of schools after almost 20 months. “Even during this period of online classes, my cell phone alarm used to ring at 6.45am every day, but I had learnt the art of snoozing it without even opening my eyes. Well, that’s not possible any more as my daughter has to leave at 7.30am to attend her first class at school by 8.30am. It’s a renewed struggle but I guess within a week, we will be back to our old routine,” said Sujata Ghosh, mother of a Class-X student of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. For Paikpara resident Amrita Nandi and Janbazar homemaker Rita Das, the struggle was similar, as both had to get up more than two hours prior to the time they had been waking up till Monday. “During this period of online classes, I had adjusted to the routine of waking up around 7am, preparing breakfast and lunch for my husband while my daughter had the luxury to sleep till 10am before I used to shake her up to attend the 11am class. But on Tuesday, I woke up at 4.30am, prepared lunch for the family and my daughter’s tiffin. I woke up my daughter, then she got ready and we left home at 8am. Her classes started from 9.30am but on the first day, we tried to reach a bit early,” said Nandi, whose daughter Paromita is a Class-XI student of Bethune School. Anilava Das, a Class-XII student of Scottish Church Collegiate School, was so excited to return to school after almost a two-year gap that it kept him awake for a major part of the night. For his mother Rita, the struggle was far more real as she woke up at 5am and did all the household chores as she accompanied her son to school and even stayed back to bring him home.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Travancore Devaswom Board hints at concessions in shop auction rates||KOTTAYAM: Devotees started arriving at Sree Dharma Sastha Temple in Sabarimala as the temple gates were opened from Tuesday morning. Only those who had booked slots in the virtual queue system are being permitted to the hill shrine from the base camp at Pampa-Thriveni. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president K Ananthagopan hinted at giving some concessions in the auction rate for the shops in Sabarimala. He said that the rates cannot be reduced steeply as asked by bidders who cite Covid-19 or floods. The same can be reduced slightly; but this will affect other operations here, he added. Addressing the media later in the day, Devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan said that more pilgrims will start arriving once the weather becomes favourable. The restrictions enforced now are for the safety of all pilgrims in the wake of the pandemic. He also said that currently 13 lakh devotees have registered online for darshan. A bath in the Pamba is not allowed for the safety of devotees as the water level is high. He also said that Njunangar Bridge across the river, which was destroyed in the heavy rain, will be reconstructed. In accordance with the increase in the number of arrivals, the traditional Sabarimala road, Neelimala-Appachimedu, will be opened for the pilgrims to return to Pamba. Sufficient lights and toilet facilities will be ensured along this road, said the minister, who also inaugurated the prasad packing units at Sannidhanam. TDB started its annadanam at Sannidhanam where pilgrims can avail free food three times a day. Breakfast is from 7am-10am, lunch is served from 10.30am-3pm and dinner after 5pm. Due to Covid protocol, food is served as buffet. The Punyam Poonkavanam project launched to keep Sabarimala clean, has completed ten years. The project was launched for removing the waste accumulated at the holy shrine every morning during the pilgrim season. It was introduced by IG P Vijayan in 2011. The service of Ayyappa Seva Sangham also began at Sannidhanam. Around 200 volunteers of the outfit are there at Sannidhanam for supporting the needs of devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tdb-hints-at-concessions-in-shop-auction-rates/articleshow/87745915.cms||---

These classes, which offer free coaching to meritorious students across the state who cannot afford private tuition/coaching classes fees, would now be held in every district of the state instead of just the divisional headquarters. The scheme was launched by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on February 15, 2021. As part of the Abhyuday scheme, the UP government has set up coaching centres and offered free classes to prepare the students for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for the medical aspirants, the entrance exam for the National Defence Academy, Combined Defence Services (CDS) examination and Union Public Service Commission exams. The platform has over 500 IAS officers, over 450 IPS officers, over 300 IFS officers and several experts on various subjects who contribute by creating educational content through physical classes and virtual sessions for civil services and other competitive exams aspirants. A dedicated portal http://www.abhyuday.up.gov.in/- too has been launched for benefit ofstudents. These training classes were given online during the multiple lockdowns that the state went through. Gradually, the ‘Abhyuday’ coaching centres were set up at the divisional level in the first phase and is now being followed up at the district level in the next phase, informed officials of the state social welfare department. For paving way for the classes to begin at the district level, a missive has already been sent to all the Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates on behalf of Director of Social Welfare Department. Now preparations are on to constitute district-level committees, he added. Deputy director (social welfare), Prayagraj, Manjushree Srivastava said, “This time, the Chief Minister Abhyudaya Yojana classes are to be held in all the districts of the state”. She added, “State social welfare director’s letter has arrived in this regard. District-level committees are being constituted. This is the reason that the classes which were to start from November 15, have been stopped for the time being. As soon as the committees are constituted in all districts of the division, the classes will start simultaneously in all the 75 districts in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/mukhyamantri-abhyuday-yojana-to-benefit-students-in-every-dist/articleshow/87745916.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Top 25 Aurangabad villages in Covid vaccination to get extra funds: Collector||Aurangabad: Amid relatively lower Covid vaccination in rural areas as compared to urban pockets, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan on Tuesday said the top 25 villages in the immunization programme would get extra development funds. Appealing for cent per cent vaccination in all villages in the district, Chavan said villages achieving the target quickly would be entitled for such funding incentive. “The Covid vaccination is vital amid fears of the possible third wave of the pandemic. The rural population should shed its inhibitions and get vaccinated as early as possible,” he said, while addressing villagers from Khuldabad taluka. The district administration led by Chavan has launched an aggressive Covid vaccination campaign in the rural pockets where the vaccination percentage is still low. As part of the effort, Chavan has been visiting different villages with an appeal for speedy vaccination. As per official data, the rural areas of Aurangabad district have a target population of 21.7 lakh to be covered under Covid vaccination. Of this, 12.5 lakh beneficiaries have received at least one dose so far, which accounts for nearly 58% vaccination. The rural areas have only 4.1 lakh beneficiaries who are fully vaccinated, which account for only 19% of the total target population. To boost the vaccination programme, the Aurangabad zilla parishad has appointed a nodal officer for each of the nine talukas from the district. The officers concerned have been given a target of achieving minimum 90% vaccination by the end of December. Besides vaccine hesitancy among certain sections of the society, the heavy rainfall in Aurangabad district during the recent monsoons as well as the dearth of vaccination doses in the past have been blamed by authorities for the relatively poor vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/top-25-aurangabad-villages-in-covid-vaccination-to-get-extra-funds-collector/articleshow/87743532.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hindu man offers vacant Ggn shop space for namaz||Gurgaon: Amid opposition in some parts of the city to namaz being offered in public places, a local resident who is a Hindu has come forward to offer a small commercial space he owns in Old Gurgaon to the Muslim community for Friday prayers. Akshhay Rao, a wildlife tour organiser who owns several shops at the mechanic market, said most of his tenants are Muslims and were facing problems offering Friday prayers. He said he had made available one of his vacant shops, which can accommodate 15-20 people. “I have not done anything special. It is not the first time I have offered my place for namaz; I had done so a few years ago too,” said Rao. Rao told TOI he was born and brought up in Gurgaon and had never seen a communal dispute. “I was disturbed after reading reports about namaz being disrupted. My aim was to let our Muslim brothers know that it’s only a handful of people who are causing this. We have been living together peacefully and will continue to preserve and maintain our social harmony,” he said. District administration officials said they have not included any private land in the list of the places for Friday prayers and no one has yet formally approached them to offer their private land or space for namaz. Muslim groups welcomed Rao’s “gracious” offer but said they are yet to receive a formal proposal. At the same time, they said private spaces were unlikely to be a solution because there have been instances in the past of neighbours raising objections. Shahzad Khan of Muslim Ekta Manch said they had met a district administration official on Friday for restoring namaz in Sector 12A. “Two years ago, our mosque was sealed in Sheetla Mata Colony. We have been requesting to open it and clear encroachments from Waqf Board land to provide adequate space to offer namaz,” said Khan. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurgaon Muslim Council, said Rao’s offer was “a true example of brotherhood”. Like Khan, he also stressed the number of namaz sites, now reduced, is insufficient for the city’s Muslim community. The number of sites for offering namaz in the city has come down by nearly half. While 37 spots had been identified in 2018 after the first round of protests over the issue, 20 public places were earmarked for Friday prayers at the beginning of November by a government committee in consultation with community representatives. The sites were reduced after weeks of protests by right-wing outfits and some locals, first in Sector 47 and then at Sector 12A, against the use of public spaces for namaz.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hindu-man-offers-vacant-ggn-shop-space-for-namaz/articleshow/87745928.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC denies Indrani Mukerjea's bail ‘on merits’ in Sheena Bora murder case||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday dismissed on merits a bail application filed by Indrani Mukerjea in the Sheena Bora murder case. After hearing her counsel Sana Raees Khan at some length on Monday, Justice Nitin Sambre had asked her to take instructions and inform by Tuesday whether she desires to withdraw her bail application. Khan got back on Tuesday to say Indrani Mukerjea wishes to invite an order on merits of the case. In other words, she did not wish to withdraw her plea. Her advocate said Indrani will now move the Supreme Court agaisnt the rejection and seek bail there. Indrani Mukerjea (50), arrested by the CBI on August 25, 2015, for allegedly murdering her daughter, is lodged in the Byculla Women’s prison. It was her first bail plea on merits before the HC, said her lawyer. Justice Sambre had on Monday orally said, “on merits, am not convinced”, and on Tuesday passed the rejection order. The CBI alleged Indrani is the main accused who executed the murder of her own biological daughter following a conspiracy with her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamwar Rai, on April 24, 2012. Her body, the CBI said, was then burnt and dumped in a forest in Pen, Raigad district. Indrani’s husband Peter Mukerjea — who she divorced during the ongoing trial — was also arrested the day the chargesheet was filed. CBI prosecutor Sandesh Patil with DP Singh said her first bail plea was rejected in 2016, and four times thereafter and “there has been no change in circumstances”. Indrani denied all charges and is facing trial. She may now challenge the bail denial before the Supreme Court. Advocate Khan cited various “contradictions, omissions and inconsistencies” and said “no last seen theory” existed in the case to argue that CBI “concocted the case”. She also cited SC orders and argued that Indrani has faced six years of “pre-trial punishment” and the trial is likely to go on since 185 more prosecution witnesses are to be examined. The CBI, in turn, cited SC rulings to submit that neither delay in trial completion nor prolonged incarceration could by themselves be reason to grant bail in a serious case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-denies-indrani-mukerjea-bail-on-merits-in-sheena-bora-murder-case/articleshow/87745919.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Scolded at tuition, 13-year-old runs away to Bankura, traced||KOLKATA: A 13-year-old boy from Garia went missing for 16 hours from his tuition class in the Golf Green area on Monday evening, throwing his parents into panic and keeping cops on their toes to trace him.  After a search, cops found the Class-VIII student in the temple town of Bishnupur in Bankura district around 1pm. The boy told cops that he had gone to his maternal grandmother’s house there after being scolded by a teacher at his tuition class for being inattentive. He was scared that his parents would also scold him after his teacher complained to them. “So, the boy ran away to escape being scolded by his parents at home,” said an officer. After the boy was finally found at his grandmoher’s home, cops at Bansdroni polie station and Lalbazar heaved a sigh of relief as they had been trying to trace him since Monday night. “We had been told that the boy had booked an app cab and gone to Howrah station, where we lost his tower location as he had switched off his mobile or its battery had died. The boy told us that he had spent the night at the station and boarded a Midnapore local on Tuesday morning. From Midnapore station, he took a train to Bishnupur,” said a police source. “We were certain that he had boarded a train from Howrah after we spoke to several witnesses and traced the cab driver, who had taken him to the station,” said an investigating officer. As the search continued, the boy’s relatives living outside the city were contacted and instructed to alert his parents and police if and when they came across him. “However, we traced him with the help of a source,” said an investigating officer. Cops will counsel the boy to ensure that he does not make a similar mistake again. “There have been many such instances before. But children, who flee from houses for adventure, are often unaware of its consequences,” said an officer of the detective department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scolded-at-tuition-13-year-old-runs-away-to-bankura-traced/articleshow/87745159.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Allahabad||Robinhood army and Food Safety dept come together to feed needy||Prayagraj: To ensure that no person is forced to starve and even the poorest people in Sangam city have food to survive, a joint effort by the Prayagraj unit of Robinhood army and the Food Safety Drug Administration department of the district is sure to come as a boon just before harsh winter sets in. Following the noble work done by the Robinhood army for the past two years, the district administration has decided to come forward and further strengthen the bond between the ‘army for the poor’ and the restaurants of the district. Many restaurant owners in the city have happily agreed to part with the remaining amount of food that goes wasted at their respective establishments and the same would be distributed to the homeless and downtrodden by the volunteers of the Robinhood army. The department had arranged a meeting of the Robinhood army representatives and the office bearers of the hotel and restaurant association of the city. “Although we were in contact with some of the prominent hotels and restaurants of the city as we had collaborated to help the needy during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the businesses of both hotels and restaurants of the city were also adversely affected and it had an impact on our collections too. The meeting now was to restart the valuable contribution of these two segments, left-out food of which can be used to fill the stomach of the needy people in the city”, said a senior member of the Robinhood army, Narendra Tiwari. He further informed TOI that there are around 250 active volunteers of the ‘army’ and presently the sticker drive is being carried out by the team of these volunteers who visits the guest houses of the city every Sunday and paste the stickers at the noticeable places of the guest houses. “Through the stickers, we try to communicate the numbers using which these guest houses, who are used for marriage and birthday functions, can contact us if they have the leftover food. The food, which the donor wants to give us, should be minimum of 25 people with no limit of maximum quantity”, said Tiwari. He added that the sticker drive has already covered around 90 guest houses of the prominent localities of the city including Daraganj, Kydganj, Allahapur, Sobatiyabagh, Talierganj etc., while 90 odd more guest houses marriage halls would be contacted in the coming Sundays. “We attend the calls late at around 11 in the night also and if someone calls us after that, we request to kindly preserve the food and the same is picked up early in the morning, we taste the food and if it is fit to be consumed, we distribute it to the needy living in the vicinity of the site from which we have collected the food”, said Tripathi. Chief food safety officer at the Department of Food Safety and drug administration, KK Tripathi said, “The department is trying to play the role of a bridge between the hotels, restaurants and this noble NGO and from time to time, such meetings are held to spread awareness about the noble work of this ‘army’ and how hotels and restaurants can play an important role in the same”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/robinhood-army-and-food-safety-dept-come-together-to-feed-needy/articleshow/87745925.cms||---

A workshop in this connection would be held at KTDC Grand Chaitram here on November 17 and 18. Unveiling the plans, higher education minister R Bindu said the campaign has been named as ‘Samabhavanayude Sadkalasalakal’ (Virtuous Campuses of Equality). “Kerala caught the global attention in the past because its development indices were pro-women. Despite Kerala being in forefront in literacy and higher education, there are several glaring factors that pull the state back. It’s against this backdrop that the higher education department and the LDF started a new campaign to achieve the goal of establishing a pro-women Kerala,” the minister told reporters on Tuesday. The minister said the campaign is the beginning of the efforts to ensure women-friendly campuses and gender equality awareness throughout the higher education sector. It would help to ensure that gender justice forums are functional on all campuses. Steps would also be taken to make timely changes in curriculum and syllabus, the minister said.

The state reported fewer than 1,000 cases for the sixth day in a row, but there was a slight increase in Covid fatalities. Maharashtra added 886 cases and 34 deaths on Tuesday, taking the total cases to 66.3 lakh and fatalities to 1.4 lakh. Active cases in the state dropped further to 11,847, of which 3,554 were in Mumbai. The number of critical cases in the city at the moment was 257, a fraction of the tally in May-June. Less than 7% of the 17,500 beds earmarked for Covid patients were occupied, according to the BMC dashboard. With cases consistently staying low even 10 days after Diwali, the BMC has reduced over 2,000 beds for Covid. “We are closing down some wards in a few of our peripheral hospitals as there are very few Covid patients. In some places, we have allowed beds to be converted to non-Covid ones,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We can add the beds back if needed within a few days,” he added.The situation is the same across the state, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-single-covid-death-in-city-for-3rd-time-in-nov/articleshow/87747007.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Key accused in nat'l kidney racket was running clinic in Guwahati, held after 4-yr chase||Dehradun: After four years of chase spanning several states, police on Tuesday arrested a doctor, one of the main accused in a country-wide organ transplant racket, from Guwahati. He was quietly running a clinic in that city. Police said Dr Akshay Raut, who had set up the clinic in Guwahati some years ago, moved from one state to another, changed his name and identity to hoodwink officials. Electronic surveillance helped police pin down the accused, who carried a bounty of Rs 20,000 on his head. Blowing the lid off the scam, five persons had told Haridwar police on September 11, 2017 that Dr Amit Raut, Akshay's father, had illegally removed one of their kidneys during surgery at a hospital in Doiwala, Dehradun. Subsequently, on September 15, Raut was arrested from Panchkula in Haryana and police teams recovered luxury cars, including a Mercedes and BMW, and cash worth Rs 33 lakh, that the doctor, who turned out to be the mastermind of a large scale kidney racket, had earned through organ trafficking. Further investigations found that each kidney would be sold to prospective clients for anything from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore. During interrogation then, Raut told police that Akshay had fled to Chandigarh and had been hiding in several states, including Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal. He was finally traced in Guwahati, where the police arrested him. The accused doctor has been booked under sections 420 (fraud), 342 (wrongful confinement), 370 (trafficking of person) and under relevant sections of the Gangster Act. So far, 17 people, including doctors and nurses and support staff, have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the scam. “The location of the absconding doctor was traced to Assam and West Bengal, following which teams were sent and the accused was arrested and produced in the court,” said a senior police officer in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/key-accused-in-natl-kidney-racket-was-running-clinic-in-guwahati-held-after-4-yr-chase/articleshow/87745173.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Thane||Oxygen capacity in Maharashtra 2,500MT, target 3,838MT||MUMBAI: The state could require up to 3,838 metric tons of medical oxygen during the peak of a possible third wave when active cases may skyrocket to 12.95 lakh, according to projections drawn by the health authorities. To tackle such a demand, the state has been steadily augmenting its storage and production capacity for the past four months. It has managed to almost double it to reach 2,500MT from the previous capacity of 1,200MT. However, it could take a while to reach the desired volume of 3,838MT. The state now has 150 liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks in public hospitals, including medical colleges, that can hold 2,000 kilolitres of oxygen. LMO is the mainstay in ICUs and high-dependency units, where patients on life-support require high pressure oxygen. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said the state plans to add 200 LMOs, the funds for which will be allocated from the Centre’s Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package (ECRP-II). In addition to the LMOs, a total of 513 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants that can generate oxygen are also being installed in all districts. Sixty-eight of these plants, provided under the PM Cares Fund, have already been installed. “In all, more than 50% of the PSA have already been installed, while the rest are in process,” he said. Mumbai has been building capacity to generate and store up to 400MT oxygen, up from its existing capacity of 250Kl. According to the guidelines of the Centre, 70% of the supplies for a region have to come from LMOs, 20% from PSA plants and 10% from tanks, dura cylinders, etc. Ramaswami said that based on this formula and the active case projection for the third wave, every district has been asked to build capacity. During the second wave, Maharashtra faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen, forcing it to borrow supplies from neighbouring states and enforce stricter norms like restricting the use of oxygen-guzzling devices such as high flow nasal cannula. Against the state’s capacity of 1,200MT oxygen, the demand had shot up to 1,800-1,900MT. To avoid similar sights of desperation, the Centre handed out comprehensive plans to states to increase their bed, medicine and oxygen capacity. Dr Kanchan Wanere, state nodal officer for medical oxygen, said states have been told not just to create capacity that would suffice patients on a given day, but to create enough storage for the next three days. The state received donations of 5,000 oxygen concentrators from PM Care Funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/oxygen-capacity-in-maharashtra-state-2500mt-target-3838mt/articleshow/87749587.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The state now has 150 liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks in public hospitals, including medical colleges, that can hold 2,000 kilolitres of oxygen. LMO is the mainstay in ICUs and high-dependency units, where patients on life-support require high pressure oxygen. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said the state plans to add 200 LMOs, the funds for which will be allocated from the Centre’s Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package (ECRP-II). In addition to the LMOs, a total of 513 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants that can generate oxygen are also being installed in all districts. Sixty-eight of these plants, provided under the PM Cares Fund, have already been installed. “In all, more than 50% of the PSA have already been installed, while the rest are in process,” he said. Mumbai has been building capacity to generate and store up to 400MT oxygen, up from its existing capacity of 250Kl. According to the guidelines of the Centre, 70% of the supplies for a region have to come from LMOs, 20% from PSA plants and 10% from tanks, dura cylinders, etc. Ramaswami said that based on this formula and the active case projection for the third wave, every district has been asked to build capacity. During the second wave, Maharashtra faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen, forcing it to borrow supplies from neighbouring states and enforce stricter norms like restricting the use of oxygen-guzzling devices such as high flow nasal cannula. Against the state’s capacity of 1,200MT oxygen, the demand had shot up to 1,800-1,900MT. To avoid similar sights of desperation, the Centre handed out comprehensive plans to states to increase their bed, medicine and oxygen capacity. Dr Kanchan Wanere, state nodal officer for medical oxygen, said states have been told not just to create capacity that would suffice patients on a given day, but to create enough storage for the next three days. The state received donations of 5,000 oxygen concentrators from PM Care Funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/oxygen-capacity-in-maharashtra-state-2500mt-target-3838mt/articleshow/87756428.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Inculcate values in students, guv tells varsities||T’puram: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan urged universities to impart a sense of the country's cultural values to students of higher learning. Material prosperity, he said, cannot save the nation if we allow the breakdown of traditional discipline or do not act promptly to arrest the decline of moral and ethical standards. He was addressing the vice-chancellors at the chancellor’s award presentation ceremony at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. “If there is an interruption in the transmission of the skills and values which have come down to us from the past, the purpose of universities is not well served. If we are not to fail, we must ensure that the basic Indian cultural values are properly assimilated by students, accepted by them, and made a part of their very being. That is what we require if our universities are to succeed. If we are not able to do it, that is not the right education,” he said. Knowledge one acquires should be deeply internalized that it manifests itself in enlightening others. It must become the very part of our being. It must make us different from what we were before we received our education and degrees. If it is not done, our education has not really been a successful venture, Khan said. Khan, who is also the chancellor of state universities, said that state universities are yet to contribute substantially to offering Massive Online Open Courses and to place themselves in the services like Study Webs of Active–Learning for Young Aspiring Minds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inculcate-values-in-students-guv-tells-varsities/articleshow/87745943.cms||---

While Vipul Kavadiya died in the attack, his uncle Sanjay got injured after they were beaten up mercilessly at the main market in Ramghoda village of Umrava taluka. Kavadiya’s father Suresh is the chairman of executive committee of Umrava taluka panchayat, said the police. The eight attackers have been identified as Anil Satiya, Ashwin Satiya, Ravi Satiya, Vishal Satiya, Raju Bhokadva, Gopal Bhokadva, Hama Bhokadva and Bogha Satiya. Kavadiya received grievous injuries on his head and chest and was declared dead at Sir T Hospital in Bhavnagar. Sanjay, who too suffered minor injuries and is undergoing treatment, later gave a complaint against the eight accused. Based on his statement that they had ben attacked over a past rift with Anil Satiya, cops registered an offence of murder, assault, rioting and criminal intimidation. According to the police, more than a year ago, Kavadiya’s cousin Jagdish Dangar and Anil had a fight over rash driving of a bike. Since then, the two groups had been having minor clashes over petty issues. Police said that the attack on Monday night was also over the same ongoing rift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-beaten-to-death-in-bhavnagar-over-old-rivalry/articleshow/87745201.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi high court nod for herbal hookah with riders||NEW DELHI: In a boost to pub and restaurant business, Delhi high court on Tuesday gave its conditional nod for use of herbal hookah in all such outlets in the national capital, saying that Covid-19 restrictions cannot be permitted to continue at the cost of livelihood. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a batch of petitions by several restaurant and bar owners against the restrictions on serving herbal flavoured hookahs, said the prohibitions imposed on account of the pandemic couldn’t go on forever and noted that the authorities had already permitted cinema halls and swimming pools to function at full capacity. However, the court clarified it was granting permission as an interim relief and the same was subject to the petitioners giving an undertaking that they would strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. It restrained the authorities from interfering as long as Covid safeguards are followed. In case of any change in the pandemic situation, the government will be free to approach the court. The court directed the government to file its response and asked it to take a call if other restaurants and bars approach it for the same permission. The petitioners argued that they were serving herbal hookahs for which no licence was required as they were totally without tobacco, but police were still conducting raids, seizing equipment, and issuing challans. The petitioners had challenged the order of the joint commissioner of police (licensing unit). The government had argued that allowing hookah consumption in public places might spread Covid as people would share it. “Now you have opened everything. Cinema hall, full capacity. Swimming pool, full capacity. You want to ban hookah, you can do it, but not on the ground of Covid,” the judge told government counsel Santosh Tripathi. “What is happening? These people don’t have to survive? I’ve given you a long rope. But there has to be a limit. You can’t have such restrictions at the cost of livelihood. I know we can’t put our guards down, but this can’t go on forever,” the court observed, when the government maintained that herbal hookah could not be permitted now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-nod-for-herbal-hookah-with-riders/articleshow/87745960.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Cut dose gap, Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope urges his central counterpart||MUMBAI: State health minister Rajesh Tope has urged the Centre to reduce the gap between two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine Covishield. Tope met union health minister Mansukh Mandviya in Delhi on Tuesday and apprised him about the steps taken by the state to bring down the Covid-19 cases and informed him about the work done by the BMC to complete 100% coverage of first dose in the city.Tope said that to boost vaccination, the Centre must reduce the gap between two doses of Covishield to 28 days from 84 days. He said many countries have reduced it and many states have raised a similar demand. “The government has allowed the second dose to be administered in 28 days to those going abroad for studies or work and so there should be a re-think for others too,” said Tope. He asked the Centre to allow booster doses for health-care workers. Tope said that since schools and colleges in the state have started, the Centre must issue guidelines for vaccination of those under 18. The state sought funds for additional manpower in case of a third Covid wave and urged the Centre to re-start the scheme under the national health mission. Mandaviya congratulated the BMC for completing 100% vaccination coverage of the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cut-dose-gap-tope-urges-his-central-counterpart/articleshow/87747026.cms||---
---||Varanasi||RNA-based drugs, vaccines may play important role against infectious diseases||Varanasi: With the success of RNA-based vaccines in Covid-19 management, it has come to light that RNA-based drugs and vaccines may play an important role in the prevention of infectious diseases in the days to come. A study conducted by the researchers of the Molecular Biology Unit at the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) has highlighted the important role of small RNAs during Chandipura virus infection, which can be used in microRNA-based therapy. Recently, the research on the pathogenesis of Chandipura virus was conducted by Neha Pandey under the supervision of Prof. Sunit Kumar Singh, a well-known virologist and the head of the Molecular Biology Unit. The study was published in the July-2021 issue of the prestigious peer reviewed international scientific journal, “Journal of Biomedical Science”. “Whatever is neglected today may be a potential threat tomorrow. Therefore, it is very important to understand the intricate mechanism of neglected viruses,” said Singh. He said that in 1966, the Chandipura virus was discovered during an unknown fever outbreak in Chandipur village near Nagpur, Maharashtra. The Chandipura virus particularly attracted the attention of virologists between 2002 and 2004, when its infection was reported in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. According to him, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of the Chandipura virus. Prevention of vectors spreading the Chandipura virus, maintaining good nutrition, health, hygiene and awareness in rural areas will help in preventing the risks related to the virus infection. The microglial cells of the brain respond quickly to infections in the brain. Chandipura virus infection in the brain over-activates microglial cells and induces inflammation. He said that the research highlighted a mechanism that might be involved in aggravating the encephalitis-like symptoms during Chandipura virus infection. The Chandipura virus is an RNA virus. Children under the age of 15 are more vulnerable to Chandipura virus infection and have a higher mortality rate. The Chandipura virus spreads through infected sandflies and mosquitoes. The sandflies belonging to Phlebotomus spp and Sergentomyia spp are reported to play a major role as a vector for the transmission of Chandipura virus. There are millions of nerves and cells in the human brain. Infection in the brain results in inflammation and disturbs normal functioning of the brain. Chandipura virus infection leads to high fever, vomiting, convulsions, and other brain disorders, similar to encephalitis like symptoms, and severely affected patients may slip into a coma or other serious complications. These symptoms are classified under the category of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Most cases of AES are thought to be caused by bacterial meningitis or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. However, in more than half of the cases of AES, the source or factor cannot be traced. Singh said that the research highlighted the role of microRNA-21 in the activation of microglial cells in the Chandipura virus infected human microglial cells. Chandipura virus infection in microglial cells upregulates microRNA-21, leading to reduced expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in cells. This leads to increased activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB p65) in human microglial cells. Activation of NF-kappaB p65 promotes reactions that contribute to the aggravation of symptoms associated with encephalitis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rna-based-drugs-vaccines-may-play-important-role-against-infectious-diseases/articleshow/87745972.cms||Binay Singh

---||Business||Coromandel Intl to invest Rs 400 crore in new plant||Hyderabad: Secunderabad-based crop protection products manufacturer Coromandel International Limited (CIL), which is a part of the Murugappa Group, is investing Rs 500 crore in setting up a new 1,650 metric tonnes per day capacity sulphuric acid plant at its fertiliser complex in Visakhapatnam. The new plant will boost the company’s sulphuric acid production capacity by another 5 lakh MT per annum from the current level of 6 lakh MTPA to a combined capacity of 11 lakh MTPA, the company said on Tuesday. Coromandel International said the investment is in line with its long-term objectives to secure key raw materials for its fertiliser production, reduce import dependence considerably and ensure sustainable production of phosphoric acid, which is one of the key raw materials for phosphatic fertiliser manufacturing. The company is the country’s second largest phosphatic fertiliser producer and the largest private manufacturer and marketer of phosphatic fertilisers in the country, it added. The company’s Visakhapatnam manufacturing unit has a production capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per annum of complex fertilisers and a captive phosphoric acid production capacity of around 4 lakh tpa, it said. CIL has also signed technology partnership agreements with MECS Monsanto Enviro-Chem Systems (MECS) and ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions (TKIS) for setting up the project. Commenting on the proposed facility, Arun Alagappan, executive vice chairman, CIL said, “India is a net importer of sulphuric acid, and the third largest importer globally, accounting for close to 20 lakh MT of imports. In line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision...for import substitution and promotion of local manufacturing, Coromandel has announced the setting up of the...plant...Considering the essential nature of fertilisers, this investment will improve the self-sufficiency and availability of phosphatic fertiliser in the country.” According to Brian Blair, global licensing manager, MECS USA, the company has worked closely with CIL to be able to guarantee the precise performance and emissions control needed for the project to meet stringent environmental standards and production objectives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coromandel-intl-to-invest-rs-400-crore-in-new-plant/articleshow/87745225.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi to strive for per capita income at Singapore’s level by 2047: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Outlining the economic and development vision of Delhi government at a meeting of chief ministers and finance ministers of all states chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the target was to make the capital’s per capita income equal to Singapore’s by 2047. The discussions were held to improve the country’s economy and accelerate the pace of development in all states. Delhi’s growth rate reached 11-12% in the past six years and per capita income Rs 3.5 lakh, which is three times the national standard. The service sector accounts for 85% of Delhi’s GDP. Currently, Delhi’s contribution to India’s GDP is 4.4% despite having only 1.5% of the country’s population. TIMES VIEWThe Delhi government has set itself the ambitious target of making Delhi’s per capita income equal to Singapore by 2047. But increasing per capita income should go hand in hand with reducing inequality. That ensures that the poorest sections have a share in progress, which should be the goal of any welfare-oriented government.Sisodia underlined that shortage of land was the biggest challenge in the all-round development of Delhi and stressed that the AAP government expected cooperation from the Centre in this regard. Delhi has 29 planned industrial areas and four flatted factory complexes. “There are also 25 non-conforming industrial clusters, but all activities take place there. The central government should validate these areas soon so that they can contribute to the growth of Delhi,” said Sisodia, while urging the Centre and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to cooperate in the larger interest of citizens. The Kejriwal administration intends to build a world-class multilevel manufacturing hub on 147 acres in Rani Khera. On 55.2 acres, a knowledge-based industrial park is being developed in Baprola. In Kanjhawala, an integrated industrial township has been planned. The proposed large greenfield project will be on 920 acres. “The city’s roads of 540km length are being redesigned at a cost of Rs 11,000 crore to meet world-class standards. Delhi government expects the central government to contribute in this regard too,” said Sisodia. The deputy CM added, “The AAP government is working to make Delhi pollution-free. It has implemented the Electric Vehicle Policy and intends to make the city the country’s e-vehicle capital. A thousand e-buses have been procured. In the coming days, 4,000-5,000 e-buses will be purchased for which the central government’s cooperation will be needed.” “New hospitals are being constructed on government-owned land. While DDA has given land to private trusts to build hospitals, they have not been able to use them. These lands should be audited by the central government. If the trusts are unable to build hospitals, Delhi government will construct world-class hospitals on such land,” said Sisodia. Sisodia further stated, “Currently, only 20% of Class XII pass children across the country get higher education. In the last 5-6 years, this figure has exceeded over 45% in Delhi. To build a college or university, Delhi government has to purchase land from DDA at high prices. If DDA brings a change in its policy with the intervention of the central government, it will be of great help in improving the field of higher education.” He also appealed to the Centre to approve the remaining three Delhi Metro Phase-IV corridors. Sisodia said the AAP government was promoting startups and had drafted a new policy for them. To improve ease of doing business, 454 old rules from 16 departments had been repealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-strive-for-per-capita-income-at-singapores-level-by-2047-sisodia/articleshow/87745981.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Madurai||Madras HC: Exhume body of fisherman, hold re-postmortem||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed a team of experts to exhume and conduct a re-postmortem on the body of the Pudukottai fisherman on November 18, after taking into account the apprehension raised by his wife that her husband’s death was due to gunshot injuries suffered at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities who had opened fire mid-sea. The court passed the order while hearing the petition filed by R Brundha, wife of the deceased fisherman R Raj Kiran. Justice G R Swaminathan said that while the authorities stated that the petitioner’s husband died as he fell into the sea following a collision of his boat manned by him with a Sri Lankan navy vessel, the petitioner contended that her husband died due to gunshot injuries. The judge said that it was further contention of the petitioner that though the postmortem was performed at the Jaffna Medical College Hospital in Sri Lanka, the postmortem certificate was not handed over to her. The petitioner was not allowed to see her husband’s body before burial as the body came in a sealed coffin. The judge observed that when such genuine apprehension is raised by the petitioner, it is the duty of the state to allay the same. The judge directed a team of experts to exhume and perform a re-postmortem on Kiran’s body on the site itself on November 18. The judge also permitted a retired forensic science professor representing the petitioner to be present when the procedure is done. The judge directed the authorities to submit the re-postmortem report before the court and directed to serve the same to the petitioner’s counsel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-exhume-body-of-fisherman-hold-re-postmortem/articleshow/87745221.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan said that while the police have taken a stand that the death of the man Suresh Kumar, 27, was suicide due to consumption of poison, the petitioner alleged that his brother was murdered.The judge said that the state submitted that CCTV footage shows that the deceased person had gone to an agro farm to purchase pesticide. The spot where his body was later found has also been captured in the CCTV.The judge said that the court had directed the investigating officer to circulate the CCTV footage to the petitioner’s counsel to allay his misgivings. Since the counsel insisted on a report, the judge directed the DSP to file the same. The judge also directed the police to ensure the safety of the petitioner’s family.In his petition, Anand stated that his brother was in love with a woman from another caste for the past eight years.

The committee said Dr Priya Varghese, wife of CM’s private secretary KK Ragesh, was shortlisted ‘illegally’ for interview to the post of an associate professor in Kannur University. The minimum eligibility for the post of an associate professor is a PhD degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor-level. Varghese joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012. While working, she availed three years’ leave under the FDP programme for completing her Ph. D, the petition claimed. Quoting UGC Regulations 2018, Clause 3.9, the committee said the period taken by the candidates to acquire MPhil and/or PhD degree cannot be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to teaching posts. Further, the period of active service spent on pursuing research degree simultaneously with teaching assignment without taking any kind of leave shall be counted as teaching experience for the purpose of direct recruitment/promotion. The period of leave taken for pursuing research degree, i.e. for acquiring PhD, shall not be counted as teaching experience for the purpose of direct recruitment/promotion, it noted. “She also served as the director, student services for two years in Kannur University from 2019, which also cannot be considered as teaching/research experience. She cannot claim more than 4 years’ of teaching or research experience and thus she is blatantly ineligible to apply for the post,” the committee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/norms-flouted-for-cpm-mans-wife-to-be-on-list/articleshow/87745982.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Nepal seeks nod to let its census workers cross Dharchula in India to reach 2 of its villages||Pithoragarh: Nepal’s Darchula district administration has reached out to India’s Dharchula SDM (in Pithoragarh), AK Shukla, seeking permission for that country's census workers to use Indian routes to reach Tinker and Chhangru villages. The reason is that the two Nepalese villages situated on the eastern side of the Kali river do not have direct connectivity with the Himalayan nation's mainland, leaving only one option, Dharchula on the Indian side, to gain access to these villages. Taking place amid political skirmishes, Nepal’s 12th national census, conducted every 10 years, kicked off on November 14 and is slated to conclude on November 24. A house survey was completed in October this year. The foot trail lining Tinkar and Chhangru villages to the rest of the district and the headquarters, Darchula, was damaged by landslides triggered by floods. Following the devastation, villagers started using Indian roads to reach Darchula. Though the Nepal government started the construction work on the 127km Darchula-Tinkar road in 2008, only 40km stretch could be completed even after 13 years. The Nepalese army, too, repaired the track but it was damaged again, say locals. To reach their respective destinations, the villagers first go to Chhiyalekh, then cross the Kali river at Sitapul and enter India. While returning, the same drill is followed – they cross the river and enter Nepal via Dharchula. After the Nepal cabinet in May last year endorsed a new political map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura under its territory amid a border dispute with India, the villagers were left on the edge. They say that earlier, Tinkar and Chhangru villages were on the other side of the Kali river but with the new map showing Kalapani in Nepal’s territory, they have no idea where they belong. India’s Dharchula SDM said he has apprised the Pithoragarh DM of the situation and also forwarded the letter sent by the Nepalese authorities for conducting census. Responding to a query on whether authorities in India has considered giving permission to Nepalese officials, sources said they have received no response from the Indian side so far, adding that other means would be used to reach the villages if permission was not granted. The request comes less than a week after TOI reported that the Nepalese government is gearing up to conduct a census in the Kalapani region of Pithoragarh district -- an exercise that is likely to stoke border tensions between India and Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nepal-seeks-nod-to-let-its-census-workers-cross-dharchula-in-india-to-reach-2-of-its-villages/articleshow/87745255.cms||Prem Punetha

The unit was allegedly manufacturing crackers illegally. The charred bodies were identified as those of Hameedha, 55, and Kartheeswari, 33. Though it was suspected that owner Ramanathan and his wife Panchavarnam were also trapped under the building, no other bodies were found. The two-storeyed building had completely collapsed under the impact of the blast on Monday. Two people who sustained 60% and 30% burn injuries respectively were rushed to the Sivakasi government hospital.Official sources said fire and rescue services personnel from Sivakasi were carrying out the work of removing debris to ascertain if any others are trapped. Since chemicals required for cracker manufacture were stored inside the building, officials stopped the work. Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy inspected the spot and monitored the rescue operation. A fire and rescue services official said the presence of chemicals inside the building posed a great challenge to carry out the work of removing the debris. “We had to take a lot of precautions since there was a possibility of fire breaking out since chemicals were stored in the building. There was also apprehension on spraying water as fire would break out due to chemical reaction,” explained the official. Police sources said investigations revealed that unit owner Ramanathan and his wife Panchavarnam had left before the incident. No other bodies were recovered from the spot. Sivakasi Town police have registered a case against the couple under sections of IPC and Explosives Act and are on the lookout for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-womens-bodies-found-at-sivakasi-explosion-site/articleshow/87745245.cms||---

The vaccine maker started off Covovax trials among children in August this year. Initially, the trial enrolled adolescents between 12 and 17 years and was later expanded by enrolling children in the 7-11 age group. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax will have a total of 920 children — 460 in the 12 to 17 years category, 230 in the 7-11 age group and another 230 in 2-6 age group. “As per the trial design, we have been expanding the trial after ensuring vaccine safety among 100 children from each group in reverse order of age. We first did that among adolescents and then included children in the 7-11 age group. Now, we have started enrolling children in the 2-6 age group after seeking due regulatory permissions,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India this year and for children by April 2022. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculating with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “We enrolled the first child in the 2-6 age group in Pune on November 11. We intend to enrol 25-30 kids in this (2-6 years) age cohort.” Earlier, Bharati Hospital had enrolled 35 children in the adolescent age group and 21 children in the 7-11 age bracket for the Covovax trial. “The enrollment in the adolescent age group is now over,” Lalwani said. KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial.” SII would submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licensure. According to the latest guidelines of the DCGI, the company can apply for a licence for the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results. The child cohort comprises about 13 to 14 crore population. India would need about 25-26 crore doses for them, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-6-year-olds-join-covovax-trials-sii-plans-vaccine-for-kids-by-apr/articleshow/87747169.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the state government had also proposed to Delhi Disaster Management Authority that standing passengers should now be allowed in buses and Delhi Metro. Vehicles are among the biggest contributors to particulate pollution in Delhi and a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment showed traffic congestion was back to pre-pandemic levels at a time when the air quality had degraded. Gahlot requested Delhiites on Tuesday to shift from personal vehicles to public transport to curb vehicular emissions. “To augment public transport, Delhi government is in the process of hiring around 1,000 private buses for a period of one month,” he added. Gahlot told TOI, “This is being done as an emergency measure. During the operation of the odd-even scheme in previous years, only around 650 buses could be arranged, but the government will strive to engage 1,000 buses.” During the road rationing exercise since 2016, the government has been engaging private buses to augment the existing public transport. “Owing to the improved Covid situation and to control pollution from private vehicles, we have also proposed to DDMA that standing passengers in buses and Delhi Metro should be allowed and the current prohibition lifted,” Gahlot disclosed. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that his department held a meeting with associations of tourist transporters, contract carriage and school bus owners to work out modalities. “Delhi Transport Corporation is working out the details because the buses will have DTC signage and its conductors to guide the drivers,” said Kundra. Kundra said that there are no large private bus fleets in the city, with most operators having 50 to 100 buses. But overall, these will add up to have around 1,000 buses that will augment DTC and Cluster Scheme buses. He said that the transport department and DTC would be flexible with arrangements, such as allowing school buses to be deployed only after school hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-hire-1000-buses-for-a-month-to-cut-pvt-vehicle-load/articleshow/87745987.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The girl's family started looking for her when she went missing from the venue in Meerut even as the rituals were on. They later saw her lying unconscious and half-naked in the washroom inside the banquet hall. A police constable, drunk, was found in a room next to the toilet where the girl's body was found. While the family maintained that the girl was raped and that the constable is involved in the crime, police filed an FIR only for murder against "unknown persons." A post-mortem report is pending. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, said, “We are investigating how the constable reached the spot and other aspects of the case in a separate inquiry.” He added that the girl’s family has not alleged rape in their complaint, which is why an FIR for murder has been filed. “We are awaiting the post-mortem report. Further additions in the FIR will be made based on the findings of the autopsy,” he said. An uncle of the girl said that the girl was accompanied by her mother and two brothers at the wedding. "When the family asked the banquet hall manager to open a room that was locked from outside, he refused. Relatives then broke the lock and found the girl lying inside the washroom in a terrible state. A man was sleeping on a bed in a room right next to the toilet. He was later identified as a police constable,” he said. Kin of the girl also alleged that the manager of the banquet hall refused to show them CCTV footage of the premises, saying that the camera was not working.They also suspect the involvement of another man who is a staffer at the banquet hall.

The toddler was abducted so that she could be made to beg. On November 13, a man named Suraj Khiradkar was questioned by the shopkeepers when they saw him beating the girl on the beach. The shopkeepers tried to intervene, but the man told them that he is her father and asked them to leave. The shopkeepers, however, were not convinced so they informed cops at Prabhas Patan police station. Police picked up Khiradkar for questioning and admitted the girl to the hospital as she was injured. Khiradkar gave the cops their identity and said that he hails from Amravati in Maharashtra and the girl was his daughter. As police found Khiradkar’s responses suspicious, they contacted his parents back in Amravati. Cops asked Khiradkar’s parents about their granddaughter, but they said that they did not have any granddaughter as Khiradkar was not married. When Khiradkar realized that he had been exposed, he admitted on Tuesday that he had kidnapped the girl from Nagpur railway station on October 22 to use her to seek alms. Police then contacted their counterparts in Nagpur to inquire if they had received any complaint regarding a missing girl. It then came to light that the girl’s mother had approached the police after the toddler went missing. The girl’s mother had come to Nagpur at her parents’ home from Allahabad along with her. Nagpur police and the girl’s family members were asked to reach Somnath to take the custody of the toddler and also Khiradkar. “The accused will be handed over to Nagpur police as the crime took place there and all legal proceedings will also be done there,” said inspector N M Ahir of Prabhas Patan police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nagpur-toddler-abducted-for-begging-rescued-in-somnath/articleshow/87745266.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi police oppose Ansals’ plea, say need to restore faith in justice delivery system||NEW DELHI: The police told a Delhi court on Tuesday that the offences proved against the real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal were of the “gravest of its kind” and had ultimately “shattered the faith” of the common man in the justice delivery system. The submissions were made during the hearing of appeals filed by the Ansal brothers against an order under which they were convicted and sentenced to seven-year jail for tampering with evidence in the Uphaar fire tragedy. Additional public prosecutor A T Ansari, appearing for the police, submitted that the peculiar facts and circumstance of the present case undoubtedly made it an exceptional case where the court should not lean to exercise its judicious discretion in the favour of the convicts. “By tampering with crucial evidence forming part of judicial records, convicts sought to hamper and scuttle the process of law. They have not only polluted the stream of justice but have also potentially undermined the majesty of 'rule of law’,” Ansari told additional sessions judge Anil Antil.  “It would not be an exaggeration to submit that it is a targeted assault by the convicts on the institutional integrity of Delhi judiciary. The possibility of reform cannot be expected from the convicts, namely Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal. They are previous convicts,” he added.  Ansari argued that this case has led to a formation of a perception that rich, mighty and influential people could do anything and get away with it and that they could even manipulate the judicial system in their favour.  “No court of law can afford to turn a blind eye to the commission of such a serious offence. In this case, even the aspect of prolonged trial cannot be a factor to be considered for suspension of the sentence awarded against the convicts as it was the Association of the Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT), which approached the Delhi High Court for expediting the trial,” he said.  He further said the Ansals tried to protract the trial in the main Uphaar case by one or other way and, when they failed to do so they hatched the conspiracy in question along with convicts, D C Sharma, PP Batra and Anoop Singh to get the crucial and material documents having potential to establish their involvement in the main matter tampered with.  He added that the age of any convict may be a relevant factor but it could not be a determinative factor by itself in the consideration of suspension of sentence and grant of bail  “When a person can commit crime in his old age, how can he seek the benefit of the same old age at a later point of time? It was by virtue of their age, the convicts gained sufficient knowledge to meticulously plan and hatch a conspiracy with nefarious design to get the document in question tampered with to scuttle the process of law and secure their acquittal in that case,” he submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-oppose-ansals-plea-say-need-to-restore-faith-in-justice-delivery-system/articleshow/87746004.cms||Usha Das

According to my knowledge, work is being done to resolve this issue." He added, "There are many places where terrorism is being spread, I am not saying all madrasas are involved in it, but many are providing education on terrorism and they work to defame education organisations." The MLA representing UP's Sardhana constituency also showcased support for a recent statement made by Wasim Rizvi, former chairman of the Shia Waqf Board, who had said, "Sanatan dharma is the biggest in the world." Som welcomed Rizwi's decision of wanting to be cremated according to the Hindu religion after his death. Som made these statements during an interaction with media in Muzaffarnagar, where he had arrived to appear before the MP/MLA court for a 2009 case registered against him for "breach of peace." According to the prosecution, police had registered a case against Som and three private guards for blocking roads in the Civil Line area while protesting against the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh during the BSP rule in 2009. However, charges could not be framed against him as his two co-accused, Virender Singh and Jaipal Singh, were not present in the court.

The prevention of crime branch (PCB) busted the racket late on Monday night and arrested 24-year-old Mohsina Munshi from a commercial complex on Old Padra Road. The accused revealed that her parents and brother too were involved in the drug selling racket. While brother Shaqib Munshi has been arrested, their parents are on the run. “We had received a tip-off following which we nabbed Mohsina and her 21-year-old brother Shaqib and also seized some amount of marijuana from the complex. The duo revealed that they have been selling drugs for over a year as both have good network among the youngsters,” said Jatin Patel, police inspector, PCB. Mohsina said that she came in contact with a man identified as Dilip when she was studying in Vidyanagar. Dilip told her that he buys drugs in large quantities from Madhya Pradesh and sells them in Gujarat. “Mohsina told her mother Zarina Munshi about it and they decided to become drug suppliers to earn some quick money. They also involved Abdullah Patel, Mohsina’s stepfather, in the trade,” Patel told TOI. Both Mohsina and Shaqib began selling marijuana and charas among their contacts that included youngsters from decent and upper-middle class families too. As the business grew, Abdullah and Zarina began making trips to Anand to get supply of drugs. Zarina used to manage the drug stock at home, while Mohsina and Shaqib sold it. The PCB also arrested two addicts — Meet Thakkar and Nupur Sehgal — who work for a multi-national company (MNC) in Gotri and were regular customers of Mohsina. They would buy drugs from her and sell it further among their friends. “We raided Mohsina’s house in Tandalja and seized about 560gm marijuana and 10gm charas,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/family-of-four-booked-for-selling-drugs-to-youngsters/articleshow/87744990.cms||---

Bird watchers expressed concern over the non-arrival of migratory birds like the red-crested pochards, gadwalls, garganey, northern pintails and other waders that migrate from Europe and Siberia and South East Asia. They were seen in sizeable numbers at Gorewada even last year. Bird expert Nitin Marathe attributed the non-presence of migratory ducks to the depleting water level at Gorewada. “Diving ducks are agile swimmers. They dive far beneath the surface of the water in search of food, including fish, insects and aquatic plants,” he said. “These ducks need 15-20 feet water and prefer to stay in the water and can be ungainly and awkward on land. They have to build up speed to take off from the water’s surface,” said Marathe. A regular visitor to Gorewada, K Murli Manohar Naidu said, “Barring a few migratory gadwalls, local residents like whistling and spot-billed ducks, little grebes, jacanas, koots and purple morons are being regularly sighted. The gadwalls were recorded on October 21 after which the birds vanished but have arrived again .” However, Naidu said migratory ducks from abroad are missing this time. These birds need deep water and hence, are avoiding the lake. “Despite good rainfall this year, I’m surprised why the lake water level has decreased. The water has reached a level which normally happens during the summer season,” he stated. NMC officials admitted that the Gorewada water level has gone down to 314.30 metres. Normally, the water level is 314 metres and during the monsoon, it is 315 metres. The lake receives water from Navegaon Khairy (Pench) and it is supplied to treatment plants at Pench I, II, & III pumping stations. “Water continues to flow in and released out. In the next two days, the water level is expected to be at the normal level,” they said. However, a birder and assistant manager with FDCM Kalpana Chinchkhede says, “It is possible that the birds may arrive a little late as severe winter must have not set in the areas from where these birds migrate. The climate change effect cannot be ruled out as there are fluctuations in the temperature even in the city. Graylag geese and brahminy ducks were also sighted at the lake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/depleting-gorewada-water-level-affects-arrival-of-migratory-birds/articleshow/87746012.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Meerut||Four primary schools in UP to be illuminated with solar energy||Bijnor: Four government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh's Bijnor district are set to be illuminated with solar panels soon. The schools were unable to get electricity before as they are situated near the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, through which power lines cannot be drawn. The schools are situated in four villages. Two of these villages, with one school each, are Rampur Chata in Najibabad and Telipara in the Kotwali Dehat block. Both villages are located near the UP-Uttarakhand border. The UP government provided individual homes here with solar packs in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The other two are Rampur Thakra, which falls in the Haldar block around 15 kilometers from Bijnor, and Ram Sahaywal village, located near the Muzaffarnagar-Haridwar border. Rampur Thakra, in which the third school is located, is on forest land. The village previously had electricity but the same was cut off after the Allahabad high court in 2019 said that relocation of residents was necessary as power lines could not be laid through the forest. Ram Sahaywal village, which has the fourth school, has also been provided with solar packs as the presence of the Ganga river makes it impossible to lay power lines. District coordinator of basic education, Salim Beg, said, "All four villages were provided solar power packs by the government. However, our schools still remained without solar energy. We have prepared a proposal to illuminate four primary schools. I hope solar panels will be set up here by next year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/four-primary-schools-in-up-to-be-illuminated-with-solar-energy/articleshow/87744367.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Delhi: Without proper headgear, kids in harm’s way on roads||NEW DELHI: Three years ago, Lucky, then 12 years old, and his older brother, then 18, were going to their south Delhi school for a cricket match. At a traffic junction, when the light turned green, they rode ahead only to hit by a milk van speeding to beat the lights from another direction. Lucky (name changed) was knocked unconscious while his brother suffered knee and hand injuries. “My older son had a driving licence and a helmet on, but Lucky wasn’t protected,” said Vipin, their father, a Kalkaji resident. Lucky did not regain consciousness for two days. He underwent surgery and was in hospital for five days. Three years later, Lucky still has seizures. “The doctors had cautioned us that the contusions could continue to affect him,” Vipin said. “A month after returning from hospital, he had his first seizure. It happened again four months later. Now he suffers such seizures at least twice a year. Because we don’t know when he will have these attacks, we don’t allow Lucky to do things such as cycling, swimming or sitting on the front seat of the car.” The long-suffering father has a message for two-wheeler riders, especially children: “Please make sure the pillion rider, irrespective of religion or community, wears a helmet, one that is certified as meeting quality standards.” Every year thousands of children across India die in two-wheeler mishaps, mostly because their heads are unprotected. According to data provided by Delhi Traffic Police, the number of children’s deaths on two-wheelers till October 31 has risen from 11 last year (15 in the full year) to 17 in 2021. The figure for the injured has also gone up from 46 in 2020 to 60 this year. This, despite the amendment in the Road Safety Act in 2019 making it mandatory for children aged four years and above to wear a helmet while on two-wheelers. Over 70% of Indians ride on two-wheelers. The National Crime Records Bureau data shows that last year, 121 children below the age of 14 and 145 aged 14-18 died in road accidents. This year in Delhi, up to October 31, two-wheelers were involved in 1,560 accidents, 373 of them with fatalities. Last year, in the same period, there were 1,439 accidents in the city involving two-wheelers, 355 of which recorded loss of lives. In Delhi, 28.9 lakh notices have been issued to two-wheelers for speeding this year against 82.3 lakh last year. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, neuro and spine surgeon and medical director of Indian Head Injury Foundation (IHIF), cited a Union road ministry report putting the number of children who lost their lives in road accidents across the country in 2019 at 11,168. “The unofficial estimates are much higher,” revealed Prasad. “The children frequently sustain severe disabilities after accident due to untrained first responders, poor pre-hospital care and lack of neuro rehabilitation facilities. The chances of survival automatically improve if they wear good headgear while riding two-wheelers.” IHIF, which helps road accident victims and also rehabilitates them, said in most accidents involving children, they were found not wearing helmets. “Frequently, a child sitting on the pillion dozes off and falls down. There have been numerous cases in which children with head injuries have had to stay in hospital for many months,” said Prasad. “There needs to be some method of checking children are protected. For example, schools shouldn’t allow children to enter if they ride in without helmets.” Rohit Baluja, president, Institute of Road Traffic Education, and observer for India at the Global Forum on Road Safety Collaboration, United Nations, noted, “No company in India makes helmets for children complying with BIS norms. At best, there are the helmets used by cricketers and construction workers, which guarantee no safety in road accidents.” Baluja also pointed out loopholes in the prevailing law. “By amending the law to make it possible for a four-year-old to ride pillion, we wrongly promoted children riding on a two-wheeler. But the law doesn’t explain how a child should be secured on a two-wheeler,” said Baluja. “In Europe, if your feet don’t touch the footboard, you aren’t allowed to ride a two-wheeler. In other countries, say Vietnam, the two-wheeler traffic is segregated from the other vehicles. In India, both heavy vehicles and two-wheelers are supposed to drive on the left-most lane.” Traffic officers that TOI spoke to accepted that the unavailability of headgear for children was a drawback. “Elders should try to secure the child firmly while riding two-wheelers,” said Manish Aggarwal, joint CP (Traffic). “We also hope manufacturers come up with children’s helmets that meet the safety norms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/without-proper-headgear-kids-in-harms-way-on-roads/articleshow/87746015.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two held for involvement in over 50 snatching cases||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested two men for their alleged involvement in more than 50 cases of snatching and robberies. They were arrested after a brief exchange of fire in the early hours. The men have been identified as Manish Poddar (25) and Nirala alias Mohd Nizamuddin (24), both residents of JJ Colony in Bawana. Police have found that Poddar was involved in at least 37 criminal cases and Nizamuddin in 19 cases. A pistol with which the accused threatened their targets, two used .32 cartridges, and a KTM Duke 200 bike used in crimes in the recent past have been seized. The KN Katju Marg police station received a tip off that two active snatchers, with a loaded pistol, would reach Rohini to target people on Monday. “Accordingly, a trap was laid and, around 1am on Tuesday, they were spotted. As soon as they were directed to surrender to police, the accused tried to run away. The rider of the bike hit constable Rakesh and the pillion-rider fired two rounds at the police team,” said deputy commission of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal. In retaliation, the police team also opened fire and the pillion-rider sustained an injury on the right leg. “Both of them were overpowered. During their search, one .32 pistol and two used cartridges were recovered. Poddar, who was riding pillion, was taken to BSA Hospital for treatment. Both have been booked for attempt to murder among other sections,” the officer said. The accused later disclosed their involvement in various crimes, police claimed. The cops are trying to find out if they were involved in more cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-held-for-involvement-in-over-50-snatching-cases/articleshow/87746018.cms||---

Another, the Composite and Primary School in Putthi, was not providing "adequate" meals according to the mid-day meal menu as the gram pradhan had allegedly hoarded ration inside his house. The department said that during the raid, school authorities at Jai Kishan Inter College told the team that this was being done since students had "less attendance". However, the principal of Jai Kishan Inter College, Indresh Kumar, later told TOI, "There was proper food in the school. I will complain about this matter to senior authorities." Virendra Kumar, the divisional coordinator of Meerut, said, “A team comprising deputy inspector (Urdu), Amarveer Singh, visited several government schools on Tuesday. These were Composite and Primary School, Putthi, Primary School No 2, Jai Kishan Inter College, and Primary School in Lodipura and Khatki. At Jai Kishan Inter College, the students never got proper food after they returned to school after the second lockdown. They told us that they are being given Parle biscuits instead of proper meals." Kumar added that prima facie, it looked like Jai Kishan's principal and an NGO have distributed the money meant for mid-day meals among themselves. He said that the NGO and principal also did not deposit convenience money into the bank accounts of the students. The principal refuted the allegations and said that the education department's team demanded "certain things" from the school that they didn’t do, which is why they made "baseless" allegations. "We have given the money to students as and when it was due," he said. Meanwhile, those at the Composite and Primary School in Putthi were supposed to receive raw material for meals from the gram pradhan. Virendra Kumar said that the pradhan kept the ration in his own house, thereby depriving children of proper meals. He said the cook at the school also corroborated this. The gram pradhan, Sonu, said that he has kept the ration at his home because the door of the school is broken and anyone can enter the premises and steal it. “It's wrong if they say I don’t give the ration when asked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/biscuits-being-distributed-as-mid-day-meals-in-meerut-school/articleshow/87744375.cms||Ishita Mishra

The recruitment was on hold for several months and many aspirants had been waiting for government orders. A statement issued by the state education department said that a committee appointed to study the vacant posts had suggested filling up 4,737 posts, of which 1,697 posts were filled two years ago. The payment for recruited candidates will start from the 2022-23 academic year, an education department notification issued on Monday stated. Dattatraya Kahar, state department of higher and technical education department official, said, “Teachers who were considered ‘extra’ will be accommodated in these vacant posts on priority. There are no additional posts of assistant teachers. Hence, the joint directorates in the state can immediately issue an advertisement for recruitment in their respective divisions.” The selected candidates will be appointed for 2022-23 academic year. The joint director must mention this in their recruitment advertisement as well, he said. Kahar said that the unaided non-agricultural universities also have vacancies for teaching and non-teaching staff. However, the vacant posts and their structure have still not been decided by the designated committee due to some technical issues. It will be resolved soon.” The distribution of vacant posts has been done by the education department considering affiliation of the institute with the universities and accreditation and reaccreditation limits. The joint directorates have been informed by the education department to strictly follow the university rules and regulations during recruitment. The colleges will have to submit the monthly report on the recruitment process and thereafter to the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-recruitment-in-aided-colleges-gets-go-ahead/articleshow/87745270.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Meerut||3 more contract killers held in Bijnor lecturer’s murder case||Bijnor: More than two weeks after the murder of a degree college lecturer, Priya Sharma, 35, in broad daylight in posh Saket area of the Bijnor city, police claimed to have arrested three contract killers, including a shooter named Golu, who were hired by her husband to murder her. Another shooter, Raju Singh, was earlier arrested on October 4 after a brief encounter with police. The professor’s husband, Kamal Sharma, and four of his relatives -- including his father, mother and brother -- are on the run. Police had earlier claimed that Kamal had paid advance money of Rs 5.5 lakh to contract killers. According to Bijnor superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh, acting on a tip-off about the presence of the killers in the district, police sealed the district borders. During vehicle checking on Jhalu road, police spotted the three men on a bike coming towards Bijnor city and signaled the riders to stop but they tried flee and also fired at the police personnel. The cops managed to arrest the three, identified as Vikrant, Ankur and Kapil Kumar – all from Moradabad. The SP said, "The arrested persons confessed to their crime. They told police that Kamal Sharma had given the contract to eliminate his wife Priya, her sister-in-law and her husband in lieu of Rs 12 lakh. Kamal had made Rs 5.5 lakh advance payment, and the rest was to be given after the three were killed. After killing Priya, the killers were camping in Bijnor and looking for an opportunity to kill her sister and brother-in-law." “So far, nine accused have been booked in the case. Four accused have been arrested. A reward of Rs 25,000 for information on each of the remaining five accused was announced earlier," the SP added. Priya, professor of English literature, was gunned down in posh Saket area on October 29 while she was on her way to college. She was a resident of Surendra Nagar, under the jurisdiction of Bijnor city police station. Locals said they were inside their houses when they heard a gunshot and rushed out to find a woman lying in a pool of blood. Some of them spotted two bike-borne assailants speeding away. The bullet hit Priya's temple, killing her on the spot. The motive behind the crime, according to police, was marital dispute between the husband and wife. She had moved to her maternal house and was staying with her parents, who claimed that her husband had allegedly attacked her earlier as well. Priya had filed a dowry case against her husband and in-laws a day before her murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-more-contract-killers-held-in-bijnor-lecturers-murder-case/articleshow/87744385.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Nashik||Dist development council approves outlay of Rs 861cr for Nashik this fiscal||Nashik: The district planning and development council (DPDC) on Friday approved an outlay of Rs 860.9 crore for the Nashik district for the ongoing fiscal — about Rs 36 crore higher than the previous financial year. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal chaired Tuesday’s DPDC meeting, which was attended by the elected representatives and district officials. Bhujbal told reporters that the infrastructure in Nashik would be one of major focus areas this fiscal. “Till October-end, the state government released only 10% of the outlay due to Covid-19. That is why we could spend less than 10% of the total outlay by last month,” Bhujbal said, adding, “But now the government has started releasing funds. We have received 90% of the funds in the past few days and plan to spend all the funds under DPDC by March 2022.” In the past financial year, DPDC had approved Rs 824.14 crore, and 96% of the outlay was spent by the various departments. The remainder could not be spent due to the Covid pandemic. Of Rs 860.9 crore this time, Rs 470 crore outlay is for general schemes, while Rs 290.9 crore is planned for tribal development schemes. The remainder would be spent on schemes for the Scheduled Castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-development-council-approves-outlay-of-rs-861cr-for-nashik-this-fiscal/articleshow/87743646.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||Doc writes to ECI to provide vote verification facility to blind||Nagpur: A Mumbai doctor has drawn the attention of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to blind voters’ right to exercise their franchise in an autonomous and independent manner. In a letter to the ECI, Dr Akshay Bajad proposed ‘image-text to speech’(ITTS) conversion system be introduced in electronic voting machines (EVMs) that will enable blind voters to verify their vote. ITTS is a simple, inexpensive and proven technology that provides reasonable accommodation to visually challenged, in the process bringing them at par with other voters, he said. Dr Bajad has also forwarded the same e-mail to the ministry of law and justice and chief commissioner for persons with disabilities four months ago. The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and National Association for the Blind (NAB) have appreciated his initiative and forwarded the suggestions to the ECI. However, the ECI is yet to respond. Quoting 2011 Census, the 31-year-old doctor said there are about 2.68 crore disabled persons in India, of which about 50 lakh are blind. “Such voters have to cast their vote only with the assistance of a companion. An assisted vote, while not a secret and independent, still allows such voters to participate in the electoral process. However, in the present system of voting through EVMs, there is no way of knowing if the assisting person has indeed cast his/her vote for the candidate picked by the voter with disability in seeing,” said Dr Bajad. He said for the convenience of such voters, there is Braille signage on the EVM unit. On its right side along the candidates’ vote button, digits 1 to 16 are embossed in Braille for their guidance. “However, though a blind voter can press a button, he or she cannot ascertain the actual voting. The voter is not sure whether the vote is recorded or not, and whether it is in favour of the candidate to whom it was intended to. Moreover, not every person with such a disability understands Braille,” he said. Explaining ITTS, the ayurvedic doctor said the basic idea behind the proposed stand-alone real-time system was to capture the image of the paper slip generated by the printer in VVPAT, extract text from it and convert it into speech that can be listened to through headphones. “ITTS device shall be fixed inside the VVPAT machine in such a way that voters’ view through the transparent window of the machine remains unobstructed and the printed paper slips displayed for seven seconds come within the field of view of its camera lens. Externally, it requires a set of headphones with volume control so that blind voter can listen to his choice of vote,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doc-writes-to-eci-to-provide-vote-verification-facility-to-blind/articleshow/87746023.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Gahlot visited the rain-affected Mundhela and Malikpur villages and was informed that due to the low embankment, the Najafgarh drain overflows and enters nearby fields, affecting crops. Farmers told him that they had not been able to sow crops due to the waterlogging. The minister instructed the officers to complete the survey in a time-bound manner. In Malikpur, the village pond has overflown, submerging nearby fields. Officials will explore the possibility of raising a protection wall around it. To provide immediate relief, pumps have been installed in these villages. Gahlot also ordered the revenue department to prepare an estimate to build a proper embankment. “As per the orders of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the revenue department is conducting a survey in different rain-affected villages. About 80% of our survey has been completed,” he said.

In his place in the Rajya Sabha, the TRS may give an opportunity to KCR’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha whose term as an MLC would expire in January 2022. On the last day of nominations to fill six vacancies under the MLA quota on Tuesday, the TRS named its six candidates. Apart from Prakash, names of former legislative council chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari, party leader from Huzurabad Padi Kaushik Reddy, senior leader T Ravinder Rao and former Siddipet district collector P Venkatrama Reddy were announced. The party leadership is believed to have considered Nalgonda leader MC Koti Reddy, former SC Commission chairman Erolla Srinivas and sitting MLC Akula Lalitha along with others. In the end, Prakash clinched the issue in his favour while others whose names were doing the rounds since Monday made it to the list. Venkatrami Reddy, who took voluntary retirement on Monday, was initially considered as an MLC nominee from Medak local authority constituency for which elections will be held on December 10. However, the party had decided to send the former IAS officer under the MLA quota. Party sources said Prakash, who belongs to Mudiraj community, got the green signal as he may be inducted into the state cabinet in the next reshuffle. Prakash hails from the same community to which former minister and Huzurabad BJP MLA Eatala Rajender belongs and his likely induction in the cabinet is being seen as a move to keep the Mudiraj community happy. Speculation is also rife that former assembly speaker S Madhusudhana Chary could be sent to the upper house in place of Prakash and that he will be nominated to the legislative council under governor’s quota in place of Kaushik whose nomination has not been cleared by the governor till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/surprise-as-kcr-names-banda-for-mlc-seat/articleshow/87746027.cms||Koride Mahesh

The states and Union Territories have been entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the first -tier screening examination known as State Level Talent Search Examination,” said Supe. The scholarship is awarded to candidates for pursuing courses in science and social sciences up to the doctoral level, and in professional courses like medicine and engineering. Around 2,000 scholarships are awarded in the country with 15% reserved for scheduled castes, 7.5% for scheduled tribes, 27% for other backward classes and 4% for a group of students with benchmark disabilities. The state level examination will have two parts: a mental ability test (MAT) and a scholastic aptitude test (SAT).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nts-exam-1st-level-on-jan-16-applications-till-dec-13/articleshow/87745274.cms||---
---||Pune||Engineering admissions: Last 2 yrs’ cut-off marks now available||PUNE: The State Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell has uploaded the category-wise cut-off marks for the last two academic years, which should be checked before filling up the online admission forms for the engineering course’s first year, engineering college teachers have told candidates who are in the process of filling up the said forms. The last date to fill up the forms and upload the documents online is November 18, after which the first merit list will be published by the cell on November 27. An engineering college professor, on the condition of anonymity, said that many private colleges are under a lot of pressure financially and many professors have not been paid their full salaries in the past two years. “This automatically causes a lot of issues. Some colleges have also asked senior faculty members to leave if they want, because they can then employ recently passed out postgraduates who can be paid less for the same work. In the end, placements are the biggest deciding factor for the students. So, my advice is to check placement data before zeroing in on a college,” the professor said. A candidate who is filling up his admission forms, however, complained that many colleges are not putting up their complete data online. “It is not possible to visit all colleges. We mostly rely on their websites, but many colleges just give names of companies who hire from them, without details — like when did they hire, which department did they hire from, how many were hired, what was the average salary, and more. There is also not much information on faculty. Hence, choosing a college, especially if one has got fewer marks in the CET, is very hard. Except names of renowned colleges, nobody knows the status of the remaining ones — which is where maximum students end up,” he said. On December 6, all colleges will commence their academic activities, while the cut-off date for all admissions for the academic year 2021-22 will be December 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/engg-admissions-last-2-yrs-cut-off-marks-now-available/articleshow/87745289.cms||Ardhra Nair

Many are now using AI-based voice-to-text tools to document their work more efficiently and save time. Aditya Shetty, radiologist, said, “A voice-to-text app can precisely follow the flow of my thoughts in the form of commands, helping me generate and finalise reports in minutes without relying on a transcriptionist or assistant. This experience is further supplemented with the introduction of mobile mic app, thus creating a more convenient hands-free capability to dictate reports through my earphones while I remain focussed on viewing and reporting the scans.” “The desktop app in conjunction with the mobile mic app is a ground-breaking experience in the work environment, which has revamped and revolutionised the way we approach the process of generating a report at a remarkable turnaround time,” he added. These apps also help with hospital administrative work. Rahil Shah, director of NM Medical, said, “Text-to-voice apps have transformed the efficiency of our documentation process.” While there are a couple of voice-to-text apps for different purposes and professions, one used for medical purpose needs to be verified and trustworthy with no room for technical errors. An issue with such apps can be accent recognition and vocabulary of technical medical terminology. Anand Patil, general manager, information technology, Ruby Hall, said, “We are seeing substantial benefits in efficiency with this software.” Using a voice-to-text tool that is developed in India decreases the chances of misinterpreting one’s native accent or MTI, and is more conducive to local work environment, said tech-savvy medical professionals who rely on such apps to get through work more efficiently on a daily basis. Rustom Lawyer, co-founder and CEO, Augnito, currently the only Indian voice-to-text app built for local medical professionals, said, “We aim to transform our two decades of clinical documentation knowledge and expertise in quality systems, security, and the criticality of turnaround times in hospital environment, and package this into a powerful AI, which is easily accessible to every doctor in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/voice-to-text-tools-help-med-professionals-save-time/articleshow/87745302.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Delhi||Once burnt, forever shy: Theatres do their bit to avoid Uphaar Part II||NEW DELHI: Friday the 13th proved proverbially sinister in June 1997. In one of the worst fire catastrophes in the country that day, 59 people lost their lives and 109 suffered serious injuries in a fire in Uphaar cinema hall in Green Park. The only silver lining in the tragedy was it taught theatre operators and the authorities to ensure strict guidelines to make movie viewing safer for people. Amit Sharma, MD of Miraj Cinemas, which owns over 150 screens across India and 10 in the National Capital Region, claimed that now the theatres strictly comply with the national building code guidelines for theatres, including designing the seating in such a way that the exit gates aren’t more than seven seats away from any viewer. “We use fire-resistant fabrics and materials for seats, carpets, curtains and wall panels,” Sharma said, explaining that while accidents couldn’t be avoided, most establishments have staff who are now equipped and trained to face threatening situations. Fire and a combination of heat and smoke detection are key. "If detected, our staff is trained to evacuate the hall and extinguish the fire,” Sharma added. “The staff undertake regular training on dousing fires caused by electric equipment or by wood burning. They are also trained to handle injured people and evacuate them to safety.” At the malls too, nothing has been left to chance, attested Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Malls. His staff, Bansal claimed, underwent regular drills conducted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority and Delhi Fire Service (DFS). The building bylaws too have changed for the better since Uphaar, defining the number of staircases required and their width to facilitate smooth evacuation of the people. Bansal points out that the size of the halls has changed to seat around 250 people rather than the 500-1,000 they did then. Rajeev Patni, chief operating officer, INOX Leisure Ltd, claimed to have put in place pre-emptive measures to reduce the probability of disasters — from using fire-retardant seating and wall fabric to using beam detectors and smoke and heat detectors in auditoriums and in the lobby and concessionaire counters. "We also have installed smoke extraction fans in all the auditoriums and have emergency power backup to light up the exit signage," said Patni. Inox also keeps ready safety gear and emergency response kits, comprising masks, oxygen cylinders, searchlights and first aid boxes. Maintenance of safety equipment has become a must. “Merely investing money on safety is not enough,” said Sharma. “We also have to see that sprinklers are kept fully functional and the detectors work efficiently.” A manager at a multiplex, however, felt that many establishments, especially the single-screen theatres, needed an infrastructure upgrade because their entries and exit were still cramped and there was a laxity about fire safety norms. Fire officers agree that safety in cinema halls and multiplexes has improved since Uphaar. Sanjay Tomar, deputy fire officer, DFS, cited the court order requiring the quarterly inspection of all cinema halls by a joint team of DFS, the electricity and licensing departments and the land-owning authority. “The advantage of this system is that if there are shortcomings, they are highlighted by the various agencies and change and amendments can be made expeditiously,” said Tomar. Atul Garg, DFS director, confirmed, “Nowadays we inspect cinema halls once every six months.” He also disclosed that around 60 theatres operated in Delhi with a valid fire NOC. Tomar noted that in a multiplex, a licence to operate is not issued until the fire department certifies the entire mall or high-rise complex as fire safe. Earlier, the theatre doors were bolted from inside, but these days not only do they remain unlocked but are also prominently indicated by exit signs. “We also train the theatre staff to operate firefighting equipment,” added Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/once-burnt-forever-shy-theatres-do-their-bit-to-avoid-uphaar-part-ii/articleshow/87746073.cms||Amin Ali
---||Vijayawada||Farmers stand to lose Rs 33,000 crore if capital is trifurcated, Andhra Pradesh high court told||VIJAYAWADA: Capital region farmers stand to incur a loss of at least Rs 33,000 crore if the value of returnable plots is estimated at the lowest possible prices, senior counsel Shyam Diwan, arguing on behalf of the farmers, told the high court as the hearing on the batch of petitions challenging the trifurcation of the capital continued on Tuesday. Stating that capital establishment is a consequential effect of the State Reorganization Act, Diwan said the state government does not have the power to make laws to change the capital. Referring the Reorganisation Act, he said the power to decide the capital of any state lies with the Union government under article 3 of the Constitution. The Union government, through the said Act, decided Hyderabad as the common capital for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for not more than 10 years, after which it would remain as capital of Telangana. It also mentioned that AP shall have a new capital post bifurcation and an expert committee was constituted by the Centre to identify the location, Diwan said, adding that the state government does not have the legal competence to do that exercise over and over again as it has to be a one time exercise. As the capital has already been identified, notified by statute, master plans were prepared and investments made including the funding given by the Centre, it cannot be changed as and when the state government changes its mind, he argued. Stressing on the farmers’ contribution, Diwan said they gave up their livelihoods for the construction of a world-class capital. Though lands are being acquired for several projects, the capital region farmers cannot be equated with others and must be looked upon as a special class, because without their collective contribution a project of this size and magnitude is impossible to accomplish, he added. Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra intervened at this juncture, saying that the capital not only belonged to the 30,000 farmers who gave away their lands, but to everyone in the state. In reply to a query from the bench as to how vested rights were conferred on capital farmers, Diwan said had the decision to have three capitals taken at the time of bifurcation, this problem would not have arised. But by virtue of APCRDA Act and land pooling scheme (LPS), certain rights are vested with the farmers which cannot be taken away arbitrarily, he said. The hearing will continue on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-stand-to-lose-rs-33000-cr-if-capital-is-trifurcated-high-court-told/articleshow/87744409.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The air quality index (AQI) levels recorded in Agra city on Tuesday though remained in the 'poor' category at 262, this marked a slight improvement as against 'very poor' to 'severe' category for seven continuous days last week. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 is 'satisfactory'; 101 and 200 'moderate'; 201 and 300 'poor'; 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Environmentalists, however, warn that the air quality is expected to soon deteriorate from 'poor' to 'severe' due to low temperature and high humidity. Green activist Debashish Bhattacharya said, "Air quality gets improved due to settlement of dust particles on the ground by sprinkling of water on roads. Besides, all construction work has been stopped in the city." he said. AQI recorded by the five monitoring stations in Agra on Tuesday evening was - 243 at Sanjay Place and Manoharpura, while Shastripuram was at 248, Shahjahan Garden 269 and Avas Vikas Colony recorded 280 .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-air-quality-poor-but-better-than-last-week/articleshow/87744402.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which oversees and frames the policy for the Income Tax Department, did not disclose the name of the firm, but said that the company manufactures excavators, cranes, piling rigs, and equipment in the mining and port space. Officials from the ITD or the CBDT did not respond to queries till late on Tuesday. In a statement, the CBDT claimed that the company has “admitted” to up to Rs 120 crore of unaccounted income, adding that cash, jewellery and bank lockers linked to the firm have been placed “under restraint”. The CBDT said the firm resorted to various means to suppress its income and profits by writing off expenses, such as by issuing credit notes, “non-verifiable” commission payments, “incorrect” depreciation claims, among others. The statement further added that the ITD had found and seized unaccounted investments, loans, and cash receipts by various parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/income-tax-dept-raids-pune-heavy-machinery-firm/articleshow/87745308.cms||---

Babu Bambhaniya, a resident of Nava Bandar village of Una taluka in Gir Somnath, is expected to reach his native village on Wednesday. According to case details, Babu was arrested by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) in March 2017 along with five other fishermen. But his five crew members were released within six months of the arrest after completion of jail sentence. The reason why he was not released was a typographic error in his father’s name. According to records of the Indian authorities, Babu’s father’s name was ‘Krisan’, but Pakistani authorities had mentioned it as ‘Naran’. Ajay Shiyal, a social worker from Amreli, who represented his issue with the Union ministry of external affairs and the Indian embassy in Pakistan said, “Babu was once released but had to return from Wagah border because of the typo mistake. We lost hope of his release now but suddenly we got the news that he is among the 20 fishermen released by Pakistan.” Babu’s eldest son is working with a local fisherman and is the sole breadwinner for the family. His two other children — a son and a daughter — are studying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fisherman-stuck-in-pak-jail-due-to-typo-error-released/articleshow/87745316.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: After lull, Nawab Malik raises storm with cruise ship trap list in KP Gosavi chats||MUMBAI: After a brief gap of a few days, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Tuesday stepped up his drive against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede for shielding the drug mafia and fashion designer Kashiff Khan. Malik shared a series of WhatsApp chats of K P Gosavi, the independent witness of the NCB during the raid on a cruise ship on October 2 and an informer, which shows how they were planning to trap people going to attend the party on Cordelia Cruise. The chat specifically mentioned Kashiff Khan and he was identified as suspected but not arrested by the NCB. He was on the cruise for two days but no action was taken against him. During the cruise raid, mega star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested by the NCB and later released on bail. “Wankhede must come out clean what are his relations with Khan and explain to the people as to why he was allowed to go and innocent persons arrested and sent to jail,”Malik said while disclosing the entire chat between Gosavi and an informer in New Delhi. Malik said that following the chat between Gosavi and the informer, it appears that the persons to be trapped were identified well in advance and their pictures, including one of Kashiff Khan, was sent to them. While more than a dozen persons were detained, Kashiff Khan was let off by the NCB sleuths. “Kashiff Khan and White Dubey’s names were among the persons to be arrested, but the duo was let off owing to his relations with Wankhede,” Malik said. Malik alleged that serious offences have been registered against Kashiff Khan across the country, including one in Mumbai. One court in Mumbai has declared him absconding. Malik was the first politician to raise doubts over the raid on the ship, saying it was fake and fabricated. He alleged that most of the witnesses were fake and criminals and they were working for Wankhede. Malik was proved right when it was found that Gosavi was indeed facing a series of criminal cases and that he was declared absconding, while another witness Bhanushali was a BJP worker. The third witness, Prabhakar Sail, submitted an affidavit against the NCB. While Wankhede declined to comment on the charges, an NCB official said that on umpteen occasions Malik had alleged Wankhede has relations with Kashiff Khan but he must produce evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-lull-nawab-raises-storm-with-cruise-ship-trap-list-in-gosavi-chats/articleshow/87746656.cms||---

These automatic and advanced monitoring stations will provide a real-time air quality index of the areas. The MPCB officials said that the work has already been started at two locations — Guru Gobind Singh High School and the office-building of the Nashik Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (NIMA). The MPCB has also sought NOC from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to install air quality monitors in the city. The fourth station will be set up at the recreation centre building of Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) located at Ambad industrial estate of MIDC. At present, MPCB has air quality monitoring stations at five locations, which are operated manually. These four new stations will have continuous automatic monitoring devices for carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO2) and beta attenuation gauges to measure PM2.5 and PM10 pollution levels. The MPCB officials said the cost of setting up each mobile continuous ambient air quality monitoring station is Rs 1.5 crore. Also, efforts are being taken to boost the remaining two pollution monitoring projects. We have already sent a letter to the NMC administration, requesting them to provide a space to set up mobile air quality monitoring stations the officials said.The officials further added that they are in talks with the AIMA office-bearers for their consent to set up the air quality monitoring station at their office building. When contacted, the NMC officials said, during the recent meeting related to Godavari pollution, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav has instructed the concerned civic officials to provide the space to the MPCB to set up a mobile air quality monitoring station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-to-get-4-advanced-air-quality-monitoring-stations/articleshow/87743688.cms||Tushar Pawar

The only solace was, however, increased number of tests. More than 7,000 tests were conducted in the region and the test positivity rate further dropped below 0.25%. However, more detections and fewer recoveries in the last 7 days have increased the number of under-treatment patients to 130 as on Tuesday. The number of under-treatment patients in Nagpur district on Tuesday surpassed 50, after a gap of almost 3 weeks. Nine out of the 18 new cases reported in the last 24 hours in Vidarbha are from Nagpur district alone. These include 3 from city, 5 from Nagpur rural and 1 from other state. On Tuesday, cases reported include Gadchiroli 3 and Chandrapur 3. In Amravati division, Buldhana 2 and Amravati 1 reported new cases. All other districts did not report new cases on Tuesday. Now, five out of the 11 districts in Vidarbha have under-treatment patients above 10. Washim is the only district where there is no ‘active case’ at present. All other districts have at least 1 or 2 patients under treatment. The first fortnight of October has seen 174 new patients against 133 recoveries. The number of new cases has seen a minor, but confirmed, surge in the seven days gone by. According to experts, the next seven days will be crucial. If most of the patients reported in the last seven days recover, there will be no reason for the authorities to worry. Bhandara: The district reported no new case on Tuesday as all 317 tests conducted in last 24 hours were negative. As no patient recovered on Tuesday, Bhandara has 2 patients under treatment. Gondia: No new case was reported on Tuesday in the district, where 168 tests were conducted. The only patient in the district under treatment is in home isolation.

---||Pune||5 Rajasthan men held for cheating folk artist online||Pune: The cyber cells of the Delhi and Pune police, in a joint operation, busted an online cheating racket with the arrest of five men from Rajasthan on Tuesday. A Pune police team left for Delhi after the arrested suspects were brought there by their Delhi counterparts. “The fraudsters cheated a Balewadi-based folk artist (35) to the tune of Rs16,200 on November 11. The woman had lodged a police complaint in this regard. During the probe, it was revealed that the suspects were operating from Rajasthan, and the Pune police shared details with the Delhi police’s cyber cell,” senior inspector D S Hake of the Pune cyber police said. The arrested men have been identified as Bajrangla Jagdish Narayan Meena, Ram Lalram Meena, Anilkumar Ramavatar Meena, Harbhajan Durgaram Meena. “The victim takes online folk-art classes and teaches students. She has a social media profile. The suspects read her posts and contacted her on the phone,” he said. He said the suspects claimed that they wanted to join her online classes and inquired about fees. The woman said she charges Rs1,800. The suspects agreed to pay through UPI,” he said. “The fraudsters then prepared a fake image to claim they paid Rs18,000 to her. They sent this image to the woman. Within minutes, they called up the woman and told her they accidentally transferred Rs 18,000 and demanded a refund of Rs 16,200. The woman checked the image and transferred the money,” Hake said. Under questioning by the Delhi police, the arrested men disclosed that they had created fake profiles on a social networking site. They used to visit shopping pages on the site and after taking the screenshots of the product, they used to ask the sellers for the price via messages, an officer said. “Then they would send fake messages of the paid amount, which would be higher than the amount quoted, and demand a refund of the excess amount,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-rajasthan-men-held-for-cheating-folk-artist-online/articleshow/87745323.cms||---

But in 2018 and 2019 when the two FDs were to mature Pravinchandra Shah, who lives in Makarpura, was shocked to know that the bank did not have any records of it. Shah pursued the issue with the bank since 2018, but the money was never paid out to him. However, the consumer court came to his rescue recently. The court ordered the bank to pay the matured amount of Rs 65,342 along with interest and compensation of Rs 2,000. As Shah did not get any positive response from the bank, he had filed a complaint at the consumer forum in November 2019. He told the court that the bank did not have records of his FDs. When he approached senior officials of the bank, he was told that as the bank’s system had changed, his FDs’ account numbers had changed and he was assured of the payment. But Shah never got the money and instead learnt that the bank had deducted tax at source even as he had filled forms 15H and 15G and the rate of interest was reduced without informing him. The bank was sent notice to appear before the forum and respond to Shah’s complaint, but the bank’s representatives never remained present. Since Shah had submitted all documentary evidence and they were not opposed by the bank, the court upheld the evidence. The court ordered the bank to pay the promised sum of Rs 65,342 to Shah within two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bank-misplaces-fd-records-of-senior-citizen-told-to-pay/articleshow/87744933.cms||---

A proposal regarding the same was tabled before the standing committee on Tuesday but could not be finalised as the meeting was adjourned. The proposal will again come for discussion next week and, if approved, Rs1 crore will be diverted for providing scholarship from the funds reserved for transport of civic school students. “The funds for school transport will not be utilised as schools did not open for in-person studies. The classes were conducted online. So, these funds may lapse due to non-utilisation. Instead, they are being diverted for providing scholarship,” said a senior PMC official. PMC offers scholarship to meritorious students. Any student scoring more than 85 % marks in SSC and 80% marks in HSC is eligible for this award.  Students of classes X and XII from municipal, private schools and colleges are awarded financial help for pursuing studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diversion-of-funds-on-cards-for-scholarship/articleshow/87745327.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Congress razes bust of Godse installed in Gujarat village||RAJKOT: A massive controversy has erupted in Jamnagar after members of a right-wing group installed a bust of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse, which was razed by the Congress members a day after being erected. The members who identified themselves as activists of Hindu Sena installed the statute in an ashram in Morkanda village adjoining Jamnagar city on Monday. They even raised slogans hailing Godse. However, local Congress leaders led by city’s party president Virendrasinh Jadeja razed the bust on Tuesday. The Hindu Sena and Congress lodged cross-complaints with Jamnagar A-division police station. The members of the outfit claimed that they had demanded a place from Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) to install Godse’s bust a month ago but JMC did not respond to their application. Pratik Bhatt, Gujarat president of Hindu Sena, said “Godse was associated with Hindu ideology and he fought for a Hindu nation. When our demand to erect his bust was not heard, we did it on our own on his death anniversary.” In his complaint, Bhatt named Jadeja and a person named Dhaval Nanda. “We are followers of Godse’s ideology. The accused vandalized the bust and threw a saffron cloth and a cloth on which Shree Ram was written in garbage. This act hurts our religious sentiments,” he stated. Meanwhile, Virendrasinh Jadeja in his complaint against Bhatt, Dhiren Bhanushali, Bhavesh Thummar and two unidentified persons, alleged erecting the bust of Godse was a blasphemous act. “They installed the bust without taking any permission and insulted those who believe in the ideology of Gandhiji. This act is creating dissension, hatred and animosity between people,” the complaint stated. In both complaints, those named were booked under relevant IPC sections including 153 (a) for an offence of promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony. Jamnagar deputy superintendent of police J S Chavda said “We have registered both FIRs against and the matter is under investigation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/congress-razes-bust-of-godse-installed-in-gujarat-village/articleshow/87745332.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: GVMC to supply 7 lakh bins for waste segregation at source||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has floated tenders to procure seven lakh garbage bins. These bins will be distributed to about 2.3 lakh households belonging to the below the poverty line in the city. The major objective of this initiative is to further waste segregation at source and promote the three-bin culture among the residents of the city. The civic body will utilise the 15th finance commission grants for this purpose. The GVMC earlier decided not to collect the non-segregated garbage from the public. But it is not being properly implemented at the ground level due to lack of awareness or for the want of bins on the part of some households. The GVMC distributed about 1 lakh bins in 2020 to tide over the situation to some extent. Now, the GVMC is expecting that the distribution of 7 lakh bins will reach out to all the eligible beneficiaries in the city. The Corporation earlier made a council resolution to intensify its solid waste management practices by adopting the guidelines of the solid waste management rules 2016. The source segregation of waste has been mandated to channelise the waste to wealth by recovery, reuse and recycle. As per these rules, the waste generator will have the responsibility of segregating it into three streams - wet, dry and hazardous waste. The generator will have to pay a ‘spot fine’ for littering and non-segregation, the quantum of which will be decided by the local bodies. Even though the two-bin segregation has been happening for quite some time in Vizag city, the majority of the residents are yet to adapt to the three-bin culture. A GVMC official informed that the tenders for procuring the bins would be finalised by November 20 and the distribution will begin in the coming weeks. “The distribution of three bins for every eligible household will help the public habituated to the waste segregation into three channels. The solid waste management rules 2016 emphasise scientific disposal of solid waste through segregation, collection and treatment and disposal in an environmentally sound manner. The GVMC is implementing several initiatives to achieve the objectives of Swachh Bharat Mission and solid waste management rules,” said the health wing official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-supply-7l-bins-for-waste-segregation-at-source/articleshow/87744429.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Milind Band, general manager of the Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (NMPML) — the transport wing of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) — said this was proof of the growing popularity of the city buses among commuters. NMPML buses crossed the milestone of ferrying 25 lakh passengers recently and collected a total of Rs 5.75 crore through sale of tickets in the past four months. The transport utility will deploy 20 more buses on three more routes from the city, to Wadiwarhe, Jategaon and Konarknagar, from Wednesday. Currently, NMC has deployed 130 buses on 134 routes in the city. The number of buses playing on the city roads will increase to 150. With schools reopening from Monday, NMPML has increased the frequency of the buses on various routes in the city, from the previous 30 minutes to 15 minutes. The routes where the bus frequency has been increased include Nashik Road, Shramiknagar, Boargad, Sinnar, and Trimbakeshwar. NMC has deployed two private agencies for procuring, operating, maintaining, and managing city buses. Both agencies have procured 250 buses, including 200 CNG buses. CNG buses are 48-seaters, while diesel buses are 28-seaters. NMPML has also decided to increase the number of CNG buses as per the supply it gets from the Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd. At present, NMPML operates 80 CNG buses and 50 diesel buses. It will add 20 CNG buses from Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmpml-rakes-in-record-single-day-revenue-of-rs-10l/articleshow/87743707.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||20 hospitals warn of stopping cashless facility over tariff cut||Nagpur: At least 20 key private hospitals have issued an ultimatum to three insurance companies and six TPAs (third-party administrators) regarding stoppage of cashless facility for the beneficiaries if they don’t rollback the tariff cut by November 18. Around six hospitals have allegedly been de-empanelled by these companies following disagreement over new packages offered for different treatments at the time of renewal, recently. The Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) has alleged that the insurers and TPAs adopted ‘arm-twisting’ policy through a lesser known body ‘Nagpur PPN Hospital empanelment committee’. A member of the committee, refusing to be quoted, passed the buck on the insurers. “We only communicate the decisions of the companies to hospitals. We don’t have much authority in negotiating or fixing the rates,” said the member, adding the committee is unaware of the VHA ultimatum. The VHA claimed all of its 160 members will soon take a similar decision. “If the fair demands are not met, the privilege of cashless services to the policy-holders of these insurance companies and TPAs will be stopped,” stated a press note issued by the VHA. Sources said the insurance companies and TPAs could take such a bold decision of slashing rates by over 50% due to support from some hospitals. “The companies and TPAs are citing the example of a select hospitals which have agreed to their revised rates. This can’t be standard for rest of the hospitals. These hospitals are startups and don’t have the similar set of doctors and expertise as compared to those who have built a reputation for themselves,” they said. The sources added that a possibility of these hospitals deliberately agreeing to the new packages at low rates to divert patient load under them can’t be ruled out. On last Saturday, the concerned VHA members had convened a meeting and resolved to stand united with the aggrieved hospitals. They have sought technical details supporting the extensive tariff reductions. “Instead of such crude rate cutting, all hospitals were waiting for some augmentation on existing tariff proportionate, at least on national indexes as a way to thank the private health care service providers,” said the VHA. Such ‘cartelization’ will result in poor quality and less choice of services for beneficiaries and is violative of the Competition Act, 2002, the VHA added. “The beneficiaries should have been at liberty to choose hospitals to avail quality health care. These companies are misleading and cheating policy holders by forcing them to avail services in select hospitals,” alleged the VHA.  ‘Insured face hardships due to decision of insurers’ cartel’ An insurance beneficiaries body has slammed the companies and the TPAs for “arm-twisting” private hospitals in agreeing to lower rates. “It is learnt that member hospitals of Vidarbha Hospitals Association are deliberating on stopping cashless services to health insurance beneficiaries of major TPAs of Nagpur. If such decision is taken, this will affect lakhs of the health insurance policy holders. People pay health insurance premium so that in times of need, cashless health care is available. One does not have cash ready during hospitalization and it creates lot of problems if admission of self or any dependent is required. We propagate health insurance only to avoid this,” said Insurance Beneficiaries Organization, Nagpur, in a press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20-hospitals-warn-of-stopping-cashless-facility-over-tariff-cut/articleshow/87745338.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The accused, identified as Rajneesh (who goes by his first name), went to the same school as the victim girl. The victim's brother told police that they were returning home after shopping in the Fatehganj East area, when Rajnish came before the bike and as he applied the brakes, allegedly kicked it, knocking the brother-sister duo off the bike on the road. Subsequently, he dragged his sister by the hair, tore her clothes and shot her five times at point blank range. The injured man said the attack was over even before he could pick himself up and save his sister. Rohit Singh Sajwan, Bareilly senior superintendent of police (SSP) said while police teams were searching for Rajneesh, he walked into the SSP office on Tuesday afternoon and surrendered along with the murder weapon. He said he killed the girl because she did not keep her promise of marrying him. Some villagers claimed the girl broke off ties with Rajneesh after her parents came to know about their relationship and did not approve of it. They fixed her marriage elsewhere and she abided by her parents' wishes. SSP Sajwan said, "The girl was shot in the neck and abdomen and she died on the spot. Her body was handed over to the family after an autopsy on Tuesday. An FIR has been registered against Rajneesh under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder) and 504 (intentional insult). The accused has been sent to jail." A police force has been deployed at the village to maintain law and order till the matter settles down, the SSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-19-shot-dead-by-jilted-boyfriend-in-bareilly/articleshow/87744454.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

According to zoo officials, a lioness gives birth to a maximum of four cubs, and that this is the result of continued efforts for successful breeding. “Five cubs is a rare event. Last year, a lioness gave birth to six cubs which is a very rare phenomenon. Lionesses have only four teats on their mammary gland, so naturally she can afford only up to four cubs,” a senior forest official said. D T Vasavda chief conservator of forest (wildlife circle) said “The mother is experienced as she has given birth to three healthy cubs earlier also. All are being taken care of and monitored by the staff.” Of the total 62 lion cubs born in Sakkarbaug zoo in the last two years, 30 cubs were born in the last one year. The zoo authority has studied behaviour management of lions and provided the cats with privacy and a relaxing environment for mating. The pairs are then kept in separate enclosures to create a conducive environment for the animals, with minimal human interference. As part of behavioural engagement, zoo authorities also included a few colourful balls to engage the felines in a playful mood and dispel any natural odium between opposite sexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lioness-gives-birth-to-quintuplets-at-sakkarbaug-zoo/articleshow/87745349.cms||---

---||Delhi||DJB to start installation of new connections||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Tuesday issued an order to start installation of new water connections. To stop contamination of water and avoid unauthorised connections, water minister Satyendar Jain had held a meeting with officials last month. It was decided that DJB would directly provide connections to its consumers, thereby removing any scope of intermediaries. The installation charges have been divided category-wise based on the colonies. For colonies falling in groups A, B and C, the charge for a new connection would be Rs 4,000. For categories D and E, the charge would be Rs 2,000 and in case of F, G, H and rural villages, Rs 1,000 would be levied. For commercial connections, the charges would be double the domestic charges based on the category of the colony. DJB would approve sewer connections along with the water connections and no separate charges would be levied. All zonal officials have been directed to send a daily list of sanctioned water connections to the officer concerned in the maintenance department for installation without waiting for payment by the customer. During this process, the government would also be replacing defective meters and regularising unauthorised connections. DJB has also made it clear that only authorised people would be allowed to lay water or sewer pipelines. “No unauthorised person will touch the water or sewer pipeline as only people authorised by DJB will lay the connection, according to the decision of the board,” stated the order issued by Akriti Sagar, director, revenue department. “As water is a basic human need, every house in an area where water pipelines have been laid and made functional will be provided a connection and all unauthorised connections will be regularised,” added the order. Through this effort, DJB hopes to benefit customers by providing a single-window facility for its services. There would be better maintenance of pipelines as water connections would be done by an expert team, thereby avoiding chances of damage and contamination of water. This would also reduce revenue losses through household connections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-to-start-installation-of-new-connections/articleshow/87746096.cms||---

The passengers, a few of whom spoke to TOI, said that many aggregator drivers were becoming just like Kaali Peeli drivers in the past. Recently, TOI wrote about how they have begun cancelling rides and “refusals” similar to Kaali Peeli drivers. And now, the latest modus is to demand “fixed fares” for a ride to the airport. This was something Kaali Peeli taxis would do at the stands a few years back. TimesViewAggregator cabs came as a major relief for lakhs of commuters in Mumbai in 2014 when citizens were frustrated with refusals, and rigged meters of autos and Kaali Peeli taxis.If the aggregators have to survive, they need to discipline drivers, ensure zero refusals and provide low cost rides to woo back commuters’ trust.The drivers have also begun asking for the fare shown in the app for the trip to the airport, a few riders said. If the fare does not suit him or is lower than his expectation, he quickly cancels the ride. One such rider, Virat Singh, said he refused to reveal the fare shown in the app and the driver cancelled the ride. “After I booked the cab, the driver instantly called me and said ‘rate kitna dikha raha hai airport drop ka app mein (what is the fare for airport being shown on app)? I refused to give him the fare while he kept insisting and when I did not budge, he just cancelled the ride,” he said. Another passenger said she had booked a cab for her brother to the domestic airport. “The driver called me asking what is the fare shown in the app and said that he will only ply if we pay Rs 600. This is ridiculous. Drivers should compulsorily ply cabs at fares being calculated by the app,” she demanded. Singh said he complained to the aggregator firm, which replied : “We’re sorry to hear about this. We understand how this experience can be upsetting. We’ve always encouraged driver partners to take all rides irrespective of the destination. Since this wasn’t the case here, we’ve reached out to the driver partner and made a note on his profile. We use a point-based model that records every feedback about a driver-partner and takes necessary actions ranging from educating them to excluding them from the platform. We appreciate you bringing this to our notice.” Social media had citizens discussing the same issue and some of the tweets were : #Ameya Chumbhale @ameyapc : “No long term solution will be found on this....All they are interested in is their profits. Nor will our government step in to make them do it.... they are the new kaali peelis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/app-cabs-demand-fixed-fares-for-trip-to-airport-in-mumbai-riders/articleshow/87745345.cms||Somit Sen

The Ankudu wood depot that was set up in the village has never served the purpose. Etikoppaka toys are mainly handmade, using wood which is lightweight and easy to cut. Etikoppaka toys are exported to even foreign countries. The previous government set up a depot of Ankudu wood, which is most suitable for making toys, but not a single load of wood came before it was closed a couple of weeks later in 2018. The village artisans need around 15 to 20 tonnes of Ankudu wood a month. The wood is available in Golugonda, KD Peta, Kottakota, Tallapalem, Ravikamatham, and other areas. The tiny village with a population of 15,000 on the banks of river Varaha has 200 artisans including five national and five state award winning craft persons. The artisans are now depending on vendors who deliver the wood secretly. Akudu wood is available in forests but the department says it is forest produce. Sirsailapu Chinnayya Chari, the President Award winner, says Ankudu wood is available at various places but needs forest department permission. “Forest department officials are trying to get permission from the government. We are dependent on craftwork and the government should save us. Most of the artisans have moved to other works and not trained their wards in the art, “ Chinnayya Chari said. More than three-century-old legacy of the softwood-lacquerware toy industry is now urging the government authorities to provide permission to bring the wood from forest areas or set up a depot in their village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/etikoppaka-craftsmen-in-limbo-after-bar-on-transport-of-wood/articleshow/87744458.cms||Siva G

---||Nashik||Onion prices continue to drop at Lasalgaon||Nashik: The average wholesale onion price at the country’s largest wholesale market at Lasalgaon APMC declined by 36% over the past eight days due to drop in demand in comparison to supply. The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by Rs 1,050 per quintal in just a week, from Rs 2,900 per quintal on October 9 to Rs 1,880 per quintal today. APMC officials said the supply of new onion crop has increased in other onion growing belts in the country and it has reduced the demand for Nashik’s onions. Moreover, export of onions has also reduced, which has led to overall drop in average wholesale onion prices, said APMC officials. Moreover, the central government has created a buffer stock of 2 lakh tonnes and it is in the process of selling over 1 lakh tonnes in the markets in major metro cities. This has also impacted the wholesale market leading drop in average wholesale onion prices, said APMC officials. Meanwhile, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 901 and Rs 2,512 per quintal, respectively. Around 8,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Tuesday. Presently, the onions arriving at the Lasalgaon APMC are the summer onions harvested in March and April. The summer onions have a shelf life of over six months and farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices. The fresh kharif onions have also started arriving at the market but in very low quantity — only 4% of the total arrivals at the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/onion-prices-continue-to-drop-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/87743723.cms||Tushar Pawar

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana noted that the accused was allegedly part of the syndicate that cheated Indians with the help of Chinese nationals by using a complex maze of mobile applications, websites and shell companies. “The chats of the applicant/accused with the Chinese nationals through Telegram and WhatsApp applications clearly proves the role played by him in the commission of the alleged offence,” the judge said while refusing to grant him bail on account of parity on Monday. “The instant bail application is bereft of any merit and the same is accordingly dismissed,” he added. During the hearing, the accused’s counsel claimed that he had been falsely implicated and neither anything incriminating had come on record to connect him with the commission of the alleged offence nor he had received any pecuniary benefit from it. Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea, saying the accused had duped the victims on the pretext of doubling their money within a short span of 30-35 days. Ahmed argued that the gullible citizens were initially paid about 10-15% of their amount before they were blocked and the rest of their amount was cheated by the accused people. He further submitted that many companies were used in the scam for siphoning money and large amounts were transferred from one company to another. It was also submitted that while the power bank app had projected itself as a Bengaluru-based company involved in quick charging technology, the server of the app was found to be based in China and the app was associated with several dangerous permissions. Once the user registers on the app, he/she was induced to invest money to earn high returns and invite their friends and relatives to join it, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-accused-in-chinese-crime-syndicate/articleshow/87746101.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Farmers’ outfits to intensify stir over sugar cane prices||Kolhapur: The meeting called by sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad to resolve the issue of sugar cane pricing between the representatives of the farmers’ outfits and sugar mills on Tuesday, remained inconclusive. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and other outfits from Sangli and Satara districts are angry over the fact that the mills have started sugar cane crushing without announcing the price they would pay to the farmers. The mills from the Kolhapur district have announced that they will pay the farmers an amount equal to Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the central government. The outfits are demanding the FRP amount to be paid in a single installment. Mahesh Kharade, Sangli district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana who attended the meeting in Pune, said, "Apart from a couple of mills in the Sangli and Satara districts, no mill has announced the prices even though the cutting and crushing has been started. By law, it is mandatory for the mills to pay the amount equal to FRP to the farmers, however, many mills have not announced the prices so they can pay less." The transportation of sugarcane to the mills is being obstructed violently. Now, since the meeting with Gaikwad remained inconclusive, the farmer outfits are likely to intensify the agitation. "We will hold a meeting with the local workers. It is for sure, the agitation which was limited to a few mills will now be extended to all the mills from both the districts. The mills will not be allowed to cut the cane," said Kharade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-outfits-to-intensify-stir-over-sugar-cane-prices/articleshow/87743751.cms||---

At the time of chief minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, a committee was set up to come up with a transfer policy in Rajasthan. The committee submitted its two-volume report, which was later presented in the state assembly, but couldn’t get passed.Since then, there have been several discussions regarding the transfer policy, but no concrete step was taken by any government. Teachers have been demanding a transfer policy for a long time. Vipin Sharma, vice-president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Government Teachers Association said, “We have been listening to these discussions for a long time. Instead of just talking about it every year, the government must take ction.”Spokesperson of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh, Narayan Singh Sisodia, said the step in implementing this decade-old plan should be executed by the state government as this will give relief to government teachers who have to suffer due to this.A transfer policy will decide the time limit of transferring an employee.

---||Mumbai||All Panje wetland choke points cleared, finds joint inspection||NAVI MUMBAI: A joint inspection of Panje wetland by government officials and local environmentalists on Tuesday found that all the five major choke points, which the green activists had earlier pointed out as being blocked, have been unblocked, thereby allowing the free flow of tidal water into Panje. Environmentalists are happy that all the five choked tidal water inlets to Panje wetland have been unblocked now and migratory birds have also started arriving there. Cidco, revenue, and forest department officials, accompanied by environmentalists from NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, and the fishing community representatives trekked the radius of the nearly 300-hectare wetland for close to three hours and physically checked all the five inlets. Cidco nodal officer for environment, Pramod Patil, Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare and range forest officer S A Kadam also joined the inspection team. Two inlets were towards the Dongari village end and three at the Panje end. “With the help of the map prepared earlier by BNHS, the officials managed to detect and open all the choke points, which is good for the Panje wetland,” NatConnect Director B N Kumar said. “Some miscreants were earlier trying to sabotage and destroy the wetland by blocking these five inlets, which are now reopened. We also urge the authorities to conducte regular patrolling at Panje,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan. The visit assumed significance as the Bombay high court had on Monday admitted the petition of the NGO Vanashakti Foundation for declaring Panje a protected bird sanctuary. Since it was the low-tide time during the joint inspection, water was flowing back into the sea through the channels. Responding to the Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan’s petition, the Western Zonal bench of the National Green Tribunal had earlier asked the Raigad district collector and Cidco to ensure that the state government’s orders were complied with on the issue of preservation of Panje. Finally, at the end of a battle lasting exactly one year, the channels were kept open on the instructions from collector Mahendra Kalyankar. The decision followed complaints of attempts to sabotage the wetland by rendering it dry to suit vested interests who are trying to convert the place into a concrete jungle. Sub-divisional officer Rahul Mundake assured the environmentalists that the officials would keep an eye on the wetland to ensure that the inlets are kept open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-panje-wetland-choke-points-cleared-finds-joint-inspection/articleshow/87745393.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Hyderabad||‘Keep Mask On To Avoid Resurgence Of Covid’||Does the drop in Covid-19 numbers mean the pandemic is behind us? Can people drop their guard already? N K Arora, co-chair of INSACOG, a 28-lab consortium to monitor genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 and senior member of India’s Covid-19 task force, addresses these questions  “Keeping the hands sanitised at all times is a good and desirable habit. It should become part of our lives and culture – Covid-19 or no Covid-19. It will prevent several other respiratory and gut infections”, says N K Arora, co-chair of INSACOG Q: There are conflicting reports coming in from different quarters about the status of Covid-19. Is it really on the wane? A: From June-July 2021, there is a gradual decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The decline is variable – some parts of the country have seen a faster decline while other parts like Kerala and the north-east are witnessing a slower reduction in cases. Overall, the test positivity rate has come down across the country and now we have 10,000 to 12,000 cases every day for the last several weeks. Q: A lot of people have stopped wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Is that advisable? If not, why? A: SARS-COV-2 is very much around us. That is why we are still getting over 10,000 cases every day. People in several countries in Europe and other high-income countries have made the mistake of giving up Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after high vaccine coverage and initial decline in cases. That has led to the resurgence of the disease. We do not want to make that mistake in India. Q: What other Covid-19 protocol must we follow while stepping out into public places? A: Besides SMS (Sanitation, Mask and Social distance), the key is to avoid crowds and avoid creating a crowd. In any social gathering we do not know about the Covid-19 infection status of the person standing next to us. Currently, several other infections – the so-called ‘viral fevers’ -- are also widely prevalent but unfortunately none can be differentiated from Covid-19 infection unless tested. Despite vaccination, we can acquire and carry the infection back to our homes and become a reason for continuing the chain of Covid-19 virus transmission in our near and dear ones. Q: As offices and schools have started reopening, what precautions must we take while being inside closed spaces? A: Strict adherence to Corona Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) is very important because the risk of spreading of infections increases several folds, in closed spaces. Employees and students who have even mild common cold/flu like symptoms should be asked to work or study from home till the symptoms subside in three to five days. Q: Is it still necessary to sanitise our hands and things we buy from outside, before using them? A: Keeping the hands sanitised at all times is a good and desirable habit. It should become part of our lives and culture – Covid-19 or no Covid-19. This habit will prevent several other respiratory and gut infections. The recent evidence suggests that Covid-19 virus does not survive for long on any surface but usual cleaning of vegetables and fruits with running water is necessary. Q: Do we really have a shortage of vaccines or are people still hesitant to get the shot? A. India started on a journey of Atmanirbharta right from day one and the complete vaccination programme has been accomplished with indigenously manufactured vaccines. There is absolutely no shortage of vaccine. In fact, vaccine manufacturers have been allowed the export of vaccine now. Q: Are there any other challenges that we need to overcome to increase our vaccination rate? A: Last mile run in any vaccination programme requires extra effort – be it polio or measles or now Covid-19. Additional efforts like ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ are necessary to reach everyone to get both doses of the vaccine. Hesitancy is only part of the story. A large number of families and individuals are not able to avail the facility due to fear of loss of their daily wages. Availability is an issue for those staying in inaccessible areas as well. Q: Many were infected with coronavirus after taking two shots of the vaccine. Are there chances of contracting it even after the third dose? A: The Covid-19 vaccines, irrespective of any brand available anywhere in the world, do not completely prevent the risk of infection with the virus. Having said that the Covid-19 vaccines practically eliminate the risk of severe disease, need for hospitalisation and death. Third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is required in those with immunity problems and who may not mount adequate protection after the regular two-dose schedule. Q: Will a third dose or booster reduce the fatality rate further? A: The question is about the need and timing of boosters. Based on scientific evidence in India, we do not require boosters now. The individual and national priority is to get everyone two doses of the Covid-19 vaccines at the earliest and the people must continue to demonstrate discipline in the form of adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and avoiding social gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/keep-mask-on-to-avoid-resurgence-of-covid/articleshow/87745416.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||AUM for equity MF surges Rs 3,756cr in October||Ahmedabad: Propelled by sustained inflows into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), the assets under management (AUM) for equity-linked mutual funds (MFs) increased by Rs 3,656.4 crore in Gujarat. According to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), AUM for equity MFs touched Rs 1.35 lakh crore, continuing its rally in October, against Rs 1.31 lakh crore in September. However, the growth in AUM slowed last month as compared to September, when it grew by Rs 7,279 crore against Rs 1.24 lakh crore in August. Financial consultants attribute the slowing growth to increased profit-booking by investors for festival spending and savings. “With market indices touching new highs, several investors continued to profit-book their gains from mutual funds. This could have been for festive season spending or for future and long-term savings due to which growth in overall AUM during October was slow,” said Jayesh Vithalani, a financial consultant from Ahmedabad. The surge in AUM for equity MFs was largely due to increase in net asset value of prevailing investment in addition to sustained inflows into SIPs. “SIP inflows touched record-high across the country and the trend remained similar in Gujarat as well. Fresh investments also continued to pour from investors, thanks to a few new fund offers being launched by asset management companies from time to time,” Vithalani added. Financial consultants also said that several youngsters are becoming aware and opening demat accounts which is also propelling fresh inflows into equity-linked MFs. In October, the total AUM stood at Rs 2.58 lakh crore in Gujarat, which was marginally up by 0.54% against that in September. This was largely driven by equity-linked MFs. In fact, the AUM for gold exchange traded funds also grew by a significant 10.55% in October to touch Rs 307.37 crore. “On festive muhurats of Dussehra and Pushya Nakshatra, investors not just purchased physical gold in the form of coins and bars but also invested into gold ETFs. Price of gold also went marginally up during the month which led to an increase in the net asset value of investments,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aum-for-equity-mf-surges-rs-3756cr-in-october/articleshow/87745700.cms||Niyati Parikh

This prompted police to give him protection even as his identity was not revealed by the cops.  The complainant alleged that he too was converted and claimed in the complaint that he was lured with a good job and expenses to renovate his house. After conversion, he was taken to Surat where his Aadhar card was made with a new identity.  He further alleged that around 100 other people from the same village were converted by offering grocery, money and luring men for second marriage. The accused involved in the racket even arranged a trip to Mumbai for some families. He has alleged that some unidentified people threatened him with life when he was passing by some houses in the street of his village. MP Bhojani, in-charge deputy superintendent of police, Jambusar told TOI: "The person did not file any official complaint about threats but have provided him armed police protection. We have not arrested any accused still and the investigation is on."  "Further legal actions will be taken once we record statements of victim families. Police will also investigate the source foreign funds that were used to finance the racket. Some unidentified persons in the UK sent money to local persons to encourage conversions," said a senior official.

BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, while speaking in Mumbai said, “On Monday, our core group has finalised the names. We have also spoken with the central leadership. For the Kolhapur MLC constituency, Amal Mahadik’s name has been finalised and sent to the central leadership for an announcement to be made in the next two to three days after we finalise the candidates for other seats. The nominations have to be filed by November 23 and therefore, we have enough time for the final announcement by the central leadership." Patil also said that the campaigning has already been started by the local leaders. He said BJP has the upper hand in the elections. "The voting for the elections is secret and we are fighting all seats with all might," added Patil. Now, it is clear that Amal Mahadik will be a candidate against Congress's Satej Patil. Interestingly, Amal Mahadik was the one who defeated Satej Patil in the 2014 legislative assembly elections, which then left Satej Patil no choice but to contest the 2015 MLC election which he won against Amal's father and three times sitting MLC Mahadevrao Mahadik. In the 2019 assembly elections, Amal was defeated by Satej Patil's nephew Ruturaj Patil. Earlier, Shoumika Mahadik, wife of Amal Mahadik’s name was finalised, however, she declined due to unknown reasons. After the defeat in Gokul cooperative dairy, Mahadiks are politically marginalised. However, it is for sure, political rivalry between Satej Patil and Mahadiks will continue for some time now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bjp-picks-mahadik-for-kolhapur-mlc-election/articleshow/87743768.cms||---
---||Mumbai||How can Maharashtra intel be in dark about rallies: Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis||MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis asked on Tuesday, “How is it possible these rallies (in Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon) are spontaneous, and if there was planning, how is it that the government and police intelligence (department) are unaware? These rallies were carried out with support from Maha Vikas Aghadi government. This is a planned experiment. Shops owned by Hindus were burnt, and no leader from MVA spoke about it.”He alleged, “As they (MVA partners) don’t have answers to PM’s (work on) development, they are polarising minorities. A similar experiment was done at Bhima-Koregaon.” Continuing to draw a link between the alleged incidents in Tripura, Rahul Gandhi’s tweet and violence in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said on October 26, a rally was organised in Tripura in solidarity with Hindus attacked in Bangladesh. “There was no violence. But from October 28, posts started appearing on social media. Photos were posted of burning of a CPI(M) office, which was shown to be a masjid. Similarly, a fire in a refugee camp in Delhi was misrepresented. Similarly, pictures of a project in Pakistan were shown as those from Tripura,” he said. Fadnavis attacked Sena’s Sanjay Raut for alleging BJP had caused riots. “Nawab Malik was fully aware of the source of funding for the riots and as a cover-up alleged money went from so-and-so places,” he said. Fadnavis asked why police were not called in early. “There are seven companies of SRPF in Amravati. Initially they were given no orders and when the situation got out of control, police were attacked. It is similar to the Azad Maidan incident where police were injured. Not a single person has been arrested for injuring cops in Amravati,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-can-maharashtra-state-intel-be-in-dark-about-rallies-ex-cm/articleshow/87746730.cms||Clara Lewis

Bhallabh said on October 4, 2018, two former Union ministers of BJP and a senior lawyer submitted a complaint to the director CBI, citing massive corruption in the Rafale deal. Just a few days later (October 11), the government of Mauritius through its attorney general had supplied the documents to the CBI regarding alleged pay off. As a consequence, the Modi government on October 23 removed the CBI director Alok Verma in a midnight coup and appointed its protege M Nageshwar Rao as CBI chief. He said the UPA government negotiated Rafale aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526.10 crore per plane after an international tender for 126 planes. Modi government bought the same jet off the shelf (without tender) for Rs 1,670 crore per plane without transfer of technology. The difference in cost of 36 planes purchased by Centre is a whopping Rs 41,205 crore. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-was-busy-covering-up-rafale-deal-says-congress/articleshow/87746726.cms||---

Bhati, a Gurjar by caste, who was earlier with the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Congress, was in the thick of controversy around an IAS officer in the previous government.His video of how he got the said IAS officer suspended had gone viral. BJP workers, especially from west UP where Bhati has his influence, are reportedly unhappy over the development. Sources said a senior minister in the Yogi Adityanath government had been pushing for Bhati’s induction into the BJP for the last one year. Among others who may join the BJP, most probably on Wednesday, include CP Chand, son of former minister Late Markandey Chand from Gorakhpur, Ravi Shanker Singh, the cousin of Rajya Sabha member Neeraj Chandrashekhar. Sources said the BJP had started preparation for the election of local body MLCs, the election for which is likely anytime next year. When contacted, a senior BJP leader tried to downplay the joining of Bhati and said he was being brought into the party fold after proper screening and he did not have any case against him. Sources said Bhati’s induction was being done to pacify Gurjar voters who are unhappy after the controversy around the installation of the statue of Mihir Bhoj in Gautam Budh Nagar. Social media also remained abuzz after reports of Bhati’s possible induction into the BJP started doing rounds on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gurjar-leader-bhati-nine-others-likely-to-join-bjp/articleshow/87746129.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: CM Ashok Gehlot hints at cabinet rejig, Govind Singh Dotasra may be dropped||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday hinted that the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle would be held soon. Speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly formed executive by the Secretariat Employees Union, the chief minister jokingly said, “it seems the cabinet reshuffle has been held up due to the delay in the swearing-in of the executive. Now that with the swearing-in has taken place, the cabinet reshuffle also will be held soon.” It was the first time he was referring to the reshuffle. Similarly, Gehlot has indicated that education minister and state Congress party chief Govind Singh Dotasra may be divested of his ministerial post. After Dotasra's speech at the state-level teachers ward ceremony, the chief minister said the minister gave a speech as if it was his farewell speech. He added that, “Dotasra had requested the high command several times to stay on only one post. I feel that now Dotasara ji only wants to remain on the post of state president.” Gehlot on Tuesday also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of being involved in the fall of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and trying to do the same in Rajasthan. Gehlot made the allegation while referring to the political crisis over the stability of his government in 2020 after rebellion by his then deputy Sachin Pilot and said the Congress MLAs stayed in hotels for a long time but “the present government is in place only due to the blessings of the people”. "The Home Minister could not do anything,” said Gehlot, without naming Shah. “He had a lot of arrogance over Madhya Pradesh but the people of Rajasthan shattered his arrogance,” asserted Gehlot. “Is it a way to act in a democracy, bringing down governments?' he asked. He claimed that about one lakh government jobs have been given in Rajasthan and the process of giving about 80,000 jobs is going on." Expressing concern over the present political situation in the country, he said, “In which direction the country is going? Nobody knows. Today the Constitution and democracy are in danger. The situation is very serious. Every person will have to think," the chief minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-hints-at-cabinet-rejig-dotasra-may-be-dropped/articleshow/87746731.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vaccination count surges in Maharashtra again after a month’s low||PUNE: After almost a month of low vaccination rates since mid-October, inoculation has surged once again with the state administering the highest daily jabs on November 13,15 and 16. Official data showed day jabs crossed 7 lakh for the first time on Saturday and Monday since October 18. The state administered 6.6 lakh shots till Tuesday evening. Daily jabs in the past few days, barring Sunday (usually a lean day), have thus been highest in some time now. State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai said the current target was to complete all the first doses in Maharashtra by November-end. “Accordingly, a daily target of 10 lakh jabs is being kept in sight,” he said. Currently, the state is yet to cover nearly 24% of its 9.14 crore eligible population with first jabs. Dr Desai said, “In the last two days, Maharashtra’s daily jabs have increased, the average being higher than almost a month. The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme started last week and took some time to pick up momentum as the districts were still collating data on the left-out beneficiaries. We have covered 76% of the eligible population with first doses in the state, and aim to cover the rest by this month-end.” Daily average for shots administered in the state had plunged to 3-4 lakh since October third week, owing to the festive season and the huge gap (84 days) between the first and second doses of Covishield and fall in beneficiaries’ footfalls at the inoculation sites. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, however, said jabs administered in Pune in the last couple of days had not shown any major improvement, being nearly 35,000 on average. “However, conditions may improve in 4-5 days not only as the programme picks up but also because the November-end period is likely to see a huge number of beneficiaries becoming due for their second shots,” he said. An official from the district health department, Thane, said the district administered over 64,000 jabs on Monday, with the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme being on. “Surveys are on at village and city level to find first and second dose beneficiaries. We are organizing separate vaccination camps in areas that have a higher number of beneficiaries for the pending vax doses. The programme picked up pace since Monday, as the previous week was spent in collecting data and sensitizing people on the importance of vaccination,” the official said. District Health Officer, Thane, Dr Manish Renge told TOI, “As part of the sensitizing activities, we have been telling people about the role of the vaccine in reducing mortality. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-count-surges-in-state-again-after-a-months-low/articleshow/87747186.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||HC asks cops, waqf board to inspect Markaz||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed a joint inspection of Nizamuddin Markaz, where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held in March last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, by the city police and Delhi Waqf Board to ascertain its structural components and examine the issue of its re-opening. Justice Mukta Gupta, who was hearing the Waqf Board's plea to re-open the markaz which has remained shut since March 31 last year, said that each party can nominate five persons to conduct the inspection and sought a report on the same within 15 days. The order was passed after the senior counsel for the petitioner stated that under the latest Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines, all religious places are now open for visitors. The masjid is the only rare religious place under lock and key, the Board said. The judge observed that the property in question, popularly known as the Masjid Bangley Wali, comprised three areas place of worship, place of congregation, and residential area and therefore there could be no “sweeping order” concerning the entire compound. The court further stated that even under the latest DDMA order, there is still a cap on the number of participants in a congregation. Central government counsel Rajat Nair said that the entire property has to be “earmarked” and the DDMA order would apply to each zone accordingly. “Earmark the property so that one knows which area is for what purpose and DDMA guidelines will apply. Plain and simple, bifurcate. Place on record the map,” said the judge who went on to observe that the three components may be “interconnected” and making a distinction among them may ensure smooth functioning. “A joint inspection of the Delhi Police officers including the SHO concerned and the authorised representatives of the petitioner be carried out so as to demarcate the three areas,” the court ordered. The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-Uloom, and attached hostel -- continues to be locked up. It has further contended that even if the premises were part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of the enquiry process. Several FIRs were registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, the Foreigners Act, and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown last year. On the last occasion, the court had questioned the Centre as to how long it intended to keep the Nizamuddin Markaz locked, saying it can't be “kept forever”. “Some persons were in possession of the property. Due to the pandemic, an FIR was registered.. (and) you take possession as case property. It has to be handed over. It can't be that the property is kept forever (subject to court orders). What is your stand on the facts of the case? You tell me from whom you took it. How long will you keep it locked as case property?” the judge had said. In its affidavit affirmed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime, the Centre had told the court that it is “necessary and incumbent” to “preserve” the Markaz property as the investigation in the case registered for violation of the COVID-19 protocols has “cross borders implications and involves nation's diplomatic relations with other countries.” On April 15, the court had allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship. The matter would be heard next on January 12. PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-cops-waqf-board-to-inspect-markaz/articleshow/87746133.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Excise takes to social media for large bid on liquor licences||HYDERABAD: The excise department adopted a novel approach to get the targeted number of applications for the auction of liquor store licences. The government was expecting close to 50,000 applications for more than 2,620 liquor shops, but received only 6,600 applications till Monday. The department is aggressively pushing the bid details on social media and urging entrepreneurs to submit applications now that store running guidelines have been relaxed. The department is sending messages on phones informing the interested traders that the bank guarantee had been reduced by half and that there are increased margin benefits now. Previously, shop owners used to receive seven times of the stock and a 20% profit on deposits paid, but that has now been upped to 10 times. “This time, the goal is to receive 50,000 applications,” excise officials said. After the bid was announced, the most number of applications (3,750) were received on Monday, with the highest number of applications coming from Khammam district (1,064). Interestingly, despite having the most authorised liquor stores, Hyderabad received only 217 applications. The department is also informing entrepreneurs that the bank guarantee can be paid in instalments and that there is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted. Since the application fee is non-refundable, the department received more than Rs 1,000 crore in revenue from the 2019 auction. The application fee received from districts such as Khammam and Warangal was more than Rs 100 crore in the earlier auction. The excise department is also campaigning big this time, claiming that there would be greater margins for owners because permit rooms are authorised and they can sell liquor-related items. “Some of the staff and officials are calling us and telling us to apply for licences because it is profitable this time. WhatsApp groups are also being formed,” said an entrepreneur, who possessed a licence a few years ago, but later shut it down. For new applicants, the department has also simplified the application process by making it a single page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/excise-takes-to-social-media-for-large-bid-on-liquor-licences/articleshow/87745411.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Power rates up by 33 paisa/unit for 90 days due to rising coal costs||JAIPUR: The discoms in Rajasthan have raised electricity tariffs by 33 paisa for the next three months factoring in rise in purchase cost due to coal and other input costs. Electricity rates in Rajasthan are already one of the highest in the country, at over Rs 10 per unit. The hikes also comes at a time people have been burdened with highest auto fuel rates. But discoms are not entirely responsible for this. They pay the highest price among discoms in the country to buy power from power generation companies, at Rs 4.81 a unit. Similarly, in crisis times like the recent one involving coal shortage, they pay more to buy from exchanges. And there are legacy issues that contribute majorly for the high power tariffs. For example the interest cost of discoms adds Rs 1.34 per unit of power. TimesViewThere are many ways to cut power cost for the end consumer. Unfortunately, every time there is a rise in input cost, it is passed on to consumers. For example, discoms in the state have one of the highest transmission losses. There are other verticals where you can improve efficiency. Instead of burdening the public, the department should explore these options.In fact, sources in the energy department said there are three major natural disadvantages that the state suffers. It is far away from coal sources resulting in higher coal cost and has a bigger geography with vast transmission network that needs more investment and depreciation and the third is extreme weather pattern with peak demand moving between a wide range of (14,000- 9,500mw). Discoms need to pay a fixed charge to power generators even if they don’t buy some quantity of power when demand comes down. But the biggest of all these problems is the mismanagement of the department. He said the state has power plants that charge Rs 15 a unit (Anta Gas plant). Discoms pay Rs 10 per unit to Auraiya Gas power. Why the department is not taking a decision to exit from such costlier contracts. Similarly, there are costlier power purchase agreements with some units of NTPC. They have to be retired as well. Management of demand and supply of power seems to have gone for a toss. In coal purchase, Rajasthan is paying Rs 600 extra per tonne to Adani for a better quality coal. Questions have been questioned about the quality of coal. Selling fly ash from the power plants are not transparent as well, said sources. That could have generated revenues for state power generators and helped reduce power cost. Of course the discoms cannot escape from the responsibility of reducing high transmission and distribution losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-rates-up-by-33p/unit-for-90-days-due-to-rising-coal-costs/articleshow/87746740.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The decision of the government comes at a time when 400 room nights in hotel has been booked till February. In the past also, the department had decided to leas out the property but after the protest by the RTDC employees union, the move was stalled. Acoording to the union, the commercial tax will take the hotel on rent to station one of its departments for which the government has already sanctioned land. The union said that this a peak tourist season and already rooms have been booked. “Once the commercial department starts working here, then all the hotel’s materials like beds, TV, chairs and other hotel specific furniture and assets will have to auctioned. It will be very difficult to restart the hotel again,” said Tej Singh Rathore, president of the RTDC employees association. He said the hotel has improve its level of occupancy to over 25% and has been profitable in the recent times except for the Covid period. Weddings have also been booked, he said. In fact, the decision to give the hotel on rent to run an office has come as a surprise for the employees. “We don’t know when the decision was taken,” said another source. According sources, Teej has been performing better in terms of occupancy and profitability that other two RTDC properties in Jaipur – Gangaur and Swagatam. Of late, the state finance department has been trying to lease out the hotels, but has failed to take a decision. “The government has neither a concrete plan to sell the hotels nor allow them to run properly. At the same time it is trying to take a loan on RTDC having hotels as underlying asset to create the Rs 500 crore tourism development fund announced by the chief minister in the budget,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-give-teej-hotel-on-rent-union-livid/articleshow/87746742.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC polls: In 2017, electoral wards split, boundaries tweaked for political gain, says Mumbai mayor||MUMBAI: Electoral wards were split and boundaries changed in 2017 for political gain, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said on Tuesday, responding to BJP’s allegations of “mischief” in the redrawing of ward boundaries ahead of the BMC elections. Pednekar, who is also a Shiv Sena corporator, said that each constituency or electoral ward should ideally have a population of around 50,000 so that citizens’ issues can be resolved and development works can be carried out. In 2017, Maharashtra government was led by BJP with Shiv Sena as the junior partner, but the two parties fought the BMC polls independently. Last week, the state cabinet had decided to add nine more electoral wards to the existing 227, raising the number to 236. The opposition, BJP, had called the decision politically motivated, saying the ruling parties have taken the step to better their electoral chances. “I don’t want to reply to any allegations since this is an election process which is being carried out officially under the State Election Commission, but it’s a fact that several wards were broken into two or three parts, and boundaries were altered for political gain in 2017. As a result, in some wards the population is 65,000, while in some wards in the suburbs it is just 40,000,” Pednekar told TOI. Election data analyst Hitesh Jain pointed out that many wards in the island city have 60,000-plus population. “The average population per ward should be around 50,000, but several electoral wards like 194, 199 and 198 in central Mumbai have over 60,000 population. There should be a uniform population across all 236 wards. A 10% difference is fine, but in some wards the population is 20% above or below average,” he added. Pednekar concurred: “Only if the average number of voters in each electoral ward is 50,000 will work get done...else it becomes physically impossible for the corporator to cater to 65,000 people... there has to be a readjustment of boundaries to end this current disparity in population in wards.” According to civic officials, five wards may be added in the western suburbs and four in the eastern suburbs. There could, however, be a readjustment in ward boundaries and population in the island city, they added. The last time electoral wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. After the 2011 census came out, the BMC had redrawn electoral wards to account for a rise in population in the suburbs and a decline in the island city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mayor-in-2017-electoral-wards-split-boundaries-tweaked-for-political-gain-in-mumbai/articleshow/87745424.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Kallupatti in Madurai. The message on it speaks about a donation of land made to the temple, identified as Thiruvalavudayar Siva temple, to ensure that a lamp (sandhya deepam) was kept burning in it. The discovery of the stone was conveyed by panchayat president Vinayaga Moorthi to the coordinator of Pandiya Naadu Panpaatu Maiyam D Muneeswaran. The two of them along with with Meneeswaran’s team including Anandha Kumaran and Karupasamy inspected the inscription which they estimated belongs to the period of the first Maravarman Sundarapandiyan (1216-1239 AD). Muneeswaran said that a chieftain named Pothan had ruled the area which came under Sengudi Naadu on the banks of Kausika river and was under the control of Madhavela Nayakanur. The Siva temple, near Pothan Oorani, has a sanctum sanctorum tower and a mandap in the front but is badly damaged. The tower and the sculptures of the temple constructed using bricks are badly damaged. The sanctum sanctorum is square and faces east while the front mandap has sculptures of man and female in worshipping positions. The pillars have flowers and buds sculpted on them. The 3-foot-tall and 2-foot-wide stone has 8 lines inscribed on it. The message on the inscription was deciphered with the help of senior epigraphist Santhalingam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/13thc-stone-inscription-found-in-madurai/articleshow/87745408.cms||---

Justice G R Swaminathan directed the DSP to complete the investigation as expeditiously as possible and directed the police to ensure the protection of the petitioner, K Villayi, wife of the deceased priest Karuppaiya, and her family. In her petition, Villayi stated that her husband was working as a priest of the Aathi Marathal Munodiyan Kali temple in the village. On June 16, Karuppaiya was allegedly assaulted by a group of people belonging to the other community as he had touched their hand while handing over ‘vibuthi’ (holy ash). They had also abused him for not using the ‘archanai plate’ for handing over the vibuthi. Following this incident, her husband lodged a complaint with the police. Though an FIR was registered, no action was taken against them. Based on a false complaint, a counter case was registered against Karuppaiya. Alleging that her husband was murdered due to caste animosity and it was made to look like a suicide, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking CB-CID probe and also sought to perform a re-postmortem as several injuries were found in his body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dsp-to-probe-death-of-temple-priest/articleshow/87745406.cms||---

When mediapersons raised queries on whether people should take BJP’s fight against corruption seriously, considering it fought the 2014 elections on the issue of the irrigation scam by highlighting Ajit Pawar’s role and then in 2019 the short-lived Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government gave Ajit a clean chit in the same scam, Shelar said, “BJP has not given Ajit Pawar a clean chit in the irrigation scam.The issue is sub-judice and is also being investigated by CBI,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-didnt-give-ajit-pawar-clean-chit-in-dam-scam/articleshow/87746745.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MCA yet to de-flag DIN, but Mehadia re-elected as president of NVCC||Nagpur: The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) is yet to de-flag the director identification number (DIN) of Ashwin Prakash Mehadia, which is mandatory for becoming a director in any company registered under Companies Act 2013. However, Mehadia was still re-elected as president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), apex body of 13 lakh traders of the region. Mehadia was elected president of NVCC in the 77th annual general meeting of NVCC held a day ago. This is the third consecutive time he has been elected as president of NVCC. TOI had on October 30 highlighted that Mehadia was elected and worked as president of NVCC for two years despite even though his DIN was under disqualification. His DIN 0291003 was under disqualification from November 1, 2016, to October 31, 2021. The MCA website showed on Tuesday his DIN is still under disqualification. MCA has displayed a public notice on its website. The public notice reads, “MCA had flagged DINs of directors found to be disqualified under sub-section 2 (a) of section 164 of the Companies Act-2013 with effect from November 2016 for a period of five years. This is for the information of all the concerned that DINs eligible to be de-flagged on expiry of the period of disqualification are in the process of verification. Necessary action shall be taken shortly.” A company secretary said, “MCA website did not accept form for directorship of Mehadia on Tuesday for some technical reasons. He is yet to become director.” As per articles of associations of NVCC, the board of directors (BoD) shall manage the business of the company (NVCC). The BoD shall consist of president and nine more posts. Advocate Anil Kumar Mulchandani said, “Any member should first become director and then get elected as president as per articles of associations of NVCC. Mehadia is yet to become director as MCA will not accept the form till DIN is de-flagged. When he is not a director, electing him as president itself is illegal.” Asked for a comment, Mehadia sent to TOI the same public notice posted on MCA website. “I lodged a complaint with MCA on November 1 and received a reply. MCA also displayed similar notice on its website on November 10. Now, there is no issue regarding my DIN. Therefore, I am becoming director today itself,” he said. One of his advisors said, “Mehadia’s disqualification period has come to an end. Therefore, now he is eligible to become director. But for some technical reasons, the process of de-flagging is yet to be completed and also the process of becoming director is pending,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mca-yet-to-de-flag-din-but-mehadia-re-elected-as-president-of-nvcc/articleshow/87745343.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The autopsies on the bodies have been completed and the board will opine on how the murders were committed. Meanwhile, DCP (southeast) Esha Pandey said no sexual assault took place with the women.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University professors object to appointment process||LUCKNOW: After dean of faculty of arts, now dean of science faculty has raised objections over the way Lucknow University authorities are conducting the selection committee meetings for teachers’ promotion and fresh recruitment. LU, however, has called the objections baseless. Science dean Prof Brijendra Singh on Tuesday not only boycotted the meetings for promotion/recruitment in the physics department, but also shot off letters to the chancellor and University Grants Commission seeking their intervention. In his written objection to the registrar, Prof Singh said that for the meetings scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday, he was informed through a letter sent as a message on WhatsApp on Sunday evening, instead of being informed 15 days in advance as per rules. This, he said, was violation of university statutes, hence he could not attend the meeting and suggested rescheduling it with a proper time frame. On similar grounds, dean arts Prof Shashi Shukla had submitted a note of dissent in the meetings on Saturday and Sunday for promotions in five departments under arts faculty. Denying the allegations, LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “The deans of science and arts faculties were informed via letter and not on WhatsApp. They had taken part in guest faculty and contractual appointments held two weeks ago under a similar situation.” In fact, he added, 81 teachers were promoted about 10 months ago through selection committees and everyone in LU had then turned up at short notice. “The selections are being done as per university statues. The rule to inform 15 days in advance existed earlier, which has been amended following a government order dated October 15, 2019. This has no time-frame binding,” said. A selection committee is chaired by the vice-chancellor and comprises three experts, besides head and dean of the department and faculty concer ned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-profs-object-to-appointment-process/articleshow/87746142.cms||---

On April 2, 2004, the MLA during an election campaigning near Chandrayangutta allegedly made an inflammatory speech, prompting the Chandrayangutta police to take a suo-moto action and the then sub-inspector of police Ashok Kumar filed a complaint against Owaisi saying that he tried to instigate the public.

Demanding that the minister be sacked, Fernandes wondered why chief minister Pramod Sawant was quiet on the development. “We were hoping the chief minister would react to this, but there is no reaction from him. Why is he quiet? Is BJP being run by the narco-money?” Fernandes was speaking to reporters in the presence of former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira. Fernandes said that from the statement made by Paliencar on Sunday, it was clear that he is referring to ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo. “This is a serious allegation. We expect the chief minister to sack him immediately and conduct an inquiry,” he said. Fernandes also slammed his own Congress functionaries for considering admitting Lobo in the party. “I would like to ask our party functionaries if they are in talks with him. We strongly object to this. I will write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and others that this is what is happening. Some of our party members are not giving the high command a clear picture,” he said. He said he will also be writing to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to conduct an inquiry into the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-demands-probe-into-paliencars-pablo-escobar-allegations-against-bjp-min/articleshow/87746175.cms||---

He also sought a CBI inquiry into the entire episode of December 6, 2019. Krishnamachary, who is representing the relatives of the four encounter victims, Md Arif, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu, started the oral arguments on Tuesday after the completion of depositions by witnesses summoned by the panel. Accusing the cops of illegally arresting the four accused, the counsel for the families said that the cops had bypassed laid-down procedures and also suppressed the juvenile status of three of them. Questioning the police claim of keeping the accused in a safe house, he said: “The safe house story is false. The four were detained at Shadnagar PS.” The advocate dubbed the entire police story of the day of the alleged encounter as cooked up. He said that police claims of injuries, weapons being snatching by the accused, firing by police party in the direction of sound and recovery of Disha’s articles from the encounter site were all fake. Krishnamachary said that the police claim of accused throwing soil in their eyes was also bogus as the field was covered with grass. “The 10 police personnel involved in the encounter are eligible for prosecution and the entire thing was planned by VC Sajjanar. I request the inquiry commission to recommend criminal proceedings against the police persons involved in the incident, CBI inquiry and departmental action,” Krishnamachary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-encounter-story-is-fake-only-cbi-probe-can-unravel-dec-6-events/articleshow/87745450.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Pune||MSEDCL offers to waive up to Rs 4,000 crore dues for 12L farmers||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) is offering a waiver amounting to Rs4,000 crore on pending agricultural pump electricity bills to farmers in Western Maharashtra. According to a statement issued by the power distribution company, the farmers across western Maharashtra owe a total of Rs8,007 crore on current power bills. If these farmers clear their unpaid bills, they will be given a 50% rebate, leading to the rebate to amount to a total of Rs4,003 crore. Meanwhile, as many as 5.52 lakh farmers in Western Maharashtra have availed the benefit of the amnesty scheme to clear their power dues for agricultural pumps. These farmers have paid a total of Rs359 crore on current bills and Rs409 crore on past dues. According to the MSEDCL statement, farmers from the Baramati circle topped the bill repayment with 3.76 lakh settling their dues, while from the Kolhapur circle 1.42 lakh farmers have settled dues. The Pune circle has recorded a low response with only 32,683 farmers coming forward to settle their dues. TOI had earlier reported that 51,529 farmers in MSEDCL's Aurangabad zone have availed the benefit of the amnesty scheme. The defaulter farmers have together paid Rs 9.42 crores towards their current and outstanding dues. The MSEDCL said it is reeling under tremendous financial strain and appealed to the farmers to clear their pending power dues at the earliest. It warned that the power connections of those who fail to clear their bills on time will be snapped. As part of the new agriculture pump policy announced on December 18, 2020, interest and delayed payment charges on power dues towards agriculture pumps have been waived. Under the scheme, farmers can get a rebate of up to 66% on past dues depending on how they choose to clear the arrears. According to an MSEDCL statement, agricultural pump consumers paying arrears in the first year will be given a 50% discount on revised basic arrears, and interest and delay charges will be waived, which eventually means the consumers who clear all arrears in the first year will get a 66% discount. Those who pay arrears in two years will get a 30% rebate on revised principal arrears and those who pay arrears in three years will get a 20% discount. Of the amount paid under the agricultural police 2020, 33% will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in the gram panchayat areas of the consumers. Another 33% will be used for strengthening electrical infrastructure in the respective districts. The MSEDCL has also said that farmers can find out about their arrears towards agricultural pump dues by visiting the closest office or entering their consumer number on the power utility’s website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-offers-to-waive-up-to-rs-4000cr-dues-for-12l-farmers/articleshow/87745455.cms||---

The state transportation has a strength of 92,266 employees, of which 84,643 have still struck work, shows official data. By Tuesday afternoon, different MSRTC depots across Maharashtra could witness operations of 23 buses, which commuted total 282 passengers. It included 3 Shivshahi buses on Aurangabad-Pune route with occupancy of 131 passengers. MSRTC spokesperson said state transport minister Anil Parab has already expressed willingness to consider the proposal for offering salaries to the employees on a par with the employees of the state government. “As asked by the judiciary, a panel has already been formed to look into the demand for merger of MSRTC into the government. The employees are requested to join work for the benefit of passengers, who are facing huge inconvenience,” the spokesperson said. The MSRTC strike started amid partial response from Marathwada and Vidarbha since October 27. The agitation later evoked cent per cent response by end of Diwali, causing inconvenience to the public during the festive season. A leader of one of the workers unions said more MSRTC staff was expected to rejoin work in next few days. “The employees are agitating for a period of more than fortnight now. While the government is adopting time-killing tactic to end the strike, staffers are losing their patience. Some suspensions handed out during the strike has also caused some effect,” he said. Notably, MSRTC had incurred Rs 400 crore monthly losses throughout the pandemic, which further afflicted its already weak financial condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/8-msrtc-employees-back-at-work-in-state/articleshow/87743825.cms||---

A colony comprising about 30 houses, this pocket has, over time, come to become synonymous with the sewage issue."Even cab drivers identify the location as the place that has drain water running through its road; that's how grave the problem is.  The drain nearby is blocked with garbage and the excess water runs right onto the road outside our homes," said the citizen journalist who aired the grievance through the TOI app.  He added: "Over the last many years, we have voted to power representatives from various parties, reached out to multiple civic authorities, submitted representations with all concerned officials, but nothing has yielded any result." Locals in the area say that the stench from the sewage overflow has become unbearable and is even leading to health issues now. "Only recently, a neighbour died of dengue. Officials visited the area then and did some temporary work, but the problem resurfaced shortly after that. It is about time that the problem is fixed for good and residents are allowed to live a hygienic life," Sambodhi added. When TOI reached out to water board officials, they claimed that the L Shankar Nagar project has been cleared and will be rolled out soon. "We have already got a sanction of about Rs 15 lakh for the work. We will change the entire pipeline there very soon," said Ramana Reddy, general manager, HMWS&SB, Marredpally division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/marredpally-resident-fights-for-a-clean-road/articleshow/87745486.cms||---

---||Kolkata||For many second-year students, it’s the first taste of life on campus||Kolkata: Cooped up in their homes for almost two years, college for two batches of undergraduate students had so far meant lectures on smart devices. On Tuesday, those allowed in-person classes, stepped into their college and university campuses for the first time, sat in real classrooms and met their classmates they had only seen online. Rohit Roy, a first-year post-graduate geography student at Presidency University, who had lost both his legs to polio, did not want to wait til hostel accommodation to visit the campus. On the first day of reopening, his mother, Reba, steered him into the campus in his wheelchair for his practical classes. The mother and son, residents of Nabadwip, took a train and then a bus to the university. “He has applied for hostel. We wanted to waited till he got one, but he was so eager to visit the university that I had to bring him,” said Reba. At another end of the Presidency campus, Tisha Haldar, a second-year sociology student, was seen chatting with her classmate, Ankita Sarkar. Though it was their first visit to the university, the two had bonded in online classes. Like all their classmates, the two were elated when told their semester could go in for in-person classes. They did not even dither over whether to go or not. “This is my first day on the campus. Today, I visited to see Presidency and feel the legacy of the building. I have visited all the classrooms and every corner of the campus,” said Tisha. Her friend, Ankita, said, “We have been attending online classes for more than a year. We have been communicating over phone and social media but today, we met each other. I’m super excited.” The curiosity of how her college looked like could not keep Vidyasagar College first-year student, Piyali Dey, away though she was not scheduled to visit. “We’ve not been instructed to come to the campus but I wanted to have a look at the college building from outside,” she said. It was also the first day for Manisha Dutta, a zoology third-semester student at Scottish Church College. After her practical classes, she said, “Finally, I was able to touch the laboratory instruments and look down the microscope. I am so excited that I can’t explain in words.” Gargi Naskar, a Bengali first-year PG student at Bethune College, was in two minds initially. She was torn between her urge to visit the campus and the fear of the novel coronavirus and at the end, “college life” won. “I am elated to see the campus and meet new friends. I have taken admission to post-graduation. However, I am a little anxious because I have got only one dose of the Covid vaccine.” Swapna Roy stood outside Bethune College as her daughter stepped into the college for the first time. “Her excitement also rubbed off on me. But I wanted to be very cautious, so accompanied her the first day,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-many-second-year-students-its-the-first-taste-of-life-on-campus/articleshow/87745477.cms||---

The BJP government has jeopardised national security, the interests of the Indian Air Force and caused loss worth thousands of crores of rupees,” alleged Pawan Khera at a media conference in Hyderabad. Despite the fact that two former union ministers submitted documents to the CBI revealing corruption in the Rafale aircraft deal, the Modi-government has remained silent on it for the past three years, he alleged. The AICC leader demanded an independent investigation to bring out the truth. “While the previous UPA government had negotiated the price of a Rafale fighter aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526 crore through a tender, the Modi-government purchased the same without a tender and without a clause for transfer of technology for Rs 1,670 crore. This has led India paying up an additional Rs 41,205 crore towards purchase of 36 fighter aircraft,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pm-scared-of-ordering-probe-into-corruption-charges-in-rafale-deal/articleshow/87746173.cms||---

Last year, the Park Street Carnival was held with 50% seating capacity but food stalls were not allowed inside Allen Park. This year’s carnival is still in the works. The first meeting has happened but choirs and programmes are yet to be lined up. “There will be music but celebrations might have to be low key if the HC orders so. Crowding will definitely not be allowed,” said Fr Dominic Gomes, vicar-general of the Archdiocese of Kolkata, a key member of the Carnival planning committee. Last year. midnight mass did not happen and mass had to be completed by 8pm at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary of the Roman Catholic Church. “The CM had attended it.

After holding talks, the strike has been put on hold for a month. While several patients had to return without consultation even after taking an appointment weeks in advance, the university claimed no surgeries were affected and patients were taken care of in the OPD. After the day-long strike, the employees and KGMU administration held a meeting on Tuesday evening following which the employees decided to hold off their protest for the next one month based on assurances made on the day. KGMU employees, under the leadership of their association president Pradeep Gangwar, have been demanding pay scales at par with their counterparts in SGPGI. In a letter by the directorate of medical education (DGME) to KGMU registrar on the day it was conveyed that cadre restructure of KGMU employees is in process at the government level. “Against the university’s list of 42 cadres, government order has been received for two cadres. The status of restructuring 14 other cadres is in the final stages which will be completed in the next one month. The process to expedite decisions on the remaining cadres is also being tried,” the DGME’s letter read. The day’s protest became a huge problem for several patients who had come to KGMU from far and wide, many of whom had to return without getting any consultation. Jitendra Pratap Singh, who came from Rae Bareli to get a consultation in the neurology department OPD, said, “I made an appointment two weeks ago. Now I am being told that OPD is not functional. I am at a crossroad now not knowing what to do,” he rued. Similarly, Keshav Chandra from Gorakhpur said, “I had to wait for three hours to get my registration done to consult with doctors, but there was nobody at the counter to start the process. I had traveled with great difficulty on Tuesday and had to return without any respite with an aggravated abdominal pain. No one heard my requests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-strike-hits-patient-care-many-forced-to-return/articleshow/87746187.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA govt anti-Hindu, backs crime, criminals, graft, says BJP||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government is “anti-Hindu and against ‘Maharashtra dharma,’” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar in his resolution on criminalisation of politics in the state at the BJP’s state executive committee meeting held in Dadar on Tuesday. “Sharjeel Usmani receives red-carpet treatment while charges levelled against Mehek Prabhu for raising boards reading ‘Azad Kashmir’ are withdrawn,” he said, adding people are banned from celebrating festivals like Dahi Handi and Ganeshotsav and ‘varkaris’ are stopped from going to Pandharpur. “Things concerning Ram Mandir and its subscription are being ridiculed. Hence we believe that Hindus are not safe in Maharashtra, and neither is Maharashtra dharma.” The resolution was passed along with that on the political situation in the state and another appalauding PM Modi. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil called for a ban on Raza Academy for being the “mastermind” behind Friday’s riots in Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon. “Following rumours of an incident which never happened in Tripura, riots took place in Malegaon, Amravati and Nanded in which mobs took to the streets and attacked the police. Following this, spontaneous reactions emerged from Hindus, for which BJP was accused,” he said. BJP state in-charge and national general secretary C T Ravi said Hindus were being persecuted in the land of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray under the MVA government. “The ruling party has left Hindutva and has become a ‘parivar’ party. They are working for the development of their families at the cost of Maharashtra,” he said. Terming Uddhav Thackeray as “a part-time CM,” Ravi demanded the government dissolve the assembly and hold elections. “BJP will emerge victorious,” he said. Former finance minister Sudhir Mungatiwar moved the resolution on the current political situation in the state, highlighting “the increase in incidents of extortion, rape, payment for transfers/posts, corruption and support to drugs.” The committee also approved the party’s support to the strike by state transport workers and their demands. The resolution on criminalisation of politics highlighted the state government’s “support initially to crimes and later criminals followed by terrorism, separatists and now anarchists.” Citing an instance of support to crime and criminals, the resolution highlighted the attack on a police personnel in Amravati, the accused person’s conviction and the government’s refusal to demand his resignation from the cabinet. Shelar said complainants, witnesses, officers are unsafe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-govt-anti-hindu-backs-crime-criminals-graft-in-mumbai-bjp/articleshow/87746768.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: VAT on petrol cut by Rs 4, diesel Rs 5 from today||JAIPUR: In a major relief for citizens reeling under inflation, the state cabinet which met on Tuesday decided to reduce VAT by Rs 4 per litre on petrol and Rs 5 on diesel. The decision will come into effect on Wednesday and cost the state exchequer Rs 3,500 crore. Effectively, VAT on petrol will decline by 4.96% to 31.04% from 36% and on diesel the state tax will drop by 6.7% to 19.30% from 26%. For consumers, petrol prices will come down from Rs 111.10 a litre to 107.10 and diesel price will fall to Rs 90.71 from Rs 95.71 a litre as per Tuesday's prices. Despite a possible loss of Rs 1,800 crore to the state's revenue due to the reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel by the central government, the cabinet took this decision keeping public interest in mind, said a government statement. Due to the continuous increase in prices of petrol and diesel by petroleum companies, the relief given by the central and state governments to the common man has been diminishing, the meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, noted. The central government had consistently reduced the basic excise duty on auto fuels from 2016 as well as its share from the divisible pool shared with states. Due to this, the share of the states has come down. The special and additional excise duty has, meanwhile, been increased continuously. But the states do not get any share of this. This move by the Centre is against the spirit of financial federalism, said the meeting. Following the Covid lockdown on May 6, 2020, the central government had increased the excise duty on petrol by Rs 10/L and diesel by Rs 13. This year also the price of petrol has increased by about Rs 27 and diesel by about Rs 25. The Centre recently announced a relief on petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 10 by reducing excise duty. This reduction in excise duty by the Centre is insufficient and the public will not get permanent relief from it, the meeting said. It noted that the excise duty increased by the Centre during the Covid period has been reduced significantly, while the VAT increased by the state government has almost come back to the pre-corona period. It was also informed that VAT on petrol and diesel accounts for more than 22% of the state's total tax revenue. Due to the global pandemic, there has been a huge reduction in the revenue of the state by Rs 20,000 crore till the month of October in the current financial year. The non reimbursement of Rs 5,963 crore by the Centre to Rajasthan has also resulted in the huge revenue deficit. The cabinet said that in order to give real relief to the common folk, it was necessary that the central government should reduce the additional excise duty and basic excise duty going to the central pool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/vat-on-petrol-cut-by-rs-4diesel-rs-5-from-today/articleshow/87753467.cms||---

---||Kolkata||The second coming: Seniors set foot on college ground after counting time for 20 months||Kolkata: Saptarshi Roy had just started his third-semester classes in 2020 when the novel coronavirus pandemic broke out and his college was shut down. His professors had assured of reopening shortly but the possibility seemed to grow fainter as Covid cases grew and stricter restrictions were imposed. When the second wave struck, Saptarshi gave up all hopes of returning to the campus ever as he was also nearing the end of his college life. On Tuesday, it seemed too good to be true when he saw the familiar faces of his professors and met his friends after the Covid hiatus. TimesViewBoth schools and colleges may need to tweak a few things after the first day's experience. There would have been a little bit of chaos on campuses — plus a lot of euphoria and some amount of wariness — but the focus must be on Covid-safety measures so that there is no spike. Bringing back those who have not yet been able to return to campus should be the ultimate aim.Priyanka Dastidar, a sixth-semester student, had reconciled to the fact that she might graduate without going back to her college again. During their chats online, Priyanka and her friends would often make plans of meeting outside the campus, given the bleak chances of institutes reopening amid the pandemic. It was a huge surprise when she received the first message of the possibility of campuses reopening. Shortly, she received a series of reopening messages, rekindling her hope of returning to the campus. Saptarshi and Priyanka are not alone. Several thousands of students, who had assumed that they would finish their college without being able to go back, were thrilled to meet their professors and friends again on Tuesday. Bhaswar Haldar, a history honours student at Presidency University, was in his last UG semester when campuses shut down. “Now, I have reached the last year of PG. I was certain I would have to complete my PG online because there was no sign of educational institutes reopening. I have only a few months left but something is better than nothing,” Bhswar said. His apprehension was not unfounded as some students had to make do with online farewells. Even now, several institutes have not called junior students to the campus. Those in senior classes and those with lab-based subjects have been given the priority. Some may not call first- and second-semesters to the campus before January. “When our seniors passed out, we thought even we would not be able to return to college. Thankfully, colleges have reopened. But we will have to be careful as any spike in Covid cases may lead to another closure,” said Neha Singh, a Jaipuria college student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-second-coming-seniors-set-foot-on-college-ground-after-counting-time-for-20-months/articleshow/87745490.cms||Zeeshan Javed

This was the second consecutive day when the city accounted for half of the state’s cases. In three days, the number of new cases reported in the city reported has increased steadily from 10 to 18, nearly doubling, while its share in the state’s cases rose from 27% to 51%. With two cases registered in Ahmedabad district – the first in over a month – active cases in Ahmedabad district reached 100 for the first time in the past four months. The last time the district touched the figure was in the beginning of July. To put the figure into perspective, the state has 253 active cases. It means that of every 10 Covid-19 active cases in Gujarat, four are in Ahmedabad. Three active patients are on ventilators. On the positive side, on Tuesday the state administered the second vaccine dose to 4.5 lakh persons, with the number of persons fully vaccinated in the state crossing 3 crore. Of the 4.93 crore eligible population of the state, 60% is fully vaccinated, whereas 91% have got at least one vaccine dose. On Tuesday, the state vaccinated 5 lakh persons. Apart from 18 cases in Ahmedabad, there were four each in Vadodara and Rajkot cities, three in Surat city, two each in Ahmedabad and Valsad districts, and one each in Kutch and Navsari districts. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of tge Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the city’s private hospitals currently have only one patient admitted. Moreover, at Civil Hospital, there’s just one active patient and one patient with suspected symptoms. “It means that the majority of active patients are being treated at home and don’t need hospitalization. We are keeping a close eye on the trend,” said Dr Gadhvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-2nd-day-half-of-guj-cases-in-city/articleshow/87745505.cms||---

Though I come from a family of non-musicians, I have always been a music lover. I grew up listening to soft music along with classical. I have even pursued classes till my 10th grade. But as time passed by and other responsibilities took priority over this passion, this passion for music took a back seat. Somewhere deep down in my heart, though, the disappointment for not being able to devote time for the sacred art always haunted me. With the pandemic things have changed as people have started working from home, are able to take up new hobbies, revisit old hobbies etc. And that’s true for me as well. I have joined my music classes back over the weekend and I cannot express how happy I am. What makes me happier is that my aptitude has been inherited by my elder son and he too has started taking music classes and being appreciated by friends and family. I am now hoping that this continuity will last. (The writer is an IT company employee) Poetry marathon sharpened my pen By Bhanu Sree Since I was a student of literature, poetry has been on my mind since my college days. But I never really got the opportunity to pursue it with all sincerity. In the chronicles of time, life had become a river meandering its way with its flow. However, the recent pandemic abruptly stilled life and brought everything to a grinding halt. Suddenly there came a huge lull in my otherwise busy routine. Initially it felt a little insane as to what to do with the time in abundance at hand. There was nowhere to go and nothing much to do. Eat, read and sleep is all I could do. At first, I felt if eating is all I can do then let me whip out some new dishes. So, I turned to YouTube and it became my teacher and the kitchen my experimental lab. From cakes to Dalgona coffee, exotic starters to haleem, I tried my hand at everything. Some were hits and some very flops. The hits found their way to my social network spaces and the flops went to the dustbin along with frowns from my husband and kids. However, soon it felt tiring and not satisfying enough. This was when I casually penned a poem titled 'Being Me', a poem on me in specific and women in general. I casually shared it with my friend who appreciated it and instantly invited me to join her poetry club. This was enough to bring out the poet in me and it soon turned into a passion. So much so that I even took part in the poetry marathon penning a poem for eight continuous days. I now have 100 poems to my credit on different subjects like art, nature, human emotions, learning disability, child abuse, child labour, beggary etc. I feel writing itself is a beautiful medium to express your inner self and poetry is even more beautiful and creative too. It contributes to self-awareness and has a therapeutic effect. Presently, even as life has got back to normal again, I keep penning poems to destress myself.

---||Jaipur||India vs NZ: Captain & hitman Rohit Sharma rules box office as international action returns to Jaipur's Sawai Mansingh stadium||JAIPUR: No Virat, no problem. What’s driving fans crazy is ‘Hitman’s’ debut in Jaipur on Wednesday as the full-time T20I India captain. The first match of the India-New Zealand series is a sold out show, and it is Rohit Sharma ruling the box office at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium. Rested for the T20 series, Virat Kohli, the first Asian celebrity to reach 150 million followers on Instagram, may have several million followers more than Rohit, but the latter is a blockbuster player with more power to attract crowds into the stadium, fans feel. “I have bought the tickets to watch Rohit. Look at his range of shots and daring game, I want to see that live at the stadium. But what makes the occasion more special is that we will get to see him leading the side wearing the India jersey as a full-time skipper,” said Sarthak, a Class XI student. Standing next to him in the queue for the tickets, Sambhav Sharma was quick to react with, “of course Rohit for me as well”. “In T20s who else? I hope I will get to see an entertaining innings from the new captain,” he added. The last time the dashing India opener played here in India colours was in 2013. He lit up the stage with an unbeaten 141 off 123 balls in an ODI match against Australia. This piece of stats adds up to the build up. The small merchandise vendor outside the stadium confirms that it is Rohit’s jersey that has maximum demand. “Everyone asks for the captain’s t-shirt. Since other players are not in as much demand, I got more Rohit jerseys today to make sure I don’t run out of stock,” said Promod Jat. The fact that an international match is being played here after eight years has also driven the ticket sales up. “It is huge for us that we finally get to see an international game in Jaipur. It is a great stadium where MS Dhoni has scored 183. I hope more matches come here and we get to witness such special knocks,” said Jaipur resident Anuraj S Dhankar. Cricket enthusiasts and those from the fraternity feel that in the IPL they can afford to miss one match and watch another, but an international match is a rare thing that makes it a grand event. Cricket commentator Devender Kumar, who has closely observed state cricket over a decade, feels international action after long years is a sign of good things to follow in future. “The return of international cricket to Jaipur is great news for cricket enthusiasts and players alike after so many years of political infighting. Considering the ground conditions and practice facilities, it's a matter of time before SMS Stadium in Jaipur is granted Test status,” he said. Clearly, the excitement is everywhere!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/captain-hitman-rohit-rules-box-officeas-intl-action-returns-to-sms-stadium/articleshow/87746192.cms||Mandakini Shalya

The clerics have asked for an FIR to be lodged against Rizvi for derogatory remarks and activities against Islam, the Quran and Prophet Mohammad. Rizvi has recently authored a book on the Prophet which has brought the ire of the clergy and members of the Muslim community. Several protests have been held and statements have been made against Rizvi across the state and country for allegedly fabricating stories about the Prophet, spewing insults and making unacceptable remarks against the Islamic personalities. Jawad also sought a ban on the publication of Rizvi’s book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/clerics-submit-plaint-against-waseem-rizvi/articleshow/87746194.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Eggs, non-veg off street menu despite ‘clarification’||AHMEDABAD: One day after the civic body’s town planning committee announced a “massive drive” against non-vegetarian street food in Ahmedabad, the BJP leadership on Tuesday clarified that the drive should not be “misconstrued” as targeting “non-vegeterian food” but it would be against those encroaching on footpaths and constricting thoroughfares. Despite the assurances, many food carts selling egg and meat items remained off the streets in Ahmedabad to avoid confrontations. At places like Rambaug Crossroads, LG Corner, and Nathalal Jhagada Bridge, five illegal carts were removed while 12 carts were removed from Anandnagar Road, Corporate Road, Jodhpur, Isckon Circle and from near YMCA Club in the South West Zone by estate department teams. Some 30 carts were removed from Ashram Road. While in some places, egg vending carts at Law Garden kept doing business as they have contracted the space from the AMC itself. The AMC’s estate department in its press release did not differentiate between vegetarian and non-vegetarian. When told that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was closing non-vegetarian eateries, Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil said, “They (AMC) must not have been removed over the issue of veg or non veg. There must be some other reason. They must be operating from footpaths and must have been asked to find another place.” Paatil clarified after CM Bhupendra Patel on Monday evening said at a function in Anand, “People can eat vegetarian or non-vegetarian food. The state government has no objection whatsoever in this matter.” However, senior AMC officials were skeptical about the drive as many vendors were being enrolled under the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Yojana for providing affordable loans of Rs 10,000 to street vendors to re-start their businesses that had been adversely affected due to the lockdown. “We faced problems as many of the vendors we had enrolled were evicted. This is creating confusion. Also many vendors are eligible under the Street Vendors Act. There were many conflicting issues in the whole drive itself. The premise that such food carts can be removed from near schools and colleges did not stand as most non-vegetarian joints operate in the evenings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eggs-non-veg-off-street-menu-despite-clarification/articleshow/87745509.cms||---

---||Delhi||Make it large: Delhi restaurants cheer new policy||NEW DELHI: As the new excise policy comes into effect, every restaurant messaging group is abuzz with talk about the ease of getting liquor licence, permissions to use open areas in eateries, regularised licence fees based on area rather than seats, serving alcohol in bottle at the table and operating till 3am and eventually reducing drinking age to 21 years. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has held multiple meetings with various authorities about the industry's concerns, and its past and incumbent president have termed the new policy as “pathbreaking”. With the new policy having a clause reducing the number of dry days as in Haryana, Punjab and UP, the city’s restaurants can serve alcohol after 5pm even on Republic Day and Independence Day. Permission to transfer the liquor licence to another company on the same premises and allowing 5-star hotels to serve alcohol all 24 hours have also been welcomed. With the new policy coming into effect from Wednesday, NRAI hosted a virtual session with restaurateurs to inform them of what to expect when migrating to the new excise regime. Restaurateur Rahul Singh of Beer Café said the new policy would mean more liquor retailers spread evenly across the city rather than being clustered in some pockets. He said the policy also inspired the opening of premium liquor stores that would bring in more brands to the city. Singh added that with no compulsion on restaurants to buy from select people or in a particular quantity, eateries can now buy from local liquor vendors — even a single bottle if needed rather than in bulk as earlier. This, he said, would enable smaller establishments to improve their offerings. Getting an excise licence has also become easier and quicker. "With its huge population, Delhi only has 516 licensed places serving alcohol,” said Singh. “Under the new policy, within a year the city can have over 2,000.” Restaurateurs were of the view that proper implementation of the new policy would lead to bars staying open till late and more people drinking at safe and licensed spots. Bar owners also rejoiced at having nothing more to do with a daily licence to host events in the open with a flat annual fee now. However, many restaurateurs and bar owners have faced problems in registering for licences and getting new challans issued online. Many other things also remain unclarified, such when the date from when they can remain open till 3am. They also are unsure if they can procure liquor from anywhere in the city or whether it has to be from a seller in their particular zone. Also, with only 250-odd new shops of the newly licensed 850 opening initially, availability of liquor would be hit across the city. A restaurateur noted too that the new tax regime will cause the prices on the menu to rise. Khan Market restaurateurs who did not have fire-safe certification and for which some of them were involved in litigation, weren’t able to procure new licences. They hope for clarification on the issue from the authorities at the earliest. One lingering concern was about the reduction of drinking age to 21. The matter is sub-judice. Since only provisional licences are being issued right now, with the final dependent on site inspections by officials, most business owners desired clear timelines rather than be at the mercy of officials during the festive season. Sanjeev Goyal of Essex Farms has been in touch with various departments and will update fellow restaurateurs on the legalities and developments to aid them transition to new policy with ease. Both Singh and Goyal said disruptions were normal during policy changes and said things were moving very quickly. Licences were being quickly issued and almost 150 brands were already registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/make-it-large-restaurants-cheer-new-policy/articleshow/87746237.cms||Amin Ali

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad has issued a yellow warning for many parts of Telangana, including Hyderabad, till November 19 as rainfall activity is expected to continue. Under the influence of a low pressure area over south-east Bay of Bengal and adjoining parts of north Andaman sea, the city is likely to witness light to moderate rains over the next two days. Rainfall activity commenced in eastern and southern suburbs of Hyderabad following an overcast day. Areas such as LB Nagar, Malakpet, Hayathnagar, Vanasthalipuram, Saroornagar, Dilsukhnagar, Balapur among others received light showers. Meteorologists predict that active north-east monsoon conditions will prevail over south India, triggering thunderstorms in many parts of Telangana. “A trough is extending from the low-pressure area over east central Arabian Sea to north Odisha across Karnataka Rayalaseema and Telangana. Light to moderate rain may occur over Lakshadweep, remaining parts of Telangana, south Konkan and Goa and Madhya Maharashtra,” stated a weather report issued by Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency. IMD, Hyderabad predicts that the onset of winter is still a few days away as more weather systems are likely to form in the Bay of Bengal. “The onset of winter over Telangana may only occur by the first week of December. For the next few days, mercury levels are expected to be normal or above normal. The temperature will only drop once the northerly winds from Himalayas start penetrating into Telangana,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, IMD, Hyderabad.

The AQI, which was in the ‘moderate’ category ever since the south-west monsoon weakened, is now at ‘satisfactory.’ AQI levels between 0-50 are categorised as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 as poor, 301-400 as very poor, and 401-500 is categorised as severe. According to figures from the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, as of November 12, AQI at Bolarum was 138, University of Hyderabad was 121, ICRISAT was 137, Pashmylaram was 144, Sanathnagar was 182 and Zoo Park was 156. The AQI has now improved to 40 at Bolarum, 44 at University of Hyderabad, 34 at ICRISAT, 76 at Pashmylaram, 32 at Sanathnagar and 79 at Zoo Park. While other cities such as Delhi NCR, Bhopal, Indore, Jaipur, Lucknow are reeling due to ‘severe’ AQI levels, Hyderabad is breathing relatively easy as a result of the change in weather conditions. “Movement of winds is dispersing the pollutants in the air over the city. Therefore, the pollution levels have dropped over the past few days. Once the movement of the winds stops or slows down, the AQI level may climb back to moderate category,” said an official from TSPCB. The air quality index (AQI) has now improved to 40 at Bolarum, 44 at University of Hyderabad, 34 at ICRISAT, 76 at Pashmylaram, 32 at Sanathnagar and 79 at Zoo Park||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-aqi-improves-following-rain-spell/articleshow/87745310.cms||---

It will now be drones that will be taking up the job of inspecting these towers and lines. The Telangana government on Tuesday said the emerging technologies wing of its ITE&C department along with Hyderabad-based startup Centillion Networks has concluded the pilot of an aerial survey of EHT transmission towers & lines using drones and artificial intelligence (AI). In the pilot project, that commenced in August 2020, Centillion Networks’ drones inspected, monitored and patrolled EHT transmission towers, lines, and substations with a 4K resolution camera and AI image recognition system in around 20 minutes. “It is estimated that automated inspections using drones can reduce the man-hours and costs by approximately 50%, in addition to reducing the potential life risk that is posed by manual inspection of high-tension lines,” the state government said, adding that the project is expected to be scaled up soon. Commenting on the development, Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary for IT and industries said, “Telangana is one of the leading states in leveraging drones across various use-cases, and the inspection of towers for TS-TRANSCO is one of the most innovative of them. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-drones-to-survey-high-tension-lines-in-t/articleshow/87745337.cms||---

Even knee-replacement surgery on both legs has not slowed down the spunky septuagenarian. Pande, who is from Malkajgiri, won four medals for Telangana at the first National Veterans Sports & Games Championship held at Nasik, Maharashtra, from November 11-14. He won gold in 30 km cycling and bronze medals in 10 km run, five km run and five km walk. The event had participants from 17 states. A retired employee of the South Central Railways (SCR), Pande’s mantra to stay healthy is simple: Be active. “From very early in life, I was told that those who stay active steer clear of diseases. I have two meals a day and ensure that I keep myself active by not only going for my regular walks but by also engaging myself in household chores,” said Pande. It hasn’t been an easy path to the podium for the gritty senior citizen. In 2016, he had knee replacement surgeries on both legs and was told that his running days were over. Today, the man not only runs but also cycles and walks for long distances. “Since childhood, I have cycled to school, college and even office. I would travel long distances without any hindrance. Cycling was always an integral part of my life. Even today, I cycle every weekend for about 10-20 km,” said Pande, who is also a member of cycling groups in the city. Pande said that while in SCR he was into weight-lifting too. After his medal haul, Pande has no intention of hanging up his boots as yet. Next on his target is the National Master Athletic Association meet in Varanasi on November 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gritty-75-yr-old-cycles-to-gold-after-knee-surgeries/articleshow/87745342.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Chandigarh||‘In reopening, BJP building confidence among Sikhs’||Jalandhar: The reopening of Kartarpur corridor appears to be a confidence-building measure by the central government to reach out to Sikhs, as the community has been sore over the corridor’s closure and the ongoing farm movement has added to the bitterness. For some time, BJP has been projecting the Prime Minister’s relationship with Sikhs and the steps he had taken for the government, but these were not cutting much ice with Sikhs as the corridor was closed even as everything else had already been opened and big political gatherings had already been taking place. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah want that relations between their government and the Sikhs as a community should remain good, and the irritants causing bitterness should be removed. In our meetings, especially with Shah, we have been getting the impression that he and PM were very clear that in what directions their relations with Sikhs should go,” said a senior BJP leader from Punjab. Another BJP leader said a major part of the community was still unhappy with the BJP because of the farm laws and the step to reopen the corridor might not result in any electoral dividends for it in Punjab. “But this would help reduce the bitterness, even if they (Sikhs) do not warm up to the party in these elections,” said the leader. The BJP leader added that though farmers from all communities and from Haryana and western UP had also been participating in the farm movement, Sikh community had contributed heavily to the movement. “The agitation close to completing a year and Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which four Sikh farmers, along with a local journalist, were mowed down by a convoy belonging to the son of a Union minister of BJP had increased the bitterness. Opening corridor was a genuine demand and it can also be a first step towards removing at least one irritant,” the BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-reopening-bjp-building-confidence-among-sikhs/articleshow/87746217.cms||IP Singh

Patel’s whirldwind tour began from Godhra followed by Savli, Lunawada and Vadodara and also addressed four gatherings of party workers in the region on the day. At all places, he addressed sizeable gatherings in the form of ‘Sneh Milan’ events for the Gujarati new year. With such event on a mass scale being an exception, most believe that the BJP is in the election mode already. In his speeches, Patel said that the party workers should aim at winning all 182 seats. “We should look at it with positivity. We do not want to defeat someone, we should aim for winning,” Patel said, adding that the workers had worked hard during the Covid-19 pandemic and remained in the midst of people. “The result of your hard work was seen in local body polls,” he said. Speaking in Vadodara, Patel said that he received such a welcome for the first time after becoming the CM. He said that following the event he had a bigger responsibility towards the city. Patel said that if plans of works in the city were brought to him, he will take them up. “We will make arrangements for such work in the budget too,” said Patel. In Godhra, Patel assured that he would look into the issues of irrigation in the district. Godhra MLA C K Raulji had raised the issue in his speech. He had pointed out that farmers in Panchmahal were able to take only one crop a year. Similarly, Patel promised to look into the need of a dairy cooperative, a industrial estate and railways in Mahisagar district during his speech in Lunawada. The gatherings, however, also sparked resistance. Activist Shwejal Vyas from Vadodara had on Monday threatened to file a suit if Covid guidelines were violated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aim-to-win-all-182-seats-cm-tells-workers/articleshow/87745002.cms||---

Paytm was also told pay Rs 1,000 as costs to the complainant. Vivek Dixit’s ordeal began after he had added Rs 6,865 into his Paytm account on May 8 and May 10, 2018, as payment for an online purchase. Dixit said he initiated the return process as he was not happy with the product and the online firm confirmed that Rs 6,865 was credited back. With no sign of the amount in his wallet, Dixit said he raised multiple requests with Paytm but reached nowhere. After several follow-ups and email/telephonic discussions, Dixit said that a Paytm executive called him and admitted the amount had gone into someone else’s account. The executive claimed it was due to a bug and assured it would be fixed, Dixit said. After waiting for over a year, Dixit filed a complaint with Hyderabad consumer forum-II in September 2019. Paytm in its written version contended that the complainant never availed any services from them with respect to the said transaction. They further added that after receiving the complaint, they had intimated that money was successfully added into a source wallet (But it was a different Paytm account, and not Dixit’s). After going through documentary evidence submitted, the bench said the refund was added to the wallet of one ‘Kancherla Sridhar’. “On hearing the conversations, it is clearly admitted by the opposite party’s executive that the amount was credited to the account of one Kancherla Sridhar, who is in no way related to Vivek Dixit. The opposite party failed to establish its claims and also did not resolve the issue,” said the bench in its verdict on October 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/online-wallet-co-penalised-for-refund-into-wrong-a/c/articleshow/87745291.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Delhi||AIIMS Delhi to open its surgery block from November-end||NEW DELHI: In a major infrastructure upgrade, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is planning to open its surgery block from November-end. Initially, OPD services for the patients requiring surgery and follow-ups will be conducted at the newly constructed block and gradually even in-patient services will be made operational, sources said. Confirming the development, a senior official of the institute said, “We are planning a soft launch by the end of the month.” The surgery block of AIIMS was planned as a separate unit over a decade ago, but the construction took longer than expected. The 200-bed facility has 12 operation theatres and provision for state-of-the-art ICU facilities. Officials said once operational, the new block would help the institute perform more surgeries and it would help reduce the waiting time for critically ill patients requiring surgery. At present, there is a wait time of up to three years for many surgeries at AIIMS, including those for cancer. Earlier, in July this year, AIIMS partially opened the newly constructed mother and child block for the public. It has 400 beds and 12 operation theatres, among other facilities that are dedicated solely for mother and child care. The mother and child block of AIIMS was also conceptualised over a decade ago to decongest the main OPD. In 2014, its foundation stone was laid to start the project. However, due to various factors such as paucity of funds and then the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said, operationalisation of the project got delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-to-open-its-surgery-block-from-november-end/articleshow/87746230.cms||---

Surrounded by sugarcane farm fields, the site saw nearly two lakh farmers witness thundering low fly-pass of jets over their farm fields with bated breath. While the ‘cobra and charlie’ maneuver of the flanker (Su-30 MKI) electrified the air, Balakot Phantoms’ Mirage 2000 bombers left the sky boom with sonic sounds. “TV pe dekha tha Balakot wala Jahaj, aaj gaon me aapni ankho se pehli bar dekha (For the first I saw the jet with my naked eye in the village, it’s the same which was in Balakot),” said 45-year-old Manju, who came from Amrupur village. She along with 150 women and men left their homes in the wee hours to reach Kurebar. The 45-minute air show also showcased special forces paratroopers taking tactical positions on air strips after short landing of AN-32 transport aircraft and Hercules C-130, which brought PM Narendra Modi to 341-km Purvanchal Expressway for inauguration. Kusumlata, who came from Ayodhya with her entire family and village, said, “We came to see Modi. We were told that his aeroplane will land on a newly constructed road (Purvanchal expressway). We have never seen Modi or aeroplane in real life so this was our golden opportunity.” The Uttar Pradesh government had arranged over 2000 buses to gather a massive crowd to witness the inauguration event. Large screens were installed to let the audience watch the live air show and expressway inauguration. Still, thousands of local villagers also climbed atop their houses, and at nearby trees and sat along the service lane to witness the event. “We could never have imagined this (airshow) in our village. There was a time when the public used to demand proper roads to travel, but now jet fighters are landing. Indeed development is reaching in far corners of the state. Now, we hope such infrastructure would help villagers to grow,” said Rajaram Kumar, who was preparing jaggery along with his family members in his farm field located right beside the service lane of expressway where jets were landing. The inauguration event had turned into a fair as well. Many had opened snack stalls and branded their products in the name of Modi, Yogi as well as IAF birds. For instance, Balram sold Rs 10 a glass of Tejas sugarcane juice, while Himmat sold puffed rice with fried gram mixture in the name of ‘double engine’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/spectacular-sight-of-hercules-sukhoi-mirage-thrills-public/articleshow/87746223.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Addressing a felicitation programme held for state teachers in Jaipur, Gehlot asked them if they had to pay money for transfers and the teachers responded with a unanimous “yes”. Gehlot looked at Dotasra, who was sitting on the dias, and reacted by saying that it was bad and promised to bring a concrete transfer policy soon, which the government employees have been demanding for decades. When Gehlot completed his speech, Dotasra rushed to the mike and claimed that he and his staff were clean. “Everyone sitting here knows the fact that I have never accepted one cup of tea. But we need a good transfer policy which will soon be worked out,” said Dotasra. Reacting to the allegation of corruption in transfers, BJP state president Satish Poonia said that corruption had become the basic “etiquette” in the state. "Corruption has become a new normal in the state. The state campaign 'Prashashan Ke Sang' has become 'Prashashan Risthedaro Ke Sang' and doesn't need any proof," said Poonia. He said that Congress MLAs Bharat Singh, Hemaram Choudhary and Deependra Singh Shekhawat were given evidence of corruption many times. Taking a dig at the Gehlot government, former education minister Vasudev Devnani also tweeted that teachers alleging corruption in front of Gehlot showed the true governance in the state. About 99 government teachers were felicitated by the government with a certificate and Rs 21,000 cash prize each. During his speech, Gehlot also said that the establishment of Mahatma Gandhi English medium schools in the state was a revolutionary step in the field of education. With the opening of these schools, the dreams of children of farmers, the poor, and labourers living in villages to study in English medium has come true. The chief minister directed setting up of good faculties in English medium schools and called for quality education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-teachers-allege-bribe-for-transfer-leave-min-red-faced/articleshow/87746211.cms||---

It is conservatively estimated that the sale of at least 100 tonnes of meat is reported in Ahmedabad every single day, say suppliers. “Based on rough sale estimates, one can say that at least 100 tonnes of chicken, 40 tonnes of mutton and seafood is supplied across Ahmedabad every day. Amdavadis also consume an estimated 15 lakh eggs daily,” said Mohammad Farooq, one of the largest suppliers of meat and poultry in the city. “Hotels and restaurants are the largest consumers of meat followed by sale over retail counters. On an average, a given hotel places an order for at least 100-150 kg meat daily. A huge volume of order also comes from street joints and independent caterers who cater at events and weddings,” he added. Even as the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation began cracking the whip to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food on main roads, industry experts say that consumption by local residents has increased over time. “A large volume of meat is consumed across restaurants and the number of such eateries have grown in the city over time,” said hotel and restaurant industry players. “Over the past 8-9 years, at least 500 restaurants selling non-vegetarian food have started in Ahmedabad. With app-based food delivery aggregators, even cloud kitchens preparing and serving non-vegetarian food have come up. These food ventures are doing brisk business driven by Amdavadis as well as migrant population that consume non-vegetarian food. Youths from the city, who travel a lot, are also increasingly open to trying non-vegetarian food and eventually become regular consumers,” said Rohit Khanna, co-founder, Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (FEA) – Ahmedabad. “Prices are usually up in the winter. Now, in a couple of days, prices have reduced due to the civic body announcement,” said Mohammad Ali, a chicken and meat trader. Prices decline, procurements hitA day after the civic body announced that non-vegetarian food joints on main roads would be removed, the prices of chicken and meat took a major hit. Estimates by meat traders in Ahmedabad suggest that procurements have been marginally affected due to which prices fell. Chicken price fell from Rs 200 a kg to Rs 160 a kg, whereas meat prices dropped from Rs 640 a kg to Rs 620 a kg, according to estimates by traders.Meat procurement took a hit from street-side joints, according to traders. “We have reduced procurement of birds for the time being, anticipating a slight slump in demand. Overall consumption of chicken in Ahmedabad is good with a lot of hotels and gourmet retail stores,” said Sultan Darbar, an Ahmedabad-based supplier of meat to organised retail stores, hotels and restaurants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-100-tonnes-a-day-non-veg-sales-are-meaty-in-city/articleshow/87745520.cms||Niyati Parikh

According to doctors, the condition of those already suffering from respiratory diseases has aggravated due to rise in air pollution before and after Diwali and change in weather. “Pollutants like particulate matter PM 2.5 and PM 10 stick to the windpipe and lungs hindering proper respiration. Our immune system gets activated against these foreign objects which results in inflammation. In this fight between foreign objects and our immune system, remodelling of our airways takes place which, in the long run, may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cancer, asthma and other respiratory tract problems,” said Dr Ved Prakash, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine department at KGMU. Track the pollution level in your city“There is an increase in COPD patients. Air pollution, dryness in the air and seasonal shift are contributing to the growth of virus and bacteria in our respiratory tract,” he added. At Lok Bandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, doctors have found a considerable rise in the number of respiratory patients just before and after Diwali. “From an average of nearly 70 patients a day, the number has gone up to 90 patients a day. Most of these patients already have comorbid conditions,” hospital director Dr Ajay Tripathi said. At TB hospital in Thakurganj, the average number of patients has gone up from 30 to 45. “Most patients complain of breathlessness and burning sensation in the eyes in the morning and evenings. Not only elderly patients, but middle-aged and young people are also visiting us with this problem,” said hospital director Dr Anand Gupta. “Every year we see a surge in the patients of COPD, asthma and bronchitis because of pollution and season change, especially after Diwali. The trend is increasing with each passing year,” said medical superintendent at BRD Hospital in Mahanagar, Dr Manish Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pollution-weather-change-spike-woes-of-respiratory-illness-patients/articleshow/87746204.cms||---

If BJP has the courage, it should first dismiss the NDA government and hold elections with ballot papers,” Patole said. Patole said it was “out of frustration” that comments on dismissal of the MVA government had been made. “BJP will never succeed. We have reports that BJP was instigating violence across the state, but we will not allow it to take law into its hands,” Patole said. Patole said that from recent developments across the state, it appears that senior BJP leaders “have gone berserk” because the party made umpteen attempts to dislodge the MVA government but did not succeed.” He alleged, The BJP used Raj Bhavan, but to no avail.” Further, Patole pointed out that after it failed to overthrow the government, the NDA government roped in the CBI, ED, the I-T department and NCB to register “false” criminal cases against cabinet members and politicians associated with MVA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-instigating-violence-in-state-says-nana-patole/articleshow/87746787.cms||---

City-based gaming companies have also made the best of the market opportunities during pandemic and 45 new companies have chosen Hyderabad as their destination in last two years taking the total count of gaming companies to 80 here,” KTR said while delivering the keynote address at the four-day IndiaJoy 2021 event that kicked off in the city. KTR pointed out that Telangana is one of the major contributors of VFX outsourcing to Hollywood and regional film markets due to its comprehensive ecosystem. The city has 20 academies creating a world class talent pool in the industry and over 40 production houses employing close to 30,000, he added. Rajiv Chilaka, mentor of Telangana VFX, Animation and Gaming Association, and founder & MD of Green Gold Studios, the maker of popular cartoon ‘Chhota Bheem’, said the last two years have been challenging for the gaming, animation and VFX industry. “While animation suffered a 20% decline in revenues, gaming took a hit of around 10%,” he said, adding that the period has been effectively used by the sector to invest in intellectual property and this is expected to reap rich dividends in future. Biren Ghose, country head of Technicolor India and chairman of CII’s National AVGC sub-committee said the state government must focus on creation of infrastructure and skills to attract investments in the state and grow the overall ecosystem. KTR informed that the government is working towards setting up the IMAGE Tower and though its development had slowed down due to the pandemic, the construction of this 1.6 million sft facility is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vfx-gaming-cos-thriving-in-hyd/articleshow/87745223.cms||---

Kumar claimed that he was charged Rs 7.62 for a plastic carry bag, which had a logo of Domino’s printed on it. He claimed that he was not informed beforehand that the carry bag was plastic and a logo was printed on it and that he noticed it only when the order was ready to carry it away. He further submitted that he requested a carry bag without a logo, but was not provided with one or given any alternative and was compelled to purchase a printed carry bag. The complainant said that he faced “harassment” due to the acts committed by the eatery and added that he was treated as an advertisement agent, which caused mental agony, as he had to walk on the streets by advertising the brand name. The opposite party, in its written version, denied insisting that Kumar purchase the carry bag bearing the logo of the company and added that he had done it out of his free will. They claimed the complainant was not under compulsion to buy a carry bag as pizza was provided in a card box container, and that he could have opted not to buy a carry bag. During the trial, the bench said that the opposite party is not supposed to collect the cost of the bag having a “company logo” from consumers and that it cannot use the consumer as their advertising agency. After the trial, the forum ordered the outlet to pay Rs 11,000 to the consumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pizza-outlet-directed-to-pay-rs-11k-for-forcing-man-to-buy-its-bag/articleshow/87745280.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

At present, there is only one centre functioning at Muvattupuzha Government Hospital (MGH). The plan is to set up one each in Tripunithura, Kalamassery and Fort Kochi. The work of the centre to be set up at Tripunithura Taluk Hospital is underway and the centre will have a dedicated inpatient facility for women and children too. The project reports for the centres to be set up in Fort Kochi taluk hospital and Ernakulam Government Medical College Hospital (EGMCH) in Kalamassery are under scrutiny and are likely to be approved soon. Vimukthi has one de-addiction centre each in all districts besides several counselling centres. Though the centre functioning at one of the buildings of MGH has inpatient facilities, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced authorities to use the space as an isolation ward for Covid patients. “Around Rs 8 lakh has been sanctioned for the setting up the centre at Tripunithura and the works are proceeding. There will be 20 beds and 10 out of them will be dedicated to women and children exclusively,” said a Vimukthi source. The centre to be set up at EGMCH in Kalamassery will have an ICU facility too and it will be functioning in association with the psychiatry department of the hospital. “There will be four ICU beds in addition to 20 beds. The project cost is estimated at Rs 40 lakh and it is yet to be approvedA 10-bed centre is planned in Fort Kochi and the project report has already been submitted,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/more-de-addiction-centres-to-come-up-in-district-soon/articleshow/87744695.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

With this, a total of 84km between Kazipet and Ballarshah has a third line facility now. The significant third line project in the Grand Trunk route between Kazipet-Ballarshah covers Telangana and Maharashtra. The section between Kazipet-Ballarshah under the South Central Railway (SCR) is a vital rail link connecting the northern and southern regions of the country. The mainline section under the GT route has been witnessing continuous growth of both passenger and freight traffic leading to over saturation of this section. To decongest this vital section, initially, tripling works between 33km Raghavapuram-Mandamarri was completed in 2016. The 202km third line project (Telangana 159km & Maharashtra 43km) was sanctioned in 2015-16 at an estimated cost of Rs2,063 crore. Of this 202km, 31km between Potkapalli-Kolanur-Raghavapuram and 34km Raghavapuram-Mandamarri has already been completed. Now, the third line works between Wirur-Manikgarh (19.2km) have been completed giving a boost to socio-economic development of this region. Gajanan Mallya, general manager of SCR, complimented the entire team from the Secunderabad division and construction wing, which completed the tripling and electrification works. “Completion of Kazipet-Ballarshah tripling project will ease congestion in this over saturated route will facilitate handling of more number of trains effectively,” Mallya said. “Manikgarh station is the interchange point with Central Railway and it is the junction connecting several cement and coal sidings. Commissioning of third line on this stretch will ease congestion for both freight and passenger trains,” said Rakesh Kumar, CPRO of SCR. “Execution of third line works of the entire project is being taken up simultaneously in different sections and the works in stretches of both Telangana and Maharashtra region are progressing at a fast pace,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/19-2km-wirur-manikgarh-third-line-to-boost-train-traffic/articleshow/87743873.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kochi||Canal rejuvenation project yet to get green clearance||Kochi: Even two years after awarding the work on integrated urban rejuvenation and water transport system (IURWTS) project, the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) the nodal agency is yet to secure environmental clearance for the project from Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA). Though KCZMA has asked KMRL to “submit details and data regarding the implications of regulating water flow by the canal lock gates” on July 2, 2021, the Metro agency is yet to submit the details. When the Rs 1,528 crore IURWTS project, which was designed for cleaning and beautifying six canals in Kochi and making them navigable, was launched in November 2019, the plan was to start the work within six months. “The project was expected to be a permanent solution for waterlogging in the city. Another purpose of the project was to make the waterbodies in the city navigable,” said BJP district committee member T Balachandran. “The government has already issued orders banning construction on the banks of six canals, which are included in the project. Still, big sharks continue with construction works on the shores of these canals,” Balachandran said. Similarly, eviction of encroachments on the canals are yet to be started. Even if all the permissions are obtained, the work can be started only after evicting encroachments. “It was in July we got the requisition for acquiring land for the project. After completing various procedures, we are now conducting a joint survey with the support of KMRL to mark boundaries of these waterbodies. We are all set to lay boundary stones of Edappally canal,” district collector Jafar Malik said. “Moreover, the land acquisition wing of KIIFB-funded projects in Kochi is overburdened. There are just 12 officials in the team which is to take care of land acquisition of all the KIIFB-funded project. So we have written to the government requesting a separate land acquisition team headed by a deputy collector for IURWTS project,” the collector said. Though TOI contacted KMRL officials seeking reasons for the delay in completing the procedures and starting work on the project, they didn’t respond. “The detailed project report is not in the public domain. Their priority seems to be navigation through these canals. The canal gates are required for ensuring minimum depth of water in the canal so that vessels can move through the waterbody,” said K T Cheshire, an activist. “But, KMRL is unable to allay the concerns raised by KCZMA regarding the implication of canal gates on the flow of water. There should be a proper report on the impact of canal gates,” Cheshire said. “Irrigation department, which is the owner of these canals, should be a party in implementing the project,” Cheshire said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/canal-rejuvenation-project-yet-to-get-green-clearance/articleshow/87744656.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

In July, the city was still reeling from the impact of the devastating second wave. But in the subsequent months, the city recorded zero cases on five days as the number of cases remained relatively low. With impact of festivities, the city has again recorded upward trend in daily cases with Tuesday hitting 18, the highest in the past four months. So how do new cases measure against the ones seen in the first and second wave? Dr Maharshi Desai, a city-based internal medicine specialist and member of state’s task force on Covid, said that the stark difference is in lung involvement. “The patients that we are seeing now are not turning hypoxic – out of breath or starving for oxygen – as we saw specifically during the second wave. It’s perhaps the direct impact of Covid vaccination that we don’t see any critical patients with high lung involvement. So far, none of the patients we have seen required oxygen,” he said. Experts from the city added that the direct impact can also be seen in very low hospitalization rate even among Covid patients. But a large number of patients have direct travel history or have contact with someone returning from a trip – something that was seen at the start of the pandemic. Dr Vivek Dave, a critical care specialist, said that due to very similar symptoms, the patients that come with possibility of seasonal flu are sometimes suggested RT-PCR to rule out Covid. “Almost all Covid patients we received are vaccinated, and they don’t show severe symptoms,” he said. “It’s following the same pattern as last year when cases are rearing its head after the season of going out and major social gatherings. While the symptoms are the same of Covid-19 and seasonal flu quite prevalent right now, it should be taken seriously even by those who are fully vaccinated,” said Dr Nirav Visavadia, a critical care physician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-covid-patients-not-experiencing-hypoxia/articleshow/87745546.cms||Parth Shastri

Manpreet also urged for special economic packages like its immediate neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and UT Jammu and Kashmir during a virtual discussion with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to step up investment, infrastructure and growth across the country. He strongly pushed Punjab’s case for special packages to wean away the agrarian state to industries stating that Punjab is a landlocked state. The state finance minister also urged the central government to extend its helping hand to Punjab stating that the state is facing new age challenges in transition of agriculture. He urged Sitharaman to come out with some schemes like production linked incentive which was given to industry so that Punjab can successfully migrate to other crops or animal husbandry from paddy-wheat crop pattern. He added that such a step will not only increase farmers’ income but also help in conservation of ground water and solve the problem of stubble burning which is again a burning issue. Manpreet also sought the allotment of a pharma park, a food park and a textile park for Punjab. “Punjab is the farthest destination from coal mines and actually we want to switch from fossil fuels into either solar or gas if possible. If we can somehow retire our coal-fired power stations, power will become cheap in the state,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/must-consider-punjabs-security-in-fund-allocation/articleshow/87746241.cms||---

Congress councillors protested the AMC’s move by showering flowers on the mayor. On Monday, the AMC’s estate and town planning committee decided to launch a drive to remove all carts selling non-vegetarian food from main roads, or near schools and colleges, religious places and community halls. “Removing food carts from public roads is a violation of Article 19 (1) G of Constitution of India which provides the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business to all citizens. It also violates a citizen’s right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India under Article 19(1 )(e),” said Shamshad Pathan, president of AIMIM Ahmedabad. Congress councillors Iqbal Shaikh and Shehzad Pathan, after showering flowers on mayor Kirit Parmar and standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot, said remoiving non-vegetarian or vegetarian food carts is anti-poor. “Instead of implementing the Street Vendors Act 2014 and providing vendors sites to carry out their business, the AMC is snatching away their livelihood,” Shehzad Pathan told the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aimim-congress-councillors-protest/articleshow/87745544.cms||---

The family claimed that Kamani Bhandari was issued the boarding pass after the security check. But while she was about to board the flight, Air India did not allow her saying, “We are overbooked and have an unserviceable seat.” The woman is now waiting for another flight to travel to Jodhpur. The family also sought intervention from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the ministry of civil aviation, terming the action as “irresponsible decision” and said it deserving “accountability”. On Tuesday, TOI spoke to the woman and her son for details of the incident. “My mother Kamani Bhandari (85) was taking a flight from San Francisco to New Delhi on Monday, scheduled to depart at 8.30pm and reach New Delhi on November 17 at 1pm. After I dropped her, she went through the security check and was carrying a valid Covid negative report. She was given a boarding pass. However, some minutes prior to boarding, she was denied by authorities at the airport who said that they were overbooked and seats were unserviceable. My mother was clueless and then they intimated me,” said Sanjay Bhandari, an IT professional based in San Francisco. “She is a US citizen and has an OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) card and was visiting our home town Jodhpur,” he said. He added that he pleaded with the authorities to put her in any next flight, but was given the option of a flight to Delhi without further connecting flight to Jodhpur. “Who is accountable for this? I have tweeted and tagged the PMO and the ministry of civil aviation,” he said. Sanjay said that they were hoping the airlines would come up with a viable option to enable her to fly to Jodhpur. “She is waiting. Despite all these hurdles, we hope they provide us with a viable option,” he said. “I was clueless of what had happened. My son came to the airport and I breathed a sigh of relief,” said Kamani Bhandari. Prem Bhandari, a US green card holder who helps NRIs and Indians stuck in various countries with various problems, said, “This is condemnable. Action needs to be taken against those responsible for this kind of negligence.” When contacted, an Air India spokesperson said, “The flight was full and one seat was unserviceable. We had requested If anyone could postpone his or her trip since the flight was overbooked and one seat was not serviceable. With the concurrence of her son she was offered another arrangement. The Air India's airport manager at San Francisco facilitated the passenger in getting another flight on a different airline which was slated to depart on Tuesday evening. However, since Air India does not have a daily flight to Jodhpur, we are trying to make an alternative and comfortable arrangement for her at the earliest. Also, as per US department of transport (DOT) rules, we are paying her $1,550 for this inconvenience.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/ai-denies-85-yr-old-raj-woman-seat-on-flight-from-us/articleshow/87746247.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Ahmedabad||Child porn: CBI cracks down in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The CBI on Tuesday conducted searches at several private premises in Junagadh, Bhavnagar, and Jamnagar districts of the state in connection with cases of child pornography. The searches had begun on Monday. “Searches are being conducted at about 77 locations including Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh; Delhi; Jalaun, Mau, Varanasi, Noida, and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh; and Junagadh, Bhavnagar, and Jamnagar in Gujarat,” said a CBI statement. The statement said that searches were also being conducted in Punjab, Bihar, Haryana, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu. Places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra were also being covered, the CBI said. The CBI as a National Central Bureau (Interpol-India) is uniquely placed to coordinate such matters that have national and international ramifications, said the statement. A special unit called ‘Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/ Investigation (OCSAE)’ was created in the CBI for matters pertaining to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. Apart from coordination with various agencies, the unit is undertaking investigations of various offences related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. In a nationwide, coordinated crackdown on crime related to online child sexual abuse material, the CBI registered 23 separate cases on Sunday against 83 accused on the allegations related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. It has been alleged that various syndicates of individuals based in different parts of India and foreign countries were circulating, storing, and viewing Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) through various social media platforms or groups. The accused persons were disseminating child pornography material by sharing links, videos, pictures, texts, posts, and by hosting of such content on social media groups and platforms and third-party storage and hosting platforms. A number of electronic gadgets including mobiles and laptops have so far been recovered during the searches. It is revealed that some individuals were involved in trading CSEM material. According to the initial information collected, there are more than 50 groups with over 5,000 offenders sharing child sexual abuse material. Many of these groups also have the involvement of foreign nationals. Nationals of about 100 countries spread across various continents may be involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/child-porn-cbi-cracks-down-in-state/articleshow/87745553.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: New liquor regime comes into effect||NEW DELHI: All government-run liquor shops shut down on Tuesday night, marking the exit of Delhi government from the alcohol retail business. From Wednesday, swanky private stores will take the orders of liquor lovers. However, a short scarcity looms on the horizon with only a few dozen of the newly mandated private liquor sellers prepared to operate from the day the new policy comes into force. In the new regime, 850 new showroom-like stores are to be opened across Delhi. These will each have a minimum of 2,000 sq ft of carpet area and will offer an array of brands. “The usual scene of people crowded into tiny vends is a thing of the past,” said one licence holder. “There will be enough space in the shops now for the customers to explore and purchase the brand of their choice. All the shops will have mechanised billing too.” The city has been divided into 32 liquor zones and each zone comprising 8-10 municipal wards will have 27 liquor stores. This is meant to ensure equal distribution of liquor shops in the capital. The government has till date given provisional licences to around 350 retailers. A government official said 206 alcohol brands had been registered and the 10 wholesale licence holders had already procured 9 lakh liters of liquor of various brands so far. However, a trader claimed that around 400 brands were registered under the earlier regime so those who patronised the remaining 190 or so brands were likely to be disappointed. In many stores, the civil construction work wasn’t finished on Tuesday evening, while many others were giving final touches to the setup. A dozen shops which were fully finished showcased empty shelves because they were yet to procure the liquor from wholesalers. “We will be able to open our shop for the public by the weekend,” said one provisional licence holder in south Delhi. There is some apprehension among the new shops because there have been sporadic protests against the new excise policy. For some days now, liquor consumers have been feeling the pinch, with many government alcohol vends no longer replenishing stocks because they were in exit mode. A government official assured that all efforts had been made to prevent a liquor crisis. While prices are expected to go up 5-10%, the government has also said there could be discounts offered by individual stores to attract customers. In the early days, however, discounts are improbable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-liquor-regime-comes-into-effect/articleshow/87746271.cms||AlokKNMishra

Ironically, as he watches his crop, the ‘Chettivirippu’ variety that was sent from his yield last year to a couple of farmers in 24 Parganas in the Sundarbans region has given them a good yield. For the farmers in that area, which was devastated by the cyclone Yaas and the land declared unfit for farming this year, pokkali seeds were sent on an experimental basis through Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), an all-India NGO that works for scientific thinking. “It was during one of our discussions that our counterparts in West Bengal mentioned about the sea level rise and post-cyclone effect on their farm. We suggested them to try out our variety. Chandu gave the seeds from his last harvest,” said Francis Kalathunkal, general convener of pokkali samrakshana samithi. Basudev Pattakkare, a farmer, planted10 kg of pokkali seeds in a 0.55-acre field and then transplanted the seedlings on July 28. It was harvested 110 days after sowing. There was no need for fertilizers and pesticides as this variety has a natural property of resisting salinity up to 8 parts per million (ppm) while the salinity of seawater is 35ppm. The crop was successfully cultivated in Dhosa village of Jaynagar Assembly constituency in 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. Karthika Sasamal and Prabhakar Meetti, farmers in Debipur village west of Kultali assembly constituency in 24 Parganas district, are also participating in the pilot venture under the guidance of IISER scientist Dr Soumitro Banerjee, who is also general secretary of BSS, Kolkata. But for Chandu, the struggle is not over until the crop has been harvested. “We might have to advance the harvest due to high tides. This year, we could sow only in August and there was a severe delay in dewatering too,” said Kalanthunkal. The samithi organized a ‘vigil’ meet on Tuesday to raise awareness on protection of the pokkali crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chandu-stares-at-uncertainty-while-his-pokkali-grains-take-root-in-bengal/articleshow/87744710.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: All Harbour trains to Andheri to be extended till Goregaon||MUMBAI: Central Railway (CR) has decided to extend all its CSMT-Andheri and Panvel-Andheri services till Goregaon, thus allowing more passengers to travel by the Harbour line. Currently, 21 pairs or 42 services run between CSMT and Goregaon and 9 pairs or 18 services between Panvel and Goregaon. A senior official said, “We are working on a new timetable, according to which the existing 22 pairs of services that run between CSMT and Andheri will be extended till Goregaon from December. Similarly, 9 more pairs of services that run between Panvel and Andheri will be extended as well.” There will be the added operational benefit of running all Harbour services on the Western Railway route from Goregaon instead of Andheri. Earlier, there was a terminating platform, beyond which the trains did not run on the Harbour line at Andheri. Now, since the line has been extended, there is no terminating platform at Andheri. Operating Andheri services means the trains first run on the down track and then have to be brought on the up track to travel towards CSMT. This also keeps one platform occupied, thus blocking movement of trains. More Goregaon services would mean that not only passengers at this station but those from Jogeshwari, Ram Mandir and even Malad can use the trains. If a significant number of commuters from Malad-Goregaon shift to Goregaon locals, there would be more relief to Borivli and Kandivli commuters as they can get adequate space in their dedicated services. Harbour line services were extended till Goregaon on March 29, 2018. Not all services were extended till Goregaon though, due to crew management issues as trains are operated by both CR and WR. Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC) has now firmed up plans to extend the Harbour line till Borivli. Work is expected to start soon as tenders are likely to be floated in a few weeks. The Harbour line’s extension till Borivli has been planned under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3A at a cost Rs 825. 6 crore. This project will be executed by WR and the entire corridor will come up on the western side of the existing tracks. Malad station on the proposed Harbour line extension will be at an elevated level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-all-harbour-trains-to-andheri-to-be-extended-till-goregaon/articleshow/87746802.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||40% of Gujarat is non-vegetarian: Survey||AHMEDABAD: Around 40% of the population of Gujarat eats eggs or meat. The state has more non-vegetarians than states like Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. More men are non-vegetarians than women in the state. Government officials say 38% of women in the state are non-vegetarian. Proportionately, Gujarat is 55% more non-vegetarian than Rajasthan, the most vegetarian state in India, where only 25.1% are non-vegetarian. Officials said this data is from the sample survey of 2014 and today the number may be much higher. Gaurang Jani, a sociologist, said, “From Independence, Punjab has been a vegetarian state and it is also woven into religion. In Gujarat, we are yet to acknowledge the fact that the state has lots of non-vegetarians. Gujarat has a large coastline and from Surat to Kutch, the population along the coast and those involved in fishing are non-vegetarians. “The Koli community, adivasis and most OBC communities are non-vegetarians. These three groups make up the majority of the population and along minorities we can easily say that Gujarat is a non vegetarian state,” he said. He said in past centuries, the elite of Gujarat imposed their food preferences and since then the state has been more vegetarian. “What is interesting that even entertainment has associated Gujaratis with dal-bhat (pulses and rice) and fafda and dhokla. As people tend not to disclose that they eat meat or eggs, the numbers are under-reported in surveys. We are yet to accept that we are a non-vegetarian state,” The younger generation, irrespective of caste or community, consume non-vegetarian food. Many sects in Gujarat are advocating vegetarian food and are even against the eating of onion and garlic, he said. Consumption of non-veg food in Gujarat is on the rise, Jani said. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in egg production in the state. Production of eggs in the state in 2019-20 was the highest ever, the socio-economic survey found. Egg production in Gujarat was 192 crore eggs in 2019-20. Egg production increased from 185 crore in 2018-19 to 192 crore in 2019-20, according to the Integrated Sample Survey (ISS) of major livestock products, the survey found. A state government report had stated that 43% of eggs produced in Gujarat are consumed within the state and the rest is sent to other states. However, Gujarat also gets eggs from neighbouring Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-of-gujarat-is-non-vegetarian-survey/articleshow/87745555.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Speaking later, cabinet minister Raj Kumar Verka said the panel will be led by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and will begin work soon. “A law will be brought in by the state government. The panel will, meanwhile, study the present status of jobs in different departments and how many more employees can be hired,” he said. Verka said the staff nurses hired during the Covid crisis will also be continued and a formal decision will be approved in the next meeting of the Cabinet. “By tomorrow, a decision on the new advocate general will be decided, and the cabinet has authorised the chief minister in his regard,” he said. Channi had said last week that when jobs are advertised, 25% of the applicants end up coming from Haryana, 15% from Himachal Pradesh, some come from Delhi. He added that the Congress government was bringing in a law to ensure that Punjabis get 100% jobs in Punjab, especially government jobs. NOD TO FREE UNIFORMS FOR GENERAL CATEGORY GOVT SCHOOL BOYSIn a move aimed at increasing enrolment, reducing dropout rate and attracting students to the government schools, the Punjab cabinet. led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Tuesday decided to provide free uniforms to nearly 2.66 lakh boys of general category studying in the government schools from classes I to VIII. The Punjab government will spend around Rs 15.98 crore in the current financial year. Boys students belonging to general category are not provided uniforms by the department as they are not covered under RTE entitlement. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting here at CMO. At present, school education department is already providing free uniforms, costing up to Rs 600 per student, to all girls, SC boys, BPL boys studying in government schools from classes I to VIII, in government-run schools and Adarsh schools being run by the Punjab School Education Board studying as per norms of Samagra Shiksha and also as per RTE entitlement.

---||Amritsar||On website, Pakistan government hails Navjot Singh Sidhu for Kartarpur corridor role||AMRITSAR: Pakistan has conspicuously given reference to cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is now Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president, in its website kartarpurcorridor-.com.pk and has eulogized his role in the opening of the corridor between the two nations. Pakistan’s credit comes at a time when BJP Punjab chief Ashwani Sharma has claimed that the initiative for opening the corridor was started by the BJP government at the Centre soon after it came to power in 2014. The website stated that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, a friend from the cricketing days of Sidhu, had decided to open the Kartarpur corridor on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev during his swearing-in ceremony and shared the same with Sidhu, who had arrived in Pakistan to attend the ceremony. The homepage of the website reads: “The idea (opening of Kartarpur corridor) was shared with Indian legend Sikh cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister of Pakistan. On November 28, 2018, Prime Minister Imran Khan and Navjot Singh Sidhu attended the groundbreaking ceremony of Kartarpur corridor.” On November 26, 2018, India Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu had laid the foundation stone of the corridor on the Indian side. On November 28 same year, Khan performed the groundbreaking ceremony on the Pakistan side. The website has also prominently published an article titled ‘Kartarpur Sahib Corridor: Interfaith Harmony in Pakistan’, which reads: “This step (Kartarpur corridor) was perceived as a sincere effort of Imran Khan, (Pakistan Army chief) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and Navjot Singh Sidhu. Sikhs and Muslims believe that these three leaders have honoured Guru Nanak Dev in a true sense and his followers by creating a facilitative environment which helped permit Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims to have a visa-free visit to Kartarpur Sahib.” It also talked about Sidhu gaining popularity among Punjabi voters that could pave the way for him to the chief minister’s office. “If it happens, this will set in a new era of social, cultural and political history of the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/on-website-pak-govt-hails-sidhu-for-corridor-role/articleshow/87746252.cms||Yudhvir Rana

However, political parties and sitting corporators and aspirants, who have already begun their campaign and preparations keeping in mind the existing electoral wards, are on tenterhooks. They fear that if the reservation for a seat changes, a new candidate will have to be nominated. “We also fear that the authorities may take time to draw out the changes in ward boundaries, which may then leave us with little time for campaigning in case the elections are held on time,” said a corporator from the western suburbs. Another corporator pointed out that the slum population—a major vote bank—has increased in many wards in the suburbs, and if the new boundaries drop out a particular slum pocket from an electoral ward, the entire dynamics would change. “Therefore, it’s important that we know which areas will be covered in our wards so that we can tap our vote base as early as possible,” the corporator added. Last week, the Maharashtra cabinet decided to increase BMC’s strength of corporators from 227 to 236. The last time electoral wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. Reservation of corporator seats are changed every five years through a lottery system. During the previous BMC elections, the reservation of wards was completed by October 3, 2016, and the polls were held in February 2017. “Once we get a communication from the state government [on redrawing ward boundaries], it will take the civic administration one week to complete the progress of reorganization of wards,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, in charge of the civic election department. “While previously the average voter count in each ward was around 54,685, this time it could be around 52,000. From our side there will be no delay; we will be ready to hold the lottery for seat reservation even in December,” he added. Kakani further said that the reorganization would be done through GIS mapping and physical verification would be called for wherever required. Officials said that considering the Covid-related works on in the city, primary health care staff would not be allotted any civic election-related work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-says-its-ready-to-conduct-ward-reservation-lottery-in-dec/articleshow/87745559.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS to hold ‘maha dharna’ at Indira Park tomorrow, second in six days||HYDERABAD: Upping the ante against BJP-led NDA government, TRS has decided to hold a ‘maha dharna’ at Indira Park on November 18. The entire cabinet, elected representatives and Rythu Bandhu Samithi workers will participate in the dharna. This would be the party’s second protest programme in six days. The ruling party hit the roads on November 12 demanding that the Centre procure paddy/rice produced in the Rabi season. “BJP is adopting a dual policy on paddy procurement. The Centre should clarify the extent of paddy (target) for the entire year, the quantity of raw rice they want to procure in the coming yasangi (rabi) season. I’m going to write a letter to PM Narendra Modi and PDS minister to spell out their stand,” TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said at a press conference on Tuesday. The chief minister declared that the pink party would introduce resolutions in the state assembly against new farm laws and ‘black laws’. He said the party’s elected representatives would question the Centre at various fora till its gives clarity. The decision was taken at the TRS legislature party meeting on Tuesday. The TRS legislature party meeting was convened by KCR to discuss the paddy issue and chalk out the future course of action, mainly to counter BJP’s attack on the TRS government. After the dharna (11am and 2pm), TRS leaders would submit a representation to governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Attacking BJP state president Bandi Sanjay, KCR said he was spreading all lies and creating confusion among the farmers. “Let Sanjay get an official order from the Centre that they will purchase paddy in the next agriculture season. If he fails to get any assurance from his party’s government, he should seek an apology from farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-to-hold-maha-dharna-tomorrow-2nd-in-6-days/articleshow/87746804.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Goa||Indian council of agricultural research looks at new rice to beat climate change||PANAJI: A hardy rice variety, ‘Jaddu Batta’ from Karnataka’s Shimoga district with exceptional tolerance to prolonged submergence under water offers hope for developing a foolproof climate-resistant crop that may help food security. With extreme weather events already registering an increase and problems of salinity, flooding and irregular rise in temperatures having disastrous effects on crops, scientists face a challenge in developing suitable climate-resistant crop varieties. At the Indian council of agricultural research (ICAR), Old Goa, agriculture scientists say they have already standardised and developed salt-tolerant rice varieties - Goa Dhan 1, Goa Dhan 2, Goa Dhan 3 and Goa Dhan 4 - on salt-affected soils of Goa and parts of coastal Karnataka. “Jaddu Batta is grown by the riverside in Shimoga and it can rejuvenate even after 15 days of being underwater,” senior scientist (plant breeding) at ICAR-Old Goa, KK Manohara said. “We are in the process of crossing saline-resistant rice varieties, Goa Dhan series – which are also high-yielding - with Jaddu Batta for its high tolerance to prolonged submergence. This will help tackle problems of both salinity and submergence due to climate change,” Manohara said. This year unprecedented flooding, one of the worst in 40 years, caused massive loss to agricultural crops due to waterlogging for many days. Stress caused by influx of salinity from estuaries and creeks hits paddy productivity and income. “A package of crop management practices - nutrient management, salt-tolerant rice varieties and other aspects have been developed and demonstrated on farmers’ fields. These practices give higher yield and income up to 20% to 25% over the farmers practices,” scientist for soil census at ICAR, Gopal Mahajan said. The institution in collaboration with the directorate of agriculture and progressive farmers are producing quality seeds of these four salt-tolerant varieties and supplying to farmers in khazan areas. “These four varieties are producing 60% to 80% more yield than the locally grown varieties like Korgutt,” director, ICAR, Parveen Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/icar-looks-at-new-rice-to-beat-climate-change/articleshow/87746273.cms||---

An IAF aircraft flies past during the air show in Sultanpur on TuesdayYogi also trained the spotlight on religion saying his government gave due respect to the ‘faith’ of the people. The CM, in fact, gifted PM Narendra Modi a handmade model of the upcoming Ram Temple in Ayodhya. “This is a picture of the new Bharat…picture of a new UP,” Yogi said, stressing that UP will play a pivotal role in turning PM Modi’s dream of making India a global economic superpower. Asserting that his government embarked on focussed development, Yogi cited the examples of the upcoming expressways, executing Metro rail in four cities, and making nine airports functional under the UDAN scheme of the Centre. Yogi said besides its focus on infrastructure development, his government also extended benefits of all schemes related to health and education to all ‘without any discrimination’. The chief minister further said that work on Bundelkhand Expressway connecting Chitrakoot with Etawah, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ballia link expressway is being carried out on a war footing, while work on the 594 km Ganga Expressway connecting Meerut with Prayagraj would begin soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-e-way-will-be-east-ups-economic-lifeline-devpt-axis/articleshow/87746256.cms||Pankaj Shah

According to SAFAR, a system of air quality and weather forecasting and research developed by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Mumbai’s air quality will remain in the ‘poor’ category for the next couple of days. Though Colaba once again recorded an AQI of 353 (very poor) on Tuesday, more than Monday’s 345, it remained lower than Delhi’s 379. According to experts, low wind speed, low temperature, cloudy weather and high humidity along with vehicular pollution prove to be a “lethal combination” for Mumbai, a feature during winter. And Tuesday was no exception. Other than vehicles and dust, smoke from garbage, chimneys and incinerators add to the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) which remain suspended in the air for a long time during such weather conditions. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/safar-mumbai-citys-air-quality-to-remain-poor-for-next-2-days/articleshow/87746820.cms||---

A forensic team, which spent around four hours at the site on Tuesday, has found nine cartridges, one among them a live cartridge, eight 32-bore bullets, stones, ashes and remnants of inflammable material from inside the house. Broken glass from window panes were also found, with traces of blood on them. Samples of the blood have been sent for examination. Caretaker of the house Sundar Ram, who was present at the house when it was attacked, had said that the protestors, a group of around 20 people, had vandalized the house, fired six to seven rounds at the house and burnt down a door after pouring petrol on it. They had also burnt an effigy near the house on Monday, shouting "Jai Shri Ram, Salman Khurshid murdabad" etc.  Currently, two personnel of Nainital district police have been deployed to guard the house. Khurshid has also sent two people to stay at the place. The house, built across 120 square kilometre (approx) has suffered an estimated damage worth around Rs 50,000. Ram, who has been the caretaker of the house since 2001, when Khurshid had the property constructed, said that his family was still in a state of shock. He had told TOI on Monday that a few members of the mob had pointed a gun at his daughter-in-law before firing bullets at the house. Station officer Bhowali Asif Khan said that none of those booked have been nabbed so far. On Monday, a case for rioting, trespassing and other IPC sections had been filed against 20 unidentified persons and one accused identified as Rakesh Kapil. Khurshid has been in the eye of a storm over parallels drawn between ‘Hindutva’ and Islamic terrorist outfits in his recent book. Hours after Monday’s incident, in a Facebook post, the former minister of external affairs, sharing pictures and videos of charred doors and other parts of his house, wrote, “I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-khurshids-house-vandalised-no-arrests-made-yet/articleshow/87744740.cms||---

Before the PM reached Sultanpur to dedicate the Expressway to the people, Akhilesh took to twitter to slam the BJP for tussle to claim credit for the project. “The ribbon came from Lucknow and the scissors from Delhi. There is a tug-of-war to claim credit for SP’s project,” a part of his tweet in Hindi said. Later in the day in a press statement Akhilesh said it would have been better had the Prime Minister, while dedicating the project to the people of the country, mentioned that it was conceived and initiated by the SP. “It was the SP government which announced that budgetary provisions will be made for the expressway while laying its foundation at a gala event held outside UP Vidhan Sabha in December 2016,” he said. “It was the SP government which released money for acquisition of land for the project,” he added. He said the SP government got the Agra-Lucknow expressway completed within 22 months which was a record in itself. The SP had claimed BJP was five years behind SP in terms of providing landing and take-off facility for fighter aircrafts on Expressway that the BJP tried to showcase by way of an air show. “We did it five years ago when fighter jets touched down on Agra-Lucknow Expressway,” he said. Over a dozen IAF planes, including Mirage-2000 fighters and Sukhoi 30s, besides C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, took part in the exercise near Bangarmau about 65km from Lucknow in December 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-usurping-others-initiatives-akhilesh/articleshow/87746269.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

However, the large gap between the minimum and maximum temperatures (31.2 degrees celsius) of 13 degrees remained, making citizens feel the change of season. The weather is likely to get trickier from Wednesday, with light to moderate rainfall forecast in the majority of coastal districts along and in some districts of central Gujarat due to a system in the Arabian Sea that is travelling north-westwards. Dr Dhirendra Sanandiya, president of the Ahmedabad Family Physicians’ Association (AFPA), said that the changing season is giving citizens a slew of health conditions ranging from seasonal flu to congestion, head and body aches, fevers and the odd reaction to allergies. “Fever is very common even as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are on the decline compared to October,” he said. “We are advising those with a history of travel to undergo RT-PCR tests to rule out Covid-19.” Experts said there is a need is to remain on guard for those with lower immunity and existing health conditions. “The conjunction between monsoon and winter is often marked by large temperature differences with hot days and much colder nights, causing a slew of infections,” said Dr Pragnesh Vaccharajani, a city-based general physician. “We are getting a similar number of patients as immediately after the monsoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/change-of-season-making-many-sick/articleshow/87745567.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Industries oppose local quota in private sector||Chandigarh: Punjab industrialists have come forward to oppose Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s proposal to fix the job quota for Punjabis in the private sector in the state stating that the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the state have over 70% migrated workers and proposed law is unconstitutional. All Industries and Trade Forum has written a letter to the chief minister requesting him to refrain from coming up with the local Punjabi workers’ quota law in the private sector stating that the industries will be forced to close down if the government forces them to fix the quota for local workers. President of the forum Badish Jindal, in his letter, mentioned that industries of Punjab are fully dependent upon the migrated labour. “There are around 30 lakh migrated workers in the state and around six lakh have settled their families permanently in Punjab,” said Jindal. He added that as per a study carried out by the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies of the Punjabi University at Patiala, 70% of the people coming to the cities are from outside the state and only 30% belong to the rural Punjab. Jindal informed the chief minister that the MSME sector in Punjab is having 70% to 90% migrated workers, while the large and medium industries have 30% to 60% migrated workers in their industries. “The 90% of unskilled workers in industries are migrated and almost 60% are semi-skilled and 30% skilled workers are migrated labourers. They have been working in Punjab since decades and now their second or third generations are working in industries in Punjab,” he added. Jindal also apprised the chief minister that industries feel it is convenient to hire migrated labour due to their cost and work efficiency and even the migrated workers are hardly involved in the trade union politics in Punjab. “The proposed law is not only against constitutional provisions but also sovereignty and basic principle of meritocracy that Act as the foundation for businesses to grow and remain competitive,” said Jindal. He added that almost 20% of Punjabis are working in other states and overseas countries so such policies may also impact the future of migrated Punjabis staying in other parts of the country or in other countries. Jindal also said that even the same quota politics was tried by the Haryana government by fixing the quota of 75% for local workers but that was strongly opposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/industries-oppose-local-quota-in-private-sector/articleshow/87746277.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Suryapet on the boil as clashes mar Bandi Sanjay’s visit||HYDERABAD: A day after BJP state president Bandi Sanjay’s convoy came under attack during his visit to paddy procuremnt centres in Nalgonda and Suryapet, the situation turned worse on Tuesday with police forced to resort to a mild lathicharge to disperse warring TRS and BJP activists in Suryapet district. In the melee, a police officer suffered a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. It all started in Chivvemla village, where Sanjay first went to meet farmers and talk to them about the procurement of paddy. While TRS activists raised slogans against Sanjay, BJP activists too arrived at the spot and both clashed with sticks, prompting police to resort to mild lathicharge. Later, when Sanjay arrived in Atmakur mandal, the TRS activists followed him there too. While TRS and BJP supporters gathered in large numbers at the procurement centre, they attempted to outwit each other, when a reserve police inspector Srinivas suffered a heart attack and was immediately rushed to a hospital in Suryapet. Sanjay could meet a handful of farmers and attempted to pacify the angry BJP activists. Speaking about the incident, Nalgonda SP A Venkata Ranganath said the BJP chief did not have a permission for his visit, and it is also not permissible due to the enforcement of election code. “We have booked cases against him and other BJP leaders for the same reasons, we booked cases against activists of both parties,” he said. Security was tightened in border areas of Nalgonda and Suryapet, and several BJP leaders were arrested before they arrived at the locations where Sanjay was speaking to farmers. Later in the evening, Sanjay cancelled his journey to the Jangaon district since police refused to give him permission due to clashes between TRS and BJP activists. TRS supporters arrived from Tirumalagiri in Suryapet to Jangaon. Sanjay had scheduled a district party meeting in Jangaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/suryapet-on-the-boil-as-clashes-mar-bandis-visit/articleshow/87746831.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The special operations group (SOG) of the Ahmedabad rural police on Monday held nabbed the two and seized narcotics and psychotropic substances worth Rs 3.52 lakh from their possession. Police confirmed that Vandit Patel, who runs Rexon Salon and Nails, was caught with 300 gm of hybrid ganja, 501 gm of American charas, 221 gm of charas balls, 224 gm of magic mushrooms, and 43 gm of shatter. Patel’s journey into the drug world began when he began consuming drugs in 2012 and met various suppliers in the city. Later, in 2016, he went to Singapore to study diploma in tourism in Singapore where also he consumed drugs and met various international suppliers. In 2018, he returned to the city and opened his salon in South Bopal. “To earn more money, he decided to sell drugs and contacted international drug mafias. He began obtaining drugs through air cargo since 2019,” said a police officer. For payment, he used to contact dealers and agents of various crypto currency providers. Patel used to give these agents and dealers cash or send it through angadias. The agents used to give him an ID and password for payment in crypto which he provided to the dealers. According to police officers, Patel brought drugs worth Rs 1-2 lakh through air cargo but his consignment was never caught at the airport. “Patel confessed that he used to smuggle the drugs in household articles like microwave oven wrapped in a particular paper that would hinder screening of materials inside,” said a police officer. Police officers believe that Patel used to supply drugs to various areas in the western parts of the city and also in other cities like Surat. He had six aides who worked as suppliers and cops have been trying to nab his suppliers also. Police booked Patel and his aide Parth Sharma, 32, a resident of Vejalpur, under the NDPS act and investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/salon-owner-aide-held-in-drug-bust-in-south-bopal/articleshow/87745587.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa got another opportunity now to win ISL: Brandon Fernandes||Panaji: Brandon Fernandes has set his sights on the Indian Super League once again. Now into his fifth season at FC Goa, the star midfielder has already lost one final and knocked out in the semifinals on three occasions, including last season. The desire to win the biggest prize in Indian football is now more than ever before. “It is disappointing, but we got another opportunity now,” Brandon told TOI on Wednesday. “We are working as a group. We are more or less the same team from last season. We have to rectify things that we didn’t do last season, but we can do better now. All the players are hungry this time. We are going to take game by game and obviously the objective is to win the ISL.” The 27-year-old has lit up the league with his performances and holds the record for the highest assists by an Indian, a total of 18 in 64 games to be precise. Only former FC Goa star and current ATK Mohun Bagan attacker Hugo Boumous is ahead in the all-time list with 24 assists in 58 games. The number can increase this season with the league allowing only four foreigners in the starting line-up, a decision Brandon feels will help Indian players to step up. “Having one less foreigner than last season, it is more important now that we can contribute more to the team. We have four foreigners and it’s good to have them because they help us a lot. This is going to be like a new challenge for all the Indian players this time,” said Brandon. Brandon will once again pair up in midfield with captain Edu Bedia, the club’s longest serving foreigner, and Alberto Noguera, who got most assists last edition. Then there is Glan Martins, Princeton Rebello and a bunch of new talented youngsters who adore the midfielder. “My role will be to help the youngsters. Some of them will be playing their first ISL and it will be a new experience for them. They need to learn everyday, improve everyday and just wait for their opportunity and grab it when they get it,” said Brandon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-got-another-opportunity-now-to-win-isl-brandon-fernandes/articleshow/87767235.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

She claimed that the family had sent her to her parents’ house in April, promising to call her back once things settled but never did so. In her complaint with Chandkheda police, she told police that she got married in June 2019 and began staying with her in-laws. After a few months, her husband, his father, mother and sister began fighting and abusing her. She alleged that when she complained about their behaviour to her father-in-law’s elder brother, he also got angry and abused her. The complainant claimed that she was taunted that her father never wanted her to marry in the family but the complainant was ready to marry despite his reluctance. The family on several occasions asked her to get out of the house and her husband was pressured to seek divorce with the complainant. She stated that on April 29, 2020 her father-in-law and his elder brother dropped her at her mother’s house. She stated that since April no one came to take her back, but she was informed that her husband has filed a divorce petition in the family court. On November 4, she went to her in-laws and tried to persuade them but instead of talking to her, the family abused her. Hence she decided to file a police complaint against her in-laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chandkheda-doctor-files-dv-complaint-against-in-laws/articleshow/87745593.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pinarayi, FM lash out at CAG’s observations against KIIFB||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at the observations made by the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) against the functioning of KIIFB. The detractors of KIIFB are sadists who want to derail the state’s progress, he said. “Some are trying to prevent Kerala from going forward from the present situation. They are happy if we go back a little bit. The government will not stop any work which has been started. Sadistic people are trying to destroy KIIFB,” he said, in an apparent dig at CAG and also the opposition parties which are criticising KIIFB. The chief minister was responding to the latest CAG report on Kerala finances that found serious constitutional issues in the functioning of KIIFB. He was speaking at the Chancellor’s Award presentation held at the Raj Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. He said there are several attempts to defame and degrade KIIFB from various quarters. The attempt is to sabotage the state’s progress, he added. “The state is facing a serious resource crunch. We are not rich in resources. There are weaknesses. But if we fail to strengthen various sectors, including education, citing weak resources we would be doing an injustice to the future generations,” he said. Vijayan made it clear that the state cannot progress on the strength of its own budgetary resources alone. For this, the government will have to opt for alternative paths. “Our general education sector was strengthened only when KIIFB resources supplemented government money. We are now reaping the benefits of such a move. We now have to use the KIIFB route to augment our higher education sector,” he said. The KIIFB resources were necessary to improve the faculty and infrastructure facilities like labs and libraries in the higher education sector, he added. Finance minister K N Balagopal too came out against CAG and said it was creating unnecessary controversies against KIIFB. “Whatever has come as special report were just queries raised during the audit and KIIFB has given its clarifications. No such final report has been received by the government. If there are any anomalies in the functioning of KIIFB, the government has no hesitation in probing it,” he said. The finance minister accused CAG’s special audit report of being an attempt to stoke a controversy. The present attempt is to create controversy based on a report which has not been submitted before the government so far. The chief minister and finance minister came down heavily against the CAG as the opposition demanded a probe into the findings made by CAG in the appointments done at KIIFB and also in the disbursement of salaries and allowances without the government’s consent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-fm-lash-out-at-cags-observations-against-kiifb/articleshow/87745598.cms||---

---||Goa||No human rights violation by PWD at Bambolim: Panel||Panaji: Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC) has found no merit in the complaint filed by residents of a colony at Bambolim against the PWD for inconveniencing them by diverting traffic through their colony to facilitate highway road widening work. Taking cognisance of the complaint filed by 14 senior citizens from Palmar Colony at Bambolim, the commission had sent a notice to the PWD, which, in its reply, denied that the National Highway Authority changed the original highway widening plan to save one commercial building and that work was ‘ill-planned’, which had led to dust and noise pollution. They had also complained about the unnecessary breaking of the major district road from Santa Cruz to Bambolim, and an illegal ‘No Entry’ sign installed near an automobile showroom at Bambolim, due to which, light and heavy traffic were plying through their residential colony. K L Bhagat of the PWD denied diverting traffic through the colony road. He said the colony has not erected any compound wall or gate or fencing to prevent trespassers and that the internal roads of the colony are wide open. The PWD stated that the national highway work is being taken up and the Santa Cruz-Bambolim road is being used as a diversion and will be restored once the work is completed. The PWD stated that it has taken measures to avoid noise and air pollution and that once the project is completed all complaints will stop and that the complainants will be able to avail benefits of the road widening project. “There is no dispute that the housing colony is not surrounded by any compound wall and the roads passing through the colony from the district road are wide open. The commission finds that due to the construction of the four lane road of the national highway at Bambolim, the respondent had used the Santa Cruz-Bambolim other district road as a diversion road,” the commission stated, adding that the complainants failed to make out any violation of their human rights or negligence by the PWD in prevention of such violation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-human-rights-violation-by-pwd-at-bambolim-panel/articleshow/87746326.cms||---

He had visited the ashram between November 3 and 11. According to the police, the man identified as Vijay Yadav had come to the ashram to attend a shibir along with his 10 friends. Police said that Yadav had last contacted his family on November 9 after which he went missing. However, when all his friends returned home and he did not, Yadav’s family became anxious. As they could not contact him, they reached Ahmedabad on Monday and sought information about him from the ashram people, said deputy commissioner of police, zone-2, Vijay Patel. He said that his family members called up the police control room and sought help. Following this a team of Chandkheda police registered a missing person complaint and started an investigation. Patel added that Yadav had told some disciples and locals that he wanted to go to Jodhpur. Sources in the police said that Yadav might be under influence of Asaram so that he was telling everyone that he wanted to go to Jodhpur in Rajasthan where the godman, accused of raping a minor girl, is lodged in jail. Police have begun checking CCTV footage from the ashram to get clues about Yadav. The Motera ashram of Asaram was mired in controversy when two young boys Dipesh and his cousin Abhishek Vaghela had gone missing from the ashram in 2008 and later their bodies were recovered from the riverbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hyderabadi-inmate-missing-from-asaram-ashram-in-motera/articleshow/87745597.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Worried Telangana farmers sell paddy in Karnataka below MSP, incur losses||HYDERABAD: Even as the turf war between TRS and BJP over paddy procurement continues with BJP chief Bandi Sanjay’s tour of districts to inspect paddy procurement sparking off fresh tensions, farmers in the border areas of Gadwal and Kothakota in the erstwhile Mahbubnagar district, as well as some villages of Nalgonda district, have started resorting to distress sale of paddy and rice in neighbouring state of Karnataka, mainly Raichur. The farmers are selling the parboiled rice at a much cheaper price of Rs 1,300 per quintal when the minimum support price is Rs 1,940. “Thankfully, the fine variety is getting a price of Rs 1,800 as against the government’s MSP of Rs 1,960 per quintal,” said Kotha Ganesh, a paddy farmer from Gadwal district. He said farmers who are financially stable may wait, but was quick to add that those who have taken huge loans and need money right away were transporting the paddy to the neighbouring state as a desperate measure. Mohammad Ghouse, who planted paddy in 17 acres in Kollampally village in Narayanpet district, told TOI, “Since the paddy crop is not ready in Raichur and other border areas of Karnataka, we are shifting rice and selling it at a low price. Once their paddy is ready, there would be additional problems.” He demanded that the state government establish paddy procurement centres run by self-help groups again. Some farmers believe that if the government is willing to provide good market linkages, they will switch over to other crops. “However, not all land parcels are eligible for this paradigm shift to other corps. Firstly, such land parcels should be mapped,” G Venkanna, farmer from Khammam, pointed out. Meanwhile, taking advantage of the situation, some local dealers are purchasing paddy from desperate farmers at a reduced price. “Since it is raining in spells, several farmers are leaving massive heaps of paddy at the procurement centers. Traders are approaching us for selling paddy at Rs 1,500 per quintal. Though many of us are refusing to sell at a lower price, some helpless farmers are resorting to distress sale,” SK Ravi Reddy, a farmer from Vikarabad, said. Urging the authorities to bail them out, Ravi Reddy said: “We are hoping that the state government will procure our paddy and provide us some relief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/worried-t-farmers-sell-paddy-in-ktaka-below-msp-incur-losses/articleshow/87746846.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Goodbye to Crater Mumbai? EEH, WEH to be concretised||MUMBAI: The MMRDA on Tuesday gave its approval to the extension of the Eastern Freeway till Thane and concretisation of the Western and Eastern Express highways. Motorists using the WEH and EEH are promised a pothole-free experience by 2025 as MMRDA has given its approval to concretise these arterial stretches. The approval came in the authority meeting chaired by urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday. Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said, “We have given approval for concretisation of both these roads.” MMRDA officials said only a 14km, 5-plus-5-lane stretch of the 26km Western Express Highway (WEH) will be concretised between Andheri and Dahisar for now. The 10km stretch between Bandra and Andheri will not be taken up now as it has been asphalted and is still under the contractor defect liability period. This stretch will be concretised in Phase II. On the Eastern Express Highway (EEH), only two lanes each on either side of the median will be concretised between Sion and Mulund. Srinivas said, “On EEH, there are utility lines beneath the main carriageway. Hence, only those lanes are taken which do not have utilities underneath.” On WEH, the utilities are underneath the service road, hence it is feasible to undertake concretisation on all lanes. Work on WEH will cost Rs 750 crore while EEH expenditure is estimated at Rs 300 crore. Tenders are likely to be floated soon and work is expected to commence in March 2022. The work is expected to be completed in 2 years. MMRDA will divide the work in 5 stretches so each package has adequate deployment of men and machinery to complete the work in time. MMRDA has been given the mandate to maintain both EEH and WEH as some stretches on these roads are witnessing Metro-related works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/goodbye-to-crater-mumbai-eeh-weh-to-be-concretised/articleshow/87746850.cms||Manthank Mehta

But he was captured by the cops of the local crime branch of Ahmedabad rural police who found him with the help of CCTV footage of a hardware shop. He had bought a saw and a trowel at the shop to break the glass of the window. “The accused, Motisingh Chauhan, worked at the house of Mohit Maradia in Basant Bahar Society in Bopal about two years ago,” said a police officer. “He had vital information such as the place where valuables were stored and the location of the CCTV cameras. He also knew that the high-tech digital door could not be broken.” Chauhan, who was working as domestic help at another person’s house on Sindhu Bhavan Road, decided to shed weight to slip inside his target’s home through the kitchen window. “He told us that he had food just once a day for about three months to reduce his weight from 75kg to 65kg,” said the officer. “His current employer told us that Chauhan used to skip dinner citing his diet.” Chauhan entered Maradia’s house on November 5 and stole valuables worth Rs 37 lakh. As he was not caught by the CCTV cameras, cops used human intelligence and found his footage from a hardware shop in Bopal. Later, on the basis of Chauhan’s cellphone location, cops caught him from SP Ring Road when he was about to board a bus to his native place in Udaipur. He had the loot with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/to-fit-opportunitys-window-he-lost-10kg-for-rs-37l-booty/articleshow/87745616.cms||---

During an interaction, Sisodia highlighted the achievements of AAP government in Delhi, saying if voted to power, the party will ensure a business-friendly government in Uttarakhand as well. "Delhi government ended the ‘raid raj’, saving traders and businessmen from harassment caused due to raids. We believe if the traders progress, the people too progress," Sisodia told traders. While seeking cooperation in forming a government in Uttarakhand, Sisodia said, "Since AAP came to power in Delhi, traders need not go to any office in the national capital. There are 125 departments in Delhi, where government employees themselves go to people’s doorsteps and provide necessary documents." He further added that Delhi's capita income has increased to Rs 3,54,000, resulting in overall development of people of Delhi and increased tax revenue. "We are going to introduce a single-window system in Uttarakhand if AAP government comes to power," said Delhi deputy CM.

As AICC has declared an organizational poll and the membership drive has begun for this, Chandy is of the view that there was no point in going ahead with the appointment of the new secretaries for KPCC and also the new committees in state districts. Senior leaders like Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala are upset with the way KPCC president K Sudhakaran is going ahead with the restructuring of party committees. “There are certain grievances and complaints regarding the party's revamp. All such issues will be discussed and a solution will be evolved soon,” said AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, who is in charge of Kerala affairs, when asked about Chandy’s meeting with the AICC president. However, state leadership is unhappy with the way senior leaders like Chandy and Chennithala are approaching the AICC against party revamp. “AICC has not stopped party restructuring. It has given the go ahead and KPCC executive committee has also taken a decision on this. These are enough for party revamp,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan, while reacting to Chandy’s scheduled meet in Delhi. It is learnt that Chennithala is also reaching New Delhi this week to meet the AICC president with the same grievance. Both leaders are upset with the state leadership since KPCC president had agreed that he would go ahead with the party revamp only after having consultations with the AICC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/speculations-arise-over-chandys-delhi-visit/articleshow/87745625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Health department vaccination data showed that the per day jabs administered crossed 7 lakh for the first time on Saturday and Monday since October 18. The state administered 6.6 lakh shots till Tuesday evening. The daily jabs in the past few days, barring Sunday (usually a lean day), have thus been highest since some time now. State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI that the current target was to complete all the first doses in Maharashtra by November-end. “Accordingly, a daily target of 10 lakh jabs is being kept in sight,” he said. Currently, the state is yet to cover nearly 24% of its 9.14 crore eligible population with first jabs. Dr Desai said, “In the last two days, Maharashtra’s daily jabs have increased, the average being higher than almost a month. The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme was started last week and took some time to pick up momentum as the districts were still collating data on the left-out beneficiaries. We have covered 76% of the eligible population with first doses in the state, and aim to cover the rest by this month-end. Maharashtra is expected to keep up the current level of daily jabs.” The daily average for shots administered in the state had plunged to 3-4 lakh since October third week, owing to the festive season and the huge gap (84 days) between the first and second doses of Covishield and fall in beneficiaries’ footfalls at the inoculation sites. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, however, said the number of jabs administered in Pune in the last couple of days had not shown any major improvement, being nearly 35,000 on average. “However, conditions may improve during the next four to five days not only as the pace of the programme picks up but also because the November-end period is likely to see a huge number of beneficiaries becoming due for their second shots,” he said. An official from the district health department, Thane, said the district administered over 64,000 jabs on Monday, with the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme being on. “Surveys are on at the village and city level to find the first and second dose beneficiaries. We are organizing separate vaccination camps in areas that have a higher number of beneficiaries for the pending vax doses. The programme picked up pace since Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-count-in-state-surges-again-after-a-months-low/articleshow/87745609.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Covovax trial includes kids aged 2-6 years||PUNE: Covishield maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has scaled up the paediatric trial of Covovax by including children in the two to six years age bracket across 10 sites in India, including Pune. The vaccine maker started off Covovax trials among children in August this year. Initially, the trial enrolled adolescents in the 12-17 years category and was later expanded by enrolling children in the 7-11 age group. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax will have a total of 920 children — 460 in the 12 to 17 years category, 230 in the 7-11 age group and another 230 in 2-6 age group. “As per the trial design, we have been expanding the trial after ensuring the vaccine safety among 100 children from each group in the reverse order of age. We first did that in adolescents and then included children in the 7-11 age group. Now, we have started enrolling children in the 2-6 age group after seeking due regulatory permissions,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India this year and for children by April 2022. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculating with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “We enrolled the first child in the 2-6 age group in Pune on November 11. We intend to enrol 25-30 kids in this (2-6 years) age cohort.” Earlier, Bharati Hospital had enrolled 35 children in the adolescent age group and 21 children in the 7-11 age bracket for the Covovax trial. KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covovax-trial-includes-kids-aged-2-6-years/articleshow/87745603.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||I like when people say FC Goa are the favourites: Juan Ferrando||Panaji: The word everywhere is that FC Goa are among the favourites to win this edition of the Indian Super League. There are stronger teams like Mumbai City and ATK Mohun Bagan, who finished top two last season. Others have strengthened themselves considerably, but Goa – with almost the same squad as last season and few additions – should fancy their chances, given how they performed in the AFC Champions League. Coach Juan Ferrando has heard all the talk. “We are the team to get the trophy,” Ferrando told reporters on Wednesday. “I like when some people talk about FC Goa like that. It is good words for FC Goa. Most important is thinking about the first game.” Goa have been the most consistent team in the ISL but have never won the trophy. They lost two finals in 2015 and 2018. Last season, they lost in the semi-finals against eventual champions Mumbai on penalties. This season, Ferrando wants his players to be on the same level when they start their campaign against the defending champions on Monday. The Spaniard believes his ideology will be the key factor to help the team deliver good results, if there’s injuries and suspensions. “In case of cards and injuries all the players should be ready, and the level of the team is more or less the same. I understand the technical details might not be the same. But about football, controlling the spaces, time of the press for me is very important,” said Ferrando. Goa started pre-season in August itself and then took part in the month-long Durand Cup in Kolkata. Winning Asia’s oldest tournament has boosted their morale and made them hungry for more. Goa missed key players like Brandon Fernandes, Glan Martins and Seriton Fernandes in the last-four stage of the competition as they were on national duty. But Ferrando is proud of how other players stepped up in their absence. “I think the word is to improve. Because of course our target is for the team to play in one style, one methodology. I want to help the players this way. My point of view and of the club is the big success to see the team play on the same level in case of injuries,” said Ferrando. Goa return to the ISL after more than eight months. While most teams have been out of competitive football, Ferrando’s team was engaged in the AFC Champions League and the Durand Cup which gave the players more exposure. Along the way, Goa handed debuts to their developmental team players and unearthed talent such as 19-year-old Mohammed Nemil. The arrival of India U-17 World Cupper Anwar Ali has created plenty of buzz too. While Goa have certainly improved, others are not too far behind. “When I see the players of the squads, I know the league will be very competitive. For me this season 11 teams will be striving to be in the playoffs. We have a very good squad, but in the end, we will see if we make the play-offs. After four-five games, we will see what happens in the ISL,” said Ferrando. Unlike last season, mere semifinal appearance won’t be enough for the fans. The expectations from fans are high. At least, that’s the word everywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-like-when-people-say-fc-goa-are-the-favourites-juan-ferrando/articleshow/87767299.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

SOG sleuths had received a tip-off about marijuana farming at Umathi village of Kawant based on which a police team raided the farm. They found 127 marijuana plants on the farm of Sildar Rathwa and Tama Rathwa. While Sildar was arrested, Tama has been declared as wanted as he was not found there. The duo was booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at Kawant police station. Police said that the seized 127 plants weighed over 240 kg with a market value of over Rs 24 lakh. Sildar will be produced before a special NDPS court on Wednesday and his remand will be sought to investigate who had supplied the marijuana seeds to him and to whom he was planning to sell the drugs. In the last month, this is the fifth arrest of a farmer in Chhota Udepur for growing marijuana in their farms and backyard. Earlier, police had arrested four farmers in different parts of the district and seized marijuana worth Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmer-held-for-growing-marijuana/articleshow/87745018.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BJP trying to play communal card ahead of Uttarakhand polls: Harish Rawat||In an exclusive conversation with TOI, former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat slammed the BJP for trying to create a Hindu-Muslim rift ahead of the upcoming assembly polls. The senior Congress leader also cleared the air on CM Pushkar Singh Dhami's recent allegation that "a former CM had announced a holiday on Fridays for namaz” saying no such government order was issued during his tenure as CM. Excerpts from an interview with Kautilya Singh: Q. You have been targeted by Union home minister Amit Shah and CM Dhami over Friday namaz holiday? The formula of playing the communal card is a tried and tested one for BJP, and it is trying to do the same in Uttarakhand ahead of the assembly elections. Rather than talking about development and work done by the BJP government, top BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, are levelling baseless allegations against me. Currently, they have all the power and wherewithal to find out the facts. I challenge them to produce a copy of the so-called government order -- which they say was issued during my tenure as CM --- that made Friday a holiday for facilitating people to offer namaaz. Q. You are claiming that no such government order was issued during your tenure? Has anyone in this country – with the exception of a handful of top BJP leaders – ever heard about Friday being declared a holiday by a government? How can a government take a decision when there was no such request from any section of the citizens? During my tenure as CM, there was a request for a holiday on the occasion of Parushram Jayanti but no request was made for making Friday a holiday. Some media channels tried to highlight the issue, but there was no truth in the matter. BJP leaders are free to speak to the departments concerned to get a copy of the order. They do not talk about facts. This is just an attempt to spread hatred and hide the BJP government’s failures on issues such as employment, migration, anti-people decisions and the deteriorating economy. Q. Will going to the Uttarakhand polls without a CM face hurt Congress’s prospects? I have given up on the issue. Earlier, I had made my stand clear and cited the importance of going into an election with a CM face. I had highlighted some examples in some states where the party had performed well in an election by projecting a CM face. During election campaigns, we make promises to people and someone should be made accountable for fulfilling those promises if the party is voted to power. It is now up to the party leadership of Uttarakhand to convey to the national leaders whether we should go with or without a CM face. Q. The way AAP and BJP national leadership is targeting you, is it turning out to be a fight between only you and them? BJP is well aware of the fact that the party is on its way out in the state. AAP’s top leaders come to Uttarakhand to spend a few days at picturesque locations as tourists. I am their target as they are well aware of the ground reality. Had BJP worked for five years, its senior leaders would have focused on development in their speeches. So, they are relying more on levelling baseless allegations against me rather than projecting development activities, if any, carried out by them. Similarly, AAP is aware about BJP’s dismal performance and regards me as a challenge. It is not Harish Rawat versus others, but Congress versus others. Being a senior leader, I am often on the receiving end of other political parties. Q. Recently, you have locked horns with CM Dhami and other ministers over the issue of employment? During the previous Congress regime, employment was provided to 32,000 youths. Now, the BJP is not able to reach anywhere close to that number. A few months back, the BJP government announced to provide 24,000 odd jobs, but how many people will actually get jobs before the state polls. Failure on the part of the BJP government to generate jobs forced people and talented youths to migrate from the state. A state minister did come up with some numbers regarding jobs given by the government, but it is a late effort to hide the BJP government’s failure. Q. After Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s announcement in UP, will 40% tickets be given to women candidates in Uttarakhand as well? It is the responsibility of party seniors like me to create an atmosphere where more and more women can be encouraged to enter politics. My daughter Anupama has written to the national and state leadership regarding 40% reservation of seats for women. Because of the vision of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, women got reservation in panchayat elections. Q. Has the tiff in Punjab Congress ended? Will the issue impact the party in state polls? I have already said that “all is well” in Punjab Congress. We will collectively fight the Punjab assembly elections. The party has given a very good chief minister to Punjab in the form of Charanjit Singh Channi, and the party is confident that he will take decisions related to public welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-trying-to-play-communal-card-ahead-of-uttarakhand-polls-harish-rawat/articleshow/87744795.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Petition against TTD: Cannot interfere in temple rituals, says SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that constitutional courts cannot interfere in daily rituals and practices in a temple on the basis of a writ petition and said that if any devotee is aggrieved by any deficiency or violation of rituals she/he has to file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum seeking relief. "If a devotee is aggrieved by non-performance of any daily ritual properly or deviation from daily practices in a temple, he/she can file a civil suit or approach an appropriate forum for grievance redressal. The high courts and the Supreme Court cannot deal with it," said a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli. The ruling came on a petition filed by Srivari Dadaa, who had accused the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Trust Board of deviating from daily rituals. The Andhra Pradesh HC had on January 5 rejected the petitioner's PIL and said, "procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others". TTD is an independent trust that manages temples including the famous Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple at Tirumala. Daadaa has alleged that the temple authority has been performing sevas - Abhishekam Seva, Thomala Seva, Arjitha Brahmotsavam, Yekanta Utsavalu and Maha Laghu Darshan - in a "wrongful and irregular procedure". However, the apex court clarified that if a Devaswom Board or temple administration is failing in its duty to make proper arrangements for the devotees or indulging in maladministration of the temple, then a devotee could be permitted to seek redressal of her/his grievances before the HCs or the SC through a writ petition. Agreeing with the AP HC, the CJI-led bench said, "the constitutional courts cannot start interfering with the daily rituals of the temple and its customs and practices, as it is not judicially manageable. Can we manage daily puja? Which law mandates that constitutional courts can interfere in daily rituals. Can we dictate to the temple authorities how a coconut is to be broken in front of the deity? Can we tell the priests how to carry out aarti? This appears to be a publicity interest litigation. If you have any grievances about the carrying out of sevas, then file a suit before an appropriate court seeking redressal by leading evidence." About the petitioner's allegations regarding discrimination of devotees and denial of "darshan", the SC asked the TTD to respond to the petitioner's representation listing out the deficiencies. "The temple administration is directed to give a proper response within eight weeks to the petitioner. If he feels his grievances have not been addressed properly by the authorities, then he can seek appropriate remedy before a suitable forum," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/petition-against-ttd-cannot-interfere-in-temple-rituals-says-sc/articleshow/87746848.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Doctors too were surprised when the ultrasound revealed Sarita’s first prenatal sonography since she conceived. Childless since 18 years, the couple had lost hopes of becoming parents. They never thought the pain Sarita was going through during the last nine months could be due to pregnancy. The team at AIIMS provided multi-disciplinary care with cardiologists, anesthesiologists, neonatologists and obstetricians pitching in to conduct this unique experience of managing a patient who had undergone a cardiac bypass surgery and still delivered a healthy baby. Such a case is rarely reported in literature, claimed doctors at AIIMS. “Almost 17 years ago, Sarita had a pregnancy that ended in the 5th month. She never got pregnant since then. She developed a heart disease later and had to undergo bypass surgery (CABG) 4 years ago. She was on treatment for chronic hypertension and diabetes. After tests, we decided to go for an elective cesarean,” said Dr Shuchita Mundle from the team of obstetricians at AIIMS. The team also had Dr Anita Yadav and Dr Neha Gangane. Cardiologist Dr Gunjan Ghodeshwar looked after the heart condition of the patient. The C-Section was done on October 27 and a healthy girl weighing 3.2kg was born. The happy and grateful mother and baby were discharged recently with certain gudelines to be followed. According to neonatologist Dr Nishant Banait, many things were unknown about the baby. Throughout the pregnancy, the mother was taking medication for her heart condition and diabetes, which are known to be harmful to a growing fetus. “Fortunately, the baby was born with a good size and without any malformations. However, there was a hick-up when the baby dropped its sugar levels within the first 24 hours, which was taken care of swiftly by our NICU team,” said Dr Banait. One of the challenges was continuing the mother’s medication while she continues to breastfeed her baby. The team had a discussion with the child’s parents and informed them about the benefits of breastfeeding the baby versus the chances of harm caused by medication (a low probability) the mother is receiving. Parents took an informed decision and the baby was allowed to breastfeed. Dr Avinash Prakash, assistant professor, department of anaesthesiology said it was challenging to provide anesthesia to the patient. “Apart from hypertension, diabetes, and bypass surgery, the patient also had a history of lumbar spine surgery some 8 years ago,” he said. Maj Gen Dr Vibha Dutta, sirector, and CEO of AIIMS, said it was teamwork that handled such a rare case. “AIIMS is committed to provide safe maternity and child care in a most modern and well-equipped birthing centre. To take care of the need of infertile couples, AIIMS is going to start an ART centre which will provide services like embryo culture, embryo transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unaware-of-pregnancy-woman-with-bypass-history-delivers-healthy-baby/articleshow/87745629.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Only 81% HCWs in district administered first shot||PUNE: Ten months after the vaccination drive against Covid-19 started, only 81% of healthcare workers (HCWs) have received their first shot in the district. A District Health Office (DHO) report stated that out of the 1.98 lakh target HCW beneficiaries, 1.61 lakh have been administered the first dose, and 1.39 lakh have taken their second shot. The HCWs were the first beneficiaries with whom the vaccination drive had started across the country from January 16. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of Hospital Board of India of Indian Medical Association, said most of the healthcare workers in the region have been vaccinated, and there could be other reasons why it is not reflecting in the beneficiary list. “There is a possibility of overlapping of beneficiary names in the database of the civic body and that of the district health office. Also, the registration of the HCWs had started before the vaccination, which was closed soon after. The closed registration forced many HCWs to take the jab under the regular category of their respective age.” “Had there been a few special sessions when the vaccination was made open to all, it would have been easier to ascertain the exact data of the HCWs vaccinated,” he said, adding that most of the HCWs have been vaccinated across the district. Suryakant Devkar, the chief immunisation officer of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said they have vaccinated almost all the beneficiaries from the respective categories, but if someone is yet to get one they can visit the designated vaccination site across the civic limit. On the 74% first dose vaccination of HCWs in the civic limits, Vikas Dhakane, the additional commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said the number could be different from the DHO and he will check the data of the PCMC health department. On Tuesday, around 40,044 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district at 649 sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-81-hcws-in-dist-administered-first-shot/articleshow/87745624.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Obstetricians in the city have launched initiatives to address vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women and have been counselling them to get the jab. “About 80% of my patients have taken both doses. We are increasingly seeing vaccine hesitancy diminishing among pregnant women, as we have been telling them about the serious implications of contracting Covid during pregnancy,” Sunita Tandulwadkar, president of Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society , said. Tandulwadkar, who is also chief IVF consultant and endoscopist at Ruby Hall Clinic, said most of her patients seeking in vitro fertilization too were vaccinated. “Obstetricians and gynaecologists at city, state and national levels are working hard to promote vaccination among pregnant women through webinars, live programmes and awareness campaigns,” she said. FOGSI vice-president Bipin Pandit said vaccine hesitancy had crept in among pregnant women due to erroneous messages on social media and other platforms. Pandit said 100% of his patients were vaccinated. Senior gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte, owner and medical director of Gupte hospital, said obstetricians play a major role in ensuring their patients were jabbed. “Patients always ask us before opting for vaccination and thus, doctors have a big role to play..”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-hesitancy-among-pregnant-women-shrinks/articleshow/87745613.cms||Neha Madaan

The PMC had set up 20 Covid care centres, but none of them is occupied now, forcing the civic body to close them, officials said. According to PMC data, 13 Covid care centres were developed during the second wave, comprising around 4,700 beds. Ten more facilities were set up later, but were kept on hold due to poor demand. They have the capacity of 4,200 beds. “The demand for these facilities has reduced over the months. Even during the second wave, there was hardly any demand for the beds in these centres. So, PMC has decided to shut them,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior official of PMC. As per civic officials, the issue of manpower to run these facility had cropped up they were set up. The PMC had planned to rope in staff to keep this facilities running, but due to lack of demand, recruitment was kept on hold. The civic administrations had given extension to some medical staff members, who were working on contract at the civic centres. These contractual employees have now been given the responsibility of other civic medical services. “Some of the Covid centres were functioning in the dedicated Covid hospitals. Four of these hospitals have now been opened for other patients,” said a PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-shutting-down-covid-care-centres-as-cases-drop/articleshow/87745618.cms||---

The award will be given at the 24th session of the UNWTO general assembly on December 2, in Madrid. “On behalf of the people of Pochampally and the people of Telangana, I am grateful that this award has been bestowed on the village of Pochampally. I am also grateful to the ministry officials for presenting the case for Pochampally and other entries effectively,” G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of culture, tourism and development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), said. The best tourism villages by UNWTO pilot initiative aims to award those villages which are outstanding examples of rural destinations and showcases good practices in line with its specified evaluation areas. It also aims to support villages to enhance their rural tourism potential through training and access to opportunities for improvement. The ministry of tourism had recommended three villages for the award -- Kongthong in Meghalaya, Ladhpura Khas in Madhya Pradesh and Pochampally in Telangana. Pochampally is about 50 km from Hyderabad and is often referred to as the silk city of India for the exquisite sarees that are woven through a unique style called Ikat. This style, Pochampally Ikat, received a Geographical Indicator (GI status) in 2004 and is also known as Bhoodan Pochampally to commemorate the Bhoodan movement that was launched by Acharya Vinobha Bhave from this village on April 18, 1951. The ministry of tourism said it has drafted a rural tourism policy which will not only promote tourism within our villages but also revitalise local arts and crafts and promote the rural economy. “It will help redevelop and rebuild our villages and rural life and the residents of the villages will also get an opportunity to engage and interact with people from outside,” Kishan Reddy added. He urged the citizens to include rural destinations such as Pochampally that have a rich cultural heritage in their travel itinerary and explore the beauty of the villages in our country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pochampally-indias-silk-city-is-worlds-best-tourism-village/articleshow/87746860.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The active case tally in the region ranged between 2,000 and 2,150 in the last few days without any significant increase in cases with the Monday evening tally dipping to 1,995. Active cases in Pimpri Chinchwad stayed below 500, while case count in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits has been around 800. District health office data revealed that rural areas continued to report significant drop in cases. Patient count dropped to 759 in rural pockets on Monday, almost equal to the count in the PMC limits. In the last two days, rural areas have added less number of Covid-19 patients, as against cases recorded in the PMC limits. Health officials said the district’s urban and rural pockets have not reported significant rise in daily cases after the festivals. Cases, however, have gone up slightly in the PMC limits. Assistant medical chief at PMC’s health department Sanjeev Wavre said, “Daily cases have remained below 100 barring a couple of days since the festivities. We are monitoring the cases. Daily testing continued to stay above 4,000.” The region’s positivity rate dropped below 1% on Monday. In the two days prior Monday, it was 1.8% and 1.5%. The region collectively has been testing over 10,000 samples everyday. The daily positivity rate stayed below 2% in PMR in the last seven days. “Though we have started other medical services at the PMC-run hospitals, the swab collection centres are functioning in full capacities. This is apart from the private laboratories conducting the Covid-19 tests,” said an official with the PMC’s health department. District health officer Bhagwan Pawar said, “Cases in rural areas recorded a steady drop. The situation is being monitored. The number of hotspots has declined after a drop in cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/active-caseload-in-pmr-declines-to-below-2000/articleshow/87745631.cms||Sarang Dastane

The valuation has been given in the final report submitted to the investigation team. MVD valued all eight vehicles, belonging to Mavunkal at his house in Kaloor. The highest price put for a vehicle is around Rs 14 lakh for a Land Rover and Rs 12 lakh for a five-seater Land Cruiser with Madhya Pradesh registration. “We already said in the primary report that the ‘luxury’ vehicles are altered/modified ones. A Mercedes Benz has been altered into a Porsche and we put the value at Rs 2.5 lakh for that. Since all these vehicles have not been used on roads, we do not find any offence regarding motor vehicles rules against him,” said an official. The value of a Limousine, which was converted from Benz, has been put around Rs 4.5 lakh. Of the total 38 vehicles possessed by Mavunkal, 30 are in Cherthala. Of these, 25 in Cherthala police station and all got damaged in the flood. Three vehicles are in workshop and two at his house at Cherthala. A crime branch officer, who is part of the investigation, said they received the MVD report on Tuesday and need to study it before taking another step. “Suspicion has been raised regarding the engine number of a vehicle, which we need to verify. He is not the RC owner of all the 38 vehicles. He possessed the vehicles paying only a few lakhs as all the vehicles are very old,” said the official. Currently, Mavunkal has been lodged at Kakkanad district jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/value-of-monsons-luxury-car-pegged-at-just-rs-1-5-lakh/articleshow/87745668.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Post rain, stray cattle causing accidents every day on NH 81||TRICHY: The national highway 81 (NH 81) connecting Trichy and Thanjavur districts has of late become an accident-prone stretch as cattle stray into the carriageway throughout the stretch hindering vehicular movement. On an average, the past month has reported more than 30 incidents involving a vehicle colliding with cattle and in most of the events, the animals were reported dead. Starting from Palpannai in Trichy city, NH 81 passes through Thiruverumbur and Thuvakudi urban areas as well as Devarayaneri and Asoor rural areas, where cattle menace is a common trouble for commuters. Cattle which are reared as livestock are let by owners into the NH to feed on the grass and plants that have grown in the recent monsoon. With at least 20-30 cattle flocking the highway at a time, instances of traffic getting affected are common, even near the NHAI toll plaza at Vazhavanthankottai. Regular commuters on the stretch which is dotted with National Institute of Technology (NIT) Trichy and Sastra university have complained of frequent non-fatal incidents disturbing the traffic during the night. “All on a sudden, a calf ran into the road and rammed my car even as I slowed down. I had to shell out Rs 20,000 to repair my car. ,” K Shyam Sundar, a research scholar in Bharathidasan University, said. As the cattle in bulk sleep near the medians and vacant space adjacent to the motorable way, two-wheeler riders are most vulnerable to a fatal fall. Villagers on the NH said that the usual grazing field in their hamlets was inundated in the recent rainfall and as the river beds are witnessing water flow, they lack adequate space to rear the cattle. However, even the urban parts of the stretch covering Ariyamangalam and Thiruverumbur witness similar nuisance. Commuters lamented that neither Trichy corporation nor the traffic police understand the severity of the cattle menace on the NH. Apart from the highways, even city roads including Karumandapam, Bharathiar road and Cantonment live with similar stray cattle menace. “We will discuss with other stakeholders to communicate with the panchayats and other local bodies to take action on the cattle intruding into the NH. Accidents due to cattle are reported on a daily basis,” an official source with NHAI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/post-rain-stray-cattle-causing-accidents-every-day-on-nh-81/articleshow/87745637.cms||Deepak Karthik

Due to the copious flow of water in the canal, people take baths and clean their vehicles on the banks, but now, residents have urged the forest department to be on vigil and monitor the canal. Vayalur Road residents near Somarasampettai spotted a 4-5ft long crocodile swimming in the water on Tuesday morning. Few days ago, residents near Uyyakondanthirumalai locality and suburban Trichy also reported sightings of a crocodile. Forest officials said that freshwater crocodiles usually migrate along the irrigation canals that originate from the Cauvery river. While some of the crocodiles will stay for a significant period in the canals adjoining Kulumani, Koppu and Ettarai villages during the monsoon, most of the crocodiles would migrate to the Cauvery river near Grand Anicut in Thanjavur district, forest officials said that. While the officials said that the crocodiles were harmless and there was no record of attack on humans or cattle in the city for the past 10 years, residents opined that kids enjoying a leisure dip in the river are at risk. “People are taking a pit-stop on the banks of the canal to spend some time after visiting temples with families. We cannot take any chances, the forest department can sensitise the local people about the movement of a crocodile,” Jai Ganesh, a resident of Vayalur Road said. As the canal is passing through several residential localities including Kuzhumayee Amman temple, Raja Colony, Alwarthope and Anna Nagar, local people expressed their fear over the possibility of the crocodile straying into residential areas. “We will place boards and sensitise people along the canal. The crocodiles will not stray in the area that has human movement, however, we will monitor the areas where the sighting was reported,” an official with the forest department said. The officials said that if spotted, the crocodile would be rescued and left into the Kollidam river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crocodile-spotted-in-uyyakondan-canal-in-trichy/articleshow/87745644.cms||---

He was taken off ventilator and moved to the general ward from ICU of medicine department on November 12. “He is maintaining on 2 litre oxygen and would be gradually made to breath on his own,” said associate professor Dr Milind Vyawahare, who led the team. Dr Prashant Patil, head of the department, said this is one of the many success stories of the medicine department. “We are working tirelessly with limited resources,” he said. The team comprised Dr Vyawahare (ICU in-charge), Dr Archana Aher, Dr Abhishek Pande, Dr Riya Saboo, Dr Shrijan Khandelwal, Dr Suraj Hiwarkar, Dr Saurabh Meshram, Dr Tushar Khadase, Dr Pooja Borlepawar, Dr Pradnya Gavit, Dr Saurabh Sharma, Dr Shital Bharsad and sister in-charge Geeta Kannake. Anand belongs to Gadchiroli where he was admitted to a local hospital following fever due to reaction of drugs given for epilepsy treatment in July. The fever went out of control and he developed blisters all over his body, besides breathlessness. He was shifted to GMCH on July 29. “He was denuded as his skin vanished due to merging of blisters. This is called Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, a skin disorder) overlap. He also had mucosal lesions (inside the mouth),” said Dr Vyawahare. Since the skin, which protects from external organisms, peeled off, it turned a source of entry for organisms leading to infection (sepsis). “Anand developed sepsis which caused multiorgan failure. Lungs were affected due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He was unable to breath as the lungs got swollen. His kidney got injured and BP was low,” said Dr Vyawahare. Anand also had thrombosis in cereberal venous sinuses. He was having continuous convulsions. “Anti-convulsion drugs may have aggravated SJS. So, we had limitations. We managed him on ventilator and controlled sepsis, ARDS, convulsions and renal functions,” he said. Dr Vyawahare said that before this, they have given prolonged ventilatory support to multiorgan dysfunction patient almost up to 5 months but those patients could not be saved and died. “This time, we saved this patient and successfully weaned him off from ventilator after 107 days with normal functioning of his vital organs,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/on-ventilator-for-107-days-gmch-docs-save-multiorgan-failure-patient/articleshow/87745660.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Nehru also directed the district administration and Trichy Corporation to construct new bridges to replace the damaged link roads across various canals. “Retaining walls with shutters will prevent the overflowing water from the Uyyakondan canal to the adjoining residential areas. In Lingam Nagar, retaining walls will be constructed at a cost of Rs 50 crore to prevent water overflowing from the Kodingal canal,” the minister said. Four vulnerable points in the city including Beschi Nagar in Woraiyur will undergo civil works to strengthen the canal bunds without affecting the public movement. Speaking about the encroachments on waterbodies, Nehru said that people are not cooperating with the eviction drives even if the authorities have a court order. “The smart cities mission programme mostly focussed on new public parks and multi-level car parking in particular areas. If they (previous government) had done their work properly in addressing the basic needs, such situation would not have come,” Nehru said. Later, inspecting the Karumandapam locality, the minister instructed the corporation and state highways department to widen the drain channels carrying surplus water from E Pudur and Kollankulam tank to the Koraiyar river. He also inspected the bund strengthening work underway along the Koraiyar river. The work on the Trichy side will prevent inundation in Selva Nagar, RMS Colony and Vasantha Nagar localities, the minister was told. He also instructed the PWD and the corporation to clear the weeds on the banks of channels and canals and desilt the waterbodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/retaining-walls-to-be-built-along-trichy-canals-to-stop-inundation/articleshow/87745653.cms||---

This has left the parents worried as the state government had already allowed schools to reopen with 100% capacity from November 15. The state government guidelines do not direct schools to continue online classes for students who are still scared to come to school amid mild rise in Covid cases. Majority of the schools have discontinued online classes after the government gave permission to reopen with 100% capacity, even as parents are demanding online classes to continue. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sanyukt Abhibhavak Sangh, said they were getting complaints from parents from all across the city that they were forced to send their wards to school as online classes had been stopped. “After Diwali, there has been a rise in Covid cases in the state. How can the government guarantee social distancing for the small kids? They are playing with lives of students who are vulnerable. The government should make it clear its stand on online classes. They should not leave this discretion in the hands of private schools who are here to reap benefits,” said Bittu. Parents association have given a seven-day ultimatum to the government to issue order to implement online classes as well or they will take to streets to protect their rights. Last year, seven teachers tested positive during complete lockdown when a private school called teachers to school to take online classes. For schools that do not have adequate facility for online classes and parents coming from lower income backgrounds cannot afford gadgets, offline classes are the only option. Majority of parents from that social background are relieved that schools have opened up and education of students can finally take a step forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-students-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/87746330.cms||---

TP executive officer Maheboob Jeelani has constructed a badminton court in his office premises by spending his money. This is to improve the efficiency among the staff members by helping them unwind. Now, they play badminton before and after the office hours. Jeelani has also decorated his office with the portraits of great personalities. Jeelani told TOI: “All this is to ensure people get better services from the office. Our staff would be tired after working from morning till evening, prompting some of them to smoke or booze to unwind. But if they are made to involve in any physical activity, they get rejuvenated without having to surrender to bad habits. If they go home smiling, their family members too will be happy, and this collectively get them ready for the next working day. In the larger iterest of the public, I have built this court.” When asked about the cost of his pet project, the officer said he did not keep account of the expenses on what he termed ‘love’s labour’. “It did not cost me big,” he added. He has also beautified the interiors of the office. “Photos of great souls were stored in a room. We cleaned the entire office and put those photo up on the walls. They are needed to celebrate the birth anniversary of great personalities as per the government order,” he stated. Rajanikant Nimbalkar, manager of the office, said higher officers usually do not think about keeping their subordinates rejuvenated. “With our executive officer motivating us to play, many staff members are coming early to office and play badminton.

The government college teachers are facing many problems here. There are not adequate numbers of staff, and full-time faculty are on deputation to colleges,” said a senior PU lecturer. Regarding the difficulties, the lecturer said that offline classes in colleges began 45 days back, however, the DPUE has stated that close to 60% of the portion will be covered in the mid-term examination. “How is it possible to cover 60% of the syllabus, when classes have hardly been held for 45 days? The evaluation of government college students are done by private college teachers. This is not fair, as there is a huge learning gap among private and government college students,” the lecturer said. Another lecturer said, “It has been announced all of a sudden, and there is insufficient time to prepare for the examination. Most of the government college students who work on weekends prepare for examinations only after December.” “The department has asked lecturers to evaluate 30 papers a day, and also conduct classes after the mid-term examination. This is impractical,” said a PU lecturer. Karnataka PU College Lecturers Association president Ningegowda A H, in a letter to the DPUE, has expressed concern over the shortage of manpower for the midterm examination. “The department should have announced mid-term examination plans during the start of the academic year. It is cumbersome and unscientific to evaluate examination papers as well as conduct classes. Evaluation by guest faculty is not a welcome move. The department has not yet uploaded model question papers, and it would have saved more time if mid-term examinations of both I PU and II PU were conducted simultaneously,’’ he said. C D Jayanna, DDPU, Dakshina Kannada said that they have not received any memorandum from government college PU lecturers regarding the inconvenience. Meanwhile, PU students, including those from private colleges have also opposed mid-term examinations, which have been announced in a hurry. The DPUE has proposed to change the midterm examination pattern this academic year, where it will prepare question papers, and instead of at the district level, there will be centralised evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pu-lecturers-students-oppose-ii-pu-mid-term-examination/articleshow/87743982.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Chief minister M K Stalin has announced a compensation of up to Rs 20,000 per hectare for crops that were damaged during the recent rains. The government also announced to provide agriculture input to farmers. A statement issued by K Balakrishnan said that the heavy rain and floods have completely damaged the crops ready for harvest and the recently transplanted samba nurseries in the delta districts, which caused great economic loss to the farmers. He welcomed the chief minister’s visit to the rain-affected areas and his consoling of the farmers. However, the relief announced by the government for crop loss is not sufficient, he said. Farmers have to spend Rs 50,000 to raise paddy crops in a hectare and up to Rs 20,000 per acre. So, the amount announced would in no way compensate for the loss incurred by the farmers in delta , Balakrishnan said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cpm-seeks-to-enhance-compensation/articleshow/87745664.cms||---

Kanota police also claimed that the accused was seen carrying a sword-like object, concealed in a cloth about two hours before the crime. “All these testimonies by locals further raised suspicion on the accused’s involvement in the crime. We had interrogated him but he was dilly-dallying. He parried questions from interrogators about his suspected movement in the area before the crime. He finally admitted to the crime,” an official claimed, adding that Sonu said he killed the contractor because the latter was allegedly had a relationship with his wife. Officials said police teams from Bassi and Kanota were asked to probe the case and they held the accused on Tuesday morning. “We had first suspected the accused’s involvement in the crime when locals told us about how Sonu often expressed his deep-seated anger towards the victim.

---||Jaipur||SC panel seeks report on Barmer, Jodhpur mishaps||Jaipur: The Supreme Court committee on road safety has sought a report on accidents involving death of at least 12 people in a bus-tanker collision on Barmer-Jodhpur highway less than a week back and by a speeding white Audi hitting the people riding two-wheelers on a busy road in Jodhpur, involving death of one person and injuring others. The committee has asked the Rajasthan transport and road safety department to submit this report by November 30 along with action plan to stop such accidents from occurring in future. The state transport department has also constituted an investigation committee to look into the cause of the accidents which will be submitted in the coming days. In the letter addressed to the state government, the committee said that it has taken a serious view of these two road accidents which occurred and the desired a detailed report on each of the two road accidents. It also asked that the state government should take necessary steps to prevent occurrence of such accidents happening due, amongst others, to poor enforcement and over-speeding. The report on safety measures proposed to be taken by the state to prevent such accidents in future, should also be sent to the committee. Just a week back, at least 12 people, including an infant, were killed and 39 others severely burnt after a busload of travellers was engulfed in an inferno upon crashing into a trailer going down the wrong lane of the Barmer-Jodhpur highway. Prior to this, one person died and eight others were injured when a luxury car lost its balance and rammed into roadside makeshift huts in Jodhpur. According to eyewitnesses, the car had been moving at a high speed and had a blast before losing its balance and drifting to shanties. The government assured of monetary compensation to the families of the deceased as well as injured in both the accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-panel-seeks-report-on-barmer-jodhpur-mishaps/articleshow/87746356.cms||---
---||Lucknow||It’s an expressway for development of the new Uttar Pradesh, says PM Modi||LUCKNOW/SULTANPUR: Hailing the Purvanchal expressway as a medium to take the state towards a brighter future, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he could not have imagined that he would land on the same expressway of which he laid the foundation stone three years ago. Speaking after inaugurating India's longest functional expressway (341 km), he said: “It is an expressway for development of new UP, a reflection of modernized facilities and a certification of turning Sankalp into Siddhi," recounting various upcoming expressways including Ganga expressway, Bundelkhand expressway, Gorakhpur Link expressway and Ballia Link expressway. He said that the development of the state was planned not just for five year but keeping in mind the entire decade. He also witnessed the Airshow on the 3.2 km long airstrip constructed on the Expressway in Sultanpur district. The event at Sultanpur ended with an air show by Mirage, Jaguar, Sukhoi & AN-32 before the PM took off for Delhi in a C-130J HerculesIAF jets perform aerial stunts during inauguration of Purvanchal ewayModi said that the state was poised for a balanced development with “samman” (respect) for West UP measuring equally with the “prathmikta” (priority) for east UP. “Purvanchal Expressway has not only filled the gap between east and west but will also facilitate movement of people from Bihar and Delhi,” he further said. Modi stressed that the expressway will also bring enormous employment opportunities through the industries which are proposed to be set up in the Purvanchal Expressway Industrial Corridor, underscoring that the project will especially be of great help for the areas which are still “underdeveloped”. The PM lauded CM Yogi Adityanath and his team, and the people of UP on the completion of Purvanchal Expressway. He also thanked the farmers whose land was acquired for this project. He lauded the workers and the engineers who were involved in the project. The PM remarked that the security of the country was equally important as the prosperity of the country. He said that keeping that in mind, emergency landing provision for fighter jets is made while constructing the Purvanchal Expressway. He said that the roar of these planes will be for those who ignored the defense infrastructure in the country for decades. Modi said that with the active participation of the people, the dream of development of UP was now visible. "New medical colleges are being built, AIIMS is coming up, modern educational institutions are being built in UP. Just a few weeks ago the international airport in Kushinagar was inaugurated," he said. The PM said it was also a fact that parts of a vast state like UP were earlier cut off from each other to a great extent. People used to go to different parts of the state but they were troubled due to lack of connectivity. For the people of East Uttar Pradesh, even reaching Lucknow was quite a task. He noted that for industrial development of Uttar Pradesh, excellent connectivity is necessary, every corner of UP needs to be connected. He said as expressways are getting ready in UP, the work of the industrial corridor has also started. Very soon new industries will start coming up around Purvanchal Expressway. He said that the Defence Corridor being built in UP was also going to bring new employment opportunities here. He said these infrastructure works in UP, will give new heights to the economy in the future. The PM said today the double engine government in UP was working considering the common people of UP as their family. An environment is being created for new factories. He said keeping in mind the needs of this decade, infrastructure is being built to build a prosperous Uttar Pradesh. The PM also lauded the Government of Uttar Pradesh for its excellent work done for Corona Vaccination. He lauded the people of UP for not allowing any political propaganda against the vaccine made in India to propagate. He said the government is working day and night for the all-round development of UP. Along with connectivity, top priority is also being given to infrastructure in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-its-an-expressway-for-development-of-the-new-up/articleshow/87746361.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: This surgeon cured 8,000 epilepsy patients at free camps in 22 years||JODHPUR: Pokar Ram, who hails from a village in Barmer district, was put on fetter since a young age in his own house. Having been dubbed as possessed, he was at the mercy of the village godman for his treatment, which however, showed no hope. In 2000, he reached the free epilepsy camp run by a neurosurgeon of Jodhpur and underwent treatment, which lasted for over five years. “He is leading a normal life working at a salt company in Saurasthra with his wife and two children,” said Nagendra Sharma, whose camps have affected the lives of 80,067 such patients since the inception of his free medical camps back in 1999. This is just one example. In these 22 years, over 8,000 patients are fully cured and came out of the trauma of ostracisation and social stigma of having ‘mirgi’, as epilepsy is commonly identified as. Sharma decided to hold these camps seeing the absence of proper treatment for the poor patients and their falling into the trap of village godmen due to widespread superstitions linking the disease with ‘possession by spirits’. Considering the inability of the poor rural patients to afford the treatment, which cost around Rs 800 for a month’s dose, he arranged for free medicines for them so that they could continue the treatment. One of his camp coordinators Kishan Prajapat said that in these 22 years of journey, many have gotten married and settled in life, many started working to lead an independent life and many children were enabled to resume their education, which they were forced to quit due to bouts of fits. Sharma said that the camps and these success stories have brought a huge change in the perception of the disease, especially among the villagers and they have started frequenting these camps for treatment instead of approaching godmen and have been recovering. He has also been running awareness campaigns in villages with literature printed for distribution. He has also written two books on epilepsy. His team has also started an initiative for financial independence of these patients, which are normally not accepted by the society. They have arranged for their vocational training as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/this-surgeon-cured-8k-epilepsy-patients-at-free-camps-in-22-yrs/articleshow/87746348.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farmers’ stir will not impact entire Chandigarh in MC polls, says Arun Sood||CHANDIGARH: The ongoing farmers’ protest will not have an impact on entire Chandigarh, said BJP city president Arun Sood, who invited Chandigarh residents to share their suggestions/aspirations. The party would prepare a vision document, (Sankalp Patra) for the 2021 MC elections based on these suggestions and aspirations, Sood said. Addressing a press conference, Sood said the ongoing farmers’ stir would only affect small pockets rather than the entire city and the party was prepared for that. Responding to a question, Sood said that farm leader Rakesh Tikait did not have a standing in Chandigarh. Recently, Tikait urged people not to vote for the BJP in the forthcoming MC elections. Sood said this statement would not affect Chandigarh residents. On the contrary, he said, wherever Rakesh Tikait or “so-called” farmer leaders issued a statement against the BJP, the vote share increased. He said this was last seen in Haryana’s Ellenabad by-election, where Rakesh Tikait and farmer leaders’ statement was followed by increase in BJP’s vote count by 15,000. He claimed the rate of inflation was under control in comparison with the situation under the Congress regime. Sood said the BJP wanted to ensure public participation in the process of making Chandigarh a world class city .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-movement-will-not-impact-entire-chandigarh-arun-sood/articleshow/87744872.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Farmers said a breach on the banks of Konakadungalaru had caused the situation. They are struggling to drain the rainwater to save standing crops. Following the rain, a 20-foot-long breach occurred on the banks of Konakadungalaru near Varagur and Aimbathumel Nagarm in Thiruvaiyaru taluk. Rainwater flowed through the breach and submerged crops raised on about 1,500 acres in Aimbathumel Nagaram, Kadambangudi, Varagur, Nadukavery, Anthali and Kuzhimathur villages. The 15-day transplanted nursery also submerged in water, farmers said. Konakadungalaru takes a course from Vennaru river near Agarapettai and merges with Vettaru near Nagathi village. The river irrigates about 3,000 acres of agricultural land in its path. Farmers said a huge growth of hyacinth accumulated on the upper stream of a causeway that bridges Aimbathumel Nagaram and Anthali villages.Thiruvaiyaru tahsildar Nedunchezhian and VAO Rajesh arrived at the spot and expedited the removal of hyacinth with the help of around 50 farmers. The farmers appealed to the authorities to build a bridge across the river to facilitate free flow of water.

---||Delhi||Centre must clear the air on share of farm fires in Delhi pollution, says Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday asked the Centre to give a clarification on the exact share of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution. The remark came after the central government informed the Supreme Court that the contribution of stubble burning was a mere 4%. “There was a debate among experts, media and people throughout the day about the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution. The Centre submitted two contrasting statements in a single affidavit. While one page mentioned the figure as 4%, another page said the share was 35-40%. Both statements cannot be true. Therefore, I request the Union environment minister to clarify the facts and statements publicly,” said Rai. Showing the data of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), Rai said, “The average contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 from November 4 to 14 was around 31%. SAFAR is a central government organisation and the data was also submitted to the court by the Centre. I request the Union environment minister to give a clarification at the earliest so that we can devise the right strategy regarding pollution and in the future we can all come together to find an immediate and permanent solution to it.” Track the pollution level in your cityCommenting on the joint meeting taken by the Commission for Air Quality Management with the states on the order of the Supreme Court, Rai said, “In this meeting, on behalf of the people of Delhi, we proposed that work-from-home be implemented and all construction work and industries in Delhi-NCR be shut. The other states presented their proposals too. We are awaiting the minutes of the meeting. We hope that this meeting will result in a joint action plan for reducing pollution levels.” The environment minister said as the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign was coming to end on November 18, Delhi government had decided to run its second phase from November 19 to December 3 considering the prevailing pollution situation and for reducing vehicular pollution. Just like the first phase, 2,500 civil defence volunteers would continue to create awareness among people at 100 traffic intersections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-must-clear-the-air-on-share-of-farm-fires-in-delhi-pollution-rai/articleshow/87745705.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Schools face Rs 1 lakh fine for not introducing mandatory Marathi||NAGPUR: The state education department has asked all its divisional-level officials to start issuing notices for a Rs 1 lakh fine to those schools that haven’t implemented Marathi as a mandatory subject yet. Marathi has been mandatory in all schools across the state, regardless of the affiliating board, but in a phased manner which means only specific classes come under its ambit at present. In 2020, the state legislature passed a bill to make Marathi mandatory in all schools. The law also has a provision of a fine up to Rs 1 lakh for non-compliance. From the 2020-21 session, Marathi became mandatory for Std I and VI. Then every academic year, the next level of class comes under the purview of this rule, thus giving majority of non-Marathi speaking students ample time to prepare a foundation. But now in the second year of implementation, the education department has recieved complaints that Marathi has still not been introduced as a mandatory subject in some schools. Due to the pandemic and schools being closed in many places, there was no aggressive follow up. State education director (primary) Dinkar Temkar wrote to all deputy directors of education on Monday, saying that it’s time to act against such erring schools. “Action can be taken against these schools as per section 12 of our bye-laws. Send a showcause notice to these schools asking why we should not levy a Rs 1 lakh fine on them. Hear their side first and if their reply is not satisfactory or if they have not even started the process of introducing Marathi as a subject then under section 12 (2), even the district-level officials can act,” said Temkar in his letter. The letter cites multiple bye-laws and clauses so as not to keep his directives vague or receive letters from local officials about not having powers to levy such hefty fines. “Under section 12 (3), local officials can send the full report to the education director for recovery of fine from such schools,” said Temkar. Local education officials will now start enquiring with schools about the status of their Marathi subject implementation. An official said, “Once the data comes in then action can be taken against schools that have not complied with the law.” Similarly, citizens too can inform the education department if schools are not following the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-face-rs-1-lakh-fine-for-not-introducing-mandatory-marathi/articleshow/87745683.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Delhi: Where do we go now? AQI third worst in country||NEW DELHI: Air quality in the city slipped into the “severe” category again on Tuesday after hovering in the “very poor” range for the past two days. Experts see no relief any time soon. With an AQI of 403, the capital stood the third-most polluted city in the country next only to Jind (AQI 428) and Manesar (AQI 410), data from Central Pollution Control Board showed. PM2.5 levels remained over three times the safe limit. Experts said the city was in dire need of emergency steps to curb further accumulation of pollutants. On Tuesday, the meteorological conditions allowed further accumulation of pollutants with low mixing height keeping them below the surface, calm winds failing to ventilate the area and low temperature making air heavy and holding the pollutants tighter. Weather analysts expect the wind speed to drop further. “The wind on Tuesday was northwesterly and the speed was not strong enough to disperse pollutants. The wind may turn easterly, but the speed will be low and unfit for dispersion of pollutants. A combination of other meteorological factors will restrict improvement in the air quality,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. “Wind speed on Wednesday is likely to be around 4 kmph and minimum and maximum temperature may hover around 8 and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively,” said an India Meteorological Department official. SAFAR said the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s PM2.5 on Tuesday came down to 8% against 10% on Monday. Surface winds were likely to remain very low for the next few days. However, the number of farm fires may drop too. “Surface winds are likely to be very calm with a low ventilation index, pushing AQI to fluctuate between severe to the upper end of the very poor category till November 18. The peak in fire count appears to have reached last week and stubble burning is now showing a declining trend,” added SAFAR. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “What the city actually needs is a long-term action plan to curb pollution throughout the year, but it also needs to stop further accumulation of pollutants through emergency action plans because the ventilation is low.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/where-do-we-go-now-aqi-third-worst-in-country/articleshow/87745690.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Pune||Power to 1,800 schools in Pune district cut over dues||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) recently snapped the power supply of over 1,800 schools in Pune district over non-payment of dues of Rs 2.28 crore. The MSEDCL also took away the electricity meters of around 128 schools over pending bills. Pune zilla parishad (ZP) vice-president Ranjit Shivtare said the pendency was due to the closure of schools because of Covid-19 and the non-receipt of grants from the Centre. He said the local panchayats had been asked to help pay the electricity bills for their respective schools. Pune ZP has 3,639 primary schools under its umbrella while around 2,680 secondary schools belong to private managements or trusts. “The electricity meters of 128 ZP schools were removed and power was snapped to over 500 primary schools. During our review meeting, we learnt that the Central government grant (Rs5,000-10,000) under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan had not been given to schools for the past one year. This is the money the schools use for paying bills, among other dues,” Shivtare said. “We have requested the respective gram panchayats to pay off bills in instalments wherever they can within the next three weeks. We will hold a review again next month to check the status and decide on further course of action. The pending electricity dues are to the tune of Rs 2.28 crore. We had initially written to the government and the electricity board to waive off the amount, but that may not be possible,” Shivtare added. An MSEDCL official said that it was true that electricity dues had increased in the rural parts of the region which had resulted in connections being snapped. But now that the ZP officials have said they would be paying up, the power connections would be restored, he said. The official said that urban or corporation areas usually make consistent payments with regard to power dues of schools and other civic facilities. However, pendcy in rural areas in terms of schools, water supply or street lights are generally high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/power-snapped-to-1-8k-schools-in-dist-over-dues/articleshow/87745686.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||Curfew in Amravati to continue till next week: Police||Amravati: Even as situation in the violence-hit city is limping back to normalcy after November 12-13 flare-up, the police administration said on Tuesday that curfew will be extended till next week and restrictions on internet services will continue for two more days as a precautionary measure. “We are granting relaxation in curfew, but lifting the prohibitory order totally is currently out of question. It will continue till next week,” said additional DGP of Maharashtra Rajendra Singh while addressing a press conference at CP office here on Tuesday. CP Aarti Singh was also present at the time of briefing. Police had clamped the curfew on Saturday for four days after stones were hurled at shops during the bandh called by BJP, a day after incidents of stone-pelting took place during a rally called by a Muslim organisation in protest against purported communal violence in Tripura. On Tuesday, police relaxed the curfew for two hours from 2pm to 4pm. The relaxation may continue on Wednesday as well for two or four hours. Singh said police have registered 11 offences in connection with November 12 violence and 24 cases in connection with November 13 rioting and arrested 188 accused till 12 noon of Tuesday. When asked how BJP leaders including former minister Anil Bonde, Amravati mayor and others could get bail when non-bailable offences had been registered against them, Singh refused to comment saying it was court’s decision. “The process of identification of the accused persons and arrests is on. Everything is under investigation. Police are also looking into conspiracy angle,” Singh said. He thanked citizens for cooperating with the police in establishing peace and urged them to maintain communal harmony. “Differences must be sunk and no provocative language should be used,” he said. Singh praised police for acting in time during the turbulent period to establish normalcy. “We did not use any lethal weapons to tame the miscreants. We achieved peace using the least force. Today, around 2,500 cops are keeping the situation normal in the city,” he said. Speaking at a gathering of party functionaries and MLAs in Mumbai on Tuesday, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the objective of the violence was to polarize society. “The violence seen in cities like Amravati and Malegaon was part of a planned strategy to push society towards communal polarization. It was an experiment to test people’s response. We have to be careful about this in the coming days,” he said. “There were seven companies of the State Reserve Police Force in Amravati on the day violence erupted. But these were not even used. Why didn’t the state government issue orders to these companies,” asked the leader of opposition in the state assembly. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “Local police confirmed that they had given permission for a rally of 200-300 people on Friday. But more than 20,000 people were on the streets and it created a law and order situation. Was it an intelligence failure?” Some shop owners had been asked not to remain open that day, which means the rally had been planned, he alleged. ‘Somaiya agreed to put on hold Amravati visit’ Singh also told media persons that BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has accepted the request of Amravati CP Aarti Singh to withdraw his proposed tour of Amravati scheduled for Wednesday. Singh said the CP had written to Somaiya not to visit the city in view of the curfew situation. “He has agreed to the request and decided to withdraw his tour,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/curfew-in-amravati-to-continue-till-next-week-police/articleshow/87745704.cms||---

Around 5 am, the fire broke out in the sanctum sanctorum of Ashapura Temple. The priest Munna Maharaj, who sleeps inside the temple, was stuck when the fire started as the temple was locked from outside. The priest started shouting for help hearing which his family members sleeping in a room adjoining the temple woke up and called the villagers. The villagers broke the lock to rescue the priest and also tried dousing the blaze. However, the fire had engulfed a large portion of the temple following which fire brigade from Karjan municipality and Vadodara city were called in. The fire was brought under control after a fire fighting operation of two hours. Firemen said that preliminary investigation points at short-circuit as the cause of the fire. Karjan police are investigating the case. Villagers said that the temple will now be restored to its original form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/close-shave-for-priest-after-fire-breaks-out-in-temple/articleshow/87745030.cms||---
---||Dehradun||To plug gaps, health dept chart a way forward for rehab registration||Dehradun: Finding operational gaps following an RTI query that revealed the state machinery lacked any data on rehabilitation centres or the rules governing them, Dehradun health department has now started working on registering these establishments. Backed by information obtained through the RTI query -- filed by advocate Shiva Verma on August 6 -- TOI had reported that the state machinery has no data repository. Following the revelation, centres in Dehradun have been under the scanner. A few women at the centre in Clement Town, on the outskirts of the city, have even alleged sexual exploitation by the manager. On October 24, a 30-year-old man had died after his health deteriorated at the rehab centre in Nehru Colony. The family had later lodged an FIR pressing murder charges against the management. Following these incidents, district administration has issued guidelines for registering these establishments. "We will now start writing to de-addiction centres operating here to register themselves with us earliest by next month. This will ensure better monitoring and accountability. The administration is already carrying out inspections. Some of the shady centres have begun to shut operations for fear of legal action. We believe that with the registration process, we will be able to weed out several others and only genuine bodies will remain active," said Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer. De-addiction centres are generally registered as trusts. Under the new guidelines, they will be registered as part of the Clinical Establishment Act and Mental Healthcare Act. The centres will be required to pay a one-time registration fee of Rs 50,000 and an annual fee of Rs 25,000. Following the registration, health department teams will inspect the centres and report lapses, if any. Most rehab centres are in favour of the new guidelines. "The recent incidents have brought to light issues with some of the centres. It is good to have regular checks. All these institutions rely heavily on couselling and emotional support, and if the government can get work on these areas, the centres will thrive," said Uday Singh, who runs a centre on Sahastradhara road. Management of these centres is also on board with random inspections by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-plug-gaps-health-dept-chart-a-way-forward-for-rehab-registration-/articleshow/87744876.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Mangaluru||Parents allege harassment by pvt school over fee||Mangaluru: Several parents of students admitted to a private school here have alleged that the school management is harassing them over non-payment of fees, and targeting them for speaking up against the institution. The private international school in Adyar is now allegedly asking parents, who earlier protested against the school, to pay fees in its entirety. The school management allegedly told the parents that their wards will not be allowed to use the school bus service, and also threatened to not allow them to appear for examinations, if they failed to do so. Mohammed Sadiq, a fish vendor and resident of Thumbe, whose son studies in class III, said that he had been paying fees in instalments since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Last year, when the management demanded full fees, the government guidelines allowed to collect only 70% of tuition fee for 2019-2020. This year, the school is asking us to pay full fees, including that of last academic year. When we said we were unable to pay the same, and requested to pay in instalments. They prevented my child from using the school bus service, and also threatened to not allow him to appear for the examination which is scheduled on November 23,’’ he alleged. “There are parents who have not paid a single penny in fees last year, but their children have been allowed to attend classes. Me and a few other parents became the victims of a witch-hunt, because we questioned the wrongdoing of the school management. The school bus did not pick up my child on Friday, and he was left on the road. The school management, during admissions, had promised many facilities, however, till date it has no amenities, including a mandatory playground for children,” he said. When TOI contacted the school manager, he maintained the school is not forcing anyone to pay fees. “We are only collecting 70% of last year’s and 85% of this year’s fees from parents, and have not stopped any child from appearing for examinations, even if they have not paid fees,’’ he said. DDPI Malleswamy warned that schools have no right to stop a student from academic activities. “The aggrieved parents can approach our office and lodge a written complaint.

---||Lucknow||Previous government had handed over Uttar Pradesh to mafia, poverty: PM Modi||LUCKNOW/SULTANPUR: Unleashing a frontal attack on the Samajwadi Party, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the leaders of the previous state government did not even wish to stand along his side “fearing loss of vote bank”. “Un logon ko mere bagal mein khade rehne mein bhi dar lagta tha…ki kahi vote bank ka nuksaan na ho jaye,” Modi said, after inaugurating the 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway in Sultanpur. Modi averment marked a pointed offensive at Akhilesh Yadav-led SP which has been positioning itself aggressively against the BJP to thwart its bid of coming back to power after 2022 assembly elections. His reference to “vote bank” was also seen as an indication of BJP lending traction to a potential bipolar electoral contest with the SP which is markedly backed by Muslims and OBC, mainly the Yadavs. Stepping up the aggression further, Modi said that whenever he used to visit UP, they (leaders in SP government) used to “vanish” after “receiving him”. “Unko itni sharam aati thi....kaam ka hisaab dene ke liye unke pass kuch tha hi nahi (they didn't have anything to show in the name of work),” he said. In fact, the PM said, the state was subjected to “punishment” by “handing it” over to the “mafia and poverty” decades after decades. “Akhir UP ko kis baat ki saja di ja rahi thi,” he asked, stressing that after becoming the PM and as an MP from the state, he started delving deep into the causes of backwardness of the state and started many efforts including providing houses, toilets and electricity. “But the then state government did not help me and continued to do injustice to the people,” he said, recalling how various schemes brought by his government were kept in abeyance by the previous SP dispensation. In an apparent swipe at the Congress and SP, Modi said that both Delhi and Lucknow were largely dominated by “Parivarwadis”. “Their partnership kept trampling the aspirations of the people of UP,” he charged. Terming the opposition ranks as being only inclined to restrict “development” to their “own family and house”, the PM said that people of UP banished “such people” forever from the developmental trajectory of the state. “Aur 2017 mein aapne Yogi ji (CM Yogi Adityanath) ko…aur Modi ji (himself) ko apni seva karne ka mauka diya,” the PM said. Modi also hit out at the SP accusing it over the `frail’ law and order situation, prolonged power outages and lopsided industrial development. “UP mein raah nahi hote thi raahjani hoti thi (UP did not have the roads but road holdups),” he said. “Now those involved in street crime are in jail and new roads are being constructed in villages and cities,” he said, lauding the Yogi Adityanath government for putting the entire state on a growth pathway without "nepotism” and without any discrimination in terms of caste and region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/previous-govt-had-handed-over-up-to-mafia-poverty-says-modi/articleshow/87746371.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Knot ‘6Z’: From Russia with love||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s birdwatchers had reason to cheer when for the third year in a row, a great knot (Calidris tenuirostris), a shorebird tagged in Russia and code-named ‘6Z’, returned to the coastal village of Balachadi in Jamnagar district. Re-sightings of the shorebird for three consecutive migratory seasons may be a strong sign of Balachadi being a favoured wintering ground for these birds. Many experts now hope that Gujarat and India’s long coastline will provide a safe haven for the waders amid their habitat loss in China and Africa. "The great knot uses both the Central Asia Flyway (CAF) and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) for migration. Due to depleting mudflats in parts of China, there is a hypothesis that an increasing number of shorebirds could be using the CAF over EAAF," said Dishant Parasharya, an ornithologist working with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The intertidal mudflats provide critical habitats for shorebirds for roosting and foraging. Parasharya said much research needs to be done on both the flyways before one can arrive at any strong conclusion. The CAF covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and Indian Ocean and the associated island chains. The EAAF is the name given to the route flown annually by Australia’s migratory shorebirds to and from their breeding grounds above the Arctic Circle in Alaska and Siberia, and it extends from Arctic Russia and North America to New Zealand. The re-sighting of the 6Z for three successive migratory seasons lays to rest any doubts about Balachadi being only a stopover site for this bird. An iconic bird among waders, the great knot is a species of concern amongst the shorebirds. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status of the species has been revised from that of ‘Least Concern’ in 2014 to Endangered in 2019. It has been identified among Top 20 priority species for conservation in the Central Asian Flyway for India according to the National Action Plan (2018).  Tagged in Kamchatka he large-scale loss and degradation of important resting habitats along their migratory journey, notably at the Yellow Sea in China, is widely thought to be driving the general population decrease in migratory shorebirds and especially in great knots, says Yashodhan Bhatia, an avid birdwatcher who spotted the ‘6Z’, and who along with Ashish Pankhania had visited the intertidal area of Balachadi coast on October 6, 2019 when they had first spotted the bird. The duo was photographing and observing flocks of waders where they spotted around 20 great knots in a mixed flock that also had bar-tailed godwits. They were surprised to find a leg band on one of the great knots. "On further observation and after some more clicks, we noticed that there were two leg flags on the tibia of the left leg of the bird. A black flag without any number was placed over a yellow band which had ‘6Z’ engraved on it in black. A metal ring on the right leg was also visible," says Bhatia. Through a shorebird tagging protocol chart, they concluded it might be a bird tagged in Russia. With the help of BNHS, the duo mailed photographs to researchers working in Russia and East Asia. They received a message from one Dmitry Dorofeev that this individual had been tagged in Kamchatka in far Eastern Russia by him on July 17, 2019. Habitat threat from nearby ship-breaking yard?The frequent occurrence of globally endangered species on the west coast of the country evidently proves the importance of the suitable habitat conditions for the species here. Bhatia says that in the past, the great knot was documented in detail from southern parts of India with its population, status and other data. However, from the west coast, the reports have increased significantly for the last one decade. Last year, another great knot, with a green over orange band on its right tibia was sighted at Akshi Beach near Mumbai. It was probably tagged in August 2020 at Yalujiang, China. "There are sporadic reports that show that the bird is increasingly moving westwards rather than along its earlier path southwards. There was the report of a great knot tagged in Russia being sighted in UAE last year," says Bhatia, who is planning to publish a research paper on the 6Z. The Balachadi site that is home to shorebirds like bar-tailed godwits, great knots, grey plovers, crab plovers, Eurasian curlews, whimbrels, terek sandpipers, lesser and greater sand plovers, and is part of the Marine National Park and sanctuary is facing a potential threat from a ship-breaking yard at nearby Sachana. The Gujarat government had last year given a green light to restart the yard after issues pertaining to environment clearances were resolved, said sources. "The work in the yard has been slow due to the pandemic. Also, the plot numbers and their sizes are very small compared to the Alang Ship Breaking Yard near Bhavnagar, on which it is modelled," said government sources. Parasharya of BNHS said there is a need to study the long-term impact of the ship-breaking yard on the bird population at Balachadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/knot-6z-from-russia-with-love/articleshow/87745716.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jobseekers fume as Saudi collects Rs 800 as ‘passport sanitisation’ fee||MUMBAI: Indians seeking employment in Saudi Arabia have strongly protested against collection of Rs 800 as “passport sanitisation” fee before every visa application is processed. Recruitment agents here said the Saudi consulate has outsourced the “sanitisation” work to some private agencies in the city. “It is a racket to fleece the jobseekers who are already financially weak due to the lockdown and are desperate to get jobs in oil-rich Saudi,” said a major recruitment agent in the city requesting anonymity. Two months ago, Mohammed Ghufran (name changed on request), a carpenter, approached a recruitment agent with a request to find him a carpenter’s job in Saudi Arabia. “There was a vacancy, but the agent told me to deposit Rs 1,50,000, including Rs 800 for passport sanitisation, before I was given visa and a ticket. I couldn’t collect this huge amount as I was jobless during the lockdown and have no source of income. I don’t understand why I have to pay Rs 800 for sanitisation of my passport while sanitisation of my hands everywhere is free,” said Ghufran. Despite a call and an email, the Saudi consulate in Mumbai could not be contacted for a response. Abdul Karim, president of the Indian Personnel Export Promotion Council (IPEPCL) that represents around 450 registered recruitment agents from across the country, said he has written to the Indian government to raise the issue with the Saudi authorities and work towards removing this need for “sanitisation of passport” as part of compliances for visa application. “Why should jobseekers be given this extra burden? We hope the Indian government will get this revoked by the Saudi authorities soon,” said Karim. He added that before the lockdown, 28 lakh Indian expats were in Saudi Arabia. Around four lakh came back because of the changed employment rules. “Out of the 24 lakh Indian expats in Saudi Arabia, around two lakh who came to India in pre-Covid days on leave and got stuck here now want to go back,” said Karim. But before entering Saudi Arabia, travellers from India have to quarantine for 14 days in a third country. “The jobseekers have to pay for their 14-day stay in, say, Dubai, Uzbekistan or Russia before they are permitted to travel to Saudi Arabia,” said Fahad Ahmed, PhD scholar and a student leader at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) whom some unemployed youths looking for jobs in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, have approached to fight on their behalf. A source in the recruitment industry said recruitment agents are asked to deposit the job applicant’s passports with the “sanitisation agencies” which, after taking Rs 800 per passport, returns the passports in sealed envelopes with a direction not to open them but hand over the passports to the Saudi consulate. “The visa is processed only after the consulate receives passports in sealed envelopes,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jobseekers-fume-as-saudi-collects-rs-800-as-passport-sanitisation-fee/articleshow/87745709.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

H K Aggarwal (85), a resident of Sector 54, Mohali, who led the effort, said that both stray and pet dogs caused problems like loud barking and open defecation. In the letter to the CM, he said that no local body or the state government had done anything about the issue despite it being part of candidates’ manifesto at the time of local body elections. Aggarwal, in his letter to the CM, stated, “My appeal to the chief minister Channi is to please fulfill the promise of tackling the 24-hour burning issue of menance created by stray as well as pet dogs, as this was a priority agenda of the ruling party in the manifesto of all the winning candidates in the local bodies' elections held last February, 2021.” He complained that the elderly need peaceful sleep but were disturbed by the barking and howling of stray dogs. The MC has no count of stray dogs on the streets of Mohali. Five years ago, an estimate was made and it was believed that there were around 4,000 stray dogs in Mohali. By 2021, the number crossed 7,000 despite the fact that the MC had outsourced the stray dog sterilisation work. As of now, the process of stray dog sterilisation has been halted for the past five months for want of fresh tendering process. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said fresh tenders are being called and soon, tenders would be allotted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stray-dogs-make-residents-uncomfortable-in-mohali/articleshow/87744881.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The court also set aside an order of the Central government issued on June 5 last year, saying the Kendriya Vishwavidyalaya had directed HNBGU to cancel affiliations of all its colleges. Following this, orders had been issued by the university’s registrar to cancel all affiliations. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma gave the Centre and the state two months to respond. Dehradun resident Ravindra Jugran, as well as some others, challenged this order in separate PILs at the high court. The petitioners argued that only the Central University Grants Commission (UGC) or the university, on order of the UGC, can take such a decision, not the government. The petitioners called the government’s 2020 order unconstitutional and said that the state should not be paying for the colleges affiliated to HNBGU, the centre should.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-sets-aside-centres-order-cancelling-affiliations-of-garhwal-university-colleges/articleshow/87744887.cms||---

---||Nagpur||India’s renewable power targets will lead to earlier phase-out of coal||Nagpur: The announcements made by India at the recently-concluded United Nations COP26 summit in Glasgow are all set to mark a historic beginning towards terminal decline of coal. Even though the country opposed the commitment to phase out coal, latest analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) reveals that the country’s target of renewable power generation capacity of 500 gigawatt (GW) by 2030 will likely provide all of India's additional electricity demand without increasing power generation from coal. According to the report titled ‘Powering Down Coal — COP26’s Impact on the Global Coal Power Fleet’, coal-fired generation of electricity will likely increase in the next few years in India, and then peak and decline as the addition of clean energy capacity accelerates towards the target. “This means that there is no case for adding new coal-fired power capacity. Also, the 500 GW target will already start the phase-down of coal in the country,” the analysis stated. Researchers further highlighted that the country’s 2070 carbon neutrality target date leaves ample space for existing coal power plants to run until their conventionally assumed operating lives, implying no early retirement. “The target of reaching renewable power generating capacity of 500 GW by 2030, up from 100 GW currently, will likely provide all of India’s additional electricity demand without increasing power generation from coal,” they said. The global climate meet COP26 witnessed strong opposition to the inclusion of ‘accelerating phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies’ — mainly from India and China. Both the largest coal consumers pledged carbon neutrality targets but refrained from any commitments on their domestic coal power sectors. As per researchers, this is unlikely to be a major cause of concern for India as its non-fossil electricity targets will “phase down” coal before 2030. “Phase-down or phase-out does not really matter much. Coal is on a terminal decline. Phase-down is also a step towards phase-out. We will see this change, not just on paper, but in the real world over the next year and more importantly, this decade” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA. The study further found that that the announcements and pledges made at Glasgow climate summit will directly impact 80% of planned coal-fired power plants around the world. “Glasgow climate summit might have failed on several fronts, including on loss and damage fund as well as on adaptation. However, COP26 has taken historic steps towards ending coal. This is not just optics, announcements and pledges made at Glasgow have real world consequences on the global coal industry” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at CREA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/indias-renewable-power-targets-will-lead-to-earlier-phase-out-of-coal/articleshow/87745712.cms||Manka Behl

The firm has already installed the chargers in 20 housing societies, with the company’s co-founders claiming that any hesitancy among housing society residents and office-bearers about the charging station safety, are being won over by safety measures in their chargers. “Safety is a genuine concern when it comes to installing chargers on society premises. We have multiple circuit breakers inside and outside the charger to account for power fluctuations, and we have been certified by the Automotive Research Association of India. It is also compatible with all well-known EV models,” Dheeman Kadam, co-founder of goEgo, said. Kadam added that its initial target of around 100 societies over the next three months may be achieved owing to the enquiries. goEgo rolls out its chargers on a security deposit and subscription model, with societies contractually bound to host the chargers for five years. Users are required to pay a per-unit fee through an app, with the company also rolling out a pay-and-go facility for non-society residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/startup-plans-ev-charging-stations-in-100-societies/articleshow/87744883.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

According to police, the accused identified as Rakesh Bairwa had entered into the house of the woman while she was alone and raped her on October 27. “He had threatened her to keep mum else he will kill her husband and children. However, realising that the woman was upset, her husband enquired and that’s when she told him about the incident. Thereafter, the woman along with her husband approached us and narrated her plight and lodged a case of rape and criminal intimidation,” said a senior police officer of Kolwa police station of Dausa. Woman had also alleged that the accused had raped her four months ago as well but during then she was scared as he had threatened to kill her whole family. Soon after a case was lodged that accused escaped and was on the run. “We had constituted a special team of six policemen and also put his mobile phone on surveillance. On Tuesday, our cyber cell team gave an input that his location was somewhere near Jaipur. A team was sent and he was arrested,” the officer added. Police stated that the medical examination of the woman was already done while she had lodged the case of rape and her statements under Section 164 CrPC were also been lodged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-in-police-net-for-raping-married-woman-in-dausa/articleshow/87746382.cms||---

Meanwhile, the state government on Tuesday also informed the Supreme Court-appointed air monitoring committee that it was not in favour of a lockdown to control pollution levels. “The CM has asked for planned action at a local level to deal with pollution levels, especially in areas like Noida and Ghaziabad which are adjoining Delhi where pollution levels are in the severe category. In light of that, he said that they should be encouraged to use public transport,” said a government spokesperson. “Farmers are also to be sensitised about crop burning and told that it will harm not just them but also increase pollution,” said a government spokesperson. Additional chief secretary (environment), Manoj Kumar, said that during the meeting with the SC-appointed committee, the government laid out the various steps it is already taking to control pollution levels and is not in favour of a lockdown. “The SC had specifically mentioned two issues on which deliberations were needed. One was a lockdown and the other is stubble burning. UP is not in favour of a lockdown as it will impact our field officers who are tasked with enforcement work. Whatever work they are doing right now will also stop. Meanwhile, we are taking other steps like sprinkling of water on medians, roads and trees, planting grass where paving has not taken place, impounding vehicles which are older than 10-15 years, cracking down on illegal disposal of construction waste etc,” he said. An official said that UP was witnessing downward circulation of air which was bringing particulate matter from Punjab and Haryana where large scale farm fires were being reported from. The official said that UP had negligible stubble burning though recently, chief secretary RK Tiwari had written to district magistrates to crack down entirely on stubble burning. “The problem is that the wind velocity is negligible right now and will remain so till November 20. Because of this, there is no dispersal of PM, leading to high pollution levels. Despite that, UP is still only in the very poor category of air pollution,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/promote-public-transport-in-ncr-dists-to-control-pollution-yogi/articleshow/87746384.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kochi||Kerala: Accused in RSS worker’s murder under police protection, alleges BJP||PALAKKAD: The state treasurer of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and vice-chairman of Palakkad municipality E Krishnadas alleged that the accused in the murder of RSS worker Sanjith A is under police protection. Addressing media persons here on Tuesday, E Krishnadas and BJP national executive committee member PK Krishnadas said that SDPI terrorists are behind the murder of RSS worker Sanjith. “There is an unholy alliance between SDPI, CPM and its government in Kerala. The silence of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who holds the home ministry and the CPM state secretary is evidence of it. Such incidents show that terrorism is growing in Kerala,” said PK Krishnadas. Meanwhile, police recovered four swords abandoned in a gunny bag near the national highway at Kannanur near here on Tuesday. Blood stains were found on one sword. Forensic experts are conducting a detailed investigation to find out whether these weapons were used in Sanjith’s murder on Monday at Kinassery, said police. Ashitha, wife of Sanjith, told media persons that there were five assailants. While travelling on a bike they were hit by a car and when they fell down on the road one person dragged her to the canal and others hacked Sanjith in front of her. She said that she can identify the assailants who came in a Maruti Alto car. She and her husband shifted to her house two days ago as Sanjith had been receiving threats, she added. Seven teams have been formed to investigate the case and efforts are on to nab the accused, police said. Political enmity is the likely reason for the murder, police added.

---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: Houses to be marked during door-to-door vaccination campaign||JAIPUR: Just like marking done on houses in polio vaccination, the health department will launch similar initiative for marking on houses for Covid-19 vaccination. “Har ghar dastak” campaign was launched in the state on November 3, but it has not made a significant impact on scaling up vaccination drive. For the purpose of encouraging people, the health department will do the marking on houses and also it will take help of religious leaders, NGOs and social activists to boost Covid-19 vaccination. “Har ghar dastak” campaign was launched on November 4 nationally, and now 13 days have passed of launching the campaign, but its impact on vaccination has not changed much. From November 4 to November 16, the doses administered to the beneficiaries were around 18 lakh. In 13 days (October 22to November 3) before the launch of Har Ghar Dastak, the number of doses administered were around 18 lakh. So, no big impact of the campaign has been seen yet. The department is taking help of religious leaders, activists and NGOs for giving a boost to vaccination. “We are reaching out to houses in the state to encourage the people to get covid-19vaccination. Marking of houses, just like we do in polio vaccination will be done in covid-19 vaccination as well,” a senior health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/houses-to-be-marked-during-door-to-door-vaccination-campaign/articleshow/87753492.cms||---

Piaggio launched new vehicles under its premium sports two-wheeler Aprilia brand — the SR 160 and the SR 125, priced Rs1,17,494 and Rs1,07,595 respectively. Piaggio India’s chairman and managing director Diego Graffi, at the launch, said the new scooters are the first-in-segment to boast of features like ABS, and a 160cc engine, among others. The company conceded that a switch to electric vehicles was inevitable but said it would adopt a watch-and-evaluate measure for the Indian market. “We are monitoring the EV space as the market is still in its nascency and will decide the future course of action in around 6-8 months’ time,” the head of the company’s two-wheeler business, Sudhanshu Agrawal, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monitoring-nascent-ev-market-in-india-piaggio/articleshow/87744889.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Ahmedabad||Habitat threat from nearby ship-breaking yard?||The frequent occurrence of globally endangered species on the west coast of the country evidently proves the importance of the suitable habitat conditions for the species here. Bhatia says that in the past, the great knot was documented in detail from southern parts of India with its population, status and other data. However, from the west coast, the reports have increased significantly for the last one decade. Last year, another great knot, with a green over orange band on its right tibia was sighted at Akshi Beach near Mumbai. It was probably tagged in August 2020 at Yalujiang, China. "There are sporadic reports that show that the bird is increasingly moving westwards rather than along its earlier path southwards. There was the report of a great knot tagged in Russia being sighted in UAE last year," says Bhatia, who is planning to publish a research paper on the 6Z. The Balachadi site that is home to shorebirds like bar-tailed godwits, great knots, grey plovers, crab plovers, Eurasian curlews, whimbrels, terek sandpipers, lesser and greater sand plovers, and is part of the Marine National Park and sanctuary is facing a potential threat from a ship-breaking yard at nearby Sachana. The Gujarat government had last year given a green light to restart the yard after issues pertaining to environment clearances were resolved, said sources. "The work in the yard has been slow due to the pandemic. Also, the plot numbers and their sizes are very small compared to the Alang Ship Breaking Yard near Bhavnagar, on which it is modelled," said government sources. Parasharya of BNHS said there is a need to study the long-term impact of the ship-breaking yard on the bird population at Balachadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/habitat-threat-from-nearby-ship-breaking-yard/articleshow/87745756.cms||---

On November 13, C60 jawans of Gadchiroli police had recovered 26 bodies of Maoist cadres, including that of top rebel leader Milind Teltumbde, from the same area. Police claimed Parchapi’s body was found stuck between two rocks and it was discovered after considerable search on the basis of inputs from a C60 jawan who had spotted him hit by bullet. Parchapi was promoted to the ranks of Dandakaranya special zonal committee a few months back entrusting him with the responsibility of a bigger region due to his seniority and “effectiveness”. It was earlier assumed that Parchapi may have fled from the encounter spot. Police are yet to arrive at any conclusion regarding the possible reason behind the Maoists of the two states, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, camping at the spot in such substantial numbers. On Tuesday, Gadchiroli police managed to identify seven bodies, which also include that of another bodyguard of central committee member Teltumbde. The bodyguard was identified as Somda alias Naresh Uika, a native of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh. Earlier, bodies of two bodyguards of Teltumbde had been identified. Police have so far ascertained the identity of 23 slain rebels, including 14 from Chhattisgarh. Four bodies are yet to be identified. SP Ankit Goyal said the neutralized cadres from Chhattisgarh were being identified on the basis of inputs from the police of that state and also records available with the district police headquarters. It’s learnt seven bodies have been handed over to family members of the deceased while rest have been kept in mortuary of the Gadchiroli district general hospital. Goyal said families of the neutralized cadres from Chhattisgarh are being contacted through the local police, which is taking time owing to their remote locations. “We will cremate unclaimed bodies after a certain period as per law,” he said. In response to some media reports, Goyal did not rule out the possibility of some part of the encounter spilling over to Chhattisgarh due to hilly terrain. “The Maoists were spread over a substantial area as several dalams and formations were present when the encounter took place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/c60-jawans-retrieve-27th-body-from-gadchiroli-encounter-site/articleshow/87745754.cms||Soumitra Bose

A new rule has been added to the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1992, providing registration reports of foreigners to be submitted electronically. Any application or information under the rules can be filed online , after which the registration officer will verify its genuineness. Only if necessary will the applicant or informant be called for a personal appearance for the purpose of this rule. “The purpose of the amended rules is to ease travel and stay by foreigners in India by eliminating the outdated procedures and replacing them with digitised formats. The initiative fits in with the ‘ease of living’ and ‘ease of doing business’ theme of the Modi government,” said a spokesperson for the ministry. The latest amendments in the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1992, according to a gazette notification dated November 12, omits Rule 7(1) specifying the procedure of registration and to whom the registration report must be presented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-now-takes-foreigners-registration-process-online/articleshow/87747596.cms||---

According to the fire brigade, the fire was reported around 4.45am in the electricity meter room of Rakhma Society by few residents who alerted their neighours and the civic officials. However, the residents were unable to exit the structure as the blaze had engulfed the common exit passage trapping them within the structure. Meanwhile, the fire fighters managed to douse the blaze and evacuated the residents as a precautionary measure. A preliminary inspection by the civic officials revealed sixteen electricity meters to have been completely destroyed in the fire. “Luckily, no one was injured in the blaze as the residents were shifted out in time. The cause of the fire is likely to be investigated,” informed civic officials.

---||Nagpur||Confrontation, counselling, vaccination: Har Ghar Dastak teams set out to jab all||Nagpur: Surjit Singh (53) claims his doctor has told him not to take Covid vaccine due to his renal problems. When additional chief medical officer Dr Narendra Bahirwar asks for the doctor’s number to verify the basis of the medical advisory, Singh gives evasive replies, making it clear he was trying skip the jab on flimsy ground. A few homes ahead, auto driver Azhar Ali (21) says he is afraid of the vaccine as he believes it may “leave him dead”. Surprisingly, family members of both Singh and Ali are already vaccinated! That does not stop Singh from raising his voice to tell the NMC team to leave, and not pester him. The team marks the number of vaccinated people at home and moves ahead. Zonal medical officer Dr Ateequr Raheman Khan is able to allay Ali’s fears, though, and a few moments later Ali takes his first jab. He delayed it by nearly five months after the government opened the drive for 18+ population. “I know it is compulsory but I had been told bad things about the vaccination. I thank the health team and NMC for helping us get jabbed at home,” Ali says. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has formed over 500 teams under the government’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive. Each team comprises a nurse and two Asha workers; assigned a daily target of 200 persons. Expecting hurdles, NMC initiated the drive from November 15 to complete first dose of 18+ people by November 30. On Tuesday, TOI accompanied a Mangalwari zone team going door to door in New Colony. Dr Bahirwar and Dr Khan paid a surprise visit to check the drive’s progress. Every alternate household presented a mix of apprehension, reluctance and adamant individuals refusing to get jabbed when the team visited them. Some relented following persuasion by the senior officers. The team quietly marks ‘P’ (protected) outside homes having fully vaccinated members or cross marks (X) signifying unvaccinated homes. As the team moved to nearby Goa Colony, a group of men and women charged at the Asha workers, who knocked on the door to ask if anyone was yet to be jabbed. Dr Bahirwar and Dr Khan intervened to stop the residents from bothering the health teams. “Some don’t even let us mark their homes,” said Asha worker Chandrakala Bhalavi. Nurse Bakuli Armarkar, and other two Asha workers Geeta Thulkar and Jayshri Gaikwad said the locals didn’t turn aggressive on Tuesday. “It is not an easy task. The threat of getting attacked is always there. Today, seniors are here so locals are not reacting much,” they said. Despite the odds, the team jabbed nearly 150, including 104 first doses, after reaching out to over 700 homes by the end of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/confrontation-counselling-vaccination-har-ghar-dastak-teams-set-out-to-jab-all/articleshow/87745795.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Lisa Pingale, owner of the art gallery, said, “Venues have not been functioning for close to two years due to the pandemic. While some hosted online art shows, I believe that art is tangible and must be seen up close to be properly appreciated. We have some big names from the art world showcasing their works at this event, which has garnered a lot of interest in the city’s art circuit.” The exhibition will feature notable contemporary works such as a large triptych by Satish Gupta called ‘Abundance’ from his Zen series and another piece inspired by his visit to Tirupati. “I wanted to capture the divine energy of Vishnu by going through the whole colour pallete to represent each of the 1,000 names given to the deity. For example, Tejas is represented by a fiery red,”said Gupta. Fawad Tamkanat, whose painting from a series called Silent Sounds — inspired by his travels to remote villages in Scandinavian, European and Middle Eastern countries — will be showcased here, said, “The piece was specially painted for this exhibition, inspired by my travels before the lockdown. I am an avid traveller. I paint the way I live because I strongly that an artist’s personality must be reflected in their work.” Other remarkable works featuredinclude a limited-edition bronze Bandwalla sculpture by veteran master Krishen Khanna, bold and vibrant abstract works by Ramkumar and Sujata Bajaj, a specially created painting featuring Uchchaihsharavas, the king of horses, by Seema Kohli, Family by Badri Narayan, two mixed-media-on-canvas works titled Cosmos and Water Reflections by Michelle Poonawalla, as well as Gunjan Shrivastava’s signature work called Cyanotypes. Sapna Kar, co-founder, thecurators.art, said, “The upcoming show will feature artworks with the underlying theme of joyousness. We want collectors and art enthusiasts to see the works and feel a sense of happiness as they attend a show of this magnitude after a long hiatus. Be it a seasoned collector or someone looking for something lighter on the pocket, they can find something to their liking from a wide range across various mediums, such as sculptures, mixed media, canvas and so on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-group-exhibition-revives-citys-art-scene/articleshow/87745776.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The municipality generates nearly 12 tonnes of wet waste and has increased its manure production by adding more units. Within six months, the city municipality will be able to process all the wet waste on its own without transporting it to Pachanady. CMC commissioner Rayappa said that the urban local body has been processing both dry and wet waste, generated by about 65,000 residents. “In another six months, no waste will be sent to Pachanady. While dry waste in the municipality area is being recycled, wet waste is being converted into manure and is being used by farmers in and around Ullal. In the past six months, the city municipality has collected segregated waste from houses and commercial establishments. Awareness is being created to encourage people to segregate waste at the source,” he said. The municipality does not accept mixed waste, he added. The municipality was converting an average of four tonnes of wet waste into organic manure a day. An average of four tonnes of manure is being produced every month. The city has nine educational institutions that process wet waste at the source. Meanwhile, a private firm has started processing chicken waste to manufacture feed for animals. Waste processing units are being opened in each ward and initiatives are being taken to clear all black spots, where people dump waste, he said. Mangaluru MLA UT Khader launched Ullal Brand organic manure recently. The manure is sold to farmers at Rs 10 per kg and is available in packs of 10 kg. Demand for the Ullal Brand manure is increasing considerably, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ullal-to-become-self-sufficient-on-solid-waste-management-in-6-months/articleshow/87744071.cms||---

The truck was moving in the second lane and there were many vehicles ahead as well as on the left lane. The driver took a sharp right turn and crashed into the divider to avoid these vehicles,” the officer said. The impact was so intense that the truck broke a 10ft long stretch of the cement railings and the iron crash barriers. Assistant inspector Prashant Kanase told TOI, “The container of the truck occupied a major area of the carriage width of the bypass. Its cabin occupied a lane leading to Satara. In this way, the movement of the vehicles heading towards Satara as well as Mumbai was blocked.”  There was a traffic snarl between Dari Pul (Viaduct) near New Katraj tunnel and Dukkarkhind near Chandni Chowk. The situation became normal around 11.30am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/container-crash-blocks-traffic-on-katraj-dehu-road-bypass/articleshow/87745791.cms||---

Surendran called on governor Arif Mohammed Khan with a request for intervention in the matter. The demand for NIA probe was made in view of the state police’s failure in nabbing the culprits even 24 hours after the brutal killing of RSS worker Sanjith in Palakkad on Monday, said Surendran. “To resist SDPI’s attempts to make Kerala a battleground, all cases in which SDPI workers are accused should be handed over to NIA,” he said. “It has been proven in Sanjith’s postmortem report that he was hacked to death by trained assailants. It was a planned murder and there was largescale conspiracy behind it. Police did not do anything even when there were attempts on Sajith’s life by SDPI from 2020. Police are reluctant to name SDPI in the murder of Baiju in Chavakkad too. Police are acting in a partisan manner,” he said. Surendran claimed that the modus operandi of the murder in Palakkad shared similarities in killing patterns reported from Bangalore and elsewhere in the country. “Government has done nothing even as SDPI workers committed 10 murders, including that of SFI leader Abhimanyu, in recent times. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is helping SDPI politically. It’s with SDPI’s support that CPM rules Shoranur municipality, which is close to where Sanjith was killed,” Surendran added. He said that the governor has given assurance to intervene in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nia-must-probe-all-cases-involving-sdpi-surendran/articleshow/87745812.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BEST employees demand budget merger with BMC||MUMBAI: After MSRTC, it is now BEST workers who are demanding a “merger” of the undertaking’s budget with the BMC budget so that it ensures higher pay scales and Diwali bonus, among other benefits. The issue was brought before the BEST committee by BJP members at the budget meeting on Tuesday. Corporator and panel member (BJP) Prakash Gangadhare also warned that if the “merger issue” was not taken by the Shiv Sena-led panel on urgency, there could be protests from workers supported by BJP. He said that a few years back, the panel had agreed on the merger, which could drastically reduce losses of the undertaking and benefit 36,000 employees. “But nothing happened so far and this is unwarranted,” he pointed out. The situation is similar to MSRTC workers who are protesting, demanding the merger of the bus corporation with the state government. The strike of more than 84,000 workers entered its twentieth day on Tuesday as talks with the management remained inconclusive. A three-member government-appointed committee headed by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte met representatives of one union today at Mantralaya late afternoon. The committee will hear grievances of 28 unions over the next few weeks before presenting its report to state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “We have started the process of hearing demands of the unions. We will be speaking to all the unions before a final report regarding our recommendations is presented to the CM,” said a senior official. The CM will submit his report along with his views/opinion on the recommendations made by the panel to the high court. The entire process will be completed within 12 weeks, as per court directives. Transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab has assured police protection for those coming back to work, and also warned of “loss of pay” for those staying away from essential duties due to which lakhs of commuters are inconvenienced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-employees-demand-budget-merger-with-bmc/articleshow/87745819.cms||Somit Sen

The deputy collector had held a meeting to examine the documents before clearing the compensation in lieu of the trust land the government had acquired for Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The government had announced Rs 8.76 crore compensation to the land owner, Tabut Inam Endowment Trust. A case registered at Bundgarden police station in Pune states two accused had approached the collector’s office claiming to be the trustee and secretary of Tabut trust and claimed the compensation. They produced an alleged fake NOC of Waqf Board to support the claim. The deputy collector released Rs 7.9 crore in the name of the trust through a demand draft. Since the account number on it was wrong, the deputy collector released another demand draft that the accused deposited in their account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waqf-case-pune-dy-collector-summoned-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87745811.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Delhi||Delhi, Pune cops bust gang that duped people via online services||New Delhi: In a joint operation, Delhi Police’s Special Cell and Pune police busted a gang that used to dupe people online. The gang members used to send fake screenshots of excess payments to the targets and ask them to refund the amount. The arrested people included H Meena (23), AK Meena (22), BL Meena (32), R Meena (23) and HM Meena (23), all residents of Rajasthan. The fraud came to light when a woman from Pune filed a complaint with cyber police. She said she gave online tuition for which her students paid through Google Pay. “On November 11, a woman, Muskan Meena, contacted her on her Instagram page to participate in a class and inquired about the fees. She was told that the fee was Rs 1,800 per month. Muskan then sent a screenshot of Rs 18,000 of Google Pay. She requested the tutor to refund the extra amount paid by mistake. The complainant, without checking her account, returned Rs 16,200 to Muskan via Google Pay. Later, she realised that she had been cheated,” said DCP (Cyber Cell) KPS Malhotra. After registering a case, Pune cops contacted the Cyber Crime Unit of Delhi Police because Muskan had provided her address as Dwarka in Delhi. “The address was found to be fake. Technical inquiry revealed that the suspect was operating from Jaipur. A team was sent to Jaipur and five gang members were arrested,” said the DCP. During interrogation, the five accused disclosed that they had created different Instagram IDs. They would visit shopping pages, take screenshots of the products and ask the sellers their cost via direct message. “They would then send a fake payment receipt and ask the seller for a refund saying that by mistake they had sent an excess amount,” Malhotra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-pune-cops-bust-gang-that-duped-people-via-online-services/articleshow/87745815.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NCP, Sena looking to expand base in Vid before civic polls||Nagpur: NCP supremo Sharad Pawar’s Vidarbha tour from Wednesday after a gap of almost two years is seen as the party’s efforts to focus on Vidarbha, where it badly lacks its base, ahead of next year’s civic elections in Maharashtra. Similarly, Shiv Sena is also eyeing the region and has already started consolidating its base, after breaking away from its saffron partner BJP post 2019 assembly polls. The region holds the key to government formation with a large number of 62/288assembly seats, besides 10 Lok Sabha seats. Both parties badly lack base in the region, barring certain pockets. According to poll analysts, the parties played second fiddle to Congress and BJP all these years, particularly in Vidarbha, and to some extent in Marathwada till the 2019 elections, which saw breaking of their 25-year-long saffron alliance. On the other hand, Congress and BJP still hold the grip over Vidarbha with a maximum of parliament and assembly seats divided between them. In fact, the region was a bastion for the grand old party till 2014 general and assembly elections before the beginning of Modi era. With the fast-changing political equations and new Congress leadership under state president Nana Patole insisting on contesting all polls on their own, NCP too seems to be gearing up for going solo. The party already has a strong base in western Maharashtra and has won more seats than Congress in 2019 assembly polls. Now, it wants to focus on Vidarbha and Pawar’s three-day visit was part of that exercise, according to party workers. Winds of change were also felt in Sena’s local unit after the introduction of MLC Dushyant Chaturvedi as local publicity chief. Even chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is personally paying attention to completion of major projects like Samruddhi corridor and Gorewada Zoo, along with Gosikhurd, and also visited the city a couple of times for reviewing the schemes. He also renamed Samruddhi and Gorewada projects after party founder Balasaheb Thackeray. The party’s senior leader Eknath Shinde, also the state urban development minister, is regularly visiting Gadchiroli, where he is making efforts for the district’s development. “In Nagpur, we have made full preparations for forthcoming NMC polls. As soon as prabhag limitations are declared, we would be taking interviews of candidates for contesting all 151 seats till any decision is made by the CM to forge an alliance with MVA partners,” Chaturvedi says. Before Pawar’s arrival, senior leader and MP Praful Patel was regularly visiting various areas of Vidarbha and conducting meetings with its office-bearers. “We would be expanding our base in the region, irrespective of the coalition, and will contest all forthcoming elections. Pawar’s visit in that direction will be boosting the morale of our party workers. From one seat in NMC, we will be aiming to significantly boost our tally,” NCP city chief Duneshwar Pethe says. Already many popular names have joined the party ranks, like former Sena chief Shekhar Sawarbandhe, corporator Abha Pande and others. “Pawar is a highly experienced leader having deep knowledge of politics and his visit would be a big morale booster for our activists. We’ve already started preparations for expanding NCP’s base in the region. Senior leaders like Patel, Anil Deshmukh, Ramesh Bang and Babarao Atram are working to bring more cadres under its fold,” former MLC Prakash Gajbhiye says.

---||Nagpur||Patole flays NCP, says it hardly has any presence in Vidarbha||Nagpur: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole once again courted controversy by saying that its ally NCP hardly has any presence in Vidarbha and may lose its lone seat in Buldhana. Patole was indirectly referring to food and drugs administration minister Rajendra Shigane, who won on the NCP ticket from Sindhkhed Raja in the district. Questioning the NCP leadership, the former speaker said the NCP lost its Pandharpur seat despite campaigning by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and party president Jayant Patil. “The loss indicates that the party (NCP) is fast losing its base in western Maharashtra despite the presence of senior leaders. In Buldhana, it has only one ‘Dukan’ (seat) and it may lose that seat also (in the 2024 polls),” he said. Patole’s veiled barb against the ally of over two decades came while addressing Congress workers in Buldhana a couple of days ago. However, it once again brought differences between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents to the fore. This is not for the first time that the former speaker has targeted its Democratic Front ally. On July 15, Patole had launched a veiled attack against the Sharad Pawar-led outfit, stating that it had betrayed the Congress in the 2014 assembly polls. Two days earlier, he had claimed that he was being snooped by the government’s home department led by NCP minister Dilip Walse Patil. The former speaker is always vocal about going it alone in next year’s civic polls by leaving its former ally NCP and the new one Shiv Sena. His views, however, are not endorsed by other Congress leaders like revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and PWD minister Ashok Chavan. The Sakoli MLA again endorsed his statement against the NCP during a Congress meeting to celebrate the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at Devadia Bhavan in the city on Sunday. He, however, refused to take TOI’s repeated calls for his comments. To mark the occasion, the grand old party launched the Jan Jagaran Abhiyan against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA government at the Centre for rising inflation and fuel prices. The activists led by Patole and other leaders like Rajya Sabha MP Tariq Anwar, MLC Abhijit Wanjari, former minister Anees Ahmed and former MLA Virendra Jagtap took out a protest rally. While addressing workers, Patole targeted the BJP, accusing it of fomenting trouble between Hindus and Muslims as part of a larger conspiracy to win the assembly elections in many states next year, including Uttar Pradesh. He further accused BJP of defaming Maharashtra by instigating people to carry out riots in many places. “This is an old game of the saffron party to divert votes by dividing people. However, voters have realized their tactics and will not fall into their trap,” he said. NCP flays Patole, says doesn’t have stature to comment on Pawar, Patil The NCP strongly countered Patole’s attack by asking him to remain within limits before commenting on its party leaders. “Such comments coming from a senior leader referring NCP’s victory as Dukan is very unfortunate. He should not forget that our party has played a big role in his closely fought victory from his constituency in Bhandara. Pawar and Patil are our senior leaders and Patole does not have the stature to comment on them. If he is feeling so insecure with our coalition then he should ask his high command to move out of MVA,” said NCP general secretary Pravin Kunte Patil. Asking the MPCC chief to tender an unconditional apology, Patil, also the party’s spokesperson, reminded Patole that the MVA’s architect was senior Pawar. “His statement smacks of arrogance of power. He seems to have taken ‘supari’ from the BJP for making such statements,” said Patil. Backing Patil, city NCP chief Duenshwar Pethe said Patole should understand that a ‘Dukan’ is run by a ‘baniya’ and not by political parties. “His statement is best termed as immature and reflects ego. I have never seen a Congress leader making such irresponsible statements. It was never their party’s tradition. We have been allies since the last 22 years and making such comments creates distrust. Voters very well know whose party is on the decline and who is at number four in terms of assembly seats,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-flays-ncp-says-it-hardly-has-any-presence-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87746462.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Court on booked cops: Had no reason to help ‘rapists’||MUMBAI: In a case where three cops were booked for forcing a 12-year-old gang rape victim to marry one of the two alleged perpetrators in 2012-13, a special Pocso court in its recent judgment against five others observed that the police and other accused had no reason or interest to help the alleged rapists. There is no cogent evidence that the survivor’s father was being pressurised by the police or the other accused, it added. “…further it can be seen that there is inordinate delay in lodging of the report. Father of the victim does not appear to be under constant threats or pressure. In fact, report is lodged against him for extortion. Then he lodged report,” said the court. It also held that the survivor’s evidence did not appear to be truthful. In 2019, the Pocso court had directed the inclusion of three police officials as accused. When they challenged it, the case against them was stayed by Bombay high court. The trial continued against the two alleged rapists and three others, also accused of forcing a marriage. Last week, the special court sentenced a 41-year-old to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment for raping the girl. DNA evidence showed he was the father of the survivor’s baby boy. The court said medical evidence proved the minor was sexually assaulted, but there was no evidence on record to show she had been given a spiked drink and gang raped. It acquitted the 37-year-old co-accused alleged to have been part of the gang rape. He had married the girl and abandoned her. “Performing marriage will not prove his complicity in the absence of other cogent evidence on record,” the court said. His brother and two locals were also acquitted. The survivor’s father told the court that he had not lodged an FIR initially as the cops and others pressured him on marriage to secure the girl’s future and that of her child. The FIR was finally lodged in 2014. The court held that the father had tried to shirk his responsibility by saying he was under pressure. In a city like Mumbai, NGOs are active in helping people. “There is also active media which highlights such issues. There are state and district legal services authorities providing free legal aid... There are also women’s commissions and higher police authorities. But the complainant does not approach anyone,” said the court, wondering whether he had been to the police and narrated the incident. The judge also doubted whether the survivor’s real age was disclosed by her parents to the kazi performing the marriage. They had claimed that the girl was 18 when a sonography was first done in 2013, the court pointed out. “From the evidence it is reflected that since beginning, the father was not inclined to lodge report. I find it highly improbable that a father would yield to pressure when his daughter was subjected to such heinous crime,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-on-booked-cops-had-no-reason-to-help-rapists-in-mumbai/articleshow/87746935.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The OT was rendered non-functional due to the fire on September 15 last year. On Monday, the PCB signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a software company, which has committed Rs1.2 crore for the restoration work. Pune’s Members of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat and Congress Member of Legislative Assembly (MLC) Sharad Ranpise, who passed away recently, had earlier donated Rs25 lakh and Rs15 lakh, respectively, for this project from the local area development funds available to them. “We hope to complete the restoration work by January 26, 2022,” said Amit Kumar, PCB’s chief executive officer (CEO). As per cantonment records, the hospital had performed 580 major surgeries of different types and 380 minor surgeries in 2019. “We have adequate specialised doctors at the hospital.The revamped facility will benefit patients from humble family backgrounds in the cantonment,” said Usha Tapase, resident medical officer, PCB. “Most importantly, the patients will get health benefits under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) scheme of the state government here, so the number of surgeries will increase,” Tapase added. Cantonment officials and Tapase also said a team of doctors from the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) will join the hospital soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-year-after-fire-pcb-manages-funding-to-restore-its-general-ot/articleshow/87745817.cms||Sandip Dighe

The notional income was fixed at Rs 15,000 annually in 1994 and somehow, the same is continuing in the statute without any amendment for the last 27 years. The inflation rate since has gone up manifold resulting in depreciation in the value of the rupee but the notional income has not been increased and the compensation is being calculated on the basis of that income. While allowing a plea for enhancement of compensation for the death of a five-year old in a road accident in 2004, a bench of Justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy increased the notional income to Rs.25,000 annually and awarded total compensation of Rs 4.7 lakh to the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hike-notional-income-for-computing-road-crash-compensations-sc-to-government/articleshow/87747616.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

---||Delhi||Minding the gap: Class XII exams start on cautious note||New Delhi: The offline board examinations for CBSE’s Class XII students started on Tuesday with utmost caution. A gap was left after each desk and there were very few students in a classroom. It was a skill subject paper opted for by fewer students, and schools didn’t find it difficult to take printouts. Many schools are, however, worried about more popular subjects. Every student wore a mask and was checked and sanitised on entering the premises. Delhi government school students who had entrepreneurship, and beauty and wellness had to go to other schools as they did not have home centres. A government school had accommodated 67 students on Tuesday, but its principal is stressed about the Sanskrit exam as over 900 students from three schools will appear for this Class X test at the institute. The Class X boards will begin on Wednesday with the painting test. “Even on Tuesday, the children were at the gate before we took the printouts as the link was uploaded late. As there were fewer students, it was not a problem,” said the principal. For the major subjects, the question papers will be made available at banks, but schools will have to print the OMR sheets. These tests will begin in December. “As it was the first time, there was a lot of stress and confusion. In my school, we have a good number of printers, but there are schools that are renting photocopy machines,” another principal said. Initially, the schools were to drop the OMR sheets at post offices, but now they themselves will deposit the answer papers at the CBSE headquarters every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minding-the-gap-class-xii-exams-start-on-cautious-note/articleshow/87745887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at a press conference in Kochi on Tuesday, SDPI state general secretary Roy Arakkal said it is a call for mob attacks on the lines of those in north Indian states. The statement that the party would pay back in the same coin is a challenge to the country’s judiciary, he said. But, the enlightened people of Kerala would discard the call, he added. “It is not up to the BJP state president to declare the names of culprits. It is the duty of investigating agencies to find the accused. BJP is trying to take maximum mileage out of political unrest,” said Arakkal. BJP tried to make the women’s entry to Sabarimala a golden opportunity for the party. The campaigns like love jihad, narcotic jihad, etc, didn’t help BJP’s growth in the state. So, the party leaders have come up with attempts to create violence,” said Arakkal. There is great divide within BJP in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/surendran-trying-to-stoke-communal-unrest-says-sdpi/articleshow/87745825.cms||---

Deputy superintendent of police P Sivakumar filed a petition before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court on Monday, seeking police custody of Thananayaka, a native of Colombo in Sri Lanka, and Gopalakrishnan, of Bengaluru. When the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday afternoon, advocate Malaravan, who is representing the Sri Lankan national and Jayapal, objected the petition and sought the court to quash it. He argued that Thananayaka and Jayapal were not involved in any cases in the state and the police had foisted false cases against them. After hearing the arguments from both sides, chief judicial magistrate M Sanjeevi Baskar granted five-day police custody of the duo and ordered the police to produce them before the court on November 20 before 11am. Police said Thananayaka was a close friend of Angoda Lokka and a wanted criminal in Colombo. Following the death of Angoda Lokka in Coimbatore city on July 3, 2020, Chanuka went absconding. However, the CB-CID police traced him to Bengaluru and arrested him on November 12.

District health officer Dr Mahendra Chavan said this vaccination camp has been set up beside the police checkpost at Gavhali in Akkalkuwa taluka of the district. “The initiative has been made to boost the vaccination coverage in Nandurbar district. We have deployed our health workers to administer vaccinations to these workers,” he added. According to Dr Nitesh Vasave, the Akkalkuwa taluka health officer, since the setting up of the camp here a month back, over 500 migrant workers heading to Gujarat have been inoculated. “We stop the vehicles ferrying these migrant workers and seek information about the vaccination status. The unvaccinated or partially vaccinated workers having documents like the Aadhaar card are given the vaccination at the camp. We keep them here for about an hour after the shot, before allowing them to proceed with their journey,” added Vasave. The Nandurbar administration has started the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (door-to-door) Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district from November 10 to increase the vaccine coverage in the tribal-dominated district. District collector Manisha Khatri has ordered the officials to continue this special Covid-19 vaccination drive till the end of the month. The health workers, with the help of other departments like revenue and police, have stepped up vaccination drive in the district. The unvaccinated and partially vaccinated beneficiaries are being identified and given the shots. Even the NGOs and social outfits are rendering help to the administration for the same. In Nandurbar, out of 5.45 lakh beneficiaries, 62% have taken their first shots and around 44% are fully vaccinated.

Kottakkal police on Tuesday arrested six relatives of the woman, including her father, uncles and cousins, in connection with the attack which took place on Monday. Police identified the injured as Abdul Aseeb, hailing from Kottakkal who is currently admitted to a hospital with multiple injuries, including a broken nose. The arrested are Cholappurath Majeed, 38, Abdul Jaleel, 34, Shafeeq 34, Kizhakkeparamban Shamsudheen, 45, the father of the woman, Shafeer Ali, 31 and Musthafa, 62. Police are looking for the remaining accused, Latheef, who is absconding. They have been booked under IPC Section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), abduction, threatening, assault etc. Kottakkal inspector of police M K Shaji said that the accused barged into the RTO consultancy office run by the Aseeb at Changuvetti and thrashed him and forcibly dragged him into their car and took him to the woman’s house at Othukkungal where they beat him up demanding divorce by pronouncing triple talaq and asking him to give it in writing. “Police reached the spot within 30 minutes and we rescued him from the custody of the accused. There were some issues between Aseeb and his wife and she didn’t want to continue the relationship,” the inspector said. The nikah of the couple was held on April 5 and she was brought to Aseeb’s house in August but following issues between them, the woman had returned to her house in October. Aseeb said that his wife’s relatives had beaten him up with an iron rod and they threatened him by placing a knife on his throat and threatened with acid attack if he refused to pronounce triple talaq. He added that the attackers also filmed the attack and they even had kept an ink pad read to affix his fingerprint after getting triple talaq in writing on paper. He added that the attack happened even after he had agreed to amicably end the marriage and a mediation talk was scheduled to be held on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the woman’s family and their lawyer said that Aseeb had been torturing her and she even had to be admitted to a hospital recently. The Supreme Court had in 2017 declared the practice of instant triple talaq as unconstitutional and the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 had made the practice a criminal offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-thrashed-by-wifes-relatives-demanding-talaq/articleshow/87745840.cms||---

The move follows an increase in complaints pertaining to encroachments of main roads, including TenderSURE Roads, in Hubballi-Dharwad. The officials of HDMC zonal offices will check encroachments and also verify whether buildings on either side of roads have taken permission, violated permission rules and other norms, including tax payment. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said they have been receiving complaints pertaining to encroachments. “We will check and initiate stern action against encroachers. Instructions have been given to all zonal assistant commissioners to start the survey for the measurement of roads,” he said, adding: “Our officials will check if the building owner has taken necessary permission. If any violation is found during the drive, they will issue notices to the violators as per rules. Action will be initiated without yielding to any kind of pressure.” The civic body has received many complaints pertaining to encroachments of many roads, mainly those in commercial areas like Station Road, Koppikar Road, Dajiban Peth, Janata Bazaar, Subhash Road, and TenderSURE Road. Also, the civic authorities have been facing flak from the public for not allegedly attending to their complaints and for allegedly not initiating action against the violators. Recently, HDMC had acted against the complaint of encroachment on TenderSURE Road and also cleared it. This had raised questions as to why only the commercial hub in Vidyangar was considered. Following demand for such action against many other commercial establishments that have encroached pavements, HDMC officials swung into action. They will take measurements of roads and pavements and slap notices to the violators, sources said. It is said the drive will start from TenderSURE Road, after which other stretches will be covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-to-survey-roads-to-check-for-encroachments/articleshow/87744183.cms||J Abbas Mulla

During a meeting on Monday, all the 19 industrial associations, which are part of FOCIA, resolved that they would approach the state government regarding the issue. The federation is also planning to announce an agitation seeking attention of the state government for appropriate measures to bring down the escalating cost of raw materials. Coordinator of FOCIA J James said the companies with up to Rs 1 crore turnover which are termed as micro industries were given a 25% subsidy for purchase of machinery. But in recent times, micro units were asked to provide ISO certification to claim subsidies. While most units are operating from smaller spaces and do not have ISO certification, they will be forced to spend more on machinery, if denied subsidy. To rescue these ancillaries from incurring losses, the state government should intervene, he said. James said about a 100% increase in the cost of raw materials in the past 12 months has forced the industries to bring down their production. The ancillaries which are depending on these industries for job works are in dire straits already. Unless there are measures from the government to regulate the cost of inputs, the market may not stabilise leading to the closure of micro units. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/assns-ask-govt-to-ease-subsidy-norm-for-micro-units/articleshow/87745859.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Based on the survey, an estimation has been prepared and sent to the directorate of municipal administration. Once funds are released, installation of new lamp posts will be carried out in a phased manner,” he told TOI.The corporation had received more than 250 suggestions from residents. “People continue to fill the Google Sheets we set up on the corporation website,” the commissioner added.While there are 97,000 street lights in the city, developing areas require more. “New layouts are coming up in the east zone, in areas such as Kalapatti and Vilankurichi. Those in north and south zones also require lights,” a corporation official said.An engineering official in the north zone said that as per the norm, there should be a gap of 30 metres between two street lights. “We plan to set up new posts if gap between two posts is 60 metres or more. The gap is big in newly-developed area and old area. New layouts, where street lights have not been installed, have been noted down in the survey conducted by assistant engineers. The Google Sheets is still open. Those in need can still make use of it. Details such as name, phone number, street and required number of posts and landmark details need to be submitted.”The corporation had conducted a survey a few months ago to find the dark spots in the city to set up street lights using the Nirbhaya fund. Eleven dark spots were identified and installation of 142 street lights was proposed, a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/let-there-be-light/articleshow/87745852.cms||---

Geeta was the sister of Haryana Police ADG OP Singh, who is the brother-in-law of late Sushant. Those who died in the accident included Geeta’s husband Laljit Singh (75), his two sons Amit Shekhar Singh alias Nomani Singh (52) and Ramchandra Singh (37), daughter Baby Devi (42), niece Daisy Devi (40) and driver Pritam Kumar Singh (29). The accident took place on NH-333A near Pipra village under the Halsi police station area in Lakhisarai district around 6am when their SUV collided head-on with a truck loaded with empty LPG cylinders, police said. The truck driver and co-driver escaped. Halsi police station SHO Awadhesh Kumar said Laljit belonged to Bhandra village under the Khaira police station while his daughter Baby was from Malaypur, niece Daisy from Ratanpur under the Giddhaur police station area and driver Pritam belonged to Sonpeh, all in Jamui district. The SHO said the injured Balmiki Singh (60) and his son Prashant Kumar alias Tonu (24) of Nawadih, Balmukund Singh (60) and his son Dilkhush Singh (23) of Chauhandih under the Khaira police station area were referred to Patna for treatment. “Balmiki is Amit’s father-in-law. Balmukund is Laljit’s brother-in-law. Daisy was her daughter,” he said. The SHO said Geeta had died in Patna in the course of treatment. “They were returning to Jamui after cremating her at Bans Ghat in Patna,” he said. He said the SUV in which the entire family was travelling had been mangled to an extent that two bodies, including that of the driver, remained trapped inside for more than an hour. Lakhisarai SP Sushil Kumar, who received a call from the Haryana ADG after the accident, said the SUV was overloaded and eyewitnesses said it was at a high speed. He said the NH was single-lane where the accident took place. “Either the driver dozed off or he failed to control the vehicle due to high speed and rammed into the truck,” the SP said. Laljit’s nephew Sujaan Singh lodged an FIR against the unidentified truck driver in connection with the deaths, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-of-a-family-related-to-ssr-die-in-accident/articleshow/87745081.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Three of them on Monday night forced their hapless victim to transfer Rs 13,000 to one of their bank accounts using GPay. But the laugh could be on them as the cops can easily nab them by tracing the bank account. Police said Ajith Kumar, 24, of Kalaignar Nagar in Kunrathur, was on his way to meet a friend in Poonamallee when a well-dressed man flagged him down at Avadi and asked for a lift. The man told him there weren’t any autorickshaws around and that he would get off further down the road. An unsuspecting Ajith obliged. A couple of kilometres further on, two men standing by the road waved to them to stop. Ajith Kumar slowed down and the men jumped in front of his bike and started assaulting him. The pillion rider also joined in. The robbers cut Ajith Kumar with a knife, drawing blood and snatched his phone. They then checked if Ajith Kumar had GPay on his phone. They forced him to use his password and transfer whatever money he had in his account, which was Rs13,000, police said. An investigating officer said the three men did not even ask him for cash but straightway checked if he had GPay. The trio then pushed Ajith Kumar off the road and fled on his bike with his mobile phone. Ajith Kumar managed to reach the Avadi police station with the help of a passer-by and lodged a complaint. Police have launched a hunt for the robbers using details of the bank account to which the money was transferred and footage from CCTV cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-robbers-force-youth-to-transfer-money-via-google-pay/articleshow/87745863.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Arthur Road, Byculla inmates jabbed with both Covid vaccine doses||MUMBAI: All inmates of the Arthur Road Jail and Byculla District Prison have been vaccinated with both doses against Covid-19. Project Mumbai, an NGO, had carried out the vaccination drive inside the prisons along with the municipal corporation. As on Friday, a total of 3,400 inmates from Arthur Road Jail and 900 from Byculla Prison have completed their vaccination schedule, Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai, said. “The prisons are extremely crowded spaces, and it was important to complete the vaccination process in prisons as early as possible since maintaining social- distancing wasn’t possible there,” he said. Volunteers from the NGO said they were pleasantly surprised to receive a helping hand from inmates at the time of registering their names on CoWin. Atharv Kulkarni, a volunteer with the NGO, said that a young businessman, who was well-versed with Excel, helped them in filling out details and carrying out pre-vaccination documentation. “Many came in pairs, holding hands since they feared getting jabbed. We counselled them,” Kulkarni said. The BMC had created special sessions for prisons. Inmates from foreign countries were particularly apprehensive. “They had read about the fake vaccine scams and were worried if they were getting the right vaccine. We explained to them that the vials had come straight from the corporation,” Kulkarni said. A senior Byculla jail officer told TOI that all inmates, both male and female, who were given first dose of vaccine inside the jail earlier have now completed the second doses as well. The Byculla jail houses men and women in separate sections. “Some inmates took their first dose in the jail and were later granted bail. They were given a printed vaccination certificate so that they could take the second jab outside,” the officer said. New inmates, who had already taken one shot before coming to the jail, were given the second shot after their certificates were checked. The officer said that if the number of newcomers swells, the NGO will be roped in again, and if there are fewer inmates, jail officials will contact BMC’s E ward office for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-arthur-road-byculla-inmates-jabbed-with-both-doses/articleshow/87746956.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “A doctor at heart, always! Great gesture by my colleague @DrBhagwatKarad.” The incident made its way to social media and the minister was praised for his intervention. The incident took place on IndiGo Delhi-Mumbai flight 6E-171, which departed Delhi around 1.40am and landed in Mumbai at 3.22am. Sources said about 40 minutes into the flight, the passenger complained of feeling uneasy and giddy. A cabin crew member made an inflight announcement and the minister came forward to help. “The aircraft’s emergency medical kit was brought and the minister gave the passenger an injection. He took the passenger’s pulse, had him raise his feet, and change his position frequently. The aircraft didn’t need to be diverted. After the aircraft landed, the passenger was again given medical care,” said a source. One Amit Chavan tweeted a photo that showed the minister taking the passenger’s pulse. “Hon.MoS Finance, Dr Bhagwat Karad, a doctor by profession helped a fellow passenger on an IndiGo flight who had complained of giddiness and is a hypertension patient.

---||Chandigarh||Showcasing IAF heritage will help more reach for the sky||IAF HERITAGE MUSEUM IN PRESS BUILDING Reaching for the sky... By Rajnish Wattas There is a hidden aviator in all of us. Remember the thrill of flying kites, launching them into the wind, manoeuvring in the sky or perchance a ‘dog fight’ with another, brought down by your lethal string. The recent news that the Chandigarh administration and Indian Air Force (IAF) have reached an agreement to create an IAF Heritage Museum at the government press building in Sector 18 is very exciting. The IAF plans to “showcase its vintage aircraft, armaments and memorabilia from different wars, including the 1971 Indo-Pak War and Kargil War, at the museum.” Other attractions will be a flight simulator, audio video galleries and a space for showcasing documentaries related to IAF history. With the tricity of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula boasting a large population of defence veterans and many of its youth joining the armed forces, the museum will engender greater interest in the world of aviation and the glorious role of our defenders of the skies. The museum is to be housed in the city’s heritage Government Press Building, one of the earliest edifices that was built in Chandigarh in 1953. It was designed by Edwin Maxwell Fry, part of Le Corbusier’s four-member European team, which included Pierre Jeanneret and Jane Drew. Though the IAF will surely hire the finest of talent to develop its display of exhibits, some thoughts on the adaptive reuse of an existing heritage building merit consideration. Smithsonian Air and Space MuseumI would like to recall my visit to the world famous Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington. Its amazing exhibits, imaginative displays and evocative themes make it an experience beyond a mere walk through time and space of American aviation and space explorations. It engages the visitor, whether a curious child or a war veteran, with the same thrill and wonder. In 2018, the museum saw approximately 6.2 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. Though a comparison between the Chandigarh and the Washington museums is odious; sharing some ideas, display techniques and methods is worthwhile. Being located close to the National Mall, White House and the Capitol, the Smithsonian opted for a design that would be architecturally impressive but which would not impinge on the historic style of the national icons. Gyo Obata, an American architect of Japanese descent, designed the museum as four cuboid blocks with marble cladding, connected by three spacious steel-and-glass atria housing larger exhibits such as missiles, airplanes and spacecraft. As you enter the Museum from the muted exterior, you find yourself in a voluminous space with a full height glass wall. It is called the ‘Boeing Milestones of Flight hall’. Vintage aircraft hang from the glass ceiling, suspended in mid-air, simulating flight! My own favourite is Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo trip across the Atlantic in his Spirit of St. Louis! One had read so much about the legendary flight and seen movies about it. There are of course, many other milestone-making aircraft and spacecraft exhibited there. Then you move on to “The Wright Brothers & The Invention of the Aerial”. The 1903 world's first successful airplane serves as the centrepiece of this exhibition. The airplane has been displayed on the floor, so you can get a close-up, eye-level look at the historic craft that ushered in the age of flight. The other sections, ‘Moving beyond Earth,’ asks the question, what is the Universe like? It presents the Universe as discerned by the naked eye, then shows how the telescope, photography, spectroscopy, and digital technology revolutionised our view. The other significant sections are on ‘Space Race’ of the cold war era, and one on ‘Time and navigation’. Limitations and Constraints of Press Building While we cherish the heritage value of the Press Building, recognising that it was made in an era of concrete for a limited purpose, adapting it to a museum that requires large spans will not be easy. The building is built on a tight grid of columns and beams that allow very limited space to showcase full-size airplanes, even of the vintage era. At best, most displays inside will be of audio visual nature, photographs or replica models of air planes. Even outdoors, there is limited open space for full size displays. Then why not be little more innovative? Even the Smithsonian, when faced with the problem of exhibiting larger number of displays, established a second campus of the Museum at the Washington Airport. Why can’t we then not also think of building an additional campus of the proposed IAF Museum simultaneously? A location like the PEC Campus, which has large open spaces and established one of the first courses in aeronautical engineering would be ideal. A museum like this will not only strengthen the institution’s research base but also bring citizens in closer contact with the engineering and scientific marvels of the campus. In fact, the IAF Museum should not be limited only to the theme of exhibiting the history of IAF, but also rope in ISRO to help set up a ‘Space Gallery’. We should proudly showcase our recent scientific achievements in the realm of space exploration and beyond. This might inspire many more Kalpana Chawlas to emerge. The Press building can house the already proposed Heritage Furniture Museum and a Tree Information Centre in addition to the IAF Museum to make full use of the vacant building. Let Chandigarh, the ‘city of tomorrow,’ spread its wings to fly high in space. ______________________________________________________________ Rajnish Wattas is former principal Chandigarh College of Architecture, an author, critic & modern heritage expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/showcasing-iaf-heritage-will-help-more-reach-for-the-sky/articleshow/87745078.cms||Rajnish Wattas

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Road along Valankulam shrouded in darkness||COIMBATORE: Motorists have urged the city corporation to switch on the street lights on the stretch connecting Ukkadam Road and Trichy Road along Valankulam lake. The busy road provides the much-required connectivity to reach key hubs in the city, including the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. The lights were installed on the road when the city corporation beautified the lake under the smart city project at a cost of Rs 24.47 crore. “But they are never switched on. If they are on, we would be able to cross the stretch, measuring less than a kilometre, without any hassle,” a motorist said. Mohammed Hasan, a resident of Ukkadam, said many motorists hesitate to take the road when it is shrouded in darkness. “At night, it would be difficult to spot pedestrians at a safe distance. Apart from motorists, pedestrians also face danger at night,” he told TOI. “Tipplers camp on the bunds of Valankulam after it turns dark. They would be deterred if the area is lit up.” B Veerakumar, a commuter, said presence of cows and ponies makes the stretch more dangerous. “It is difficult to spot dark-skinned animals at night. The lights should stay on throughout the night to help people travel without any difficulty,” he said. An official with the smart city scheme promised to look into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/road-along-valankulam-shrouded-in-darkness/articleshow/87745869.cms||---

The nearest ATM kiosk outside the terminal building is located more than 600m away on Jessore Road, where one either has to take a cab or a rickshaw and shell out anything between Rs 100 to Rs 150 or take a 20-minute walk to withdraw cash. “Last week, I came out of the airport and realised I had little cash with me. I needed cash as the pre-paid taxi counter wasn’t accepting cards because of some glitch and the app cabs were refusing to ply without cash payment. But sadly, I didn’t find a single ATM anywhere nearby. I had to walk all the way to VIP Road and then further towards Jessore Road with two trolley bags before I could get a functional ATM and draw some money. How can an international airport even run like this?” said Dwaipayan Roy, who reached Kolkata from Bangalore. Soumya Mukherjee, another frequent flyer, said he had faced the issue numerous times amidst the pandemic. “It has happened to me twice that I had forgotten to withdraw cash from inside the airport and outside, I found none. I had no option but to book a dodgy cab from a tout agreeing to pay extra money only to stop at an ATM midway to my home at Hooghly to withdraw cash,” said Mukherjee, a management consultant. Rickshaw pullers conceded to mint flyers, agreeing to take them to a functional ATM outside the airport and bring them back for anything between Rs 300-Rs 350. “Passengers not habituated with the area seek our help to find an ATM and it is a set rate for us to take the passengers to an ATM out of the airport and bring them back,” said one of the rickshaw pullers near the Volvo bus stand. While harrowing passengers fume at the absence of such a basic facility, airport authorities plead helplessness claiming they have been trying to find a suitable bidder for the last one and a half years and have issued two different tenders, every time lowering the amount but haven’t found a bank who agreed to pay the quoted rent and operate an ATM at the two vacant spots opposite gate 2A/2B of the arrival terminal. Even inside the airport, there are only two functional ATMs operating currently with two other kiosks remaining empty. “It’s a troubling issue. There were three-four banks operating ATMs inside and outside the airport but during the pandemic, their contract ended and they never renewed. Since then, we have called tender twice but haven’t received any response. I have now approached the head office to reduce the rate further. We can’t just hand over the ATM to some bank. We have to follow certain procedures. With passenger footfall coming back to pre-pandemic level, we hope we will find a response this time,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pay-a-bomb-to-draw-cash-outside-airport/articleshow/87745083.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
