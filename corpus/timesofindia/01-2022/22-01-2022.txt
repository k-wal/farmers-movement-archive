---||World||Trump appointee blocks Biden federal worker vaccine mandate||WASHINGTON: A US judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction on Friday barring the federal government from enforcing President Joe Biden's requirement that federal workers without qualifying medical or religious exemptions be vaccinated for Covid-19. Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas by then-president Donald Trump, ruled that opponents of Biden's vaccination mandate for federal employees were likely to succeed at trial and blocked the government from enforcing the requirement. Biden announced in September that more than 3.5 million federal workers were required to undergo vaccination, with no option to get regularly tested instead, unless they secured approved medical or religious exemptions.  The requirement kicked in in November, when the White House said more than 95 per cent of federal workers were in compliance with the Biden mandate either by being vaccinated or by having requested an exemption - and 92 per cent were vaccinated. Those out of compliance with the policy were referred to counseling and could be terminated under an executive order signed by Biden. Brown wrote that at issue was whether the president "can, with the stroke of a pen and without the input of Congress, require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment". He added, "That, under the current state of the law as just recently expressed by the Supreme Court, is a bridge too far."  The suit was brought by the group Feds for Medical Freedom.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-appointee-blocks-biden-federal-worker-vaccine-mandate/articleshow/89047622.cms||---

This became evident on Friday when BJP national president JP Nadda kicked off organizational meetings and took part in the door-to-door campaign in Agra and Bareilly. In Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath released the party's campaign song, "Soch Imaandar...Kaam Damdaar...UP Phir Mange BJP Sarkar...". Top BJP sources said that party's chief strategist and Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to reach Kairana in Shamli district on Saturday to launch a door-to-door campaign. Yogi will also participate in the door-to-door campaign in Aligarh and Bulandshahr on Saturday. He will also hold discussions with the prominent people in Bulandshahr. The BJP has been putting Kairana at the centrestage over the issue of exodus of Hindu families it raised before 2017 state elections. Shah is also expected to reach Meerut and Mathura to hold a dialogue with various social organizations -- a move that aligns with the party's strategy to gain a high ground by associating itself with different social groups. The development was perceived as BJP's attempt to overtake its political opponents, essentially SP chief Akhilesh Yadav who has been relying solely on rigorous use of social media to reach out to party functionaries and supporters in the aftermath of the election commission putting a ban on rallies because of the pandemic. Likewise, BSP chief Mayawati, who has stayed away from poll campaigning, too has been banking on the party's social media campaign. A senior BJP leader said that the ground level presence of top party leaders is bound to have an impressive effect on the foot soldiers who happen to play a pivotal role in the electoral yard work. "It works as a booster and exhilarates the grass root functionaries to ramp up the mass contact drive," said a senior BJP leader. BJP sources said that PM Narendra Modi had set the ball rolling earlier this week when he reached out to Varanasi's booth level presidents virtually and exhorted them to associate more and more people on the ground. This was his first formal political interaction with party workers in the current poll season. Sources said that the SP, too, might ask its senior leaders to step out to oversee the ground level campaigns. "Currently, party chief Akhilesh Yadav holds online meetings with party cadres on a daily basis," said a senior SP leader. He said that the candidates whose candidatures have been announced have already been asked to carry out door to door campaigns. "The call on senior party leaders stepping out will be taken soon," he said. Even as the BJP top ranks take to ground level meetings and public contact drive, the RSS -- saffron outfit's ideological fountainhead --has stepped up the spade work to fine tune BJP's poll strategy and diffuse any possible crisis in the backdrop of prospective candidates and sitting MLAs being denied a ticket. Sources said that RSS joint general secretary Arun Kumar, who has been tasked to establish synergy between Sangh and the BJP, recently visited Lucknow and held a detailed round of meeting with the organizational brass. Sources said that RSS functionaries have been asked to ramp up the nationalistic pitch which has been high on Sangh's agenda as a key measure to cut across caste lines in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/up-polls-amid-ban-on-rallies-bjps-top-netas-hit-the-ground-running/articleshow/89047844.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||India||Omicron reinfection possible, keep using masks, say health experts||PUNE: Top health experts have not ruled out the possibility of Omicron reinfection among people, which brings back the focus on Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination to check its spread and fatalities. Maharashtra Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “Reinfection is something that we cannot ignore in Covid at all, irrespective of the variant. Even if people have recently recovered from an Omicron infection, they cannot take the risk of improper masking or no masking, because reinfection with the variant has still not been ruled out.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, another member of the task force, said: “There is still no official Omicron reinfection case reported anywhere in India. But not following Covid-appropriate behaviour after recent Covid recovery is still not an option because one never knows what variant may surface in the future. Therefore, masking and physical distancing are a must to preclude any possible reinfections — whether from Omicron itself or any other SARS-CoV-2 variant.” Microbiologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, however, said: “If we use the three-month period between two infections (initial infection and reinfection) as the definition of reinfection, then it will be some time before we have clear data on reinfection with Omicron. It is, however, certainly feasible, just as it was with other variants, for people to test positive twice or more. But, infection is defined by active replication and is harder to prove.” In a recent tweet, Dr Eric Feigl-Ding, epidemiologist, health economist and a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, had said: “There are lots of recent anecdotes about new #Omicron reinfections after a recent Omicron infection. It’s certainly possible if your first Omicron infection was a low-dose one that didn’t stimulate your immune system enough or if you’re immunocompromised. Be careful folks.” Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19 said, “New Omicron reinfection after a recent Omicron infection may be just anecdotal cases and must be extremely rare considering the overall burden of Omicron infections. We need to wait for stronger data. Since RT-PCR can be positive for a long period in some patients, it may also not indicate reinfection but residual non-infectious virus from the same infection.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omicron-reinfection-possible-keep-using-masks-say-health-experts/articleshow/89047925.cms||Neha Madaan
---||World||Texas synagogue hostage-taker killed by multiple gun shots, says medical examiner||COLLEYVILLE: The gunman who held four people captive at a Texas synagogue in a 10-hour standoff that ended with the hostages escaping and an FBI tactical team rushing in was killed by multiple gunshot wounds, according to a medical examiner who ruled the death a homicide. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner released initial information from the autopsy of Malik Faisal Akram on Friday, six days after the 44-year-old British citizen took hostages during morning services at Congregation Beth Israel in the Dallas-area suburb of Colleyville. In Texas, a death being ruled a homicide indicates that one person was killed by another but does not necessarily mean the killing was a crime. Federal officials have so far declined to say who shot Akram, citing an ongoing investigation. After taking hostages Saturday, Akram could be heard on a Facebook livestream demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who is suspected of having ties to al-Qaida and was convicted of trying to kill US troops in Afghanistan. The prison where Siddiqui is serving her sentence is in nearby Fort Worth, but her attorney said Siddiqui said the prisoner had no connection to Akram. Akram released a hostage shortly after 5 pm but those remaining later said he became more belligerent and threatening as the night wore on. The standoff ended around 9 pm after Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said he threw a chair at Akram and he and the two other remaining hostages fled. Video of the standoff's end from Dallas TV station WFAA showed people running out a door of the synagogue, and then a man holding a gun opening the same door just seconds later before he turned around and closed it. Moments later, several shots and then an explosion could be heard. The medical examiner determined that Akram died at 9:22 p.m. Akram was from the English industrial city of Blackburn. His family said he had been "suffering from mental health issues." He arrived in New York on a tourist visa about two weeks before the attack on the synagogue and cleared checks against law enforcement databases without raising any red flags, officials said. He spent time in Dallas-area homeless shelters before the attack. Authorities believe he bought the handgun used in the hostage-taking in a private sale, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-synagogue-hostage-taker-killed-by-multiple-gun-shots-says-medical-examiner/articleshow/89047987.cms||---
---||Goa||Five-star Japan breeze past Myanmar, Korea have it easy||Japan began their quest for a hat-trick of titles with a 5-0 demolition of Myanmar in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune on Friday. From among the three groups, group C is undoubtedly the strongest, but there was never any doubt that Japan, the two-time defending champions, are favourites to finish on top. Japan struggled to break down a resolute Myanmar defence in the first half with goalkeeper May Zin New making some fine saves. The defending champions took the lead midway into the first half through Riko Ueki, and despite creating several other chances, could not add to that tally. In the second session, though, Japan turned on the style and scored four more goals. It started with Yui Hasegawa and Hikaru Naomoto scoring two more inside the first 12 minutes, before substitute Yui Narumiya made it 4-0. Hasegawa scored her second of the day and Japan’s fifth in stoppage time to wrap up what was a comfortable opening win in the 1.30pm kickoff. There was never any doubt about the gulf in difference between the two teams. Japan are two-time champions and among the best teams in world football, while Myanmar’s preparations for this tournament were severely hampered due to Covid-19. Myanmar, not surprisingly, opted to sit back and soak the pressure. They did a fine job at the start, frustrating Japan, and whenever the defence was breached, either the goalkeeper or the crossbar came to their rescue. Japan took the lead in the 22nd minute when goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita picked up Hasegawa on the right flank and her well-measured cross was brilliantly headed home by a diving Ueki. Myanmar goalkeeper May Zin New then made several saves, including a few from one-on-one situations, but could do nothing after the change of ends when West Ham United midfielder Hasegawa gave finishing touches to a deft flick from Ueki. Naomoto curled a free-kick over the wall to score Japan’s third and another substitute, Narumiya, added her name to the scoresheet in the 70th minute. A minute into stoppage time, Hasegawa made it 5-0 to hand coach Futoshi Ikeda his first official win since taking charge last October. Korea have it easy against VietnamKorea Republic made a fine start to their campaign in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup with a comfortable 3-0 win against Vietnam at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune on Friday. After having a goal chalked off, captain Ji So-yun provided the winners with an early fourth-minute lead. An own-goal from Tran Thi Phuong Thao made life difficult for Vietnam, and the Chelsea midfielder got her second when she converted a penalty in the 79th minute. Korea will face Myanmar on Monday, while Vietnam face defending champions Japan later that day in the second round of group C matches.

---||World||Daily Covid-19 cases from Omicron in US down 5% in the past week: CDC||WASHINGTON: The average daily Covid-19 cases from the Omicron variant in the United States fell about 5% in the past week, most notably in areas that saw an early surge in infections such as New York, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director said on Friday. There were about 744,600 cases per day on average in the past seven days while daily Covid-19 hospitalisations were down about 1% at 21,000 admissions on average, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing, adding daily deaths, however, were more at more than 1,700 per day. "In some parts of the country we are seeing the number of daily cases caused by the Omicron variant beginning to decline," she said. "The surge in cases started at different times in different regions and (we) may continue to see high case counts in some areas of the country in the days and weeks ahead." Meanwhile, the United States Postal Service began shipping at-home rapid Covid-19 tests on Thursday after millions of orders were placed through a new federal website launched this week, the White House said on Friday.  The federal government has tens of millions of tests on hand to ship out, along with free higher quality masks, and will disclose next week how many households have ordered them, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients told reporters at a briefing. Walensky also told reporters the agency was looking to shift its language on Covid-19 vaccinations to encourage Americans to be "up-to-date" with their shots by having a booster dose within a recommended time frame, but did not say whether the agency was formally changing its definition of fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daily-covid-19-cases-from-omicron-in-us-down-5-in-the-past-week-cdc/articleshow/89048004.cms||---
---||---||Open to contesting UP polls, but that doesn’t mean I’m CM face: Priyanka Gandhi||LUCKNOW: Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Friday that she might make her electoral debut by contesting in the UP assembly elections, but she shouldn’t be seen as the party’s candidate for the CM’s post. She told news channel NDTV that contesting the UP elections has been under consideration and internal discussions are on. “When there is a consensus, we will let you know,” said Priyanka, the Congress’s in-charge for UP since 2019. At a press conference to launch the party’s youth manifesto earlier in the day, she said she was the party’s face in UP. “Are you seeing any other faces from Congress? Then? Dikh toh raha hai na sab jagah mera chehra (My face can be seen everywhere),” she said in response to the question if she was the CM face. Priyanka, however, told NDTV later that her remarks were “tongue-in-cheek” because every second question she was asked was about this. “Between me, UPCC chief Ajay Lalloo and the CLP leader (Aradhna Mishra), we are leading the efforts in UP. But it is unlikely that we are officially going to announce this face or that face,” she said. “I am the (party) general secretary of Uttar Pradesh. And the responsibility is mine, and I’m dealing with it.” She also signalled Congress’s willingness to any post-poll alliance in case of a hung assembly, but with a condition. “If such circumstances arise, a decision will be taken accordingly. But if we do, we would certainly want our agenda for the youth and women, especially women, to be fulfilled if we were going to be part of any such dispensation,” Priyanka said.Congress under her leadership in UP has been reaching out to the women electorate and has also decided to field women on 40% of seats the party contests in this year’s polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/open-to-contesting-up-polls-but-that-doesnt-mean-im-cm-face-priyanka-gandhi/articleshow/89048033.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||World||Biden administration suspending 44 flights by Chinese carriers||WASHINGTON: The United States transportation department said on Friday it would suspend 44 China-bound flights from the United States by four Chinese carriers in response to the Chinese government's decision to suspend some US carrier flights over Covid-19 concerns.  The Biden administration action came after Chinese authorities suspended 20 United Airlines, 10 American Airlines and 14 Delta Air Lines flights since December 31 after some passengers tested positive for the Covid-19. The transportation department said as recently as Tuesday that the Chinese government had cancelled US flights.  The suspensions will begin on January 30 with Xiamen Airlines' scheduled Los Angeles-to-Xiamen flight and run through March 29.  The decision will cut some flights by Xiamen, Air China , China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.  The department said France and Germany have taken similar action against China's Covid-19 actions.  The transportation department said China's suspension of the 44 flights "are adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action". It added that China's "unilateral actions against the named US carriers are inconsistent" with a bilateral agreement.  China has also suspended US flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive.  The department said that if China revised its "policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for US carriers, the department is fully prepared to once again revisit the action". But it also warned that if China cancels more flights, "we reserve the right to take additional action".  China has all but shut its borders to travellers, cutting total international flights to just 200 a week, or 2% of pre-pandemic levels, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.  The number of US flights being scrapped has surged since December, as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the United States.  Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. In August, the US transportation department limited four flights from Chinese carriers to 40% passenger capacity for four weeks after Beijing imposed identical limits on four United Airlines flights.  Before the recent cancellations, three US airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-suspending-44-flights-by-chinese-carriers/articleshow/89048057.cms||---

The statue, made of black granite from Telangana, will be placed under the canopy at India Gate, probably in August this year, TOI has learnt. Once installed, the grand statue will be clearly visible from Raisina Hill. PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that he would unveil a hologram of Bose, Netaji to legions of his admirers, at the same place on his birthday on January 23 evening. Visitors will be able to see the hologram statue only at night. Government sources termed the decision to honour Bose a move by India to “reclaim its history” as the canopy had once featured a statue of England’s King George V, which was removed and shifted in 1968 to Coronation Park at Burari in Delhi. The honour for Netaji is expected to go a long way to salve the hurt of his devotees who have been sore that the freedom fighter has been denied recognition due to him. Significantly, the PM had hit out at the earlier Congress governments saying that leaders of previous dispensations constructed new things only for their families whereas his government is building monuments of national importance. “After Independence, new things were constructed only for a few families from Delhi. But today, the country is leaving behind that narrow thinking, building new places of pride, giving them grandeur. It is our government that built the Babasaheb Memorial in Delhi and the APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial in Rameswaram. Similarly, the places associated with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Shyamji Krishna Varma have been given grandeur. Adivasi museums are also being built across the country to bring forth the glo- rious history of our tribal society,” said the PM. Netaji’s daughter Anita Bose Pfaff said that he lived, lives and will continue to live in the hearts of the Indian pe- ople. Welcoming the PM’s announcement, Pfaff, who lives in Germany, said Netaji had a vision for the financial and economic strength of India and had set up a Planning Commission even before the country got its independence. She was speaking at a we- binar on Netaji organised by the Press Information Bureau, Jaipur. “What surprises me is it came all of a sudden now. One might have prepared a bit earlier, but better late than never, I must say. I hope that the controversy about the tableau can also be put to rest in a satisfactory manner,” she said. The announcement came just days after the government declared that the Republic Day celebrations will now start from January 23, Netaji’s birth anniversary. The government had also earlier renamed Ross Island in Andamans as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Island. Last year, the INA Trust had demanded that the government give “due space” to Netaji in the Central Vista project, which TOI had reported on October 25. Sources said Netaji’s statue at India Gate will be his biggest and tallest statue. “This will be a realistic sculpture made of a single-piece granite stone. The stone has been selected considering the strong character of Netaji,” an official said. He added that the culture ministry had started the project two months ago and the ground work has been completed. The actual work on the stone will start in the next few weeks and it could take at least five to six months to complete the statue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/netaji-statue-to-be-installed-at-india-gate-likely-in-august/articleshow/89048088.cms||Dipak K Dash

While expressing concern over the significant decline in the number of devotees visiting Kartarpur Sahib everyday post reopening of the corridor, chief executive officer (CEO) of its project management unit (PMU), Muhammad Latif, said on Friday that they would celebrate ‘Jashan-e-Baharan’ or the Spring fest, celebrated by Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus alike, at Kartarpur Corridor in February.  Stating that only 73 devotees arrived at the Kartarpur Corridor on Friday from India, Latif said since the reopening, only 200-plus devotees have been arriving every day on an average.  The CEO attributed rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus behind the decline in the number of devotees.  Claiming that they had never returned any Indian devotee in case they were not carrying a negative RT PCR report, the CEO said they themselves conduct free of cost Rapid RT PCR test at the border to adhere to the Covid guidelines. “Besides we also don’t want devotees to be bereft of fulfilling their religious aspirations despite reaching so close to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib,” said Latif.  He claimed that PMU had made arrangements of facilitating 5,000 devotees a day. “Various Indian organisations want to visit in jathas of more than 500 devotees but it seems that Indian authorities are only allowing 200-plus devotees per day,” he opined.  Inaugurated on November 9, 2019, the Kartarpur Corridor was temporarily closed on March 16, 2020, as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The newly constructed corridor enables Indian devotees to travel about 4.5 km inside Pakistan to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib where Sikh’s first master, Guru Nanak Dev, had spent around 18 years till his death.  On October 2, 2020, the Pakistani government announced to unilaterally open the Kartarpur Corridor but India denied to reciprocate the gesture. On November 17, 2021, India reopened its side of the Kartarpur Corridor for the daylong pilgrimage.  The CEO said despite economic stagnation, the Pakistani government is spending a huge amount on the maintenance of the Kartarpur Corridor, for which it has specially created a separate department.  “We have over 1,000 dedicated staff, including security personnel, which costs us anything between 5 to 6 crore in Pakistani rupees per month,” said the CEO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-attract-indians-to-kartapur-sahib-pakistan-to-celebrate-spring-festival/articleshow/89048301.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The CEO said despite economic stagnation, the Pakistani government is spending a huge amount on the maintenance of the Kartarpur Corridor, for which it has specially created a separate department.  “We have over 1,000 dedicated staff, including security personnel, which costs us anything between 5 to 6 crore in Pakistani rupees per month,” said the CEO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/to-attract-indians-to-kartapur-sahib-pakistan-to-celebrate-spring-festival/articleshow/89048375.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Justice C Hari Shankar, who is part of a bench headed by justice Rajiv Shakdher, reminded Rebecca John, appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court on the petitions seeking to criminalise marital rape, that while “there is a right to expect sexual relations from both sides in a marriage, there is no such right when the parties are not married”. Explaining why he remains sceptical of “too much emphasis” on wife’s consent made by the amicus, Shankar said Parliament did provide “some kind of rational basis” to justify the exception in IPC 375 to protect husbands. “We are obfuscating this entire argument, this entire rationale (provided by legislature) by concentrating on consent, consent, consent. We can’t deny that there is a presumption of constitutionality in the law made by Parliament. Specially in a criminal case we don’t lightly quash a provision that is not deemed an offence,” Shankar said. He wondered if the court can “substitute our sensitivities or sensibilities” and “step into the legislature’s shoes” to overturn a legal provision when there is a “prima facie rational basis” for it given by Parliament. “That’s the kind of dialogue which unfortunately from day one I am not getting an answer for, have been posing it again and again...we are not supposed to find ways to quash a provision,” the judge told the amicus, outlining his reservations. At the very start of Friday’s hearing, Shankar pointed out that one can’t “close ones eyes” to the fact that there is a difference that can be understood between a marital and non-marital relationship. “There is one case where a man has no right to ask at all for sex since they are not in a marriage, but another case where he has a right sanctified with marital bond between them, he can expect reasonable sexual relations with partner,” Shankar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/too-much-emphasis-on-wifes-consent-delhi-hc-tells-amicus-on-marital-rape/articleshow/89048392.cms||Abhinav Garg

On a day when opposition parties criticised the government for allegedly extinguishing the "eternal flame", official sources dubbed the allegation as misinformation. They said the merger of the Jyoti with the flame at the National War Memorial will mark a tribute to the fallen soldiers befitting their sacrifice. They pointed out that the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which was lit in the honour of the soldiers killed in the 1971 war with Pakistan, did not have the names of the martyrs. “It was an odd thing to see that the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti paid homage to the martyrs of the 1971 and other wars but none of their names are present there,” a source said. The names inscribed on the India Gate are of only some martyrs who fought for the British in the World War-I and the Anglo-Afghan War, and thus are a symbol of our colonial past, sources said. “The names of all Indian martyrs from all the wars, including 1971 and wars before and after it are housed at the National War Memorial. Hence it is a true ‘shraddhanjali’’to have the flame paying tribute to martyrs there,” a source said. In a dig at the Opposition, sources remarked that it is ironic that people who did not make a National War Memorial for seven decades are now making a hue and cry when a permanent and fitting tribute is being made to the martyrs, sources said. Lt General ( retd) Satish Dua who oversaw the construction of National War Museum welcomed the decision on merger of the two flames. "It gives me great satisfaction that the eternal flame of Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate is being merged with National War Museum,” tweeted the retired General. He further said: “India Gate is a memorial to the fallen heroes of the First World War. The Amar Jawan Jyoti was added in 1972 as we did not have another memorial. National War Memorial pays homage to the Indian bravehearts after Independence. All homage ceremonies had shifted to NWM already."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amar-jawan-jyoti-merged-for-true-shradhanjali-to-martyrs/articleshow/89048443.cms||---
---||World||Anti-abortion protesters optimistic at March for Life in DC||WASHINGTON: Thousands of anti-abortion protesters were in a celebratory mood Friday as they rallied in the nation's capital and marched to the Supreme Court with a growing sense of optimism that their goal was finally in reach: a sweeping rollback of abortion rights.  The March for Life, for decades an annual protest against abortion, was held as the Supreme Court has indicated it will allow states to impose tighter restrictions on abortion with a ruling in the coming months - and possibly overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling that affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion.  "It doesn't feel real. There's so much hope and vibrancy and happiness and joy at this thing," said Jordan Moorman of Cincinnati. "I really do believe that we're in a post-Roe generation."  The rally, held one day before the 49th anniversary of the Roe decision, is taking place amid a Covid-19 surge that limited turnout at the National Mall. Some abortion opponents posted on the event's Facebook page that they will not attend because of Covid-19 vaccine mandates for people going to restaurants and other places in Columbia.  Still, the rally drew a crowd of thousands on a sunny but frigid day, with a heavy contingent of young people and students bussed in by schools and church groups. The mood was overwhelmingly optimistic, with many treating the end of Roe v Wade as an inevitability.  "Hopefully this will be the last March for Life," said the Rev. Andrew Rudmann, a Catholic priest from New Orleans, who was attending his 11th event.  Rudmann said previous marches may have had larger crowds but he doesn't recall this level of optimism. He said the crowds grew "gigantic" under former president Donald Trump and the movement's enthusiasm grew with each Trump Supreme Court appointee. He proudly pointed out that his home Archdiocese of New Orleans includes the Catholic high school that educated Trump's last appointee, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.  "Sometimes I would come to the March and it would be great to be united with people who share my beliefs, but there would also be this heaviness," he said. "This time the whole language and vibe is different."  After the rally, the crowd marched to the Supreme Court with chants that included: "We love babies, yes we do, we love babies, how bout you?" and "hey hey, ho ho, Roe v Wade has got to go!"  Abortion rights groups worry that at least 26 states are in line to further limit abortion access if Roe is weakened or overturned. In December, the court indicated in a major case that it would uphold a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, and allow states to ban abortion even earlier. The Mississippi case directly challenges Roe.  Courts have also dealt Texas abortion providers a string of defeats over efforts to block a law that since September has banned abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant. Another loss for Texas clinics came Thursday, when the Supreme Court refused to speed up the ongoing challenge over the law, which providers say is now likely to stay in effect for the foreseeable future.  "This law is cruel and unconstitutional, and I am deeply disappointed that our judicial system has done very little to stop it," said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Whole Woman's Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas.  Lawmakers from both parties weighed in Friday to note the anniversary of Roe vs Wade and reflect on the shifting political landscape surrounding abortion.  "It has been an eye-opening year for the cause of life in America, and we have made significant progress in defending our youngest and most vulnerable," said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House.  "The stakes are higher than ever, with the health and autonomy of women and families across the country hanging in the balance as Republicans work to methodically challenge and overturn Roe," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "It's time to sound the alarm and make clear: decisions about our bodies, our health care and our future belong to us."  Dozens of GOP lawmakers appeared at the march personally or as part of a video voicing their allegiance with those in attendance. White House press secretary Jen Psaki took note of the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling as part of Friday's press briefing, saying that "reproductive health care has been under extreme and relentless assault ever since, especially in recent months."  She said the Biden administration was committed to working with Congress to pass a bill that protects the right to provide and access abortion care free from forced waiting periods, biased counseling and other restrictions.  Mississippi state Sen. Joey Fillingane, a Republican who pushed for the state's strict abortion laws, said that if Roe were nullified, he expects states to take different approaches to setting their own abortion laws.  "I think that's the way it should be," he said. "The laws in California, based on their population and what they want, may be very different than the laws in Mississippi based on what our population feels about the issue of life."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anti-abortion-protesters-optimistic-at-march-for-life-in-dc/articleshow/89048515.cms||---
---||World||Biden tells mayors to spend Covid aid to boost workforces, job training||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden called on United States mayors on Friday to use more of their state and local Covid-19 aid funds to boost worker training and pay child care workers, moves that could increase the supply of workers and reduce income inequality. Biden said in remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors to use American Rescue Plan resources to "build for a better future around the people who make communities run."  "Use your funds to cover child care costs, or temporary paid leave to help certain workers dealing with Omicron," Biden said. "Build pathways to better jobs, through union-based apprenticeships, on-the-job training. To give people in every ZIP code a chance to deal for themselves."  The call comes as Biden's administration is shifting the way it promotes its economic agenda, casting its "Build Back Better" social and climate spending plan as a way to boost the economy's productive capacity, by increasing available labor and productivity -- blunting criticism from Republicans that it would increase inflationary pressures.  Earlier on Friday, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen branded the new approach "modern supply side economics", twisting around a phrase normally associated with the Reagan-era tax cuts and reduced regulation favored by Republicans.  The Biden administration is facing pressure to control inflation, which soared by 7% last year, the biggest annual increase in nearly 40 years as demand for goods and housing outstripped supply, a phenomenon which economists attribute partly to a lack of qualified workers.  Biden said his spending legislation would increase labour supply by cutting child care costs, allowing women to return to the workforce.  "This bill would reduce inflationary pressures on the economy -- not increase it, reduce it," Biden said.  Cities have wide-ranging ability to use money from the $350 billion State and Local Fiscal Relief Fund, which was approved in last year's American Rescue Plan Covid-19 aid legislation.  The treasury department earlier this month issued final rules for the program that allow greater flexibility for use of the funds on programs such as early childhood education, child care and affordable housing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-tells-mayors-to-spend-covid-aid-to-boost-workforces-job-training/articleshow/89048551.cms||---
---||World||Associate of Trump's ex-personal lawyer gets year in prison in campaign finance case||NEW YORK: A Florida man who helped Rudy Giuliani, ex-personal lawyer of former president Donald Trump, seek damaging information against Joe Biden in Ukraine was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $10,000 Friday in an unrelated campaign finance case. Igor Fruman was told to report to prison March 14. He pleaded guilty in September to a single charge of solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national.  As part of the plea, he admitted soliciting a million dollars from a Russian entrepreneur, Andrey Muraviev, to donate to Republicans in Nevada, Florida, and other states as part of an effort to launch a recreational marijuana business.  Federal prosecutors in New York had urged Judge J Paul Oetken to sentence Fruman to between three and four years in prison. Defense lawyers had argued he should face no incarceration because he has otherwise led a law-abiding life.  Fruman was charged in the case along with Lev Parnas, another Florida businessman who helped Giuliani's attempt to spoil Biden's quest for the presidency on the Democratic ticket.  The pair served as liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials and business tycoons as the former New York City mayor tried to persuade prosecutors in that country to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, over his work for an energy company.  U.S. prosecutors haven't brought any charges in connection with the Ukrainian influence campaign, which was the subject of one of former president Donald Trump's impeachment trials, but focused instead on donations that Fruman and Parnas made to U.S. politicians as they sought to build influence in Republican political circles.  Parnas was convicted in October of campaign finance crimes and awaits sentencing.  Politicians who got the illegal donations, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, have said they were unaware the money secretly came from a foreign source.  Muraviev was not charged in the case. Giuliani, who worked for Trump as a personal attorney, faces a continuing investigation into whether he was required to register as an agent of a foreign government during his dealings with Ukraine authorities.  The inquiry partly involves an examination of whether Giuliani offered to lobby or influence the Trump administration on behalf of Ukrainian figures. Giuliani has said everything he did in Ukraine was done on Trump's behalf and there is no reason he would have had to register as a foreign agent.  Following raids on Giuliani's home and business last year, former federal judge Barbara Jones was appointed by a judge to determine what materials on electronic devices seized in the raid can be turned over to criminal prosecutors.  In a four-page report issued Friday, Jones said only a few dozen items among tens of thousands of communications on seven of his electronic devices have been prevented from being turned over to prosecutors because they contain privileged communications. She said she was awaiting further assignments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/associate-of-trumps-ex-personal-lawyer-gets-year-in-prison-in-campaign-finance-case/articleshow/89048700.cms||---

It also added two new features to the online platform that played a significant role in implementation of the countrywide Covid vaccination programme. Now six members, instead of four, can be registered for vaccination using one mobile number. Besides, beneficiaries can also correct their vaccination status on CoWin. “It is clarified that no data has leaked from CoWin portal and the entire data of residents is safe and secure on this digital platform. It is also clarified that while Union ministry of health and family welfare will enquire into the substance of the news, prima facie the assertion is not correct, as CoWin collects neither the address of the person nor the RT-PCR test results for Covid-19 vaccination,” the ministry said in a statement following reports of alleged leak of data. Through new utility feature introduced under the “Raise an Issue” section of CoWin, a beneficiary can revoke the current vaccination status from fully vaccinated to partially vaccinated or unvaccinated status and also partially vaccinated to unvaccinated status. “The vaccination status can be corrected by the beneficiaries, where in occasional isolated cases, the vaccination certificates are generated due to inadvertent data entry errors by the vaccinator in updation of vaccination data of beneficiaries,” the ministry said. On change of vaccination status, the ministry said such beneficiaries can get their due vaccine dose, may be at the nearest vaccination centre, according to existent standard guidelines, once a new vaccination status is successfully updated in the system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-leak-of-data-from-cowin-says-govt-adds-feature-to-app/articleshow/89048733.cms||---

While government sources indicated that the demand for liquid medical oxygen used by critical patients admitted to hospitals, especially those in the intensive care units (ICU), has peaked, the numbers are seen to be tallying with a spike in infections in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi where the maximum number of Covid-19 cases during the third wave was reported around the start of the new year. While cases are rising in several states, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, state government are claiming that the peak has been reached in Mumbai and Delhi. Government sources said that hospitilisation rates have been lower as a proportion of infections and the numbers needing oxygen support are nowhere close to Delta variant levels, resulting in lower oxygen demand. During the peak of Delta wave last summer, demand for liquid medical oxygen had reached nearly 10,000 MT, prompting the government to scurry for sources across the country as well as overseas. Since then, capacity has been beefed up with daily production capacity now pegged at over 8,700 MT. against this production has been under 6,000 MT without calling up resources from the steel and petroleum sectors. In fact, with production remaining high, and consumption staying moderate, the total stock of LMO is now hovering over 85,000 MT as against around 76,000-77,000 MT around January 6-8, accessed from PESO showed. Apart from enhancing LMO capacity, the oxygen plants set up in hospitals have also helped augment capacity with the government claiming it can meet daily demand of around 19,000 MT a day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-omicron-surge-oxygen-demand-peaked-on-january-8-to-1900mt/articleshow/89048837.cms||Sidhartha

The SIT had filed a 5,000-page chargesheet against Ashish and 12 others on January 3 and said the incident (the mowing down of four farmers and the journalist) was “premeditated and not an act of negligence”. The four farmers who have now been charged for the lyinching of the BJP workers are already lodged in the Lakhimpur Kheri jail. Three of them have been charged with murder and one for other related offences. Three other farmers who had been arrested earlier were released from jail in the evening on the court’s order. Giving details about the second chargesheet, a 1600-page document, senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav told TOI, “In the chargesheet submitted by investigating officer SK Pal, four farmers, Gurwinder Singh, Kamaljeet Singh, Gurpreet Singh and Vichitra Singh, have been named as accused. A closure report was submitted against three farmers, Avtaar Singh, Ranjeet Singh and Kawaljeet Singh due to lack of evidence against them.” Yadav added, “Gurwinder, Kamaljeet and Gurpreet were charged under relevant sections of the IPC.” sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object),114 (abettor present when offence is committed), 109 (abetment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 302 (murder), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire), and 504 (intentional insult). “Vichitra Singh has been charged under IPC sections 109, 114, 427, 436 and 504,” he added.

Pawar added Kolhe was not with NCP when he played the role. The film was shot in 2017, while Kolhe joined NCP later. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister Jitendra Awhad had targeted Kolhe over the issue, and BJP had sought to know the actor-turned-MP’s “exact stand on Godse.” Kolhe, MP from Shirur who was earlier with Shiv Sena, issued a video message on Friday. “It seems many people have got hurt because of my role as Godse in the Hindi movie “Why I Killed Gandhi”. I have never endorsed the act of Godse or his views against Mahatma Gandhi,” he said. Explaining the circumstances behind accepting the role, he said after playing Chhatrapati Shivaji in a TV serial, he wanted to play Chhatrapati Sambhaji on TV or in a film. Kolhe, who is an MBBS graduate, said he received an offer for a serial on Sambhaji, but the shooting got stalled after so me days. Around this time, in 2017, he got the offer to play Godse in the film directed by Ashok Tyagi, he said. Actors like the late Nilu Phule or Pran played negative roles in films but in real life they were progressive, Kolhe said. “I repeat that I do not endorse the ideology or views of Godse,” he said, adding he did not even promote the film. “In 2017, as an actor it was my need to get a role in films. It should be understood in that context,” he said. State Congress president Nana Patole on Friday said his party will not tolerate glorification of Gandhi’s assassin and added it would have been better if Kolhe had avoided playing the role. Patole said though Kolhe is an artiste, he is also MP of a party and is expected to act more responsibly. State Bharitya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil said Kolhe should clarify his “exact stand on Godse and his views”, because his leader Sharad Pawar did not approve of Godse’s views. “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is totally against Godse and his actions,” Patil added. Earlier, Awhad had said that even if Kolhe had played Godse in his capacity as actor, “it is indeed an endorsement of Godse’s views.” Maharashtra Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Jayant Patil had defended Kolhe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ncp-mp-faces-flak-for-playing-godses-role-gets-pawar-backing/articleshow/89049103.cms||---
---||India||Block 35 more Pakistan-based YouTube channels: Information and Broadcasting ministry||NEW DELHI: The Union ministry of Information and Broadcasting said on Friday it has issued orders to block 35 more YouTube channels, two websites, Twitter and Instagram accounts each, and one Facebook account, all originating in Pakistan, for spreading anti-India content in a “coordinated manner over digital media”. The fake, anti-India content contained references to Indian Army, Jammu and Kashmir, India’s foreign relations with other countries, including fake information about the demise of former Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and content seeking to undermine the elections in five poll-bound states. The I&B ministry said the channels also propagated toxic, separatist content, which have “the potential to incite its audience into commission of crimes adversely affecting public order in India”. The January 20 order comes exactly one month after the ministry invoked, for the first time, the emergency clause of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, to block 20 YouTube channels and two websites on December 20, last year. Union I&B secretary Apurva Chandra referred to the pernicious content as a “war of misinformation against India” and said the blocking orders followed fresh intelligence inputs about YouTube accounts operating from Pakistan. Some of the YouTube channels, Chandra said, have a total subscriber base of over 1.2 crore and the anti-India content they have disseminated had over 130 crore views. He said orders to block the social media accounts and websites were issued after Indian intelligence agencies, which were closely monitoring these accounts and websites flagged them to the I&B ministry for immediate action. “While the ministry is alive to finding and blocking such kind of content, we also call upon people to flag such content when they see it. It is also the responsibility of intermediaries to create systems where such kind of fake and toxic content is automatically flagged,” Chandra said. In December, when the ministry ordered the blocking of 20 YouTube channels, YouTube had responded by blocking them not just in India, but also globally, within 24 hours of the ministry flagging the content. As per the IT Rules, the ministry’s interim orders to DoT, YouTube and the social media platforms will have to be ratified at a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Government Committee (IGC) within 48 hours. This, joint secretary Vikram Sahay said, is likely early next week||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/block-35-more-pakistan-based-youtube-channels-information-and-broadcasting-ministry/articleshow/89049124.cms||Swati Mathur
---||---||In 4th UP list, BJP keeps focus on OBCs, Dalits, shows faith in sitting MLAs||LUCKNOW: The fourth list of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) once again reflected its focus on Dalits and other backward classes (OBCs) as together they accounted for 49 seats out of the 85, for which candidates were announced on Friday evening. The OBCs alone got 30 seats while 19 tickets went to Dalits, mostly from the Kori community. The party has announced 195 out of possible 403 so far. Asim Arun, an IPS officer, who recently took VRS while he was posted as Kanpur police commissioner, has been given ticket from Kannauj Sadar reserved constituency. BJP had won 73 out of these 85 seats. Four of them have defected to the Samajwadi Party. Out of the remaining 69 winners of 2017, the party has retained 56, or more than 80%. Upper caste tickets mostly comprised Thakurs (15) and Brahmins (14) who together got 29 seats while three Punjabis and four from Vaishya community also made the cut. Among the OBCs, the maximum 10 tickets have gone to Lodhis, followed by seven to Kurmis, one to Nishad and one to Yadav candidate. Eleven other OBCs include Maurya, Kushwaha and Shakyas. The party has also given tickets to six turncoats, including two from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's home turf Rae Bareli — Aditi Singh from Rae Bareli Sadar and Rakesh Singh from Harchandpur. Although both switched over from the Congress recently, they have been siding with the BJP for quite long. Rakesh's brother Dinesh Singh, in fact, contested against Sonia in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Among others who have come from other parties are BSP’s Brahmin face and former cabinet minister Ramveer Upadhayay, Nitin Agrawal, former minister and MP Naresh Agarwal's son, who switched loyalty from the SP to join the BJP, Hariom Yadav, who is also a sitting MLA from Sirsaganj on the SP ticket and Anil Singh who is a BSP MLA from Purwa seat in Unnao. Yadav is a relative of the Samajwadi Party’s patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Upadhyaya, who was the sitting MLA from Sadabad constituency on the BSP ticket, has been fielded from the same assembly seat. In Kanpur, Cabinet minister Satish Mahana has managed to retain his candidature from Maharajpur seat while minister of states Nilima Katiyar from Kalyanpur, Mannu Kori and Ranvendra Singh ‘Dhunni’ have also managed to get the nod to contest. Among the seats of four defectors, Salona Kushwaha has been fielded from Tilhar after the sitting BJP MLA Roshan Lal Verma went to the SP, along with Swami Prasad Maurya. Similarly, in Bidhuna, Vinay Shakya has been replaced by his daughter Riya, ending speculation that Pramod Gupta, who joined the BJP on Thursday, could be fielded from there. Gupta won from Bidhuna on an SP ticket in 2012. Similarly, Vinod Kumar Awasthi has been fielded from Dharaura in place of Bala Prasad Awasthi, and Rahul Sonkar from Bilhaur in place of Bhagwati Prasad Sagar. Both defected to the SP, along with S P Maurya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/in-4th-up-list-bjp-keeps-focus-on-obcs-dalits-shows-faith-in-sitting-mlas/articleshow/89049171.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The weekend curfew from Friday 10pm to Monday 5am had been imposed on January 5 following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Although the state continues to see a rising number of cases and nearing its peak, the government withdrew the weekend curfew since the number of patients hospitalised is not alarming. "We decided to withdraw the weekend curfew subject to the condition that if the rate of hospitalisation goes up alarmingly from the current 5%, we'll reimpose it," said revenue minister R Ashoka after the two-hour long review meeting chaired by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. The meeting also decided not to reopen schools in Bengaluru, except classes 10-12, till January 29 while allowing schools in other districts to operate classes as usual from Monday. "We'll review the situation next Friday and take a call on reopening of schools in Bengaluru," said primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh. Based on the recommendation of health experts, he said one single school will be considered a unit and the government will take a call on closure of schools in the districts. "If few Covid cases are reported, that particular school will be closed for three days. If the number is high, the school will be closed for seven days," Nagesh said, adding that assistant commissioners, district health officers, and tahsildars have been empowered to take a call. Ashoka earlier insisted that the weekend curfew is being lifted based on experts' report and considering the decisions by neighbouring Maharashtra and Kerala. He said there has been demand from people, organisations and political leaders across party lines to lift the weekend curfew. "We have taken this decision based on experts' reports and on a scientific basis and not under any pressure,'' he said, appealing to people to follow Covid guidelines and precautionary measures. He said the guidelines imposed on January 5 will remain in effect, including restrictions on protests, rallies, fairs, and other mass gatherings. Apart from this, the 50 per cent rule in pubs, theatres, malls and commercial establishments will continue. As on January 20, Ashoka said Karnataka has 2,93,231 active cases. Among them, 2.8 lakh people are being treated in home isolation and 5,344 people hospitalised with 340 in ICU and 127 on ventilators. The positivity rate in the state is 19.9 per cent and it's 8% among kids and 16.5% among the elderly. "The CM has directed us to focus on children who are admitted to hospitals," he said. Covid experts had earlier informed the government that the worst-case scenario for the state is 1 lakh to 1.2 lakh cases a day. They added that cases are expected to rise in Karnataka in the next few weeks and reach the peak on January 25. Karnataka has so far reported 50,000 cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ktaka-lifts-weekend-curfewnight-curbs-to-stay-till-jan-29/articleshow/89049178.cms||---

Additional commissioner Vaishali Sharma inspected the landfill site on Friday and gave the directions. The firm has been told to submit a disposal certificate to the MCG, failing which a penalty will be imposed on it. Also, the payment will be stopped, an official said. The civic body has also directed the private firm and MCG’s concessionaire for solid waste management, Ecogreen, to work in coordination and ensure that lechate does not go beyond the pond boundary.“We have made it clear that the processed waste should be lifted from the nearby villages and effectively dispose and submit the disposal certificate to the MCG. If they fail to do so, a penalty would be imposed on the firm. The concessionaire, Ecogreen, has also been told to coordinate with the private firm,” said Sunder Sheoran, executive engineer-Swachh Bharat Mission, MCG.“There is a space constraint at the landfill site. I have not dumped the waste in the villages, however, I have taken the private land in Mangar and Bandhwari on rent to store the processed waste and simultaneously sent it to cement plants for further processing. For example, if I am processing 4,000 tonnes every day at the landfill site, around 1,500 tonnes of RDF generated will have to be kept somewhere till it goes to the cement plant for further processing. The process takes some time and if the people and other agencies cooperate with me, I would be able to reduce the mountain garbage,” said Sheeshpal Rana of Patheya, the firm which has been given the contract to clear and process 2 lakh metric tonnes of waste from the landfill site.“We have been told to assist the other contractor to prevent leachate spilling. For the watste treatment plant, we have already started demolition work so that the boundary wall can be constructed around the site,” said Sumit Kumar, general manager-engineering, Ecogreen.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/pvt-firm-told-to-clear-waste-from-aravalis/articleshow/89049180.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The directions come during the meeting with senior officials of district administration and other civic agencies in the city.Presiding over the meeting, deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that the depleting groundwater level in Gurgaon is a matter of concern. “The amount of water that is being recharged in the district is being wasted twice as much. Keeping in view the increasing population and the demand for water in the district, work will have to be done on some important points to prepare a water plan in the district.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/nodal-officers-appointed-to-monitor-water-supply-data/articleshow/89049181.cms||---

The hearing has been scheduled for Monday. Sethia was accused in the case by the special task force (STF) of Haryana Police, which is probing the matter, based on the disclosure statement of Dr Sachinder Jain Naval, the prime accused in the case.Earlier in December, the STF had made Sethia an accused in the case and added additional sections, including those under the Anti-Corruption Act. On December 10, the state government had suspended the IPS officer, who is alleged to have taken Rs 3.5 crores from Dr Naval for settling the case.Cash amounting to several crores were allegedly stolen from two flats owned by the developer of a Sector 84 residential society in August.

---||Gurgaon||Sohna elevated road to fully open to commuters by March end, says NHAI||Gurgaon: The 21km-long Sohna elevated road, under construction for nearly four years now, would be fully opened to commuters by March-end this year, according to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).The 12km-long stretch between Badshapur and Sohna, package 2 of the project, is almost ready and will be thrown open this month. However, package 1, involving the 9km-long stretch running between Rajiv Chowk and Badshapur, will take a little longer, expected to be ready by March-end.“The entire project is on track to be completed by March. We expect to complete package 2 this month, and package 1 will be ready by the end of March. The two portions of the elevated road are under development as separate packages, so we can open the stretch under package 2 while still finishing work on package 1,” said a senior NHAI official who did not want to be named. Nearly 95% of the work on package 2 costing Rs 606 crore, and 75% of the work on package 1 costing Rs 690 crore is complete, added the official.The Rs 1,300-crore Sohna elevated road project got conceptualised to create signal-free connectivity between Rajiv Chowk and Sohna and allow people to avoid the busy intersections along the stretch, including Vatika Chowk. In addition, the elevated road is likely to bring down the current three-hour travel time between Gurgaon and Alwar to less than two hours.The work on the project had started in 2018, with an initial deadline of 25 months. The project, however, got delayed due to some complications in the shifting of utilities, the pandemic lockdown and repeated construction bans over high pollution levels. Additionally, the project got delayed because of an August 2020 accident involving the collapse of a 40m spine of the elevated road. Subsequently, the NHAI had suspended work on the stretch after finding out that the concessionaires of the two packages had been flouting safety norms and resuming the construction only after a month.In September last year, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had declared the latest March 2022 deadline for the project while in Gurgaon for an inspection of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, which is currently under construction. He had then stated that the Sohna elevated road would also connect to the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway that may be ready by 2023.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/sohna-elevated-road-to-fully-open-to-commuters-by-march-end-says-nhai/articleshow/89049184.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Why only 1 midway exit on elevated road: Commuters||Gurgaon: Residents and commuters have questioned whether the 21km-long Sohna elevated road to be thrown open in March would effectively ease traffic movement in the area. They claimed that many commuters would not use it because the road has only a single entry point at the Ghamroj toll, apart from the Rajiv Chowk and Sohna entry or exit points. Residents said that if the NHAI had created more such points, the road could have solved the traffic issue. "Due to this factor, the road will lose out on a lot of commuters; not everyone is looking to travel the entire distance from Rajiv Chowk to Ghamroj or Sohna to Ghamroj. If the road provided connectivity with other places in the city, as well, many more people would have used it,” said Nalini Kumar, a Sector 86 resident.The NHAI should have at least created an entry point to the elevated road at Vatika Chowk, Ananya Sinha, a Sector 69 resident, added. “There are so many residents living along the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) who could have used the road then. With how it is now, nobody is going to travel six kilometres towards Rajiv Chowk to get on the elevated road and then go towards Sohna when they can travel in the opposite direction and probably reach their destination quicker.”A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) official also confirmed that once commuters get on the elevated road from Rajiv Chowk or Sohna, the only midway point to exit is at the Ghamroj toll where they can switch to the service road. "If anyone accesses the highway at Ghamroj, they have to go all the way to Rajiv Chowk or Sohna. There are no other entries or exits along the stretch,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/why-only-1-midway-exit-on-elevated-road-commuters/articleshow/89049185.cms||Sakshi Dayal

But we are focusing only on the transfer of funds to multiple accounts,” said a senior officer of Gurgaon police.The special investigation team (SIT) looking into the case has issued notices to over 80 account holders to record their statements, explaining why they received money from the BSF officer over the past year. “Every day, we call around 10-15 persons to record their statements,” said the officer.Most of the transactions, according to SIT, were commercial, and some other transactions were for the purchase of properties in Gurgaon. Additionally, the SIT is scanning the financial transactions of all the accused in the case.To date, police have registered five different FIRs in the case and arrested four persons, including Praveen Yadav, his wife Mamata, sister-in-law Rituraj and property dealer Dinesh. Another suspect, Naveen, assistant commandant, ITBP, posted at the NSG campus during the fraud, is on the run.Praveen Yadav, who was on deputation at the NSG campus in Gurgaon till May last year, had started planning the fraud even before ending his NSG deputation. Yadav, who wanted to be rich in a short while, became addicted to future trading in the share market and invested beyond his paying capacity. After exhausting his savings, he borrowed money from his batchmates, which he also lost in the future trading. The borrowing went on till Yadav had a debt of several crores.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/contract-fraud-sit-grills-account-holders-who-got-money-from-bsf-dy-commandant/articleshow/89049186.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Owner booked for flouting bldg norms||Gurgaon: The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has got an FIR registered against the owner of a plot in Palam Vihar for allegedly violating building norms. The developer, the architect and the buyers of illegal flats constructed on the plot have also been booked for the same offence.As per the Haryana Building Code, a maximum of four floors with one dwelling unit each on one floor can be constructed. In this case, officials said, the developer constructed multiple dwelling units on each floor and sold it to different people. In July last year, the DTCP revoked the occupation certificate (OC) granted to the building. In fact, the matter came to light last year when the DTCP received a complaint about the construction of a residential tower on a 1,000 sq yard residential plot (number 1340) in Block B of Palam Vihar.“During site inspection, it was found that the owner has sub-divided each floor into multiple dwelling units (more than one dwelling unit on each floor), which is in gross violation of the norms,” said DTP (enforcement) RS Batth. “Earlier we withdrew the OC of the building, and now a case has been registered against the plot owner, the architect and the flat owners at the Palam Vihar police station.”The developer is also accused of making additional construction after getting the OC from the department, officials said.The building plan of the residential plot was approved, allowing only stilt and four floors with a maximum of four units — one unit on each floor. As per the Haryana Building Code, 2017, “dwelling unit” means a building or a part thereof which is used or is intended to be used by a person or family for habitation consisting of kitchen, toilet and rooms.In this case, officials said, the owner and the developer of the building constructed floors with multiple dwelling units on each floor and there was some illegal construction too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/owner-booked-for-flouting-bldg-norms/articleshow/89049187.cms||Bagish Jha

This exercise aims to identify constraints and gaps in management of Covid-19 patient care in all government hospitals in the state. The drill will last for at least 24 hours and check readiness for bed availability, oxygen, staff, medicine and other consumables.This drill aims to simulate a real time situation of high influx of Covid patients in coming days. At present, Haryana has around 2,068 patients in hospitals across the state for Covid treatment and out of these 165 are in Gurgaon. “Yes, we are preparing to carry out a drill on Sunday so that normal functioning of weekdays doesn’t get disturbed. The drill will be at Civil hospital in Sector-10,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. As per the plan, all pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants will be run for 24 hours during the drill to supply oxygen. The drill will also check switching of patients from O2 supply to oxygen concentrator oxygen and shifting of patients from one hospital to other in case all measures fail related to oxygen. It is important to note that Gurgaon needed around 60 tonnes of oxygen daily during the second Covid wave. At the height of the pandemic in May, all major hospitals in the city depended on Gujarat and Rajasthan for liquid oxygen, which was supplied in tankers and even trains. Functioning of ventilators will be monitored and pulse oxymeters will be checked.

---||Gurgaon||More complaints filed but H-Rera’s disposal rate fell sharply last year||GURUGRAM: The Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera), which came into existence in 2017, says it has attended to 70% of all the complaints filed with it – 14,801 out of 19,136. Most of these complaints were, palpably, from homebuyers in Gurugram, which is Haryana’s largest real estate market. However, official data shows its complaint disposal rate has been going down year on year. In 2021, for instance, H-Rera could only adjudicate on or address 29% of the complaints it received. According to sources, the total number of complaints filed online in 2021 were 5,733, which was an 18% increase from the previous year. But only 1,669 could be disposed of by the regulator. In 2020, the number of complaints filed with it were 4,830. The disposal rate was a much healthier 79% (3,832 complaints were settled). Most complaints were received by the regulator in 2019 – 6,344. H-Rera also recorded its highest disposal rate this year, resolving 83% or 5,279 complaints. Asked why fewer complaints were being attended to, H-Rera chairman KK Khandelwal said, “There was a ban on proceedings related to refund cases for over a year. Besides, there was the pandemic due to which the working of the authority was badly hit. One of the members has retired as well.” He said the number of complaints being filed with the regulator has increased due to awareness among homebuyers and their trust in H-Rera for a fair resolution of their grievances. “With our new initiative of the digital court, we are hopeful of speeding up the disposal of complaints,” Khandelwal said. The H-Rera chairman said there were several new initiatives being undertaken by the regulator to ensure quick redress of problems that homebuyers and developers bring before it. “The number of projects registered with the authority has gone up. 93 new projects were registered in 2021, whereas the number was 48 in the previous year. So has the number of registered property agents for transparent and hassle-free deals for prospective homebuyers,” he added. Homebuyers’ groups have, however, consistently demanded stricter measures by the regulator against developers who violate licence conditions, and not just time-bound redress of complaints. A lawyer who represents homebuyers said according to norms, the regulator should decide on a complaint within 60 days, but it has often been taking four to six months, sometimes even longer, to dispose of complaints.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/more-plaints-filed-but-h-reras-disposal-rate-fell-sharply-last-yr/articleshow/89049195.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

The letter, signed by restaurateur and NRAI’s Noida chapter head Varun Khera, states the industry, which is one of the largest employers, is one of the worst affected and needs immediate help. The NRAI has sought waiver of excise fee for the period when operations were hit because of curfews and lockdowns since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. It has suggested that restaurants should be allowed to pay the rest of the quarterly or half yearly, besides a relaxation in cutoff for the deposit from January 31 to March. The letter states the restaurant industry has paid full excise fee from the beginning of the pandemic but hasn’t been able to run the businesses in accordance with licence conditions, especially during the second wave last year. It adds that extended night curfews were removed in October but reinstated in December. The industry, NRAI contends, has not yet recovered from the negative impact of the second wave and restrictions for the third wave had increased financial problems. The restaurateurs underlined that the adjoining states of Delhi and Haryana had offered relief through waiver of fees for the period of restrictions, arguing the industry needed immediate intervention to survive and work towards a revival.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/restaurateurs-seek-excise-fee-waiver-for-all-covid-curbs-since-march-2020/articleshow/89049199.cms||Amin Ali

---||Noida||Women in poll fray: More as Independents than in a party||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: What binds a teacher, a doctor, a Delhi university professor and a social activist together? It’s the assembly elections. In a few days from now, they will be contesting against each other from various seats of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad. In the two NCR districts of Noida and Ghaziabad, there are 16 woman candidates in total so far. The maximum for any political party, three, have been fielded by Congress, which is relying on its “ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon” campaign. While Pankhuri Pathak has been fielded from Noida, Sangeeta Tyagi, the wife of deceased party spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi, is the Congress candidate from Sahibabad. Neeraj Kumari has been given the party ticket from Modinagar. Originally from a family of Congress loyalists, Sangeeta has been teaching science at a school for over two decades. After the death of her husband, she has been involved in public service through the Rajiv Tyagi Foundation. Her name was announced for the Sahibabad seat on Thursday, along with that of Neeraj Kumari, who has been associated with Congress for over 20 years. Sangeeta said she agreed to contest the elections after getting a call from party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The name of Pankhuri, a media panelist in the party, was announced for Noida in the first list itself. She has not only been busy with door-to-door campaigns, but also holding video meetings with homebuyers in Noida. While AAP has fielded two woman candidates from Jewar and Sahibabad, BJP and BSP have given tickets to one woman candidate each. SP has not announced any women for the seats. There are five woman Independent candidates, and four from smaller parties. In Modinagar, BJP has retained its sitting MLA, Manju Siwach. A doctor by profession, Siwach had earlier pitched for a new government educational institution in the area. While a degree college is under construction in her constituency, her focus would be on bringing a new inter college if she is elected again, she said. AAP, on the other hand, has given the ticket to Chhavi Yadav, PhD scholar and state vice-president of the party, from Sahibabad. The party’s face in Jewar is Poonam, a graduate from DU and homemaker. She would be contesting the elections for the first time. “Being associated with social service for long, I wanted to do something for the people of my area. It is because of this I joined the Anna Hazare movement and later, the AAP,” Poonam told TOI. BSP, too, has fielded a woman candidate from Modinagar. Dr Poonam Garg, who runs a nursing home, has been associated with the party since 2004. She said she would contest the polls on the issues of women’s safety, unemployment, and lack of infrastructure. Among the five woman Independent candidates, two are former BJP functionaries. Sapna Bansal, a Delhi University professor with MBA and PhD degrees, is contesting as an Independent from Sahibabad. She had been associated with ABVP and BJP for a long time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/women-in-poll-fray-more-as-independents-than-in-a-party/articleshow/89049204.cms||Aditya Dev

---||India||Assembly elections: 30 seats to OBCs, 19 to Dalits in BJP’s fourth UP list of 85||LUCKNOW: The fourth list of the Bharatiya Janata Party once again reflected the party’s focus on Dalits and other backward classes (OBCs) as together they accounted for 49 seats out of the 85 for which candidates were announced on Friday evening. The OBCs alone got 30 seats while 19 tickets went to Dalits, mostly from the Kori community. Asim Arun, an IPS officer, who recently took VRS while he was posted as Kanpur Police Commissioner, has been given ticket from Kannauj Sadar reserved constituency. BJP had won 73 out of these 85 seats. Four of them have defected to the Samajwadi Party. Out of the remaining 69 winners of 2017, the party has retained 56, or more than 80%. Upper caste tickets mostly comprised Thakurs (15) and Brahmins (14) who together got 29 seats while three Punjabis and four from Vaishya community also made the cut. Among the OBCs, the maximum 10 tickets have gone to Lodhis, followed by seven to Kurmis, one to Nishad and one to Yadav candidate. Eleven other OBCs include Maurya, Kushwaha and Shakyas. The party has also given tickets to five turncoats, including two from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's home turf Rae Bareli -- Aditi Singh from Rae Bareli Sadar and Rakesh Singh from Harchandpur. Although both switched over from Congress recently, they have been siding with the BJP for quite long. Rakesh's brother Dinesh Singh, in fact, contested against Sonia in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Among others who have come from other parties are BSP’s Brahmin face and former cabinet Minister Ramveer Upadhayay, Nitin Agrawal, former minister and MP Naresh Agarwal's son, who switched loyalty from the SP to join the BJP and Hariom Yadav, who is also a sitting MLA from Sirsaganj on the SP ticket. Yadav is a relative of the Samajwadi Party’s patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Upadhyaya has been fielded from Sadabad constituency. He was the sitting MLA from the same constituency but on the BSP ticket. In Kanpur, Cabinet Minister Satish Mahana has managed to retain his candidature from Maharajpur seat while minister of states Nilima Katiyar from Kalyanpur, Mannu Kori and Ranvendra Singh ‘Dhunni’ have also managed to get the nod to contest.

---||Mumbai||No MV Act payout over mishap on riding kin’s bike: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court recently held that dependents of a person who dies in an accident while riding a motorcycle which he borrowed from its owner, there being no involvement of any other vehicle, is not entitled to third party or victim compensation under the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act.  MV Act section 163 sets liability on vehicle owner to pay compensation in case of death or permanent disablement due to accidents arising out of vehicle use, to legal heirs or victims. Justice N J Jamadar on January 4 held that dependents of a man who had borrowed his brother’s motorcycle and died in an accident in 2007 while headed to work, involving no other vehicle, were not entitled to compensation under section 163A of the MV Act, but were entitled to Rs 1 lakh as provided in the insurance contract to the owner-cum-driver, with eight percent interest from application date. In case where a claim is by such a non-third party, in the absence of contract to pay compensation for the death or injury to the insured or to paid driver, the insurer is not statutorily liable to pay compensation, said the high court. New India Assurance Company Ltd had appealed against a 2012 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) judgment that directed it to pay out almost Rs 4 lakh and interest to claimants who were dependents of the brother who rode the motorcycle. Insurer through advocate D R Mahadik submitted that it cannot be saddled with liability as accident occurred due to negligence of insured himself.  Claimants’ advocate Anand Patil submitted that questions of negligence are wholly irrelevant in a section 163 A application and the MACT was thus justified in awarding compensation. The HC said the issue was whether dependents of such non-owner who died in an accident were entitled to compensation under section 163A. It is a special provision under MV Act where claimant is not required to establish that the death or injury was due to any wrongful act or owner’s fault said the HC. “This, however, does not imply that the insurer is liable to pay compensation in cases where, it is neither statutorily liable nor has contractually undertaken the risk,’’ the HC added.  The person who died stepped into the shoes of the owner, said the high court observing he was not employed by the vehicle owner, consequently, he was not a third party for the purposes of the insurance company.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-no-mv-act-payout-over-mishap-on-riding-kins-bike/articleshow/89049226.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Advocate sends BMC notice over garbage dump||MUMBAI: An advocate, who lives in Null Bazar area in South Mumbai, has sent a legal notice to BMC for garbage dumped outside his house and at times not picked up for days together. Mohamed Nawaz Haindaday said that he would be following up on the matter with a writ petition which he is in the process of drafting. In the legal notice that he sent to the municipal commissioner and the assistant engineer of BMC C ward on January 20, Haindaday has asked them to stop the practice of removing filth and garbage from alleys and dumping on the roadside outside his building especially if the filth that is removed cannot be immediately taken away. He said that telephonic complaints and also those made on social media to the solid waste department at Chandanwadi have not been of any help. Complaints are only noted but except for one or two occasions, remedial action is never taken, and the victims are left to suffer. In his notice, the advocate also pointed out that this manner of functioning is seen in almost all the streets in and around the Null Bazar area. He said in contrast, it is observed that in areas beyond the Null Bazar-Bhendi Bazar area, the BMC's efforts at keeping areas clean from filth are apparently better. “You are put to notice that you have consistently violated my fundamental rights and have consistently failed to perform your fundamental and also legal duties under the law which vest me with the right to take appropriate legal action against you and your department,” stated the notice notice. Haindaday said his family has been living in the building since 1880 but this issue has started in the past five years. An official from BMC’s C ward said, “We are even trying to reach out door-to-door to collect waste through BMC or contractual staff. However, in some cases we have observed locals themselves dump garbage on the streets to the extent that the chamber below the spot gets choked.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/advocate-sends-bmc-notice-over-garbage-dump/articleshow/89049227.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze quizzes Anil Deshmukh but makes it a dull affair||MUMBAI: For dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, it was a different kind of “encounter” when he quizzed ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday, but it turned out to be a tame affair in the absence of tough questions.  It was a rare opportunity for Waze to take on Deshmukh, that too before a judicial commission, but he failed to take advantage of the situation. Most of his questions were routine and administrative in nature, and as a police officer, he failed to elicit sensitive information on the role of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh with regard to the allegations made by Singh about a target of Rs 100 crore set by him (Deshmukh). Singh did write a letter to the CM making the allegations in March last year, but before the panel, he stated he does not want to lead evidence or cross-examine witnesses. As per the original plan, Waze’s counsel Yogesh Naidu was expected to cross-examine Deshmukh on Wednesday. When he did not attend, the case was adjourned for Friday. Again his counsel was absent, following which Justice K U Chandiwal made it clear there will be no more adjournment and Waze himself will have to cross-examine the former home minister. Waze then cross-examined him. Chandiwal is probing Singh’s 20 ‘letter bomb’ against Deshmukh. Deshmukh told the panel that after taking charge of the home department, he collected details of departments under him and studied key issues . “It’s a routine practice. After assuming charge, I secured information from officials... I do not recollect as to through whom Sanjeev Palande was appointed private secretary. Then there were 4-5 persons, but I appointed Palande without his interview,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh said when he saw Singh’s letter, he suggested to the CM he set up a commission of inquiry since the allegations were false. “I came to know about the resolution on the committee when it was published. I was not party to the decision, but it was on my suggestion the commission was set up,” he said. When Waze asked him if the Mumbai police commissioner reports to the DGP, Deshmukh said as per the police manual, he should do it. When Waze asked him how he (Waze) was appointed CIU chief, Deshmukh said he was told Waze was under suspension for 14-15 years and after reinstatement, he was appointed to lead the CIU. Generally, if a suspended officer is reinstated, he is posted to a side branch. Waze was appointed on Singh’s oral instructions. As the CIU ought to have been of the rank of police inspector, the then joint commissioner Santosh Rastogi took objection to his appointment. When Waze asked if there was a rule an API cannot lead the CIU, Deshmukh said there must be, which prompted Rastogi to raise objections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/waze-quizzes-deshmukh-but-makes-it-a-dull-affair/articleshow/89049229.cms||---

He has been accused of tarnishing the police image by allegations of corruption in the department. Toke, who is credited with exposing several incidents of bribery in the traffic department and filing a PILin high court after which the traffic police were forced to carry out several reforms, was serving at the main police control room. Reacting to the suspension order, Toke said it is illegal as he has already faced suspension in 2018 and he will challenge it in court. “I’ve done sting operations of corruption and exposed the department. This is nothing but in retaliation to my PILs. I will challenge my suspension in court.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cop-who-exposed-depts-corruption-suspended/articleshow/89049230.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Extension of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s judicial custody not illegal: Court||Mumbai: A special PMLA court held that the extension of judicial custody of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, ordered by the court on December 27, cannot be held to be illegal as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had filed its chargesheet on December 29, within 60 days as prescribed under the criminal procedural law. Default bail is available on non-filing of chargesheet within 60 or 90 days as prescribed by law and taking cognizance after filing of chargesheet is not required when it comes to deciding default bail, said the court in its reasoned order by special judge R N Rokade, uploaded on Friday. Deshmukh’s plea that cognizance of chargesheet not being taken by the designated court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) entitled him to default bail is “too far-fetched” and devoid of merit, said the special judge. The “crucial question’’ that arose before the court was whether an indefeasible right of statutory bail accrued to Deshmukh on January 2, 2022 on the ground that no cognizance was taken by the court. Senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri, with advocate Aniket Nikar for Deshmukh, had said that in order to remand him beyond January 1, 2022, the court ought to have taken cognizance of the chargesheet, which was not done. The ED, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, had submitted that cognisance of chargesheet was of no relevance for the provision of default bail and had cited Supreme Court judgments to bolster its arguments. The court accepted Singh’s submission that right to default (not on merits of the case) bail is extinguished even if the chargesheet is filed in the court registry within the legally mandated deadline. The order of dismissal of his plea said Section 167(2) of Criminal Procedure Code sets an embargo on the pribe agency to file the final report (chargesheet), so that such an agency acts diligently. The Code is silent on the aspect of court taking cognizance within such period, said the court and “delayed taking of cognizance of offence by magistrate would in no way defeat the report or the right of the investigating agency to have the accused under continued detention.” The court said once a chargesheet is filed, accused cannot seek default bail, which is a provision to ensure liberty if police or probe agency is unable to complete its probe and file chargesheet or closure report within the time given under law. “The indefeasible right accrued to the accused is enforceable only prior to the filing of the report and it does not survive or remain enforceable on the report being filed. It is extinguished the moment report is filed because Section 167 of CrPC ceases to apply,” held the special judge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/extension-of-ex-home-mins-judicial-custody-not-illegal/articleshow/89049232.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Govt med seats up 50%, pvt 40% in state in 4 yrs||Mumbai: Seats in state-run medical colleges have gone up by close to 50% in just about four years. The number of MBBS seats available across government colleges in the state is 4,550 in 2022; it was 3,060 in 2018.While two new colleges have been added this year, the total seats have also gone up after the government relaxed infrastructure norms and introduced a quota for the economically-weaker section (EWS).Seats in private colleges in the state, too, have gone up by 40%, from 1,970 in 2018 to 2,720 now. The seat matrix for medical admissions was released by the state’s CET cell on Thursday night.The seats increased for multiple reasons, said Pravin Shingare, former director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). “Two years ago, when the EWS quota was introduced, the central government floated a scheme allowing government colleges to increase their seats by 50 with the current infrastructure. They were given two years to fulfil infrastructure norms. The state got around 970 seats under the scheme. Also, a lot of new government colleges are coming up in districts which did not have a single state-run medical college, including ones at Alibaug and Satara that got permission this year," said Shingare.In 2019, when the central government introduced the 10% EWS quota, total seats across the country went up by 4,470, including a significant number in Maharashtra. Some of the sought-after colleges in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur increased seats by up to 250 from their existing capacity at that time.Parent representative Sudha Shenoy said though the total number of seats has gone up in absolute numbers, reservations also increased. “Earlier open category students had around 50% seats, but now they have less than 40% seats due to the increase in quota. Therefore, the net benefit is not as significant as it seems to be,” said Shenoy. One batch of undergraduate students also suffered due to the introduction of the Maratha quota in the state, she added.Medical seats in Maharashtra remained constant from 2001 to 2015, said Shingare. It was only after 2015 that the capacity increased and new colleges came up in Chandrapur, Gondia, Baramati and now Alibaug and Satara. Permission for two more colleges in Sindhudurg and Pune is awaited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/govt-med-seats-up-50-pvt-40-in-state-in-4-yrs/articleshow/89049234.cms||Yogita Rao

The 200 vehicles on diesel will be replaced with e-vehicles soon,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra on Friday. He added that a few official vehicles in the electric supply division running on diesel will also be replaced with electric variants. A couple of months back, BEST had announced its decision to retrofit the diesel buses with CNG kits, but now it has decided to replace them with electric vehicles. This will help them speed up the process of electrification of the entire fleet. The aim is to have 50% electric buses in the fleet by 2023 and 100% electric bus fleet in Mumbai by 2027, Chandra said. There are over 500 other mini diesel buses which are run by private contractors, and sources said the BEST will request them to switch to clean fuel this year. The electric bus fleet in BEST will be increased six times this year – with orders for 2,100 more electric buses to be placed. This will include 200 double decker e-buses for which the Centre plans to give special subsidy, sources said. Commenting on the cost of electrification of the fleet, Chandra said that the capital cost of e-buses was very high. “However, we will procure new buses only on wet lease under which we pay a nominal lease for each bus for a 10-12 year contract. This will save us a lot of money,” he said. BEST panel chairman Ashish Chemburkar said the fleet in the undertaking will expand with 5,000 more buses on wet lease in coming years. “We will ensure that the buses are environment friendly, provide comfortable AC rides at affordable fares,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/100-of-best-buses-may-run-on-green-energy-by-year-end-gm/articleshow/89049235.cms||Somit Sen

The accused are Jaiprakash Bhusan Yadav (48), Kameshkumar Patel (51) and Mehboob Shaikh (40). Police have booked them under the IPC for negligence, endangering life, cheating, as well as under the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act. The crime branch has recovered a huge quantity of injections for acidity, anti-allergy medicines, antibiotics, NS bottles, cannula, syringes, multivitamins and paracetamol, among others. “The accused claim to have degrees in BMS, Naturopathy and Unani and yet they were administering allopathy, were seen giving injections as well saline and allopathic medicines to patients,” said Neelotpal, DCP(crime). The Shivaji Nagar police, along with health officers, are also carrying out random checks on shady clinics operating in slum pockets of Baiganwadi, Shivaji Nagar, Mandala in Mankhurd and Vashi Naka. It was the Shivaji Nagar police who had booked the four staffers for the death of the 2-year-old. Cops said they have launched a manhunt for the four accused. The 2-year-old was admitted in a nursing home in Baiganwadi, where a sweeper administered him with an injection of Azithromycin that was meant for another patient — a 16-year-old.

This comes on the heels of the state government’s recent announcement of a full property tax waiver for homes less than 500-sq-ft area in Mumbai. A proposal to waive the property tax was tabled before BMC’s law committee on Friday. Officials said that the state government had in 2020 issued a notification asking all urban local bodies to waive property tax for former defence personnel. “BMC’s scheme will cover former defence personnel, widows of martyrs and kin of unmarried martyrs. Those eligible must submit relevant certificates from the district Sainik Welfare Office or domicile certificates to prove that they have been living in the state for the last 15 years. Only one property would be eligible for the waiver. Officials said a similar proposal was moved last year to waive only general tax component. “It was rolled back as high court ordered BMC to waive all components,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/property-tax-of-ex-defence-personnel-kin-to-be-waived/articleshow/89049238.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Silver lining: In ’21, city crime detection rate surged to 82%||Mumbai: Despite the pandemic-related curbs, Mumbai recorded a 21% rise in registration of crime cases in 2021 as compared to 2020. According to the Mumbai Crime Report 2021 released on Friday, 64,656 FIRs were registered in 2021 across the 93 police stations compared to 51,068 FIRs in 2020, when the city faced strict lockdown. A police officer said every year, around 20,000 FIRs are registered under the Indian Penal Code, but in 2020 and 2021, the number climbed up to 34,878 and 45,908, respectively. The only silver lining is that the detection rate was around 82%—police cracked 53,193 of the 64,656 cases registered in 2021—compared to 79% in the previous year. In 2021, the detection rate for dacoity was 100% (all 16 cases solved), murder 99% (160 of 162 cases solved), causing hurt 93% (3,971 of 4,262 cases solved), motor vehicle thefts 49% (1,599 of 3,282 cases solved), and thefts 41% (1,870 of 4,534 cases solved). Since the pandemic started, police have filed 57,687 cases for violations for Covid restrictions. They account for 49.8% of the total 1,15,724 FIRs in the city in 2020 and 2021. Between April and December last year, 29,837 such cases were filed. For the entire 2021, it’s estimated that Covid violations could have accounted for around 60% of the total cases.Former state DGP Praveen Dixit said leadership plays a crucial role in keeping a check on the situation. “Negative developments in the force [the involvement of a few senior officers in wrongdoings] has certainly resulted in demoralizing the force at various levels. Strict monitoring and tasking of the juniors are necessary to instill a sense of pride as well as dedication to duty,” he said.Dixit added that it appears that the police were “over-occupied” in responding to the pandemic and did not pay enough attention to curbing crimes. Also, he said, there has not been an increase in crimes against women, but a rise in registration of complaints.Stressing that mobile phones have become the facilitator of cybercrimes and negligent convictions have made criminals arrogant, cyber lawyer Prashant Mali said: “Today, the ratio of police complaints to FIR registrations is not even 5% of the actual numbers. Registration of cyber offences should increase with more knowledge induction courses for the cops to deal with such complex offences.” Lawyer Aditya Pratap said prevention now requires a mu-lti-pronged effort and is likely to be more complex than before. “But as far as prosecution and conviction are concerned, the performance of courts seems to be improving,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/silver-lining-in-21-city-crime-detection-rate-surged-to-82/articleshow/89049240.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||A parallel pandemic? Uptick in crimes against women and children in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Crimes against women and children are on the rise in the city. According to the Mumbai Crime Report 2021, 3,879 cases of crimes against women were registered in 2021 compared to 3,317 in 2020. Similarly, 2,159 cases of crimes against children were registered in 2021 against 1,710 in the previous year. The report showed that police detected 79% (4,335) of the 5,496 cases of crimes against women and children in 2021—a 3% rise against 76% in the previous year. RTI activist Arati Chauhan said the lockdown has seen a rise in crimes against women and children, especially assault cases. “The major reason for the rise in kidnap cases is prompt action in registering such cases; earlier they would be recorded as missing person’s complaints. Many of the kidnap cases are minors running away from home either due to a love affair, study pressure or some other reason,” she said. Lawyer Aditya Pratap said: “I would attribute the increase to a number of probable causative factors like a major growth in pornography and unscrupulous persons using dating apps to lure women and children and then commit crimes upon them,” he said. “It is shocking to note that even today, the evil of dowry continues to prevail in Indian marriages...Also, the fact that female foeticide continues even today shows how hostile society is towards women.” —V Narayan||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/a-parallel-pandemic-uptick-in-crimes-against-women-and-children-in-mumbai/articleshow/89049241.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Rise in cyber offences in Mumbai, but detection continues to remain low: Report||MUMBAI: With increase in online activities amid the pandemic, there has been a rise in cybercrimes in the city with 2,883 cases registered in 2021 compared to 2,435 in 2020. Cheating (1,154) and credit/debit card and online frauds (1,075) comprised a major chunk of the cyber offences in 2021, according to the Mumbai police cybercrime report released on Friday. Though cybercrimes are increasing every year, detection remains poor. The report showed out that only 455 cyber offences were solved in 2021 and 207 in 2020. Mumbai police have introduced a cybercrime chart explaining the frauds registered under cheating. “There 50 custom/gift frauds, 167 purchase frauds, 119 job frauds, 22 insurance/ provident fund frauds, 5 admission frauds, 37 fake websites, 27 investment frauds, 16 matrimonial frauds, 7 cryptocurrency frauds, 42 loan frauds and 662 miscellaneous cheating cases. There were 17 cases of communal posts, 54 of sextortion, 20 of data theft, and 32 of hacking,” the report stated. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said lack of action against cyber fraudsters is encouraging them to get bolder and target politicians and businessmen. Former state DGP D Sivanandhan said police are falling short of skills and ability in both software and hardware. “We need to have an international-level agency to help detection teams. The pandemic has increased unemployment that resulted in an increase in online frauds, especially from overseas...Police have to go to MEA and use the MLAT channel to connect with foreign agencies, which would take years,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/report-rise-in-cyber-offences-but-detection-continues-to-remain-low/articleshow/89049242.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Crook held for kissing, robbing lawyer at ATM||MUMBAI: Andheri police has arrested a man from Nalasopara for allegedly molesting and robbing a lawyer at an ATM booth on Wednesday. The accused, Avinash Kasar (29), was nabbed within 24 hours of the incident, after the police went through CCTV footage at several locations at all railway stations between Andheri and Nalasopara. The incident occurred on January 19, around 8.40pm, at an ATM outside Andheri railway station, where the victim was withdrawing money. “Kasar entered the ATM premises, kissed the lawyer’s back and, then, made off with her cash,” said an officer from Andheri police station. The lawyer rushed to the police station and registered a case. “We scanned all the CCTV camera footage and found out that the accused had boarded a train to Goregaon on the harbour line, followed by a Borivli-bound local. The accused finally boarded a Virar-bound train from Borivli railway station and alighted at Nalasopara. To learn his whereabouts, we sought the bank’s help with details of account holders who had withdrawn money before and after the incident, and got the details of Kasar, who hails from Nalasopara,” said the police. After scanning the CCTV camera footage, the police further zeroed in on Kasar by checking his call detail records (CDR) and cell phone location, which tied him to the scene. The officer said Kasar’s profile met with the victim’s description and the CCTV footage, and he was arrested on that basis on Thursday night. He has been booked under the Indian Penal Code for robbery, outraging modesty and stalking.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/crook-held-for-kissing-robbing-lawyer-at-atm/articleshow/89049243.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid tally is at 250-day high as Mumbai graph dips||MUMBAI: The contrast in the Covid graphs of Mumbai and Maharashtra got sharper on Friday, with the state registering its highest daily detections in over 250 days and the city reporting its lowest cases so far this year. A total of 48,270 cases were reported in the state, the highest so far in the third wave and also highest since May 8, when the state which was amid the second wave then had added 48,401 cases. The state continued to report high fatalities and added 52 deaths to its tally on Friday. Mumbai’s cases dropped by 12%, from 5,708 on Thursday to 5,008 on Friday. While the daily toll remained steady at 12 in Mumbai, the state toll climbed to 52. According to the state data, Mumbai is no longer driving the Covid-19 graph of the state. The Mumbai circle, which includes neighbouring districts like Thane and Palghar added 10,493 cases, but the Pune circle topped the charts by adding 18,785 cases. The Pune Municipal Corporation added over 8,000 cases on Friday. The Mumbai circle added 27 deaths, the highest in the state. State officials said the rise in cases in smaller cities only indicates it’s a while before the state reports a peak in cases. “Although it is a relief that cases in Mumbai have dipped, districts like Pune and Nashik are reporting a surge. Testing in most of these districts has been ramped up,” said an official. There are at least 10 districts which have a weekly positivity rate higher than the state’s average of 24%. Cases are now surging in these 10 districts. The BMC dashboard showed that most of the city’s Covid parameters have dropped: the number of critical patients dropped marginally to 584, while the number of sealed buildings dropped by more than half to 29 in the last couple of days. The bed occupancy dropped from 15% to 12.1% in the same period. The daily test positivity rate in Mumbai continued at 10% for the last three days, with 50,032 tests done on Thursday. “The RT-PCR test positivity rate is closer to 15% as against 30% a few weeks back,” said a BMC official. The number of people in home quarantine that had increased beyond 9 lakh dropped for the first time (8.9 lakh) in three weeks. The doubling rate in the same time has almost tripled to 93 days while the infection’s weekly growth rate has dropped by a third to 0.72%. Apart from wards A (Colaba) and M West (Chembur), which have a growth rate of 1.03%, the remaining 22 wards in the city have a growth rate of less than 1 per cent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maha-tally-is-at-250-day-high-as-city-graph-dips/articleshow/89049244.cms||---

Acting on such complaints, the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) has passed an order linking thalassemia day care centres to two to three private blood banks in the vicinity. The model is being tried as a pilot project in the city. As per the plan, St George Hospital’s thalassemia unit has been linked to Jaslok and Bombay Hospital’s blood banks, which would have to provide 25 and 20 bags respectively every month. JJ Hospital’s thalassemia day care centre has been linked with the blood banks of SRCC, Prince Aly Khan and Breach Candy hospitals. All have to provide 10 bags each. Effectively, 17 thalassemia centres, mostly in public medical colleges, have been linked with 47 blood banks to ensure that patients don’t have to run around for blood. “Some blood centres issue more than 40% of their blood collection to thalassemia patients, while others are issuing a meagre amount or none at all... Some banks even demand replacement blood,” said Dr Arun Thorat, assistant director of SBTC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/thalassemia-blood-search-to-get-easier-for-patients/articleshow/89049245.cms||---

The procedure — the fifth hand transplant in the city and the first of this year — is anticipated to take 10 to 16 hours. Friday’s beneficiary is a 35-year-old mother of three from Buldhana who lost her arms in an electrocution accident in July 2018. “She was drying clothes in the verandah when she stepped on a live wire,” said an official of Global Hospital, Parel, where the transplant is taking place. She will get hands from a 67-year-old male donor who was declared brain dead in a Surat hospital after suffering an intracranial bleed, said sources. The donor hands were flown in from Surat on Friday evening, said Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre chief Dr S Mathur. None of the five hand transplants conducted so far were local donations; they were sent from hospitals in Ahmedabad and Surat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mother-of-3-to-get-new-arms-in-citys-fifth-hand-transplant/articleshow/89049246.cms||---
---||Mumbai||After schools, higher edu officials want physical classes for colleges||Mumbai: After the state government approved reopening of physical classes for schools from Monday, the higher and technical education department has moved a proposal seeking resumption of physical classes in colleges and universities. Meanwhile, despite the nod from the state to resume offline classes, a number of schools may continue teaching online for a while before switching to the hybrid mode due to poor response from parents. The file to start classes in colleges and universities has been sent to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for his approval, said Uday Samant, minister heading the department. Officials said that the department has given a few dates in the proposal and once the CM approves it, they will give a few days to colleges for preparations. “It is likely that classes will resume by next week,” said an official. Classes 10 and 12 have continued to operate in the hybrid mode since October, and more students moved online this month due to Omicron fears. Though the drop in cases has now prompted the state to restart physical schools, principals said that parents want to continue online for a few more days. “We will be getting offline from February 1 as parents don’t want to take any risk yet,” said the principal of a school in Bandra.Some schools are conducting online exams and will return to physical classrooms only later. “Our class 10 preliminary exams are being held online till January 27. We will then obtain parental consent and hopefully start offline,” said Vishnu Saravle, principal, D S High School, Sion.Meghana Bhandari, parent of a class 8 student from Charni Road, said, “Covid cases may be falling but the fear of an infection still looms. Schools should wait till the month end before restarting offline.” Meanwhile, in Palghar district, including Vasai-Virar, only classes 8 to 12 will reopen for physical schooling from January 27, the collector said on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-schools-higher-edu-officials-want-physical-classes-for-colleges/articleshow/89049247.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai among bottom 3 distrcits in inoculating 15-17 year olds||MUMBAI: The city is placed among the bottom three districts in Maharashtra when it comes to giving the Covid vaccine to 15-17 year olds. Mumbai has barely covered 27.6% of the eligible teens, just above Solapur (26.6%) and Chandrapur (24.4%), says the latest data. The state has covered 46% of the estimated teenage population of 60.6 lakh with the first dose since the start of the drive on January 3. Only 14 districts are below the state average, including Mumbai. This is a big departure from the performance during adult vaccination, when Mumbai kept ahead by leaps and bounds in coverage as well as doses administered. Currently, Bhandara and Sangli are leading with 73% and 67% coverage. In absolute number of doses administered too, several districts are ahead of Mumbai. While the city has given 1.9 lakh doses, neighbouring Thane has delivered 2.4 lakh doses and Pune 2.7 lakh doses. A senior civic official said that unlike other districts, Mumbai’s drive started at nine vaccination centres only. “We have now extended it to all community centres and asked local leaders to motivate children,” the official said. While Thane successfully held drives within educational institutions, Bhandara used a novel approach. The district health officer told TOI that they tapped the centres that carry out routine immunisation for children up to 5 years. “They are located within the community and are accessible to most. These centres usually work on Tuesdays and Fridays, so we also carry out Covid vaccination in these places,” he said. There are at least 23-25 vaccination centres under each primary health centre. In addition, the district health officials also tied up with the education department to mobilise children and bring them to the nearest primary health centres. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said they didn’t want to wait for children to come to vaccination centres, so they took the drive to their schools and colleges. “In rural areas, it has worked well. Children are more comfortable getting vaccinated in their own schools,” he said, adding that they plan to wrap up the drive for teens by the end of January. Eligible 15-17 year olds number 6.1 lakh in Mumbai, and it appears the drive will spill over to February. Dr Bakul Parekh, member of the paediatric task force, said people are confused with mixed messaging about teenage vaccination. “Vaccination gives long lasting immunity and adolescents who are obese, have diabetes or smoke should definitely take the vaccine,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-among-bottom-3-dists-in-inoculating-15-17-yr-olds/articleshow/89049248.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Kapadia said the government and civic body were making all efforts to ensure the safety of citizens. But there is lack of clarity on the booster dose. “We want to know what the booster policy is with transparency, and not just the measures for senior citizens or people of certain categories. How many doses, where and at what level?’’Aditya Thakkar, replying for the Centre, said guidelines have been framed for the precaution doses.

Profit grew to Rs 20,539 crore in Q3FY22. It made a gain of Rs 2,872 crore from the US shale asset divestment. Revenue amounted to over Rs 1.9 lakh crore, up 54%, as business activities improved on the back of easing Covid-related movement curbs and strong festive demand. Operating profit edged up 30% to Rs 33,886 crore in the October through December months, aided by better price realisations. Operating profit of digital (Jio) climbed 14% to Rs 10,230 crore due to higher data usage by subscribers and strong earnings from new services. However, average revenue per user (Arpu) — a key metric that influences income — remained flat at Rs 151 in Q3FY22. Arpu is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio has 421 million customers (as of December end, up from 411 million in Q3FY21) and saw data and voice traffic growth of 48% and 18% on its network. It increased its prepaid plans by 20% on December 1, 2021. Operating profit of the retail business rose 24% to Rs 3,835 crore as the business environment returned to normalcy after local authorities relaxed pandemic-related curbs. Grocery maintained growth momentum, while consumer electronics, apparel and footwear doubled their business on the back of strong festive sales. The retail segment does not include RIL’s petro-retailing venture. This business is housed in a joint venture with UK’s BP. The consumer business (Jio and retail) accounted for 42% of the company’s operating profit in Q3FY22. Operating profit of O2C zoomed 39% to Rs 13,530 crore due to higher volumes and increase in crude oil prices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-posts-38-higher-profit-in-oct-dec-qtr-at-20539cr/articleshow/89049251.cms||---
---||Business||3rd wave: Dolo mkt share nears 60%||Mumbai: They’re just memes, but promise to unseat any traditional ad campaign and outwit any influencer too. Dolo 650 is having its moment under the sun on social media with funny and frivolous memes capturing the desperation of the Covid-infected to keep fever and body ache away. Over the last few weeks, with the Omicron wave gaining a stronghold, social media platforms have been abuzz with wild memes and posts on the pain-relief pill Dolo 650. As a result, the market share of the pill — sold by Bangalore-based Micro Labs — sky-rocketed in December (see graphic), and is showing a spike this month too. Dolo 650 has 650mg of paracetamol, which is an antipyretic (for fever) and analgesic (for pain relief). Estimates suggest over 80 memes are in circulation, giving rise to concerns about the indirect promotion of prescription medicines, their irrational use and inappropriate self-medication. More importantly, experts point out that the promotion and advertisement of medicines is in violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, and should not be allowed to go unchecked. Since paracetamol is a scheduled drug, it cannot be promoted under the Act for fever. “Many patients are self-medicating without even a proper diagnosis — this may even lead to serious side-effects,” Indian Medical Association’s general secretary Dr Jayesh Lele told TOI. “Dolo has become a four-letter word brand of great utility and ubiquity for many. This, in turn, has led to a Dolo 650-in-every-house kind of movement. For an OTC (over-the-counter), this is a super-brand status,” brand strategy expert Harish Bijoor said. Micro Labs was taken by surprise. Executive VP (marketing) Jayaraj Govindaraju said, “We have been promoting it as per law, and there are statutory warnings on the pack.” While paracetamol is known to be a well-tolerated drug when taken within prescribed dose range, overdosage may be associated with severe liver and pancreatic injury, they add.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/3rd-wave-dolo-mkt-share-nears-60/articleshow/89049252.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

This arose from her teaching market and business strategy at an educational institution and her research on India’s consumer economy at a non-profit research centre. Stating that she was associated with both these institutions, Bijapurkar said that these activities may require her to engage with other financial service companies or the investor community.

This will help the corporation improve its cleanliness ranking in the Swachh Survekshan initiative. The NMMC waste management department sources said that some of the slum pockets will have more than one waste compost unit, based on the local population.Deputy municipal commissioner (solid waste management), Dr Babasaheb Rajale, said, “We have already implemented this project successfully at four different locations while engaging local women, NGOs and ragpickers. We will cover the remaining slum pockets soon. A few locations have been earmarked for setting up the composting units, which will be taken up in phases.”Meanwhile, the civic body has roped in NGOs to target slum pockets for micro-level composting of domestic garbage. The solid waste department of NMMC plans to reduce the load on garbage collection by promoting slum-level composting, where volume of waste segregation is low as compared to developed nodal areas. The NMMC aims at treating around 100 tonnes of waste through a decentralised composting system.So far, the civic body has achieved a target of 85% waste segregation, which placed the city at third position in the national clean city evaluation, and it topped the list in waste management system two years ago. “We will expand the scheme to nodal areas through sector-wise composting, starting from the developed node of Vashi,” said Rajale.At present, over 750 tonnes of waste is generated from the city on a daily basis. It includes 350 tonnes of wet waste and 400 tonnes of dry waste, of which 120 tonnes is dumped at Turbhe landfill and the rest is processed to produce granules after segregation. Out of 350 tonnes of wet waste, around 35 tonnes of organic manure is generated at the Turbhe plant, which is used at civic gardens and supplied to KRIBHCO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/all-41-slum-areas-to-get-waste-composting-units/articleshow/89049254.cms||---

Meanwhile, the civic body has confiscated open plots and properties of 119 big tax defaulters at various nodes for their failure to pay the arrears with penalty and even respond to earlier notices.The notice says that the property holders have been barred from selling, donating, mortgaging or changing ownership. They have been given a final chance to pay the dues within the stipulated notice period to release their seized properties or bear with the auction. NMMC had announced an amnesty scheme until December 31, 2021, under which many defaulters paid their dues but some major defaulters did not pay heed to the offer, which invited such action now. The properties that were seized by the NMMC recently will be auctioned soon, including 19 properties in Belapur, 34 in Vashi, 17 in Koparkhairane, 10 in Turbhe, seven in Airoli, 20 in Nerul and 12 in Ghansoli.“As many as 119 major property tax defaulters did not respond to our earlier notices and did not pay the tax arrears, which prompted us to seize properties that will be auctioned soon. Other such defaulters will face similar action,” said an NMMC officer. Earlier, the property tax department had sent notices to 128 major defaulters to pay their dues. The big defaulters owe the civic body a sum of Rs 188 crore despite an amnesty scheme on offer. Out of which only nine property holders paid heed and remaining 119 were issued auction orders of their properties after seizure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/tax-defaulters-get-auction-notice-of-seized-properties/articleshow/89049257.cms||---

The total contract value (TCV) in the quarter was $335 million, with four large deals signed, including a $92 million healthcare deal. The year to date TCV stands at over $1 billion. This has grown at a CAGR of 43% in the last two years. Europe saw strong growth momentum. Banking and financial services has grown very well for the last six quarters. “Banks are not only thinking about how they will modernise their applications, but how they can create corporate startups within their large platforms and effectively grow them with a neobanking mindset. Many large clients are experimenting with blockchain-based solutions, buying neobanking licenses and building a platform around it, and they are doing in the retail side and the payment side. One of the large deals is around transformation of the payments platform using a neobank platform,” said Nitin Rakesh, CEO of Mphasis. Mphasis added 2,600 employees in the December quarter. Half of those were freshers. It plans to hire 5,500 freshers in the FY22 financial year. “The internal talent deployment is 2.5 to 3 times what it used to be three years ago.

---||Business||‘Startup ecosystem has reached self-sustaining phase’||BENGALURU: IPOs and unicorns have created a flywheel effect in the Indian tech startup ecosystem. That’s the message from a report by Nasscom and consultancy firm Zinnov that was released on Friday. Pari Natarajan, CEO of Zinnov, said the tech startup IPOs (there was a record 11 last year) and the unicorns (a record 42 were created last year) have generated enormous funds, which these companies are in turn investing in other tech startups and using to buy products that these new-age digital ventures are creating. The IPOs and venture funding are also, he said, creating wealth in the hands of individuals who are using that to provide seed funding to newer tech ventures. Darwinbox, he said, is one example of a startup that’s benefited from this – its HR management software is used by a number of Indian unicorns. “This will allow them to improve their product and sell to larger Indian and global enterprises. The same thing is happening to many deep tech startups,” he said. Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh said not only are unicorns investing in startups, they are also mentoring them. The report `Indian Tech Start-up Ecosystem: Year of The Titans,’ showed that startups raised $24.1 billion last year, a two-fold increase over pre-Covid levels. In comparison to 2020, there was a three times increase in the number of high-value deals (deals over $100 million), demonstrating investor confidence. The ecosystem saw a two-fold gain in cumulative valuation from 2020 to 2021, with an estimate of $320 - $330 billion. The ecosystem is estimated to be the largest after those in the US and China. The growth in investment into it in 2021 was perhaps the highest in the world. There was a big jump in angel investors last year to 2,400. “India was lagging behind in angel investors. That has changed,” Ghosh said. She said Indian corporates are also working closely with startups, “investing in them significantly.” Last year, 260 corporates were active in engaging with the startup community; up from 170 in 2020. Some 175 corporates invested in startups in 2021, with 52% being MNCs. Ghosh said she was also encouraged by the growing diversity and inclusion – 30% of startups are now outside established hubs like Bengaluru and NCR; and 10-15% of startups have at least one woman founder. Natarajan said the time that startups are taking to turn a unicorn has shrunk substantially. Mensa Brands, for instance, turned a unicorn in six months. He said that’s partly because investors are looking at the best options to invest in a short period of time. But also because there are now experienced entrepreneurs – those who exited successful ventures – who know how to build for the global market. Investors, he said, have little hesitation to put big money behind such ventures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/startup-ecosystem-has-reached-self-sustaining-phase/articleshow/89049270.cms||Sujit John

Its annualised revenue run rate stands at $796 million. The order booking for the December quarter was at $334.3 million in total contract value (TCV). “BFSI and healthcare are the two big sectors in any economy and we are well-entrenched in those sectors. VCs are increasingly investing in tech startups and it bodes well for us. That is driving growth and translating into order booking and then into revenue,” said Sandeep Kalra, CEO of Persistent Systems. The company's attrition rate rose to 26.9% in the December quarter, from 23.6% in the previous quarter. It added a little over 1,000 people, taking the headcount to 16,989.CFO Sunil Sapre said freshers have an edge in some areas as they are agile and digitally-savvier. Entry-level salaries, he said, haven’t moved up much, but those with 2-3 years of experience are getting good jumps. “Today, their salaries have gone up 75%-100%, and that’s the kind of market we are grappling with,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/persistent-q3-revenue-up-36-yoy/articleshow/89049271.cms||---

Net profit rose 11% to Rs 187 crore.Following the results, the company’s share price went up by more than 3% on Friday, a day when the broader sensex fell. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson of Biocon, said Biocon Biologics, the biosimilar subsidiary, achieved a key milestone during the quarter with the commercialisation of the world's first interchangeable biosimilar, Insulin Glargine, in the US. A biosimilar is a biologic medical product that is almost an identical copy of an original product that is manufactured by a different company. Biosimilars are legal when the original product's patent expires. Interchangeable biosimilars are those that pharmacists can substitute interchangeably with the original drugs. The US FDA had approved interchangeability for the Biocon product in July last year. It’s a big opportunity for Biocon to make deeper inroads into the US market for insulin for treatment of diabetes.“Approvals for several of our generics and biosimilars in global markets, and renewal of key long-term research service agreements at Syngene, position us for a strong close to this fiscal,” Mazumdar-Shaw added. Syngene is Biocon’s contract research arm. During the quarter, biosimilars grew by 28% to Rs 981 crore, research services was up 10% at Rs 641 crore, and generics delivered a 7% growth at Rs 607 crore. Arun Chandavarkar, MD of Biocon Biologics, said that encouraged by the demand for the company’s insulins globally and considering new opportunities, “we have initiated investments for the expansion of our insulin manufacturing facility in Malaysia.” Biocon Biologics has appointed three industry veterans to strengthen different functions – Matthew Erick as chief commercial officer for advanced markets (he was previously president of MedVet and Mylan), Mandar Ghatnekar as chief digital transformation officer (he was previously with Accenture and Infosys), and Ajit Pal Singh has joined as Head of Branded Formulations, India business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/biocon-revenue-up-18-strengthens-mgmt-team/articleshow/89049272.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Constables held for peddling extorted Rs 5,000 from auto driver in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The two constables who were deputed for the chief minister’s security and arrested on charges of drug peddling have now been booked in an extortion incident that allegedly happened nearly three months ago. The cops are head constable Shivakumar and constable Santosh Nowkar. A complaint has been filed against them by an auto driver, Iliyas. He has accused the two of extorting Rs 5,000 from him on October 25, 2021 on charges of consuming ganja. Koramangala police registered an extortion case on Wednesday, a day after police commissioner Kamal Pant issued notice to Srinath Mahadev Joshi, deputy commissioner of police (southeast), seeking an explanation on the constables’ deployment for the CM’s security. According to sources, there were allegations against Shivakumar and Nowkar related to their dubious connections with drug peddlers. But there was no action against them and they were instead appointed for the CM’s security. Iliyas, 34, a resident of Adugodi, stated in his complaint that he and his friend Syed Ali were consuming ganja near BDA complex around 11pm on October 25, 2021. Ali noticed that Shivakumar and Nowkar were approaching them and managed to escape. The two cops caught Iliyas and found a small quantity of ganja, enough to fill around three cigarettes. “The duo threatened to book a criminal case against me and demanded Rs 1 lakh to let me off the hook. I convinced them that I did not have that much money and gave them Rs 5,000. They also said they would send me to jail and teach me a lesson if I told anyone about the extortion. I learned through media reports that the two cops were arrested by RT Nagar police on charges of drug peddling on Tuesday. Hence, I decided to file a complaint,” Iliyas stated. Police have registered a case of extortion under IPC section 384 against the two. Shivakumar and Nowkar, who were on bandobust duty at the chief minister’s residence in RT Nagar, were arrested along with two suspected drug peddlers — Akhil Raj and Amjad Khan — on January 13 night. All four men were released on bail by a local court on Tuesday evening. The incident had caused embarrassment to the Bommai government, and home minister Araga Jnanendra had said the duo should be dismissed from service. Police honchos also took note of the failure on the part of RT Nagar cops in following procedures while seizing narcotics, filing FIR and objecting to the bail petitions of the constables, and suspended inspector Ashwath Gowda and SI Veerabhadraiah of RT Nagar police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/constables-held-for-peddling-extorted-5k-from-auto-driver/articleshow/89049273.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: NGOs to help revamped Fort High School improve enrolment||BENGALURU: After the 114-year-old building was revamped to restore its old glory, Fort High School near Chamarajpet is likely to get help from various NGOs to increase its student strength and improve quality of education. Two Teach for India (TFI) fellows — Pavitra Umashankar and Dipti Jain — said they will start interventions from the next academic year to up student enrolment. Enrolment in the institution, which is a Karnataka Public School, hadn’t improved even after its restoration because of the pandemic situation. In 2021-22, the number of boys was 99 and girls 27, totalling 126. In 2020-21, student enrolment was 142 and in 2019-20, it was 207. “Soon after the restoration work, Covid hit. Many students went back to their hometowns. Also, one of the neighbourhood higher primary schools got upgraded to class 8. So, students who would have otherwise come to our school after class 7 have continued there. A hostel in the neighbourhood from where students used to come also closed,” said Hema S, vice-principal. Enrolment in primary school has gone up marginally — from 38 to 72 — this academic year. “The building where classes for primary grades used to be held is being revamped. We are hoping to see a rise in student numbers in that section,” she added. Classes 11 and 12 have over 300 students. Hema said the staff will take steps to increase student count. “We have a beautiful building now. We need to popularise our facilities, including the various language mediums available. We will make groups and meet parents,” she said. In 2018, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage took up restoration of the colonial structure with help of donors. It was the first high school in erstwhile Mysore province. Now, TFI fellows plan to take it forward with a cohort of NGOs. “We want to bring NGOs who work in different sectors for a holistic approach. For instance, we will have Teach For India sending fellows who will engage students in lower grades and work with them till grade 10...Another NGO will work with them on sports. The priority is to increase enrolment, for which yet another NGO which works in slums, will help us. This will call for community visits and changing perception of parents about a government school,” said Pavitra. “There are many budget schools in the neighbourhood that could be competition. There is also a high concentration of government schools. But because it is a market area, one will find labourers and migrant population. When there is an intervention, rise in strength will not be visible in 1-2 years. But in 5-6 years, when the same students pass out and results start showing, parents will get convinced,” she said. “So far, the school has not seen any private intervention in academics. It is a classic example of infrastructure alone not attracting students..,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ngos-to-help-revamped-fort-high-school-improve-enrolment/articleshow/89049274.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Three, including fake CBI officer, booked for duping bizman of 70L||Bengaluru: Based on the court’s direction, police booked cases of criminal conspiracy and cheating against three persons, including a Goa-based man, for allegedly duping a 66-year-old businessman from the city of over Rs 70 lakh on the pretext of helping him in an ongoing money-laundering case being probed by CBI. Peter Caddy, a businessman from Brigade Road, filed a complaint with Ashoknagar police. The FIR identified the accused as Chhabriya BN, 78, Shyam Chandrakanth Bagli, 53, both from Bengaluru, and Vivek Yadav from Goa.The FIR reads: “The complainant had entered into an agreement with a person called Dr Srinivas to purchase a few properties related to Yellamma Dasappa institution in Shantinagar. Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued notices to the parties. On August 21, 2020, the complainant received a notice from CBI, directing him to appear for investigation at its New Delhi office. Since the complainant is an aged person, he appeared before CBI sleuths at the Bengaluru office and submitted his statement.” It added: “Meanwhile, Caddy discussed the matter with Chhabriya and the latter assured the complainant that he knew officers at CBI and would help resolve the issue. Chhabriya introduced Bagli as a CBI officer and Yadav as Bagli’s bodyguard. They told the complainant it will cost a lot to handle the issue and took more than Rs 70 lakh from him between August 2020 and February 2021. Bagli is not a CBI officer and the accused persons intentionally cheated the victim of Rs over 70 lakh.” Sources said probe will begin after the complainant hands over relevant documents. “Since it is a court-referred case, we don’t have much information. But we learnt the agreement for purchase of property was made in 2019. We can comment after looking at the records, which the complainant will provide,” police said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/three-including-fake-cbi-officer-booked-for-duping-bizman-of-70l/articleshow/89049275.cms||---

Efforts are on to nab three more people.According to police, the main accused are Jayaram of Thammanayakanahalli and his son Shashikumar. Jayaram wanted to purchase 35 guntas of land at Indlabele village on Jogani Road and had entered into an agreement with the landowner, Sudhakar Reddy. Rajashekar is said to have intervened in the deal and stopped Jayaram from registering the land. As Rajashekar was trying to sell the land to other people, Jayaram allegedly hired goons to kill him. A gang of contract killers hacked Rajashekar to death near Shivaji Circle in Anekal town around 7.30pm on January 5, police said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-son-among-five-nabbed-for-realtors-murder/articleshow/89049276.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC quashes proceedings against event manager in 2 drug cases citing lapses||BENGALURU: In a relief for New-Delhi based event manager and socialite Viren Khanna, the high court quashed proceedings in relation to two drug-peddling cases registered by city police, citing certain procedural lapses. While one case is from 2019, the other is the Cottonpet case, which allegedly involved personalities from Sandalwood. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar observed: “What’s made out by the petitioner’s counsel is a procedural lapse. This can be set right. If the petitioner is actually involved in offences punishable under NDPS Act, he must be tried in accordance with the law and punished in case the prosecution is able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Procedural lapses shouldn’t come in way of prosecuting the petitioner. Though this petition is liable to be allowed, it should not be understood that the petitioner can’t be prosecuted without following the procedure established under law.” ‘Procedural errors can be rectified’ The judge further noted: “Permission is to be accorded to the prosecuting agency to set right all procedural mistakes and take action against the petitioner in accordance with law,” Justice Kumar pointed out that if FIR no.109/2020 is to do with offences said to have been committed between April 11, 2020 and September 4, 2020, the petitioner cannot be tried for earlier offences in 2015, 2018 and 2019. “In the chargesheet, it is clearly mentioned that he (Khanna) had arranged parties at several places in 2015, 2018 and 2019 and sold narcotic substances. Previous crimes detected for the first time during investigation in connection with FIR no.109/2020 must be tried, but in keeping with the procedure established by law. Often, previous incidents are detected while probing another case,” the judge observed. “Whenever past crimes committed by the same person come to light, nothing prevents police from filing a separate FIR and separate chargesheet if all the offences cannot be tried jointly as per Section 219 of CrPC,” Justice Kumar added. Dwelling further, he said probably police were under the impression that the same FIR would suffice even for offences relating to 2015, 2018 and 2019. “The chargesheet says the last date of the petitioner’s involvement was on March 8, 2020 in a party called ‘Divine Ex-Maholli’ arranged at Ashoka Hotel. It doesn’t disclose his involvement in any offence committed after that and therefore, it is not understandable as to how the petitioner could have been arraigned as accused no.3 in FIR no.109/2020. Not only the FIR, but also the chargesheet against the petitioner requires to be quashed,” the judge said. Khanna had claimed his prosecution in relation to two cases is in violation of Section 300 of CrPC and Article 20(3) of the Constitution. According to him, he was implicated as accused no.5 in FIR no. 588/2018, which was initially registered against three accused in relation to seizure of narcotics on November 2, 2018. He claimed that based on the statement of BK Ravishankar, accused no. 4, he (Khanna) came to be implicated and a separate FIR — no.109/2020 — was registered at Cottonpet police station. Khanna said if probe disclosed he is said to have sold drugs like cocaine and ecstasy in the parties he arranged on November 3, 2018 and November 7, 2018, the two alleged incidents constitute distinct offences and, therefore, a separate FIR should have been registered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-quashes-proceedings-against-event-manager-in-2-drug-cases-citing-lapses/articleshow/89049277.cms||---

Since January 1, as many as 31 people have died in road accidents in different parts of the city. Of them, 11 were victims of hit-and-run cases. BR Ravinkante Gowda, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said a special drive will be carried out against tipper trucks entering city roads during peak hours and those found driving in a rash and negligent manner. “Also, disciplinary action will be taken against traffic police inspectors in whose jurisdiction tipper trucks cause accidents during peak hours or because of reckless driving,” he said. The first accident on Friday occurred around 9.30am when a tipper truck crushed a 28-year-old private firm employee to death near KR Puram. The victim, Bilal Khan, was a resident of Yarab Nagar in Banashankari. According to police, Khan was riding to his workplace when the accident took place near KR Puram railway station. The driver of the truck took a sudden right turn at a junction and Khan, who was riding on the right side, lost his balance and fell down when the truck hit him. The driver failed to notice this and ran Khan over, killing him on the spot. The second accident occurred around 11.30am near Bhadrappa Layout in Hebbal. A goods truck driver brushed his vehicle against a motorbike and the girl who was riding pillion fell down and came under the rear wheels of the truck. She died before she could be shifted to hospital. The victim, Y Maharshi, was a resident of Tindlu in Vidyaranyapura. She was pursuing BBA at Malleswaram government college and worked part-time at a cloth shop. “Her father Yuvaraj said they had asked Maharshi to stay back home so they could celebrate her birthday. However, she said she had to report for work and left. She was riding pillion with her friend Narasimha Perumal when the accident took place. Perumal escaped with minor injuries and the truck driver fled the scene leaving his vehicle behind,” a police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bday-girl-among-2-killed-in-accidents-31-lives-lost-since-jan-1/articleshow/89049278.cms||---

But before the bus could go up in flames, two real-life heroes came to their rescue — bus driver CP Ravichandra and conductor GP Girish Kumar. “We could have got trapped and the worst could have happened. But the driver’s presence of mind and the conductor’s quick thinking saved us all,” a woman passenger told TOI. She was travelling on route 43B (which plies between Kempegowda bus station and Hosakerehalli), when the fire accident occurred as the bus neared Makkala Koota, KR Market around 11.30am on Friday. A glitch in the vehicle’s electrical system is suspected to have caused the fire. Recounting the incident, Kumar said: “We were doing our seventh trip of the day to Kempegowda bus station and I was busy issuing tickets to three passengers who had boarded the bus at Chamarajpet, when I got a burning smell. I looked towards Ravichandra, who had by then sensed something amiss and was trying to locate where the smell was coming from.” The bus was nearing Makkala Koota traffic signal. “As I was slowing down, I noticed smoke emanating from under the engine bonnet. I was not sure what exactly was happening, but realised something was terribly wrong. As the smoke thickened, I realised there could be a fire any time. I immediately veered the bus to the extreme left of the road and parked it. Girish and I alerted all the passengers and asked them to rush out of the doors as soon as possible,” said Ravichandra. Kumar took the passengers away from the bus and made them board another Majestic-bound BMTC bus. “When I returned to the bus and peeped under the vehicle, I could see fire in the chassis. I told Ravichandra to get out of the driver’s seat.” Ravichandra got off, but went back to the vehicle to retrieve identity cards, debit cards and ticket bundles. However, the cards had burnt by then and within minutes, the vehicle was engulfed in flames. “We got water from a tanker that was being used to clean the Makkala Koota BMTC bus shelter nearby and tried to extinguish the flames. In the meantime, someone got a water pipe from a nearby children’s park,” added Ravichandra. But their efforts were no match to the raging flames. Soon, fire tenders reached the spot and douse the fire. Traffic on Pampa Mahakavi Road came to a halt for 40 minutes. Videos of the burning bus went viral. Ravichandra said he was worried about his wife. “She is pregnant and I did not want her to get a shock. I wanted to call her immediately and tell her I was safe, but did not do so till late in the evening.” Kumar added: “It was a near-miss experience. When my wife called me to find out why I hadn’t returned home on time, I narrated to her what had happened...”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bus-on-fire-driver-conductor-save-25-passengers/articleshow/89049280.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

But newly elected members are yet to take oath and start working.The reason for this is the delay in holding elections for mayor and deputy mayor posts. Unless these elections are held, the newly elected members can’t assume office. “We got elected five months ago but are yet to be officially declared corporators. Our voters keep approaching us every day with civic issues. It is getting very embarrassing,” said Imran Yaligar, a Congress corporator who won from Anand Nagar ward in Hubballi.BJP corporator and former mayor of Hubballi-Dharwad, Veeranna Savadi, too is miffed with the situation. “There is already a five-month delay and we have been told elections will be held in February,” he said.The results to these three corporations were announced on September 6. While the BJP got a majority in Belagavi, it fell short of majority by three seats in Hubballi-Dharwad and by five seats in Kalaburagi. The government had announced dates for mayor and deputy mayor elections for Kalaburagi on November 20 but postponed the process as it clashed with elections to 25 seats of the legislative council from local bodies’ constituencies, which fell around the same time.Urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj said the government is in the process of issuing a notification for the mayoral elections. “I have told officers to issue a notification and by Monday we will tell the date,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/5-months-on-3-corporations-without-council/articleshow/89049283.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt in no rush to find new Lokayukta chief||BENGALURU: The Karnataka Lokayukta post is likely to stay vacant for some time as the BJP government appears to be in no hurry to appoint a new head of the corruption watchdog. Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanath Shetty’s five-year term is set to end on January 27, and officials said CM Basavaraj Bommai wants to do due diligence in selecting a candidate for the post and is discussing it with BJP leadership. As a rule, the chief minister has to appoint the Lokayukta in consultation with leaders of opposition in the legislative assembly and council, speaker of the assembly, chairman of the council, and chief justice of the high court. Authorities said none of them has received communication from the chief minister’s office about the appointment of a new Lokayukta. A retired Supreme Court judge or retired chief justice of a high court or a person who has served as judge of a high court for ten years is eligible. “We have not heard of any process being initiated by the chief minister’s office on the appointment of Lokayukta, nor have we received an invitation of a meeting on it. I am waiting,” said legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti. “It is dismaying that the CM is procrastinating. Lokayukta is such a significant post in the administrative system that the government should never allow it to fall vacant,” said leader of the opposition in the assembly, Siddaramaiah. Ironically, it was during the Congress regime led by Siddaramaiah that the post of Lokayukta fell vacant for two years before Viswanath Shetty was appointed in January 2017. Further, Siddaramaiah has been criticised for stripping the Lokayukta of the powers to investigate and prosecute as his government created the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). He didn’t take immediate steps to appoint a Lokayukta after Justice Y Bhaskar Rao resigned on corruption charges in 2015. The issue has also given way to a slugfest between the ruling BJP and the principal opposition, Congress. BJP national general secretary CT Ravi said: “Siddaramaiah talking in favour of the Lokayukta sounds like the devil quoting the scripture for his own purpose.” Even the BJP has failed to keep its poll promise of strengthening the Lokayukta by scrapping the ACB. A pending batch of petitions seeking the merger of ACB with the Lokayukta is coming up for hearing in the high court on February 3. “Since no political party is interested in strengthening the Lokayukta, successive governments have been unconcerned about it. Both Congress and the BJP have no moral right to talk about the institution,” said former Lokayukta Justice N Santosh Hegde. The bigger concern is the pendency of cases. There are 8,967 cases pending, while one of the two Upa Lokayuka posts has been vacant for over a year now. “There is one Upa Lokayukta at present, and he can only look after administrative issues in the absence of Lokayukta. I hope the government will find a replacement at the earliest,” said Vishwanath Shetty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-in-no-rush-to-find-new-lokayukta-chief/articleshow/89049286.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

His family, which has spent over Rs 15 lakh since his birth on treatment, is now staring at expenses worth over Rs 1 lakh to help him get better. Dalpath, Rahul’s father who is a helper at a ration shop in Electronics City, told TOI that Rahul had travelled with his mother to their village near Palanpur earlier this month. “On their way back, a relative who was lifting him might have injured his leg. We got to know about the injury only 10 days ago when there was a severe swelling on his right leg,” Dalpath said, adding that Rahul cannot even express or communicate what he is going through. After visiting a hospital near Jigani, the family was shocked to know that Rahul’s leg was fractured and a surgery needed to fit a rod in his leg. It is estimated to cost Rs 1.1 lakh. “The doctors told us his leg is very weak and will need a rod to even sustain the little weight he has,” Dalpath said. He explained that he earns a meagre Rs 10,000 a month while his wife is a homemaker who spends every waking hour taking care of Rahul. “The pandemic made things worse for us. Stores were closed and I lived in constant fear of losing my job,” Dalpath said. Rahul also suffers from epileptic fits. Dalpath said the family was forced to sell its shop in Electronics City to support the boy’s treatment five years ago. “My younger son, Himanshu, is 10 years old and is a bright student. But I have neither the resources nor the energy to support him now. I hope to get help for Rahul’s surgery and Himanshu’s studies,” he said. A doctor who examined Rahul’s reports said the boy requires surgery as well as post-surgery care. “In such cases, the patient needs care and constant support,” she said. Dalpath requested that his mobile number (9916270073) be shared with those who wish to help his son.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/covid-mishap-push-bedridden-boys-family-to-the-brink/articleshow/89049289.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru man with 500g tumour on the nose gets a new lease of life||BENGALURU: A 48-year-old man developed a tumour on the tip of his nose and it eventually grew so huge that it was left hanging as a heavy mass. The abnormal growth, which started 10 years ago, grew bigger and affected his appearance. But since his general health was not affected, Mohan (name changed) initially refused to go to the doctor. Yet, the bulbous benign tumour traumatised him. Rhinophyma, also called potato tumour, is a non-cancerous dermatological disease. While its exact cause is unknown, it is said to be a severe form of acne rosacea, an inflammatory skin disease. If ignored, it grows to become a tumour with uncontrolled growth of soft tissue in the nose, said doctors at KIMS medical college hospital who treated Mohan. The man, suffering from mental health issues and seizures, kept himself busy with hemming work as a tailoring assistant. “He would refuse to seek medical help. He does not speak much and hardly mingles with anyone. This affected him further,” said a family member. He was operated upon on November 6 last year and stayed in hospital for a week. The surgery was done by Dr Smitha SG and Dr Suhasini H from the department of ENT and head and neck surgery. On the first day of consultation, Mohan lacked confidence and barely made eye contact, according to Dr Smitha. “He was counselled and psychological evaluation was conducted before the surgery. His interactive abilities also improved,” she said. The tumour weighed nearly 500 grams, said Dr Suhasini. “In such cases, we need to shave off the entire tumour and it requires regular dressing. He had to come for dressing for almost a month and it took nearly 60 days for it to heal. He is fine now,” she said. A regrowth is unlikely as the proliferative (abnormal) cells have been removed, she added. It’s a rare phenomenon seen in probably 1-2 persons in a population of 1 lakh, said Dr Jagannath B, HoD of ENT and head and neck surgery. Worldwide, such cases are largely among men, he added. Given the rarity of the case, the medical college plans to publish the details in a scientific journal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-with-500g-tumour-on-the-nose-gets-a-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/89049290.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Chennai||Madras high court bats for regulating pet ownership in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday pushed for regulating pet ownership in the state. “Let Tamil Nadu be the first state to come up with such regulation,” the court said. “In our country, pets can come to the streets and do whatever they want and the owner is not accountable. But in the US and Europe, the owners are under obligation to dispose of even the stools of dogs,” the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu said. We would require petting an animal in a manner that it does not affect others, the court said while enlarging the scope of a PIL moved for proper upkeep of dogs on IIT (Madras) campus. Concurring with the submission of a lawyer that stray dogs have become a menace in the city, the court said the Chennai corporation must frame proper rules to check the population of such dogs. The court made the observations on a PIL moved by People for Cattle India (PFCI) for proper upkeep of more than 100 dogs that are captured on the IIT-M campus and are lodged in three dog parks. When the plea came up for hearing, the judges questioned the IIT on why it created dog parks instead of approaching the corporation, which is authorised to deal with the issue. To this, counsel for IIT submitted that the decision was made by a committee that comprises representatives from the corporation, the forest department and animal welfare NGOs. Recording the submissions, the court directed counsel to prepare a compilation of all the orders and affidavits filed in the case and adjourned the hearing to February 9.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/madras-hc-bats-for-regulating-pet-ownership-in-tn/articleshow/89049263.cms||Suresh Kumar

DMK video mocks defence minister in Hindi||CHENNAI: Taking a dig at the defence ministry’s expert panel, which rejected Tamil Nadu’s tableau for the 75th Republic Day parade, the DMK women’s wing has come up with a video on freedom fighter V O Chidambaram with a narration in English with Hindi subtitles for “broader reach and better understanding”. The 2.40-minute-long video on V O C, popularly known as ‘Kappalottiya Tamizhan’, ends with a punchline “Samjha? Samajh lena!” (Understand?) to send across a loud and clear message, particularly directed at the expert panel formed by the defence ministry and the Union government, for excluding the tableau. The video includes a disclaimer that says it was “created solely to highlight the significance of Tamil leaders, in English, with Hindi subtitles for broader reach and better understanding”. It begins with the narrator asking, “Are you really not aware who V O C is?” Listing out the freedom fighters, who hailed from Tamil Nadu, starting with Veerapandiya Kattabomman in the 1790s, the video details the contribution of V O C to the nation’s freedom struggle and how he was considered “the most dangerous of all freedom fighters” by the Britishers during his time. “We want to tell people who are not aware about the greatness of V O C. We will soon come up with similar videos on Veeramangai Velunachiyar, the first queen to fight the Britishers, and other freedom fighters,” DMK women wing secretary and Lok Sabha MP Kanimozhi told TOI. She tweeted the video with the women wing logo and the tagline ‘The name is V.O. Chidambaranar’. It was widely shared on twitter and other social media. The name is V.O.Chidambaranar. #FreedomFighter #TamilLeaders https://t.co/Xi8XgaitQ9— Kanimozhi (கனிமொழி) (@KanimozhiDMK) 1642750877000“The video uses Hindi subtitles to carry forward a crystal clear message that the experts had been unaware or lacked knowledge about significant freedom fighters like V O C and woman warrior Velunachiyar. It will hit them hard and expose their ignorance,” said a functionary of the wing, seeking anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/samjha-dmk-video-mocks-defence-min-in-hindi/articleshow/89049300.cms||Shanmughasundaram J
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Blacklist contractors who pack poor quality Pongal, says CM M K Stalin||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin has instructed officials to blacklist contractors, who were found to have supplied substandard items given in Pongal gift hamper. Stalin, who held a review meeting on distribution of Pongal gift hampers in the wake of complaints from opposition parties that the items given were of poor quality, told officials to take action against staff who were responsible for bringing disrepute to the government. A statement from the government said Stalin had warned of strict action against those behind the irregularities. “He instructed that only quality products should be given to the public and that officials should not allow anyone to bring disrepute to the government,” the statement said. Government officials should ensure that all the commodities given in the gift hamper at ration shops are of good quality and of prescribed quantity. “Stern action should be taken on erring staff,” he said. The statement said that though the gift hamper distribution had received an overwhelming response from the public, there were complaints in few places about the commodities. These complaints were inquired into and action was taken on agencies that supplied the substandard items, the statement added. Though only six items were given as part of Pongal gift hamper by the previous government, the present government was giving 21 items. The government had taken concerted efforts to procure quality products, the statement said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/blacklist-contractors-who-pack-poor-quality-pongal/articleshow/89049301.cms||---

The railway made the submission in its 16-page report submitted to the Madras high court on steps taken to prevent elephant deaths. Filing the report, railway counsel P T Ramkumar informed the court that southern railway has also decided to build two underpasses in Coimbatore and Palakkad region at a cost of Rs 8 crore. The report was filed in a batch of petitions seeking to check elephant deaths and poaching in the state. The cases are specially heard by a division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and N Sathish Kumar. In the report, the railway submitted that since audio alarms with honey bee and tiger roaring sounds have been found to be successful in preventing elephants from roaming near railway tracks, it has been decided to increase the number of such alarms. Since food and garbage on railway tracks are attracting elephants, steps have been taken to sensitise passengers through audio announcements at Walayar, Kanjikode and Palakad stations, Ramkumar said. This apart, the railway informed the court that it would be easier to track the elephants if they are radio collared as done in Similipal Tiger Reserve in Odisha. At least, the crop raiding elephants and lone elephants which come regularly to the tracks must be fitted with the collars, it said. Taking the report on record, the bench directed the forest department to come up with its suggestions. On December 10, 2021 the court warned of action against authorities if immediate steps are not taken to check elephant deaths on railway tracks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/railways-to-install-sensors-to-stop-elephant-deaths/articleshow/89049306.cms||Suresh Kumar

When she returned a few hours later, she found the main door locked from inside. When repeated calls went unanswered, she broke open the door with the help of neighbours, only to find Shoba hanging from the ceiling in one of the rooms and Hrithik lying dead on the bed.

---||Chennai||Corporation looks to scale up manure production from household waste||Chennai: In a bid to scale up the production of manure from household waste collected by Greater Chennai corporation, the civic body sold 160 tonnes of fine manure to Tamil Nadu cooperative societies on Friday.The civic body produces a minimum of 135 tonnes of manure a day from about 650 tonnes of waste collected and decomposed at 200-odd micro composting centres. “Right now, we have more than 1600 million tonnes(MT) of raw compost and more than 200 tonnes of fine compost with us. We have been selling compost through retail outlets and malls and through various government institutions. We plan to scale this further this year,” said N Mahesan, chief engineer, solid waste management, . According to data available with TOI, the civic body produced 1150 MT of raw manure and 210 MT of fine manure in 2021. In 2020, it produced 996 MT of raw manure and 83 MT of fine manure. Ideally, from one tonne of wet or bio-degradable waste, about 160 kg of manure can be produced. “The quantity of manure produced was lower due to the pandemic, when waste segregation took a hit. However, we are improving our output. We aim at achieving 100% source segregation of waste this year,” said an official.The civic body is in talks with various companies and brands to package its manure, apart from giving it away for free as incentives to apartment complexes and residents who segregate their waste. Officials are in talks with farmers in neighboring districts as well to sell it to them directly. The corporation’s raw manure costs 3 for a kg while fine manure costs 6 for a kg. The manure output will be increased based on demand, an official said. The civic body plans to create a brand of its manure and eventually plans to sell it on e-commerce sites. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, corporation commissioner, said, “We are reviewing the production of manure at every micro-composting centre once in two weeks. Each centre can produce nearly a tonne of manure. We want these centres to function at full capacity. We also hold workers and officials accountable. We ensure that micro- composting centres get segregated wet waste from the concerned wards every day.” One critical problem of the civic body remains lack of awareness on source segregation. “Many bulk waste generators don’t segregate waste and continue to dump the mixed waste in road side bins. Some hire unlicensed vendors who dump them on road sides and at vacant plots. We encourage segregation and we have shared standard operating procedure on how dry waste can be sold and the workers get paid from the sales,” Bedi said. The corporation contractors are also creating awareness campaigns to improve source segregation. Ramky Enviro engineers, incharge for Madhavaram, Thiruvotriyur, Manali and Ambattur, reviews the production of manure at micro composting sites. Urbaser-Sumeet, incharge of seven zones such as Adyar, Valasaravakkam, Teyanmpet, Kodambakkam, Alandur, Sholinganallur and Perungudi, has asked their workers to inform residents to hand over only segregated waste.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/corporation-looks-to-scale-up-manure-production-from-household-waste/articleshow/89049309.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Two-way traffic on Pallavaram flyover likely||Chennai: The state highways department and the traffic police are in talks to discuss the possibilities of introducing a two-way traffic system along the Pallavaram flyover.I Karunanithi, MLA for Pallavaram, said that an inter-departmental inspection would be held soon to ensure that the new traffic pattern does not cause any traffic congestion or accidents. Ever since the 1.5-kilometre-long flyover was thrown open for the public in September 2020, residents in areas along Grand Southern Trunk (GST) have been demanding that two-way traffic be allowed on the stretch. Currently, motorists are allowed to travel only in one direction, from Tambaram towards Chennai International Airport. “It is wide enough to support two-way traffic. But for some unexplained reason, the government has restricted it to unidirectional flyover. This has defeated the very purpose of constructing a flyover at this location,” said V Santhanam, a resident-activist from Chromepet.During the evening peak hours, thousands of vehicles leave the city. But they are forced to use the road below the flyover. As a result, the entire stretch becomes congested, and vehicles move at a snail’s pace. Traffic gets worse on Fridays when the weekly market is organised.Therefore, it will be good if the government can allow at least cars, minivans and two-wheelers to use the flyover while leaving Chennai. This will reduce the burden on the road underneath the flyover, Santhanam said. Karunanithi, the MLA for Pallavaram, said that he had already initiated talks among various state government agencies. “Soon, it will be converted into a bi-directional flyover,” he said.Besides this, efforts are on to widen the roads underneath the flyover and install another traffic signal so that vehicles to and fro Pammal and Kundrathur need not take a detour. This signal will make pedestrian movement also easier, he said. The state highways department, which constructed the flyover at 82 crore, will remove encroachments along the stretch in order to widen it. “It will be converted into a three-lane road (11 metres wide) so that there are no traffic jams,” said Jayanthi, a divisional engineer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/two-way-traffic-on-pallavaram-flyover-likely/articleshow/89049311.cms||Ram Sundaram

It has also deleted the portion wherein the author emphasised that unlike Sanskrit, Tamil would flourish, the petitioner said.“In order to devalue the song and degrade the author, the state has printed the manipulated version in all school books published by the textbook society and has been enforcing singing of this manipulated song at all schools,” he added.Therefore, he wanted the court to declare that reciting the Tamil anthem in its current form is illegal and malicious.Opposing the plea, the state contended that the changes were made only to make the song convenient to sing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pil-against-recital-of-tns-anthem-junked/articleshow/89049312.cms||---

Based on data provided by private hospitals, Greater Chennai Corporation on January 18, traced 1,497 symptomatic patients, who skipped RT-PCR tests by going to clinics and hospitals. Corporation staff took swabs of patients at their doorsteps and found 455 cases, or 30 %, positive. In zones like Thiruvikanagar and Kodambakkam, 60 % of patients with ILI symptoms have Covid while in Teynampet, 40% have Covid. Of the 1,497 who went to private hospitals, 204 were from Teynampet zone and 167 from Royapuram zone, 357 patients skipped RT-PCR test and went for CT scan. “Every day, zonal health officers and entomologists are in touch with private hospitals. We send the testing team to the houses. This helps in early detection,” said corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. The number of fever patients skipping RT-PCR tests and going to private hospitals for treatment is up. From about 600 patients who visited 533 hospitals on January 4, it rose to 2,000 patients on January 20. Many of them are now self-isolating by taking Rapid Antigen Tests and skipping RT-PCR. “Symptomatic patients must definitely take an RT-PCR test and also check for comorbidities. Even if they take rapid antigen tests through commercial kits, they have to inform the corporation,” said former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy, adding that the focus now must primarily be on vaccination and preventing deaths. On Friday, to spread awareness on testing, isolating and vaccination, the corporation launched three vehicles fitted with speakers and digital display. It traced and tested 848 symptomatic people on the day. Overall, 2,084 people have been deployed for door-to-door surveillance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/one-third-of-city-fever-patients-have-covid-19-finds-civic-body/articleshow/89049316.cms||Omjasvin M D

The first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu refused to grant the relief to a batch of petitioners who wanted the elections postponed in view of the third wave of Covid-19. The court instead informed the petitioners that the pleas would be taken up for final hearing on January 24. Appearing for a doctor petitioner, advocate S Prabakaran argued that the SEC was hurrying to conduct the local body elections without considering the current pandemic situation. “The SEC has failed to assess the Covid-19 containment zones and blocks. Since people’s lives are involved, timely action is required,” he said. Representing another petitioner, advocate A R L Sundaresan contended that though the authorities are duty bound to conduct the elections, it is also their responsibility to protect and improve public health standards. “The Supreme Court has ordered the state to conduct elections during normalcy, with the ongoing pandemic elections will increase the chance of viral spread putting people’s lives at stake,” he added. Opposing the plea, counsel for the SEC S Siva Shanmugam submitted that it is the mandate of the apex court to complete the elections within four months. As per the order, the SEC must notify the elections on or before January 26. A circular on protocols and precautionary methods to be followed from nomination to declaration of the elections was released in December 2021, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-refuses-to-stop-urban-local-body-elections/articleshow/89049317.cms||---

Some of them are naturalised to such an extent that they are closely associated with religious practises, the panel said. The panel concluded that there was no violation of zoo rules. Zoo director V Karunapriya said, "Not all tree species whose origin is outside Asia are dangerous or invasive.” The NGT disposed of the petition, but told the zoo to consult experts if it plan to plant any of these species in future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/zoo-gets-clean-chit-from-ngt-in-exotic-tree-plantation-case/articleshow/89049320.cms||Ram Sundaram

TOI reported the scam on December 22, 2021.The panel is headed by director of legal studies C Chokkalingam. The other members are B Venugopal, head, department of legal studies, Chitti Annapurna, head, department of Hindi, D Sathiyavan, head (in-charge), department of econometrics, and Elangovan, dean (academic) and head, department of biochemistry.Except Elangovan, other four members are syndicate members. “The panel commenced its probe on Thursday. It will inquire into how the racket happened, who were responsible and recommend action,” an official said. Based on the committee report, the university will decide whether to file a police complaint. "At present, the committee will look only into the December 2020 semester exams for distance mode students," vice-chancellor S Gowri said.Institute of Distance Education had decided to allow people to write exams who had enrolled for degrees since 1980-81, but didn’t get degrees due to arrears. The racketeers uploaded fake course completion certificates for new students to enable them to write as old students. They paid exam fees and were given serial numbers that followed genuine candidates.As many as 117 students cleared the exams in December 2020.

---||Chennai||Chennai says goodbye to rain after 74% excess showers||CHENNAI: There would be no more rain in Chennai this season, weathermen have said. That means the end of northeast monsoon, which brought excess rain that spilled over to January. “Conditions are favourable for the cessation of northeast monsoon rain over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, Kerala and adjoining areas of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema and south interior Karnataka on January 22,” the Met department said. Private forecasters and bloggers said the city and the rest of the state will continue to see dry weather for the rest of the month. Temperatures will remain ‘near normal’ during the day and night. Former IMD deputy director general Y E A Raj said the absence of rain for several days on end is the only condition that needs to be met before the cessation of northeast monsoon is declared. While October to December is considered as the monsoon season, rain has either ended abruptly in December or has spilled over to January on several occasions. In contrast, the southwest monsoon withdraws in phases. While the deviation for monsoon onset is six to seven days, for the withdrawal it is 15 days from the normal withdrawal date of December 27-28. Meteorologists said the monsoon has extended to January at least in six seasons since 2001; that is: 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2020. City recorded 1,360.4mm of rainfall between October and December against the normal 784mm, receiving an excess of 74%. Tamil Nadu received 711.6mm against 448mm, getting an excess of 59%. So far in January, Chennai has had an excess rainfall of 160%, with 42.5mm against the normal 20.2mm while Tamil Nadu has had a 134% surplus rainfall with 32.1mm against 13.7mm.  “The weather over Tamil Nadu and Chennai will continue to be dry in the coming days,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/city-says-goodbye-to-rain-after-74-excess-showers/articleshow/89049326.cms||---
---||Chennai||58% founders feel India IPO is most viable exit route: Survey||Chennai: The successful IPOs of technology companies in 2021 has encouraged more entrepreneurs to look toward going public in Indian markets and consider it a viable exit option for their startup. Nearly 58% of founders now believe that listing in Indian markets is the most viable exit for their startup compared to only 30% who believed so last year, a recent survey showed. The proportion of founders who are interested in overseas listing has also come down to 13%, compared to 17% who said so last year. Innoven Capital’s India Startup Outlook report, which surveys senior executives and founders from over 100 startups, also finds that, on an overall basis, 71% of founders now consider taking their startup public as a key exit option compared to just 47% last year. “The ability of startups like Zomato and Nykaa to successfully list in India and the interest shown by domestic investors to get some exposure to startups has given confidence to founders (and investors) that they can execute an IPO in India,” Ashish Sharma, managing partner, InnoVen Capital India, told TOI. “In the past, we used to see companies flipping to the US but lately, we are seeing many late-stage companies flipping back to India, as they feel that public listing in India is a more viable and better option,” he added. The high liquidity environment has also made it easier to raise funds as 84% of founders had a “favorable fundraising experience” in 2021 compared to just 54% in 2020. Around 75% of founders believe that the fundraising environment will improve further in 2022. But, a large group of respondents (49%) also said there is a need for more companies with robust business models to drive the positive investor sentiment further. “Record fundraising by VCs/PEs and some reallocation from China to India also helped the funding environment in 2021,” Sharma said. Improving gender diversity continues to be a challenge. Only 30% of startups surveyed had more than 20% of women in leadership roles — a slight reduction from 33% the year before. The founders surveyed chose Zerodha as their most favorite Indian startup for the second year in a row, and Zomato’s Deepinder Goyal was chosen as the favorite founder.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/58-founders-feel-india-ipo-is-most-viable-exit-route-survey/articleshow/89049328.cms||---

Shah also said the holiday bounce has managed to offset part of the post-Diwali export slump, when factories normally take a short break. “We have every reason to believe that this momentum will carry through the end of FY 2022, bringing us closer to the set target of $41.67 billion in exports,” he said. Cut & Polished Diamond exports in December 2021 grew by 41%, as against the same period of 2019. Gold exports in December stayed flat at $778 million.

Police said that a diagnostic centre owner, a primary health care centre staff, travel agents and others had joined hands to issue these certificates in a fraudulent manner. The officials seized 75 fake RT-PCR Covid-negative certificates and 50 fake vaccination certificates. Deputy commissioner of police (Task Force) Gummi Chakravarthy said P Lakshman, who owns a diagnostic centre and his accomplice Prabhath Kumar Sangi, were arrested from Malakpet for faking the negative RT-PCR reports. While Mohammed Tariq Habeeb, owner of a diagnostic centre; Gulam Mustafa, who is into travel business; Abdul Basheer, a travel agent; Irfan Ansar, and Kumari, a PHC staff, were arrested by Humayun Nagar police for their role in issuing fake vaccination and RT-PCR negative certificates. Officials said that the accused issued RT-PCR negative certificates without taking swabs and charged between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000. "The accused sent dummy samples to a lab with whom he has tie up. The lab issued negative report because test was done without a swab," Chakravarthy said. In the Humayun Nagar case, Habeeb hatched a plan with Kumari working at the urban primary health centre (PHC) in the area to provide vaccination certificate, especially for those travelling abroad. These accused managed to generate backdated vaccine certificates and provided it to customers sent to them by the travel agents. For each vaccination certificate, they charged from Rs 800-1,000. Apart from this, the accused were also providing fake RT-PCR negative reports. The racket came to light after one agency which received the vaccination certificate cross-checked with the PHC. Following a complaint from PHC superintendent, the police unravelled the racket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fake-rt-pcr-ve-report-vaccination-cert-racket-busted/articleshow/89049336.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Property registration rates in Telangana may go up by 20%-50%||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is considering hiking property registration charges by 20% to 50% for both agricultural and non-agricultural properties. If the cabinet approves the proposal, the revised charges will come into effect from February 1. The proposal comes just six months after the state government increased property values for registration of all properties. The registration and stamps (R&S) department, which is expected to get Rs 10,000 crore revenue in the current financial year, will get another Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore after the hiked charges come into effect. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao reportedly instructed the R&S department to enhance the rates as property registrations have peaked in the past four months due to a real estate boom, both in Hyderabad metropolitan region and tier II towns in the state. “The government can revise values in urban areas for non-agriculture properties twice a year and once in two years for agriculture properties. But the government decided to increase charges for agriculture properties too. Preliminary meetings are being held on the proposals especially on the extent of the hike. These will be completed in the next few days,” a senior official of R&S department told TOI on Friday. Official sources said the government is focussing on the agricultural properties as land rates have gone up in the state since the formation of Telangana, especially after completion of various irrigation projects. “For instance, after completion of Kaleshwaram and Konda Pochamma Sagar in Siddipet, land value shot up to about Rs 50 lakh to Rs 70 lakh for an acre, while the value as per the registrations department is about Rs 5 lakh,” a sub-registrar said. After an earlier revision, the minimum value for agricultural land was fixed at Rs 75,000 per acre and the minimum value was fixed at Rs 1,000 per sq ft for flats. For open plots, the minimum rate was decided as Rs 200 per sq. yard. All the rates came into effect from July 22, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/property-registration-rates-in-t-may-go-up-by-20-50/articleshow/89049344.cms||Koride Mahesh

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union textile minister Piyush Goyal, KTR urged sanction of central funds for key projects like the Kakatiya Mega Textile Park (KMTP) at Warangal and the mega powerloom cluster at Sircilla. He also asked for projects such as an Indian Institute of Handloom Technology (IIHT) to be set up in the state and offered the handloom park at Pochampally for the same. This apart, he called for the setting up of a National Textile Research Institute as well as a Handloom Export Promotion Council in Hyderabad.

He also requested the Centre to sanction the mega powerloom cluster at Sircilla with a funding of Rs 49.84 crore out of the projected outlay of Rs 993.65 crore towards filling the various gaps and to implement various components. KTR has also asked the Centre to allow upgradation of powerlooms under the IN-SITU scheme and expressed Telangana’s willingness to contribute 50% of the upgradation cost. He also sought sanction of 15 block level handloom clusters (BLCs) under the national handloom development programme (NHDP). He also called for a relaxation in the bank financing requirements under the amended technology upgradation fund (ATUF) for large textile projects from the existing 50% of the project cost 5% to help companies finance their projects as per their size and business requirements while ensuring adequate project scrutiny by notified lending institutions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-seeks-central-govts-support-for-textile-sector/articleshow/89049363.cms||---

The invention by grassroots innovator Raju Mupparapu of Gopalpuram village in Warangal has been fitted in CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s adopted village Vasalamarri too by Yadadri Bhuvanagiri collector Pamela Satpathy. The first to recognise this was Nalgonda collector Prashant Jeevan Patil during his stint in Warangal in 2018. He got Raju to fix devices in 50 villages. The devices have been fixed in Jogulamba Gadwal district and recently in Patancheru of Sangareddy too. In the latest instance, Kamareddy collector Jitesh V Patil evinced interest in Raju’s invention. Raju said that his device uses infrared sensors, making it different from the ones available in the market and used in municipalities. For October 2021, the electricity bill for streetlights in Girnibavi in Warangal was Rs 31,483. After Raju’s device was used, the bill reduced to Rs 19,953 for November and Rs 19,907 for December. T-Works in Hyderabad helped him with designing of PCB board.

CSE’s analysis of pollution data showed a rising trend in the annual particulate matter (PM) 2.5 level in 2021 after a significant drop in 2020, which had more pandemic-related lockdown phases. Hyderabad’s 2021’s annual average of PM 2.5 stood at 41 ug/m3, making it third highest compared to other cities in south India after Visakhapatnam’s annual average of 44 ug/m3. However, Hyderabad holds a dubious distinction of standing first for having most number of days with bad air in the south while Vizag follows closely with 86 days. The total number of days recording air quality index (AQI) levels worse than satisfactory in Hyderabad was a mere 60 days back in 2020. “Bad air days begin to build up around December-end in the cities of south Indian states and tend to increase till March-end. Hyderabad and cities in Andhra Pradesh show a more pronounced impact of winter pollution compared to other cities of the region,” the CSE report said. On the bright side, the AQI during those 98 days in Hyderabad was ‘moderately-polluted’ and there wasn’t a day designated as ‘poor’, ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’. On the other hand, AQI of Vizag was ‘poor’ for 16 days and a day of ‘very poor’. This winter so far, the highest weekly PM 2.5 level in Hyderabad stood at 81 ug/m3, which is third-worst after Hubbali, Visakhapatnam and Rajamahendravaram. The worst in Hyderabad were weeks ending on December 26, 2021, and January 3, 2021. In Hyderabad, Sanathnagar had the worst air with its December average PM 2.5 levels hitting 83 ug/m3, while the Hyderabad Central University area stood second at 57 ug/m3 monthly average for December.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-logged-98-bad-air-days-last-yr-finds-cse/articleshow/89049369.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

It looks cool!” Replying to this, Kumar tweeted, “A surprise, well something similar, is on its way at the PVNR marg, jutting into the Hussain Sagar, will be up and running before the end of this year.” Sources said that there is a proposal that is manifesting something like the Soaring Bridge, which will be exclusive to pedestrians and will have a viewing platform. However, it is currently in the planning stage and officials are yet to formulate a proper design before proceeding further. The Soaring Bridge spreads across the territory of a park and soars over the Moscow River with a V-shape structure and the total length is 244 metres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/soon-a-bridge-may-soar-over-hussainsagar/articleshow/89049372.cms||---

While Hyderabad recorded 1,192 symptomatic cases, Ranga Reddy accounted for 102. According to the health department figures, close to 1.75 lakh people were surveyed in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts on Friday. In Hyderabad, 840 teams surveyed 35,107 homes, while in Ranga Reddy, 678 teams checked 10,800 households. The week-long survey initiated by the Telangana health and family welfare department will cover 4,846 colonies in Hyderabad. “We conducted survey in areas such as Hill Top Colony and Chintal Basti among others. After finding symptomatic persons, we distributed 1,192 Covid-19 kits,” said J Venkati, district medical and health officer (DMHO), Hyderabad. “People were complaining of having severe body aches and mild fever. We asked all such people to isolate and distributed kits among them,” said Swarajya Lakshmi, Ranga Reddy DMHO. The fever survey also kicked off in Secunderabad Cantonment areas where 21 health teams surveyed 1,754 houses. “A total of 60 people were found symptomatic during the survey. We distributed 48 health kits among them,” said Dr H Rajkumari, deputy DMHO of Secunderabad. During the survey, special emphasis was laid on pregnant women. Once all the data is collected, the GHMC would take up sanitisation drives in places from where a large number of Covid-19 cases was reported during the fever survey. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar along with GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar inspected the door-to-door fever survey.

---||Hyderabad||Covid derails Hyderabad Metro plan to get back on track||HYDERABAD: Even before the Hyderabad Metro rail could chug back to pre-Covid levels, in terms of passenger footfalls, the onslaught of the new Omicron variant has sent footfalls crashing again. “Prior to the pandemic, the number of footfalls, hovered around 4 lakh per day for all the three metro corridors. After the second wave, footfalls had started increasing and touched 2 lakh around October last year as things slowly started getting back on track. But now it has slipped to around 1.3 lakh per day,” said a source at the Hyderabad Metro rail. One of the key reasons for the sharp drop in footfalls is that most of the offices, that had opened up after the second wave, have once again gone back to work from home, either completely or on a rotation basis. “I used to travel every day from Hitech City to Ameerpet and the metro used to be full during rush hours for the last few months. But now, I travel every alternate day and find nearly half the seats empty at any given time perhaps because many offices, like ours, have shifted to rotational work from office strategy,” said Kiranjyot Kaur, a techie working in Ameerpet area. Apart from WFH, another factor is the scare of the contracting the highly transmissible Omicron variant while using public transport. This despite the Hyderabad Metro rail authorities are putting in a lot of effort to take up frequent sanitisation activities. The authorities, however, feel that this, being the Sankranthi season, is not the right time to assess footfalls and a clear picture will emerge only later on. But the fact remains that poor patronage is the main reason why the project for construction of the second phase of the metro is yet to take off. “All the three corridors are having very little footfalls. While in pre-Covid daily footfalls had reached 4 lakh, it was expected that over the next two years footfalls would touch 8 lakh daily but this has not happened,” said an insider.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-derails-hyd-metro-plan-to-get-back-on-track/articleshow/89049377.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Few isolation facilities in Hyderabad leave families in lurch||HYDERABAD: As Covid-19 cases swell, isolation at home has emerged as a major challenge for several families across the city. While the Telangana government has ramped up medical infrastructure in hospitals, accommodation for independent isolation is still tough to find. As of Friday, 29,127 people were under treatment and isolation across the state. The most common reason for seeking isolation centres away from home has been limited rooms and common washrooms in many houses. “I have a relative who is pregnant and lives with her family of four in a two bedroom apartment with only one common bathroom. One of the family members tested positive and it was not possible for her to stay in the same house with only one bathroom,” said Dinesh Rochiramani, who works as a distributor. With little option for isolation facilities around their house, the family continued to stay together and is following all safety protocols within the house. Many others testing positive are moving out of their homes and shifting to private isolation centres to keep elderly and children safe. “I was staying with one of my cousins who lives with his parents and has an eight year old son. After I tested positive, I didn’t want to put the family at risk and decided to isolate myself in a facility at Kondapur,” said Vinay Rao, who works as graphic designer. Volunteers say that they are receiving numerous enquiries from people seeking isolation services. Unlike the second wave when independent centres had mushroomed across the city, this time, very few facilities are available. “In the last few days, there has been an increase in number of people seeking independent isolation facilities. Some such facilities are available in areas such as Kondapur, Bachupally and Kompally. However, they charge anywhere between Rs 2,300 to Rs 3,000 per day. People want more government-run isolation centres,” said Sai Charan Chikkulla, managing director of a Pharma company, who began volunteering to help people deal with Covid-related challenges during the second wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/few-isolation-facilities-in-city-leave-families-in-lurch/articleshow/89049379.cms||Preeti Biswas

Recently, the UoH recorded 38 Covid-19 cases. Expressing deep concern over the increasing number of cases, UoH urged students staying in hostels and other campus residences to return home as all classes and examinations will be conducted online. Admitting that the university has limited resources to isolate infected students, officials said that increase in cases is causing stress on student welfare and healthcare systems available on the campus. The UoH Health Centre is making self-testing kits available at the pharmacy for those experiencing symptoms. “The UoH will not be able to accommodate infected students and staff beyond a point. Therefore, we appeal to them to return to the safety of their homes,” said prof BJ Rao, UoH vice-chancellor. “While we are making all efforts to address the evolving situation, we may be forced to escalate our decision if the numbers increase,” the vice-chancellor added. The UoH Task Force, meanwhile, has recommended that classes continue online for all semesters. The end-semester evaluation will also be conducted in online/open-book/take-home mode as was done during the second wave of Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cases-up-uoh-tells-students-to-leave-hostels-go-home/articleshow/89049380.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||HC notice to Telangana after online co questions movie ticket policy||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday issued notice to the state government and home secretary asking them to file their counters to a petition that challenged their cinema tickets policy. The bench of Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice A Venkateswar Reddy was hearing a petition filed by Hyderabad-based online tickets firm, M/s Buy Movie Tickets, and Srikanth Punati. They were challenging the state’s 2006 GO MS No 47 and some of the rules made along with it. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy said that they are challenging both the GO and the rules made along with it. They are not in tune with the Cinematography Act, he said. The bench sought replies from the authorities and posted the case to March 2. The petitioner company was aggrieved with the licence given to it by the Siddipet police commissioner who, while issuing the licence, imposed certain conditions. The police commissioner issued the licence on October 13, 2021, under provisions of the Telangana Cinema Regulation Act, 1955. One of the conditions imposed was that the firm should ensure that it will not sell more than 50 per cent of tickets for any given show on any day and that service charges should never cross 6 per online booking transaction. The licence also carried one more condition, that the online tickets firm should stop selling tickets two hours before the commencement of the show. The petitioners contended in their plea that these new rules are violating their rights and hence wanted the court to declare them illegal and unconstitutional. Prakash Reddy said that the Cinematography Act allows the state to regulate trade only in certain specific areas. “Since the licence for a cinema theatre is given, authorities must ensure the movie is exhibited in licenced premises only and not anywhere else. But what the authorities are doing in the name of the Act is something beyond the scope of the Act,” he said. The bench posted the case to March 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-notice-to-t-after-online-co-questions-movie-ticket-policy/articleshow/89049384.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Hyderabad||Drug bust: Peddler Tony sold to select Hyderabad clients||HYDERABAD: Nigerian peddler Chukwu Ogbonna David alias Tony, who was arrested for the first time on Wednesday by city cops from Pune since coming to India in 2013, never met any of his rich clients directly, operating only through his trusted lieutenants. Cops, however, said they have found incriminating evidence in the phones of some of the seven customers they arrested on Thursday. “We have sent the seized mobiles for forensic analysis and data retrieval,” a cop said. Task force police picked up the 37-year-old Nigerian from a resort in Pune where he had taken temporary shelter after some of his associates were arrested by the city cops. “He usually stays in resorts and star hotels, wining and dining with his girlfriend,” said an investigator. Cops said that Tony catered to about 100 trusted customers from Hyderabad, Goa and Mumbai through close associates Imran Babu Shaik, Noor Mohhammed Khan, Aftab, Parwaz, Rahamath, Irfan and Firdos. He rarely accepted new requests, even if they came with references, police said. “In Hyderabad Tony has about 30 clients and recently he had stationed a delivery person in Hyderabad. Every fortnight the delivery agent changed and they also kept changing the place of stay. Tony has a reputation for quality and sold a gram for ₹8,000 to regular customers and slightly higher for others,” a Task force official said. After police arrested his associates in Hyderabad a few weeks ago, he deleted WhatsApp from his phone. But based on phone contacts, police zeroed in on 13 of his customers from the city and seven of them along with two employees have now been arrested. “Whenever customers placed an order, Tony would alert his agent in Hyderabad and inform the customer where to pick up. His agents never directly got in touch with customers. In case of any suspicion, Tony, who uses a Nigerian SIM, would make a WhatsApp video call without showing his face and check the client and surroundings before making the deal,” a cop said. Payment was in cash as well as digital mode, with Tony withdrawing or transferring it soon after daily. Cops found only ₹16,000 in one of his accounts. Punjagutta inspector Niranjan Reddy said that Tony, the seven consumers and two of their employees have now been sent to judicial remand. “We have moved a petition before the court seeking police custody and we may get it next week,” the inspector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/drug-bust-peddler-tony-sold-to-select-city-clients/articleshow/89049386.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Hyderabad||HC gives Ranga Rao 3-day relief from ED’s Emaar trial||HYDERABAD: Justice G Radha Rani of the high court on Friday stayed for three days proceedings before ED special court against Stylish Holmes director Tummala Ranga Rao in the Emaar case. The judge gave this interim direction while hearing a petition filed by Ranga Rao, who questioned the action of ED that made him an accused in Emaar case. The crux of his grievance was the scam was investigated by CBI in the past. Though CBI had initially made him an accused, later it turned him as its witness following his decision to become an approver. CBI court too allowed the request of the agency and changed his status from an accused to a witness. Now, in the same case, ED had made him an accused. CBI court, had taken the chargesheet of ED on file and passed a cognizance order.  This means Ranga Rao would have to appear before the court as accused when it was acting as the ED court and as a witness when the court was performing its role as a CBI court. Allegation CBI initially against Ranga Rao was he and his firm, Stylish Holmes, acted in a manner that caused loss to APIIC in the Emaar-APIIC joint venture. After Ranga Rao turned approver, CBI filed another report before CBI court saying 96 crore was misappropriated in the villa deals. According to Rao, ED built its case on foundation of CBI case. He contended he was ready to assist ED as its witness instead. The case will come up for hearing on January 25.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-gives-ranga-rao-3-day-relief-from-eds-emaar-trial/articleshow/89049391.cms||---

Police also found out that the techie also deactivated all his social media accounts and one of the two phones seized from the house was formatted. The victims, T Srikanth Goud, 42, a software employee with TCS, his wife Anamika, 38, a private school teacher, and their seven-year-old daughter, were found dead on the first floor of their G+1 house at Vandanapuri Colony in Ameenpur on Thursday. Srikanth was found hanging from the ceiling fan in one bedroom, while Anamika and their daughter were found lying dead in the second room due to consumption of an unknown poison. “We found remnants of unknown pungent chemical in a glass. The same was sent to lab,” Patancheru deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Bheem Reddy said. Ameenpur police noticed a CCTV camera in the hall of the victim’s portion and it was turned off around 6pm on January 18 by Srikanth. Around 1pm, the family had lunch together, there were no visible signs of panic or distress shown by the couple, police said. Investigators spoke to the maid, who said that her employers told her that they were going out and asked her not to come for work for two days on January 16. She also told police that she never saw the couple arguing. Police also found out that Srikanth had also stopped daily milk purchase through an app he used and also deactivated his social media accounts. A tenant, who lives in the ground floor of the house, told police that Srikanth did not never pressurise him even if the payment of rent gets slightly delayed. Both the families also told police that the couple did not mention about facing any personal or financial problems.  Cops are also trying to figure out why the victims had vermilion teekas on their foreheads and why the photos of gods were removed from the puja room and turned towards the floor in the adjacent space. “So far, no suicide note was found. We have seized two phones from the house. One phone was formatted. Other phone has a lock. We sent both the phones to lab. We are analysing the call details of both the phones and waiting for post-mortem report,” police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/techie-kin-deaths-cctv-off-cell-reset/articleshow/89049393.cms||---

But the question remains by whom and why? What is the real reason? Is it an attempt to divert attention after facing controversy and criticism over rejecting Bengal’s tableau on Netaji for the Republic Day parade?” party general secretary Kunal Ghosh said. He added that if the Centre was so keen to honour Netaji, it should first declassify the files related to his disappearance. “It should immediately conduct a DNA test of the ashes kept at Japan’s Renkoji temple. More importantly, Netaji was the first prime minister of the Azad Hind government and held the war and foreign (affairs) portfolios. This should be a compulsory read in primary textbooks,” Ghosh said.Anita Bose Pfaff, Netaji’s daughter, said the decision was “better late than never”. “I am glad that his statue would be put up at such a prominent place.

Mamata Banerjee can’t deny that as many as 19 opposition parties, including her own, had joined a meeting called by Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on August 20, 2021 to discuss ways to fight the BJP,” Chowdhury said.Pointing out that Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena had come together in the Maharashtra civic polls, he said: “On the contrary, Mamata Banerjee harped on opposition unity minus the Congress. But opposition leaders made it clear that opposition to the BJP minus the Congress was not possible.”Taking a dig at TMC’s unity proposal, Chowdhury said: “Didi is now frantically moving out to Meghalaya, Tripura ad Goa and has managed an invite from former Bengal minister Kiranmoy Nanda to campaign for Akhilesh Yadav in UP.”CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra also took Mamata’s proposal to Congress with a pinch of salt. “The Trinamool chief may talk about opposition unity against the BJP, but her role against the BJP is not credible,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cong-reminds-tmc-about-oppn-meet-led-by-sonia/articleshow/89049399.cms||---

The duo had earlier pulled out of BJP’s WhatsApp group, protesting against the appointment of district presidents Sunil Rudra Mandal and Bileswar Singh.“I was facing difficulty with the security. BJP is a national party and I don’t want to criticize anyone in the open. You will see my future course of action. Trouble started when newcomers in the party were entrusted with responsibilities,” Sakha said.Dhara did not comment .Bankura, which is a BJP stronghold, has started witnessing rumbles in the party over organizational issues. In August last year, Bishnupur MLA Tanmoy Ghosh quit BJP to join Trinamool .BJP’s Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan distanced himself from the rebels. “If there is any issue, they can discuss that within the party,” he said. Trinamool Congress on Friday hinted at disgruntled BJP leaders quitting the party. “A section of BJP leaders is unsure about their political future. Some have joined us after assembly election results came out,” said Taldangra’s TMC MLA Arup Chakaborty.BJP’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said: “The Union home ministry reviews the need for security every six months. Security to some leaders has already been withdrawn. Maybe the two Bankura leaders have refused it, apprehending that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/2-bjp-mlas-from-bankura-decline-central-security/articleshow/89049400.cms||Falguni Banerjee

The bank’s founder and MD, Chandra Sekhar Ghosh, pointed out that the collection efficiency of the lender has improved. In Assam, there has been a 14% rise in collection efficiency while in West Bengal, its another major market for microfinance, it has improved by 5%. The private sector lender had posted a net loss of Rs 3,008.5 crore for the second quarter this fiscal on the back of provisions worth Rs 5,613.48 crore as it had seen a huge surge in bad loans.The bank’s non-performing assets (NPAs), in absolute terms, rose 7.7% quarter-on-quarter at Rs 9441.5 crore in Q3FY22 against Rs 8773.6 crore for Q2FY22. On a year-on-year basis, its NPAs soared nearly ten-fold from Rs 859.2 crore in the third quarter of the last fiscal. However, Ghosh pointed out that 66% of NPA customers have started paying back. “A lot of customers have regularised their accounts and we are expecting a further drop in gross NPA in next few quarters,” he added. The housing finance portfolio of the bank has done well and the focus of the bank is to increase the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bandhan-bank-q3-net-jumps-35-7/articleshow/89049403.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Mamata to meet Trinamool MPs virtually on Jan 27||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to meet the party’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs on January 27 at 4 pm virtually ahead of Parliament’s budget session. Trinamool Congress has already opposed the timing of the session in the backdrop of the Model Code of Conduct being in force in five election-bound states.According to sources, Banerjee will speak with her MPs from her Kalighat home. Sources said the CM always interacted with her party MPs ahead of the Parliament session. However, this comes in the backdrop of another Centre-state flashpoint of the proposed changes to the all-India services transfer rules, which gives the Centre overriding powers over the state.Banerjee had even written to PM Narendra Modi urging him to withdraw the proposed changes and pre-empt a larger opposition on the issue. But most importantly, this comes in the backdrop of the party fighting its first assembly elections beyond Bengal, in Goa on February 14.TMC sources said they were opposed to the fact that the Modi government, in a repeat of 2017, will use the budget as a tool to canvas for the polls. Budget sessions, party leaders stressed, are used to announce new policies and measures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-to-meet-trinamool-mps-virtually-on-jan-27/articleshow/89049407.cms||---
---||Kolkata||If services rules change, 200 from Bengal will go to central reserve||Kolkata: If the proposed changes in all-India services are implemented, Bengal must put up over 200 IAS and IPS officers for central deputation reserve (CDR). At present, there are around 286 IAS officers and 281 IPS officers in Bengal. As per rules, 40% of these officers must be sponsored for central deputation. For the Centre, the number of IAS officers on CDR has gone down from 309 in 2011 to 223 now, and the percentage of CDR utilisation has dipped from 25% in 2011 to 18% now. Around 15 IAS and 9 IPS officers from Bengal are now working on central deputation. The Centre’s proposed move to change all-India services rules are four-fold. The first says the state must sponsor 40% of their officers for central deputation. The second says if there is a dispute between the Centre and state over posting an officer on central deputation, the state must comply with the Centre’s decision in a specified time. Over and above this, the rules also say the Centre will be at liberty to handpick any officer for a specified central role beyond those shortlisted by the state, and the state must comply with the Centre’s decision within timeframe.The Centre sought the state’s responses on December 20 and 27 and again on January 6. It had asked states to respond by January 25. CM Mamata Banerjee had already sent out her response, twice, on January 13 and 20 strongly opposing the proposals. It is learnt that several other states, some governed by BJP or its allies, have also opposed the move. “Bengal has a cadre strength of around 318 IAS officers. However, the state never gets its full quota. To put 40% officers on the CDR list will cripple state administrations,” said an officer. Sources at the Centre stressed the shortfall must be shared both by the state and the Centre. Moreover, these sources added, officers are sponsored by states for central deputation “only after adjusting the same proportionately with the number of officers available in the cadre”. Former IAS officer and ex-MP Bikram Sarkar felt confrontation won’t resolve this issue. “Unilateral decisions by the Centre will only make the issue more complex. This problem affects both states and the Centre. An officer should ideally work with both Centre and states.”But Jawhar Sircar, former IAS officer and now a TMC Rajya Sabha MP, feels otherwise. “Modi’s sabotaging federalism by forcing IAS officers to go against state govts — that they are legally bound to serve,” he posted on Twitter along with the CM’s statement. CM Banerjee had written to PM Narendra Modi, saying “I request you not to denude the States of their powers over its officers which will have far reaching consequences for our country. Let us not forget that the proposed amendments are very much prone to be misused by the party in power at the Centre.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/if-services-rules-change-200-from-bengal-will-go-to-central-reserve/articleshow/89049409.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Night curb violations jump from 750 to 1k over 48 hours||Kolkata: Lalbazar is stumped by the sudden rise in night rule violations in the past 48 hours. From an average figure of 700-750 rule-break per night, the number crossed 1,050 on each of the past two days. While Wednesday night registered 1,071 violations, Thursday saw 1,092 cases. The flouting was especially high in the Park Street-Park Circus belt as well as places in the KMC-added areas.The East traffic guard, which carried out three nakas within a small stretch of Loudon Street, Park Street-Mullickbazar and Park Circus Seven Points, registered 270 offences on Wednesday and 342 on Thursday nights. The corresponding violations in the South guard, covering New Market to Exide Crossing, saw 169 violations on Wednesday and 146 on Thursday. From an average violation of 15-20 cases each night, Kasba, DH Road and James Long Sarani recorded 30-45 cases on those two days. “Most violators were out for a late-night spin or dinner. We even caught seven drunk motorists in the Park street area,” said an East guard cop. “We let people with genuine reasons go. A motorist at Seven Point said his mother had depression and needed to go out as she felt suffocated at home. Two bikers at Seven Points claimed they were out to buy medicines. We did let the bikers go but they were caught at Park Street as they were found going nowhere near medical shops.” Arrests for Covid violations have also been higher. On Wednesday, 708 people were prosecuted and on Thursday, 703. At 530, 600 and 609, the first three days of the week reported lower Covid-rule violations.The top brass have instructed all traffic guards and local police stations to tighten vigil, especially ahead of Republic Day. “We will have to be ready for the wedding season, too,” said an officer. The areas reporting most violations post midnight are very different from those reporting violations post 11pm. Between 11pm and midnight, it is usually Park Street-Park Circus-Ballygunge-Gariahat that reports maximum cases. After midnight, the violations shift towards Ultadanga, Garia and Tiljala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/night-curb-violations-jump-from-750-to-1k-over-48-hours/articleshow/89049412.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Now, birth companions to help with delivery at state facilities||Kolkata: The state government has introduced the concept of birth companions for expecting mothers seeking to give birth at public health facilities. This is part of the state’s endeavour to better the already-improving maternal and infant mortality rates in Bengal. Doctors said a positive birthing experience not only helped promote respectful maternity care but also contributed to cognitive development of the baby.A birth companion is someone close to the expecting mother who will be by her side during childbirth. Calcutta National Medical College had introduced the concept in Bengal in 2020 under LaQshya (Labour room quality improvement initiative), a programme under by National Health Mission. TOI had reported on it on November 22, 2020.The government will now extend the concept to all maternity facilities across the state.“Someone from the family, usually a woman who has had the experience of giving birth, is generally made the companion. When such a person is beside the expecting mother in the labour room, it becomes reassuring for the woman and the delivery process gets smoother,” said Arati Biswas, former gynaecology head at CNMC. “It wins the family’s trust, reducing chances of attack on hospital. In about 90% delivery cases, we had allowed birth companions. It is wonderful the concept will be replicated in all state facilities.” Biswas’s department got the LaQshya certificate in November 2020.From 113 in 2014, the maternal mortality rate in Bengal has dropped to 98, against the national average of 113. Infant mortality here has also come down to 20 per 1,000 births from 28 in 2014. The national average is 30. “ With a birth companion around, the stress and fear will reduce. That will ensure fewer complications and optimum milk flow,” said IPGMER neonatology Suchandra Mukherjee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/now-birth-companions-to-help-with-delivery-at-state-facilities/articleshow/89049413.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to officials the structural condition of the three bridges — constructed several years ago — have never been assessed. “Check will be done to see if there has been any deterioration in the structural condition of the three bridges on Tolly’s Nullah. The load bearing capacity too will be checked,” said an official. The authorities have lately completed short term repair work of Kalighat bridge and is presently working on major repairs of Baghajatin rail overbridge on EM Bypass.Previously in the last few years, KMDA have conducted health audits of all flyovers and bridges maintained by them. Following the study, major repair work was done on Ultadanga flyover. Strengthening work will also be done on Sealdah flyover and Aurobindo Setu. There are some bridges like the Chinrighata flyover and Kalighat Setu that have been found to be out of bounds for long term repairs as authorities are planning to dismantle a major portion of Kalighat Setu for reconstruction and also plans to dismantle Chinrighata flyover.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/health-check-on-three-old-bridges-over-tollys-nullah/articleshow/89049418.cms||---

---||Kolkata||KMC opens up devpt on thika plots at first Covid-safe meet on Maidan||Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters on Friday was shifted from the SN Banerjee Road address to the Maidan tent. The reason — The KMC brass needed to hold the second mayor-in-council meeting of the newly elected civic board in the open air, away from the conference room of the headquarters in the wake of a fresh Covid infection threat.Among the most important decisions that were taken in the meeting include setting up a special thika tenancy cell at the civic headquarters and introduction of e-files to make the civic functioning a paperless affair.The decision on the meeting venue was taken unanimously after several councillors, who took oath as MMiC, and a section of the senior officials, including municipal commissioner Binod Kumar and municipal secretary Harihar Prasad Mondal, tested positive following the first meeting of the mayor-in-council that was held in the lawn of the headquarters.After the second MIC meeting at the Maidan tent, the civic brass will also organize the civic body’s monthly meeting (House) at Town Hall to avoid gathering at the headquarters as over 140 councillors are expected to participate in the first monthly meeting of the new board. On Friday, all senior KMC officials were told to assemble at the civic body’s Maidan tent where sitting arrangements were made in the lawn keeping the Covid protocols intact. The lawn was decked up to accommodate the civic officials who were waiting for their turn to enter the makeshift conference room in the tent where mayor Firhad Hakim was seen busy discussing several essential civic issues. The Maidan meeting which started at 2.30 pm lasted for over two hours after which the mayor, his council members and the civic officials dispersed one by one.According to plans, thika tenants or lease holders of such land who want to build apartment buildings will be entitled to get benefits of KMC building rules instead of being governed by the Thika Tenancy Act. Hakim said, in presence of the senior officials of the state thika tenancy secretariat, it was unanimously decided that from now on the lease holders or tenants of thika land won’t have to visit state departments to get a sanction for construction of dwelling houses on such land. “We have set up a special thika tenancy cell at our headquarters. All the tenants and lease holder need to do is fill a form stating their willingness to construct a building. We will allow the same FIR to the thika tenants as we do in case of common citizens depending on factors like quantum of land, width of road etc,” Hakim said. Earlier, Thika tenants were entitled to build a double-storey building on Thika land. Now they can construct even multi-storey buildings without infringing upon KMC building rules.The meeting also took a unanimous decision to introduce e-files to pave way for making the civic functioning paperless. “From now on we will encourage passing of only e-files. The next MIC meeting will be held without papers,” Hakim said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-opens-up-devpt-on-thika-plots-at-first-covid-safe-meet-on-maidan/articleshow/89049421.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Long Covid returns, symptoms mild but persist for weeks||KOLKATA: The long Covid, in a form that is different from the second wave, is back with many among the infected feeling the impact of symptoms for weeks, a lingering weakness being the most common after-effect that’s refusing to go. While many had braced to return to work after a relatively quick recovery, the persistent symptoms, though mild for most, have kept many confined to homes. Experts warned that a significant percentage of these cases could be the more virulent Delta variant. Medica Superspcialty Hospital critical care consultant Dipanjan Chatterjee said that many are reporting with moderate to severe infection and continue to test positive to RTPCR for over a month. “Some of these patients have severe symptoms like a bad lung involvement, which is very common in Delta cases, and are taking over three weeks to recover. But as this third wave is just about three weeks old, we need some more time to have a better picture on long Covid,” said Chatterjee. Read AlsoKolkata: Private hospitals start planned ops on Covid patientsClose on the heels of government hospitals, several private hospitals, too, have started conducting surgeries and procedures on asymptomatic Covid patients.Apart from a persistent weakness, anorexia, nausea and body ache are holding many Covid patients back at home even after two weeks of testing positive. “These patients had mild to moderate symptoms but they have refused to recede quickly. Since a large number is not repeating the test, we don’t know if they remain positive. But it’s likely that the symptoms have stayed on even after the virus has gone,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. Since repeat RTPCR tests are no longer done on mild Covid patients, some of them could be remaining positive even after an apparent recovery, said doctors. But repeat tests are being done on a section of patients in ICU care, especially those requiring a significant amount of oxygen. In such repeat tests some have tested Covid positive for weeks. “In some patients we are noticing deterioration after seven to 10 days of admission. Though the number of patients with severe disease is significantly low during this third wave, some patients continue to suffer from bad Covid complications, taking days to recover,” said Rimita Dey, critical care specialist at Ruby General Hospital. Omicron live updatesAt several hospitals where scores of doctors had tested positive at the beginning of this month and were supposed to return to work in a week, a manpower crisis persists. “We had expected the situation to ease by the second week but it didn’t happen since many were too weak to join work. It affected our normal operations, particularly surgeries that had to be deferred,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Many are visiting outpatient departments of hospitals seeking treatment for lingering symptoms. “They have no fever or cough but are mostly suffering from a loss of appetite, joint pain and general weakness,” said Panja.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/long-cov-returns-symptoms-mild-but-persist-for-weeks/articleshow/89049422.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Dip in number of micro-containment zones in city but vigil continues in south Kolkata belt||KOLKATA: The city reported a further dip in micro-containment zones on Friday with the number dipping to 18. The biggest relief came from Borough 10 where the total number of containment zones dropped to five from 12. Most importantly, there were no fresh additions to the list from these belts. New Alipore, Jadavpur and Netaji Nagar, though, continue to remain on the list from the borough. However, the addition of some new south Kolkata addresses — Southern Avenue and Ballygunge and Karaya — will keep both KMC officials and cops a bit worried. Micro-containment zones have come up at Ballygunge Circular Road, Gurusaday Road and Ballygunge Park Road — the areas that had regularly reported many Covid cases during the first two waves. A containment zone was found in front of a high-rise on Friday. The residents of the high-rise have been asked to keep a close vigil on those who have tested positive. Meanwhile, in a bid to prevent under-reporting of Covid cases and undermining the infection rate among a section of the citizens, a joint team of health officials from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and cops from the south division on Friday launched a special drive in various areas such as New Alipore, Netaji Nagar, Jodhpur Park-Lake Gardens and Golf Green-Jadavpur belts. While the KMC and police both have been on a drive in these belts that had recently reported several fresh cases, the new list of micro-containment zones will come as a relief for them. A posh condo off EM Bypass in the Tangra area has also made its way to the main list. There was good news from the Behala-Joka zone and the Port areas, from where all containment zones were finally withdrawn. Several pockets of Beliaghata and Phoolbagan continue to be in the micro-containment list even after the passage of three weeks. In the meantime, a joint drive by KMC and cops in south Kolkata was conducted to ensure that basic Covid protocols are strictly maintained by the infected people for the safety of their neighbours in the micro-containment zones. It has been decided that cops will depute men to ensure that barricades — which indicate a containment zone — are not removed by the residents, especially in the New Alipore area. KMC has also sought help from cops to hold meetings with RWAs, asking them to encourage testing at KMC centres or private labs. “We need authentic reports so that our tele-callers are able to do contract tracing and at the same time advise the Covid positive patients what to do during the week-long isolation period,” said a KMC health department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dip-in-number-of-micro-c-zones-in-city-but-vigil-continues-in-s-kol-belt/articleshow/89049423.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Citizens write to CM, ask for reopening of parks||Kolkata: Several prominent citizens in the city have written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee with a one-point demand — reopen public parks.The brief letter cites three reasons why she should act upon the request and direct the reopening of parks in the city. First, the third wave of the pandemic is declining in Kolkata; the peak appears to have been crossed. Second, parks are among the safest places in the city due to their spaciousness and openness. Third, the closure of parks is affecting mental and physical health of citizens. Among the signatories who have requested for the review of the closure decision to reduce public suffering include sportspersons Arun Lal and Devang Gandhi, physicians Kallol Banerjee and SK Agarwal, architect JP Agarwal, social activists Satnam Singh Ahluwalia and Mudar Patherya among others. “Exercising and staying fit is important to combat any disease. Confined to homes, people are getting ill, both physically and mentally. They need to step out and parks are the safest place to go. Please unshackle them,” said Kallol Banerjee. This is the third time in the past two years that parks, squares and lakes have been shut. In all, these green spaces have been out of bounds for over 12 months. Even when open, that was for very restricted periods.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/citizens-write-to-cm-ask-for-reopening-of-parks/articleshow/89049424.cms||---
---||Kolkata||From 400 a day in Jan 1st wk, pvt hosp tests now below 100||Kolkata: The number of Covid tests has started sliding across some of the city’s private hospitals, even as the number of affected in the state has reached a plateau over the last few days. From around 400 tests a day during the first week of January when positivity rate had touched 70%, less than a hundred tests are now being conducted at these hospitals while positivity rate has dropped below 40%.At Peerless Hospital, the number of tests had been around 400 a day between January 1 and 10. It dropped sharply to 199 on January 11 and has been on a slide ever since. On Thursday, Peerless received 45 samples – the lowest in a day since the first wave. “We are now testing around 30-50 a day with a positivity rate of 30%-35%. It should fall further over the next few days,” said Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) tested 450 samples a day during the first week of January. It has since dropped to less than 200. “On Thursday, we tested 180 with a positivity rate of around 30%. It had crossed 65% during the first week of the month,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. At most private hospitals and clinics, the majority of people getting tested are those who need a clearance to travel. The asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, who would rush to get a test done at the beginning of the third wave, are now staying away. “ But the drop in tests and positivity may not be the right indicator of the incidence of Covid, felt Chowdhury. “A large number is getting tested at home using rapid test kits but not uploading the result. That apart, a few with mild symptoms are getting tested and preferring to stay in home isolation and have medicines. They are skipping tests,” said Chowdhury. At AMRI Hospitals, the number of tests has come down to a third of what it had been at the beginning of January. “We tested around 700-900 a day till January 10. It has now come down to around 250-300 a day across our three units. This includes the rapid tests as well,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. The number of tests has dropped from 900 a day to less than 200 now at Medica Superspecialty Hospital. “Our positivity rate, too, has plunged to 30% from above 70% a week ago,” said chairperson Alok RoyIt’s important to get tested so that a vaccine is not taken out of turn, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “There is a large number of elderly patients whose vaccines are now due. If they had Covid in the last two weeks, then should be waiting for another three months for their dose. But many skipped the test and don’t know of they had the virus,” said Panja.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/from-400-a-day-in-jan-1st-wk-pvt-hosp-tests-now-below-100/articleshow/89049425.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Isolation at home for Covid positive flyers||KOLKATA: Passengers coming from at-risk countries to Bengal as well as the rest of the nation, who test positive on arrival, need not be admitted at a hospital or isolation centre anymore and can be treated at home, as per the revised guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare that’s set to come into effect from Saturday. The development has come as a huge relief particularly for flyers who were coming back home via bubble arrangements to different cities before taking a domestic flight to reach home in Bengal. “It will certainly act as a confidence booster to travellers who feared of getting separated from the family or being unable to meet their close ones upon reaching India, if they tested positive and were forced to be admitted to a hospital. Now, even if someone tests positive, the traveller can remain in home isolation for the stipulated period like other patients, under the supervision of his family or loved ones,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (East), Travel Agents Federation of India while welcoming the development. The ministry’s revised protocol for international arrivals will come into effect from January 22. The other rules remain essentially the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/isolation-at-home-for-cov-flyers/articleshow/89049426.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A western disturbance (WD) is set to trigger two low-pressure areas across north India that will lead to light rain in the city on Sunday and Monday. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 13.8 °C on Friday. “A north-south low-pressure trough between Bihar and Chattisgarh and another one stretching between Rajasthan and Bengal are set to form over next 24 hours as the WD approaches. These will generate clouds and lead to light drizzles in the city. But rain will be restricted to 20mm-30mm and may occur on Sunday and Monday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. On Sunday, the minimum temperature may climb up to 15-16 °C as a cloud cover takes over.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/met-spies-rain-tomorrow/articleshow/89049427.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Airlines told to enforce one cabin-bag rule to cut down on security check delay||Kolkata: All airlines have been asked to use their ground staff to remind passengers about the cabin baggage concession rule — only one piece of luggage weighing up to 7kg and within the requisite dimensions is allowed in the cabin. There are two exceptions — women’s handbag and laptop bag — that will not be considered luggage. The home ministry has issued a notification to sensitize passengers about this rule.“The single cabin bag rule has been in existence for years. But nearly 85% of passengers still carry two handbags, with some even carrying three bags into the cabin. We want the single-bag rule to be enforced for operational efficiency. Hence, the notification from the home ministry to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security,” a CISF officer said.“It was at the check-in counter that airline ground staff would inform passengers about the one cabin bag rule,” said an airline official. But with web check-in made mandatory during the pandemic, interaction between passengers and check-in counter staff has reduced. Some airlines have already implemented retrieving hand baggage at gates, the official added.AOC chairman Rahul Wadhwa welcomed the move and said, “Long queues and congestion at security checkpoints due to passengers carrying multiple bags get carried forward to aircraft where racks are designed for one bag per passenger,” he said.While the one-handbag rule violation happens everywhere, it is more in Kolkata due to the large number of first-time flyers who are not aware of the rules. The move, BCAS officials said, was aimed to decongest the security hold area and reduce per passenger screening time. “Among those using Kolkata airport, the awareness of what should not be carried in the bag is also poor. Often, scissors, blades, or liquid cosmetics are found in handbags. When there is labour traffic, even masonry tools are found in bags,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/airlines-told-to-enforce-one-cabin-bag-rule-to-cut-down-on-security-check-delay/articleshow/89049431.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The alert follows the recent spate of online crimes in the city, including duping of multiple professors. Using the Kolkata Police social media handles, the Port division claimed all these apps are used to remotely take control of the electronic device — be it a cellphone or a laptop — by the cyber fraudsters.“You can end up losing all your hard-earned money if you end up installing any of these apps directed by a tele caller. These apps share your mobile screen with the fraudster, enabling him to view your OTP, password, etc. Beware of such cyber frauds. Awareness is key to safety,” the tweet said. “We often encounter people asking us to send a list of apps that can lead them to be defrauded by cyber crooks. Hence, we have prepared a list of the most common apps. Our suggestion is that no app — even beyond these 10 — should be downloaded at the behest of a telecaller,” said an officer.The officers were reminded that a particular app used by the fraudsters does not even need an OTP. A simple click on the link is enough to allow access to the victims’ phones. “It is more important to be aware of the links being clicked by the user,” an officer said.The cyber cell has also spoken about the need for quick reporting, stating they have recovered the entire amount in at least three instances last week after complaints within the first three hours. The victims have been asked to approach their divisional cyber cells for quick reporting. “Often the life’s savings are gone. While the bigger crimes will be dealt by cyber cell, anti-bank fraud and anti-fraud sections of Lalbazar, our job will be to try and block the flow of money as soon as we are intimated so that we can keep the loss at a minimum. At present, the local police stations neither have the necessary training nor the time to pursue such cases,” the officer said.“On any complaint, we are able to initiate chargeback on OTP or any other financial frauds. We can stop the payment if the victim lodges a complaint within 24 hours. Our success depends on their awareness,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cyber-cell-lists-10-apps-that-you-should-never-download-on-phone/articleshow/89049432.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Anwar Shah Road turns battlefield as syndicates clash for 4 hours||Kolkata: A part of Prince Anwar Road and its surrounding neighbourhoods — the stretch between its crossing with Deshapran Sasmal Road near Tollygunge Phanri to Jogesh Chandra College — turned into a battlefield for more than four hours on Thursday night as a clash involving two syndicate groups was reported from the area. At least five persons were injured and two of them had to be hospitalised with serious head injuries. Three two-wheelers were damaged as 100 men armed with hockey sticks, sharp weapons and broken glass clashed with other. All those involved are mainly residents of the Barabagan and Khas Mahal areas.Police said both groups — the Arju-controlled syndicate and the Solomon-Alauddin syndicate — are desperate to become the sole building materials supplier for an upcoming major project close to MR Bangur Multispeciality Hospital, leading to the clash that started around 8.30pm. The immediate trigger, though, were complaints of playing loud music. Six persons have been arrested so far and two separate FIRs pertaining to attempt to murder and rioting, along with other IPC sections, have been drawn up at Charu Market and Golf Green police stations respectively. Residents of several complexes in the area said they had to rush home to ensure their vehicles were removed off the main road and bylanes and the main gates were shut as men took to the streets. A huge police force brought the situation under control. Several police pickets have been set up by the south and south suburban police divisions on Friday to keep the situation under control. According to cops, a few men attacked Sanjib Sil who was drinking tea at a stall, and this snowballed within minutes as a large number of people came out on the streets. The Golf Green and Charu Market police reached the spot and pushed back the mob inside their residences and cleared the main road for traffic. A temporary police picket was created. However, an hour later, the clash spread across the inner lanes of Barabagan and Khas Mahal areas. Additional forces from South and Jadavpur divisions tried to control the situation. “The cops did not listen to us and lathi-charged some of us even when we were inside our residences,” claimed Md Junaid, a local resident.The police said they established control over the entire area by midnight. “Along with DCP (South) Akash Magharia, I decided to keep extra forces deployed. We have picked up a few accused and are carrying out raids for more arrests,” said DC (Jadavpur) Awadhesh Pathak.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/anwar-shah-road-turns-battlefield-as-syndicates-clash-for-4-hours/articleshow/89049433.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Nearly 58% of founders now believe that listing in Indian markets is the most viable exit for their startup compared to only 30% who believed so last year, a recent survey showed. The proportion of founders who are interested in overseas listing has also come down to 13%, compared to 17% who said so last year. Innoven Capital’s India Startup Outlook report, which surveys senior executives and founders from over 100 startups, also finds that, on an overall basis, 71% of founders now consider taking their startup public as a key exit option compared to just 47% last year. “The ability of startups like Zomato and Nykaa to successfully list in India and the interest shown by domestic investors to get some exposure to startups has given confidence to founders (and investors) that they can execute an IPO in India,” Ashish Sharma, managing partner, InnoVen Capital India, told TOI. “In the past, we used to see companies flipping to the US but lately, we are seeing many late-stage companies flipping back to India, as they feel that public listing in India is a more viable and better option,” he added. The high liquidity environment has also made it easier to raise funds as 84% of founders had a “favorable fundraising experience” in 2021 compared to just 54% in 2020. Around 75% of founders believe that the fundraising environment will improve further in 2022. But, a large group of respondents (49%) also said there is a need for more companies with robust business models to drive the positive investor sentiment further. “Record fundraising by VCs/PEs and some reallocation from China to India also helped the funding environment in 2021,” Sharma said. Improving gender diversity continues to be a challenge. Only 30% of startups surveyed had more than 20% of women in leadership roles — a slight reduction from 33% the year before. The founders surveyed chose Zerodha as their most favorite Indian startup for the second year in a row, and Zomato’s Deepinder Goyal was chosen as the favorite founder.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/58-founders-feel-india-ipo-is-most-viable-exit-route-survey/articleshow/89047538.cms||TNN

This has been stressed by the chamber in a pre-budget memorandum for the year 2022-23 submitted to the union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. In the representation on behalf of the trade and industry, farming and agrofood sector, the agrofood chamber president S Rethinavelu said that this has been a long pending demand of the industry. “Unbranded essential food items such as rice, wheat and pulses are exempted from GST. But the same when branded attract 5% GST, making them expensive or forcing brands to disown the brand names with a disclaimer,” he said. The chamber president said that the government should encourage companies and traders to go for branded essential food items by exempting them under GST. “By going with the brand name the companies have the responsibility of giving quality products to the consumers and to promote the brand name. As brands disown their names with a disclaimer to avail tax exemption, there is a threat for misuse of their names by anyone,” he added. Another serious issue raised by the chamber was Circular No 10/2019 QI/17253/2019 dated May 31, 2019, on the dos and don’ts at the time of vehicle checking, survey, inspection and raids. It stated that a penalty of 200% can be levied in case of any mistake in e-way bill with effect from January 1, this year. “It is draconian and should be withdrawn immediately,” the chamber president said. Rethinavelu said that the e-way bill for transportation is generated from the GST portal based on the information such as the registration number of the goods carrier, point of origin and destination and validity of the bill based on the distance. The tax is Rs 1 lakh or much more for a truck load of the goods and levying double of it as penalty without giving the consigner to offer an explanation is unacceptable,” he added. They also sought one tax rate for all the products covered under one chapter for ease of doing business, deregulating the Cereals, Pulses and Staples from the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, abolition of cess levied on farm produce that are sold outside the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees and increasing the threshold limit for the service sector from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh for the benefit of small service providers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exempt-all-branded-essential-food-prods-under-gst/articleshow/89047593.cms||Venkat Ananth
---||Business||RIL posts 38% higher profit in Oct-Dec qtr at Rs 20,539cr||Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL), India’s largest listed company, reported a 38% rise in quarterly profit on Friday on the back of a one-off gain from the sale of its US shale business and strong performance by its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) and consumer (Jio & retail) units. Profit grew to Rs 20,539 crore in Q3FY22. It made a gain of Rs 2,872 crore from the US shale asset divestment. Revenue amounted to over Rs 1.9 lakh crore, up 54%, as business activities improved on the back of easing Covid-related movement curbs and strong festive demand. Operating profit edged up 30% to Rs 33,886 crore in the October through December months, aided by better price realisations. “Retail business activity has normalised with strong growth in key consumption baskets on the back of festive season and as lockdowns eased across the country. Our digital services business has delivered broad based and profitable growth through improved customer engagement and subscriber mix,” said RIL chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. Operating profit of digital (Jio) climbed 14% to Rs 10,230 crore due to higher data usage by subscribers and strong earnings from new services. However, average revenue per user (Arpu) — a key metric that influences income — remained flat at Rs 151 in Q3FY22. Arpu is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio has 421 million customers (as of December end, up from 411 million in Q3FY21) and saw data and voice traffic growth of 48% and 18% on its network. It increased its prepaid plans by 20% on December 1, 2021 and the “full impact of the tariff hike will be reflected in its ARPU and financials over the next few quarters”. Operating profit of the retail business rose 24% to Rs 3,835 crore as the business environment returned to normalcy after local authorities relaxed pandemic-related curbs. Grocery maintained growth momentum, while consumer electronics, apparel and footwear doubled their business on the back of strong festive sales. The retail segment does not include RIL’s petro-retailing venture. This business is housed in a joint venture with UK’s BP. The consumer business (Jio and retail) accounted for 42% of the company’s operating profit in Q3FY22. “The recovery in global oil and energy markets supported strong fuel margins and helped our O2C business deliver robust earnings,” said Ambani. Operating profit of O2C zoomed 39% to Rs 13,530 crore due to higher volumes and increase in crude oil prices. The company had combined its refining and petrochemicals units to form O2C. Operating profit of financial services declined 18% to Rs 246 crore. Oil & gas, which recently turned around with revival in KG-D6 gas production, made an operating profit of Rs 2,033 crore. While operating profit of the media unit increased 15% to Rs 373 crore. RIL’s debt at the end of Q3FY22 was Rs 2.44 lakh crore. It had about Rs 2.41 lakh crore in cash and cash equivalents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-posts-38-higher-profit-in-oct-dec-qtr-at-rs-20539cr/articleshow/89048169.cms||---

Expressing regret at the move, Bijapurkar in her letter to the bank chairman said that she has been informed of a likely conflict of interest in her being on board. This arose from her teaching market and business strategy at an educational institution and her research on India’s consumer economy at a non-profit research centre. Stating that she was associated with both these institutions, Bijapurkar said that these activities may require her to engage with other financial service companies or the investor community. The move has come as a surprise as Bijapurkar’s profile at the time of her five-year appointment in January 2019 acknowledged her role in consulting and research. The profile statement had described her as an independent management consultant working in the area of business-market strategy, and an acknowledged thought leader on ‘consumer India’ and India’s consumer economy. Her role as visiting faculty at IIM-Ahmedabad and co-founder of People Research on India’s Consumer Economy was also highlighted. She added that she has been told that this “could be in violation of the conflict of interest policy of the bank and the regulator — even in the event of no direct remuneration being earned,” she said. “In order to avoid any possible ambiguity on my position at any future date as a result of these activities, I have decided to step down,” she said. Bijapurkar added that the effective date of her resignation is January 23, 2022 and there was no other material reason for her resignation than what was mentioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ind-director-bijapurkar-quits-board-of-icici-bank/articleshow/89048249.cms||---

The company is investing Rs 300 crore in building a new factory in SIPCOT which will employ around 300 people, said CMD Sunil Chordia. “We have executed a long term lease deed with SIPCOT Industrial park and received possession of land for the greenfield expansion in Chennai. The plant will have a capacity of 60,000 tonne per annum which we are doing in a single phase,” Chordia said. The plant, he added, will start operations in 18 months and will take another two years to ramp up to peak capacity. But beyond that, the company has plans for further expansion.“We have extra land and once we reach the level of utilising 70%-80% capacity, we will plan for another 60,000 tpa line in Chennai,” he said. The company currently has three 60,000 tpa lines — in Pithampur, Thailand and now Chennai. The Chennai factory will be primarily export-oriented because of its proximity to a port. “Around 50%-60% of the production in the Chennai factory will be exported,” said Chordia. “As a plant location Pithampur is land locked so exports are tough but once our capacity in Chennai is available, we will export from both Chennai and Thailand,” he added. The company already exports to South East Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam and ‘'in small quantities to Europe,” said Chordia. “Last year we started exporting to the US, but we are hobbled by limited capacity. Once the Chennai capacity is available, we will target Europe and US as big markets,” he added. The export focus is thanks to a window of opportunity that has opened up with China. The global tyre bead wire market is one million tonne strong with China commanding 50% of it. The balance is controlled by other markets like US, Europe, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Korea. With China cutting back on export subsidies on value added steel products, India has an opportunity to increase its footprint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rajratan-global-to-make-chennai-greenfield-plant-an-export-hub/articleshow/89047584.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Gem and jewellery exports in December 2021 grew by 29% to $3,040.92 million (up 37.11% at Rs 22,915 crore), as compared to as compared to $2,348.44 million (Rs 16,712 crore) for the same period 2019 – the pre-pandemic year. Colin Shah, chairman, The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), said, “India’s performance in the crucial Christmas quarter capped a spectacular year for the gem and jewellery industry. Holiday and festive demand was robust in important trading centres such as the USA, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Israel.” Between April 2021 to December 2021, the overall gem and jewellery exports saw a 6% growth at $29,084 million or up 11.61% at Rs 2.16 lakh crore, when compared to $27,500.85 million or Rs 1.93 lakh crore for the same period in 2019. Shah also said the holiday bounce has managed to offset part of the post-Diwali export slump, when factories normally take a short break. “We have every reason to believe that this momentum will carry through the end of FY 2022, bringing us closer to the set target of $41.67 billion in exports,” he said. Cut & Polished Diamond exports in December 2021 grew by 41%, as against the same period of 2019. Gold exports in December stayed flat at $778 million. However, gold jewellery exports, which declined by 25% from April 2021 to December 2021, are yet to revive to pre-pandemic levels. Exports of plain gold jewellery for the period of April 2021 to Dec 2021 declined by 57.5% to $2830.84 million. Silver jewellery exports for the period April 2021 to December 2021 grew by 94% to $1965.51 million, as compared to the same period of 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gem-jewellery-exports-up-by-29-against-pre-pandemic-levels/articleshow/89047500.cms||TNN

This week, three independent directors at PTC India Financial Services — Kamlesh Shivji Vikamsey, Santosh B Nayar and Thomas Mathew T — had put in their papers. One of the concerns was the forensic audit related to a decade-old loan that had come up for restructuring that was not put up to the board for two years. The directors also said that they wanted the loan to be reported to the regulator as a suspected fraud. Addressing the media, Mishra described the six issues raised by the directors in their resignation letter as ‘operational issues’ and said that they appear to have been raised as an afterthought as some of the loans were very old. “If on one fine day they find the operational issues are serious issues, they should have discussed it in the meeting. This appears to be an afterthought. Without making a full inquiry, I cannot take action unilaterally,” said Mishra. “The day they resigned, I had spent almost an hour with them but they were not ready to divulge what is in their mind. The resignation letter could not have been drafted in a day,” said Mishra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ptc-india-panel-to-probe-fin-arm/articleshow/89048241.cms||Mayur Shetty

HDFC Life on Friday reported a 3% increase in Q3 net profit to Rs 273 crore, up from Rs 265 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. SBI Life Insurance reported a 56% rise in net profit at Rs 364 crore for the third quarter ended December, up from Rs 233 crore in the year-ago period. Both companies saw a decline in total income. HDFC Life’s total income declined to Rs 14,222 crore in the latest December quarter from Rs 21,127 crore in October-December 2020, and SBI Life’s total income declined to Rs 20,458 crore from Rs 26,552 crore across the same periods. Addressing newspersons, HDFC Life MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar said that Exide Life Insurance has become a fully owned subsidiary, effective January 1, 2022, and the consolidation was likely to be completed by the end of FY23. HDFC Life, which had seen a spike in mortality claims at the end of the second quarter due to a rise in Covid cases, has seen a drop in claims as the second wave ebbed. It had seen Covid-related death claims of Rs 155 crore in the first quarter, which nearly doubled to Rs 307 crore in the second quarter, but fell sharply to Rs 17 crore in the third quarter. According to Padalkar, prices of term insurance had gone up by 10-20%. “As we grow, and grow beyond metros and the salaried profile, we are hoping that we are allowed to get more nuanced in pricing,” she said. The company has doubled its retention limit to Rs 40 lakh from Rs 20 lakh earlier by reducing the risk that it passes to reinsurance companies as part of its efforts to increase capacity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-hdfc-life-cos-see-higher-profits-for-q3/articleshow/89048269.cms||Mayur Shetty

Dolo 650 is having its moment under the sun on social media with funny and frivolous memes capturing the desperation of the Covid-infected to keep fever and body ache away. Over the last few weeks, with the Omicron wave gaining a stronghold, social media platforms like Twitter and WhatsApp have been abuzz with wild memes and posts on the pain-relief pill Dolo 650. As a result, the market share of the pill — sold by Bangalore-based Micro Labs — sky-rocketed in December (see graphic), and is showing a spike this month too. Dolo 650 has 650mg of paracetamol, which is an antipyretic (for fever) and analgesic (for pain relief). Estimates suggest that over 80 memes are in circulation, giving rise to concerns about the indirect promotion of prescription medicines, their irrational use and inappropriate self-medication. More importantly, industry experts point out that the promotion and advertisement of medicines is in violation of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, and should not be allowed to go unchecked. Since paracetamol is a scheduled drug, it cannot be advertised and promoted under the Act for fever. “Any backdoor advertising or promotion for a medicine should not be allowed. This is leading to rampant misuse and non-judicious use of paracetamol, which can cause harm to patients. Many patients are self-medicating without even a proper diagnosis — this may even lead to serious side-effects,” Indian Medical Association’s general secretary Dr Jayesh Lele told TOI. Overall, the pain-relief medication market — which is made up of pills (500mg & 650mg dosage strength), syrups and IV injections — is now valued around Rs 100 crore monthly, jumping nearly 4X since the pandemic started two years ago. Dolo 650, the flagship Rs 350-crore brand of Micro Labs, has grown 40-50% and corners over half the share in the 650mg market. “Dolo 650 is a meme. Not a medicine. At least on social media. To an extent, Dolo has become a four-letter word brand of great utility and ubiquity for many during the pandemic. This, in turn, has led to a Dolo 650-in-every-house kind of movement. For an OTC (over-the-counter), or for that matter prescription drug, this is a super-brand status. When a product becomes a super-brand, creators create memes — make fun of it even. In the bargain, the brand becomes larger than life,” brand strategy expert Harish Bijoor said. Micro Labs, the media-shy company, was taken by surprise with the social media limelight that it suddenly faced. Executive VP (marketing) Jayaraj Govindaraju said, “We have been taken by surprise. We have been promoting it to the doctors as per law, and there are statutory warnings on the pack.” Dolo, the company’s 30-year-old flagship brand, witnessed a robust growth of 30% even before the pandemic, and has always been a market leader. In fact, every brand has picked up during the last few months, he added. Besides Dolo, the market has been largely dominated by GlaxoSmithKline’s legacy brands Calpol (of GSK Pharma), and Crocin (by GSK Consumer Healthcare), which is available over the counter. A GSK Pharma spokesperson said, “As a responsible pharmaceutical company, we promote our prescription products only to healthcare practitioners, including education for retail pharmacies in keeping with the applicable drug law in the country. We do not advertise or promote any of our prescription brands in the media/social media.” Social media has spurred Dolo on, certain experts feel. The message that Dolo will cure everything is erroneous. While paracetamol is known to be a well-tolerated drug when taken within the prescribed dose range, overdosage may be associated with severe liver and pancreatic injury, they add. There is a grey area within the law which sometimes companies/ marketers exploit, an industry expert said. In the past, some pharma companies promoted nutritional supplements, riding on the Ayurvedic bandwagon. “In many ways, there is no regulation or regulator to stop it all. Here is the ultimate democracy of social media at play,” Bijoor sums up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/memes-spur-dolo-sales-raise-legal-concerns-experts-warn-of-overuse/articleshow/89048077.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The school education department has recently released the timetable for the pre-board examination of classes 10 and 12 for the academic session 2021-22.Class 10 pre-board exam is scheduled to be organised from January 20 Jan to 28 while for Class 12 they will be from January 20 to 31. Both exams will be on the 'take home' concept. Following Covid guideline, question papers and answer sheets will be made available to all the students at least a day before the exam. To ensure that the students do not have to call the school multiple times, 2 -3 question papers can be made available simultaneously and on the day of receipt of the next question paper, the answer books of the previously provided question papers will be submitted. Parents said that instead of calling students to the school it would have been better if the department had opted for online exams. “By calling students to the school the entire purpose of keeping schools closed has been defeated. If online classes are possible then the online exams are also possible. Students should not have been asked to come to school to collect answer sheets and question papers,” said a parent, Vimal Shukla. Students of class 10 will have to submit all the remaining answer books on January 28 and all remaining answer books for class 12 by February 1,in school. Subject teachers will evaluate the answer sheets and inform them by February 5 to rectify the mistakes. They will be called to the school at different times to provide class-wise faculty wise question papers and answer sheets. In any adverse situation, in addition to the students, question papers and answer sheets can also be provided to the parents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/parents-object-to-students-being-called-to-get-pre-board-papers/articleshow/89049473.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal deaths show delay can turn fatal, warn experts||Bhopal: Do not take Omicron or this wave lightly. A delay in seeking medical attention, especially for patients with comorbidities can be fatal, warns Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari.Over 11,000 Covid infections have been detected in January in Bhopal, and there have been two deaths attributed to the pandemic.The first was a former railway employee, who was brought to hospital late, say doctors. He was in cardiac arrest when brought to railway hospital. The 62-year-old, a Govindpura resident, was rushed to hospital after he complained of chest pain and difficulty in breathing. His Covid test came positive after his death.Health officials say he was taken to hospital around three days after he started showing worrying symptoms. “With timely medical attention, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is preventable and treatable,” said Dr Tiwari.There have been two other deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19 but these were not classified as Covid deaths by the respective hospitals. One of them was a Hoshangabad resident, who died in Bhopal. Two other deaths took place in Hamidia hospital. Some experts warn that getting tested for Covid-19 should be a priority for those with comorbid conditions, especially since the symptoms identified with Covid in the first and second waves — respiratory distress, cough and progressive breathlessness — are not always seen with the new Omicron variant.There have been far fewer deaths when compared to the second wave, but even one death is one too many — especially those that could be prevented if the patient is tested and brought to hospital earlier. On January 1, Bhopal had 10 Covid-19 patients who needed intensive-care hospitalization. On that day 27-new cases of the infection were diagnosed — reported as the highest single day spike in cases since June 2021.Seventeen days later, the state capital has 226 patients in hospital, 78 of whom need oxygen support and 32 in critical care.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bhopal-deaths-show-delay-can-turn-fatal-warn-experts/articleshow/89049477.cms||Jamal Ayub

People carry masks but don't wear them or don't wear them properly. And, since petrol pumps also refuse to give fuel to people not wearing masks, they resort to similar tactics as they used to do when helmets were made compulsory for two-wheeler riders to get fuel. Sample this: A person on his scooter at a petrol pump in Shivaji Nagar. The vendor refused to dispense with fuel as he was not wearing a mask. He pleads with him to get petrol but when he insists he can't do it because there are CCTV cameras and the administration won't take it kindly if he is seen giving petrol to him, he turns to other people queued up to get fuel, asking them to help him. As he seeks help from other people, he also tells them how he forgot to wear a mask in haste. He asked the person next to him in the queue to park his bike aside and carry his scooter to the vendor and since he is wearing a mask, he won't be refused fuel by the vendor. The scene very much reminded of the days when petrol pumps were asked not to fuel two-wheelers if the riders were not wearing a helmet. Those without helmets would ask for helmets from others in the queue to get the fuel. Since masks can't be exchanged, people without masks coming to petrol pumps are requesting masked people in the queue to take their vehicle and get it refuelled. Another person in the queue rightly said, "You may soon see some vendors selling masks sitting outside or near petrol pumps also if the rule not to give fuel to people without masks stretches for some more time." Since, checking for the masks has intensified after the cases of Corona started spiraling in the city, people are again keeping masks in their pocket but not wearing it and putting it on sighting the team imposing spot fine on people for not wearing masks. A youngster standing in a shop coughing at Ravishankar market at five no. stop was asked by the shopkeeper to put on a mask and he did take out the mask from his pocket but went without buying anything, perhaps not liking the way he was asked by the shopkeeper to wear a mask.This despite the fact that a notice in the shop clearly said "Mask ke bagair saman nahin diya jayega" (Goods won't be sold to people not wearing masks.)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/masks-still-missing-in-3rd-wave-as-cases-rise/articleshow/89049478.cms||---

Active Covid-19 cases have shot up from 497 on January 1 to more than 55,000 on January 21, in the state. Doctors say that the largest portion of infection reported in the current wave is of those people who have not been infected in first or second wave, but still there are considerable cases of re-infection too. “Around 70% cases are of those who are getting infected for the first time, remaining cases are of re-infection, but there are considerable number of cases of re-infection,” Dr Lokendra Dave, head of pulmonary medicine department at Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, told TOI. “But there is a difference in severity, the patients who are re-infected and are vaccinated, normally have mild symptoms, compared to non-infected, non-vaccinated and also co-morbid patients”, he said. “For example as of now there are 19 patients who are admitted at the Hamidia hospital, of these 11 are somewhat serious, and 7 of these 11 are non-vaccinated and 4 are co-morbid. Remaining 8 patients, are hospitalized due to other ailments and not due to Covid-19,” he said. Similar sentiments were expressed by other doctors too. “The proportion to new cases and cases of re-infection could roughly be 75:20. Large number of cases are of those people who are getting infected for the first time. Probably as these people managed to remain uninfected in first two waves and had let their guards down this time. However, in routine course also majority of the footfall of patients is related to cold and flu,” Dr Neeraj Chhari, associate professor, preventive medicine department, Peoples Medical College and hospital said. “When it comes to severity, in vaccinated and re-infected patients, it is mild compared to unvaccinated people”, he added. When contacted over the same issue, chief medical and health officer, Bhopal, Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said, “We are treating every patient as a fresh case of infection, there is no such data, and it is not possible to tell exact proportion in absence of figures.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/70-cases-in-third-wave-are-first-time-infections/articleshow/89049484.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Schools are closed till January 31. The school education department is also mulling on changing the dates of the board exams. After declaring that the schools will remain closed till January 31 the biggest concern was as to how long the campuses were to be closed. Senior officials of the school education department told TOI that the state government does not want to make any decision in haste. “As the exams were around there was no meaning of calling students in the schools. This is the reason the state government is not willing to open offline classes of schools after January 31. Even the board exams which are scheduled to be organised from January 18 will also get postponed,” said the official without quoting his name. Parents said that they are even ready to skip the exams of their wards if the present situation persists for longtime. “I can’t take any chances with my daughter. Exams can’t be more important than her life. I will send my daughter for exams if the situation continues in February also,” said Akshay Rajput, father of a class 10 student.

The project ‘Skyon’ on golf course extension road in Gurugram was delayed by years and when the flat buyers, each of whom had invested in excess of Rs 2 crore, demanded refund, IREO Pvt Ltd threatened to deduct 20% of their invested money. They moved consumer court and were granted refund of the principal money with interest of 10.5% as provided under Haryana RERA. IREO through Ankur Sehgal appealed against the decision of the NCDRC before the SC. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Bela M Trivedi asked the builder's counsel whether the promised golf course view was available to the flat owners. Sehgal said that there is a green belt provided by the builder but there was no golf course. The bench said, “You (builder) sell a dream to the home buyers but do not provide the promised amenities. When the promised amenities are not provided, they are entitled to a refund of their investments with interest.” The two complainants, Aloke Anand and Nitin Juneja, through their counsel detailed a long list of breach of promises, which were made in the brochure by the builder. The SC agreed that such deviations entitled the flat buyers to demand refund and upheld the NCDRC order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/builders-cannot-sell-dream-and-not-fulfil-it-apex-court/articleshow/89048210.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Min’s clarification contradicts previous LDF govt’s decision||Thiruvananthapuram: The statement made by revenue minister K Rajan on Thursday in connection with the cancellation of Raveendran pattayams that no land owner will lose their land and all of them can apply fresh for new titles is in contradiction to the decision taken during the tenure of the previous LDF government in 2019 regarding the cancellation of these land titles.As per the minutes of the meeting convened by the then revenue minister E Chandrasekharan on June 17, 2019, it was decided that the titles that were issued when M I Raveendran was deputy tahsildar in Devikulam, should be examined for their eligibility on a case by case basis, and those which are found ineligible should be cancelled. Those cases which are found eligible, should be issued fresh titles. A special team should be constituted for the purpose, and the task should be completed in three months.After a detailed examination, the five-member special team had reported the government about the fake titles and recommended that these titles be cancelled. On the basis of the recommendation of the committee, the additional chief secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak issued orders on Tuesday cancelling the titles as per the rule 8 (3) of land assignment rules, 1964 and the rules 21 (1) and 21 (4) of Kanan Devan Hill (reservation and assignment of vested lands), rules, 1977. However, revenue minister Rajan said on Thursday that no one will be evicted due to cancellation of these titles, and the cancellation of these titles are being undertaken because of the procedural irregularities. He said that all of them can apply for fresh titles and will be issued within two months. Rajan’s clarification came after the district leaderships of CPM and CPI severely criticised the government decision to cancel the titles.While CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan made it clear that no one will be evicted, former power minister M M Mani went a step ahead and stated that no one will be allowed to touch the CPM office situated in the land with the title issued by Raveendran. The CPI leadership from Idukki also criticised the decision. The reaction from these leaders even before examining the merit of each of the titles and ensuring whether they are eligible for the titles has put the revenue department in a fix, following which the revenue minister came with a clarification, visibly on a fire-fighting mode. Interestingly, four titles were earlier cancelled by the then devikulam sub-collector Renu Raj, after they were found have violated all the eligibility criteria, and not just because of the procedural irregularities as is being claimed by Rajan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mins-clarification-contradicts-previous-ldf-govts-decision/articleshow/89049504.cms||---

Not being an isolated corner, Kerala too witnesses a surge in Covid cases. State government has already taken steps to fight this emergency on a war footing. Government moves the administrative system effectively based on daily evaluation of ground situations. Local bodies are also coming out with more support. When the state faces an emergency like the pandemic, democratic organizations and humanitarian outfits should swing into action with an increased vigour. Like in the case of the first and second wave of the pandemic, CPM workers, sympathizers and public organizations should intervene in the third wave in an exemplary way,” said Balakrishnan, in a statement.Kodiyeri urged the public to be more vigilant against the virus and asked them to follow the instructions of the government and health department and urged them not to slack off. “It’s dangerous to develop a casual attitude under the impression that Omicron is a comparatively less-virulent variant. Delta and Omicron variants are simultaneously spreading,” he said.Balakrishnan said Kerala has been successful in carrying out the vaccination drive in an exemplary manner. The state has become a model by setting up vaccine centres in schools. “Even though Kerala has taken all precautions, Covid spread is severe. People from all walks of life should support the efforts of the state government and local bodies against the pandemic,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/guard-against-covid-step-up-relief-work-kodiyeri/articleshow/89049507.cms||---

Going by government data itself, Gujarat is faced with a 99% shortfall in super specialist doctors like surgeons, paediatricians, obstetricians-gynaecologists and the like. This deficit of specialist doctors is the highest among all major states of the country. If Gujarat was compared to all states, it is ranked second from bottom with only Mizoram faring worse than Gujarat. According to data released in the Handbook of Statistics of India States (2020-2021) by the Reserve Bank of India, Gujarat has a requirement of 1,392 super specialists, and its shortfall is 99% at 1,379. Among all states, only Mizoram fares worse with a 100% shortfall against the requirement of 36 super specialists. All other states fare better than Gujarat in terms of the deficit of super specialists in government healthcare systems. Maharashtra (64%), Madhya Pradesh (96%), Rajasthan (80%), Bihar (46%), Uttar Pradesh (71%) West Bengal (54%) and several other states have a lesser percentage of deficit of super specialists as compared to Gujarat. The data reveals that against the required 1,392 surgeons, physicians, paediatricians and obstetrician-gynaecologists, Gujarat has only sanctioned 268 posts and of these there are only 13 posts that are filled. However, when it comes to appointing doctors in primary health centres, the state has sanctioned 1,869 posts of which 1,490 are filled. The state has a shortage of 379 doctors in PHCs against the sanction posts. A senior health officer said that the state government has on the floor of the state assembly announced that they are not getting any super specialist doctors. He said that the former health minister Nitin Patel had made it clear that not many were willing to join the government sector and were not willing to serve in rural areas. The officer said that it is also a fact that lack of adequate remuneration is also a factor for doctors and super specialists not opting to work in the government sector. Another officer said that it has also been observed that two or three super speciality doctors join hands and open their own hospital which turns out to be more beneficial. The government has also started recruiting super specialists on a part-time basis, but despite this it has failed to attract much talent. A superintendent of a civil hospital in Saurashtra said, "In the absence of such super specialists, especially gynaecologists, the hospital has a committee which empowers the hospital to acquire the services of the specialists by paying a fixed amount. Such a committee,known as Rogi Kalyan Samiti, is headed by the respective collectors and hence in a majority of the district hospitals, such practice is widespread as no doctor is willing to join full time." Moreover these super specialist doctors prefer to stay more in urban cities than the rural areas away from the district headquarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-stares-at-99-shortage-of-super-specialists-in-govt-hosps/articleshow/89049408.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

This has forced many bank branches to shut operations for up to five days. In the wake of repeated branch closures amidst the third wave and hampering of banking operations, MGBEA has urged the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC)-Gujarat to reduce banking hours from 10am to 1pm. A representation was made before MM Bansal, convener, SLBC-Gujarat on Friday. Isolated branches which were shut include those of Federal Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, UCO Bank, Union Bank and Central Bank among others. Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA, said, “At least 900 bank employees have been affected by Covid-19. In bank branches where more people tend to test positive, branches are compelled to shut for two to five days and after due protocol-compliance and sanitization, the premises are reopened. This also affects the banking operations.” Bankers have requested that banks be limited to fiveday week operations till the Covid-19 cases recede. “We have made a representation before SLBC, asking them to limit the services to reduce crowding at bank branches. Employees should be allowed to go home after business hours. The purpose is to reduce the exposure of the staff to the public,” said Rawal. The representation also mentions that the banks should be advised to work with reduced staff strength which will be helpful to the employees and the bank in implementing business continuity plan. “We request you to advise banks to close the branch for 48 hours if any employee is found to be infected. Pregnant women employees and those with disabilities must be exempted from attending bank duty in the wake of the rapid spike in cases of coronavirus infections,” it mentions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/900-bank-employees-in-guj-test-positive/articleshow/89049515.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: AIFs are now making a beeline for GIFT IFSC||AHMEDABAD: An ecosystem for funds in India’s maiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) is taking shape with more than 20 Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) now registered with the IFSC Authority, the unified regulator for IFSCs in India. These 20 AIFs are looking to manage funds of Rs 40,000 crore at GIFT City in Gandhinagar which would have otherwise landed up at international finance centres in Singapore or Mauritius, said an official close to the development. Another 25-30 such proposals for AIFs are waiting for clearance from the IFSC regulator, according to the official. “In less than two years from the time the IFSC regulator was established, about 45 funds have come calling to GIFT City,” he further said. The latest to get IFSC approval is Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited (ABSLAMC) which was granted approval by IFSCA on January 20 to carry out Portfolio Management Services through a branch office in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in India. ABSLAMC’s move to set up new unit at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) is a strategic step towards growth of its international business to expand its reach and service global clients, including NRIs for investing in India, the company said in an announcement. “This is a significant development considering, Aditya Birla would carry out these operations from IFSC instead of Singapore. The government of India’s objective of onshoring the offshore through IFSC is gaining substantial momentum with the establishment of IFSCA as the unified financial regulator," said an industry expert aware of the development. ABSLAMC is the fourth largest asset manager in the country with presence in over 280 locations pan-India and already has a presence in international markets such as Dubai, Singapore and Mauritius. “We are seeing great momentum for setting up AIFs in IFSC, the fund eco-system at IFSC now covers AIFs, fund managers, PMS, IAs and Fund administrators. Enabling regulatory framework, competitive tax regime and low cost of operations are attracting global fund structures at GIFT IFSC” said Dipesh Shah, Executive Director (Development) at International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). The 20-odd AIFs that would handle about Rs 40,000 crore include Avendus Group, ASK Asset and Wealth Management, among others. In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced AIF Regulations with an intention to regulate unregistered pooling vehicles. It aimed to avoid regulatory gaps and to have a level playing field for all types of funds in India. An AIF is a privately pooled investment vehicle which collects funds from investors (whether Indian or foreign) for investing it in accordance with a defined investment policy. It plays a vital role in India's fund regime and provides long-term and high-risk capital to a wide variety of ventures at all stages of their evolution, creating stability and entrepreneurial capability. There are more than 500 AIFs registered with the SEBI. Apart from AIFs, the existing funds ecosystem at GIFT IFSC comprises of 25 fund managers, 6-7 portfolio management services (PMS) and 4-5 investment advisors that are registered the IFSCA, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/aifs-are-now-making-a-beeline-for-gift-ifsc/articleshow/89049462.cms||Maulik Pathak

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Post 1947, growth benefited only few, says PM Narendra Modi||AHMEDABAD: In a veiled attack on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that post-Independence, new construction took place only for a “few families from Delhi”, but his government brought the country out of this “narrow” mindset and is building new monuments of national importance while adding glory to the existing ones. Without naming anybody, PM’s remarks were apparently aimed at the Nehru-Gandhi family. He was speaking after virtually inaugurating a newly-built circuit house near the famous Somnath temple in Gir Somnath district of Gujarat, where he also said that development of religious and cultural centres give a boost to the local economy. He added that cleanliness, creation of facilities, ensuring that tourists' time is saved and having a modern mindset are four things that are required for tourism development. “Our ancestors have left many things (in the form of religious and cultural heritage) for us, but there was hesitation in talking about our rich religious and cultural heritage,” Modi, who is also the chairman of the Somnath Temple Trust, said. “After Independence, new construction took place for a few families from Delhi. We have brought the country out of this narrow thinking. We are building new national monuments and adding glory to the existing ones,” Modi said. “It is our government that built the memorial of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar in Delhi. We built APJ Abdul Kalam's memorial in Rameshwaram. In the same manner, the places associated with Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Shyamji Krishna Verma were made more glorious by our government. We are also building museums to highlight the rich heritage of our tribal population,” Modi said, adding that such memorials will not only help in the growth of tourism, but also make us bond with our identity. Speaking about the Somnath temple, Modi said that after he became the member of its trust, he has seen many initiatives being taken up for the development of the town, and the new circuit house is one of them. “The history of Somnath temple is a big message for us and everybody should study the way how despite being destroyed several times it came up again every time, as well as how under Sardar Patel (country's first home minister) it was reconstructed,” the prime minister said. Referring to his government's move of developing the religious and cultural centers, Modi said that development of such places would give a boost to the economy of the areas they are located in. He said that he was surprised to know the kind of revenue some countries earn through tourism. “For development of tourism, we require four things. Cleanliness is the first and essential thing, which has been taken care of by the Swachh Bharat Mission. Facilities at tourist sites are very important to attract a large number of footfalls. Tourists want to visit many places in a short time, so not to waste their time and hence providing better connectivity is also important,” Modi said. The fourth thing is that we should improve our mindset and make it innovative and modern to attract tourists, he added. “Although we have to be modern, we should not forget our heritage as well as roots, and showcase them properly to the world,” Modi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/post-1947-growth-benefited-only-few/articleshow/89049518.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Industrial units in Gujarat vow to go green||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday expressed its displeasure with the industries for ignoring the directions issued by it in 1995 to curb industrial pollution in the city. “What did you do after the 1995 judgment? What steps did you take in twenty-six years?” the judges questioned. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati was hearing the suo motu PIL on Sabarmati river pollution involving the improper treatment of sewage water by the AMC-run sewage treatment plants (STPs). The problem also relates to the release of improperly treated wastewater into the river. The high court has ordered the AMC and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to act strictly against the industrial units that illegally discharge trade effluents into the sewer network, damaging the STPs. The snapping of drainage connections of over 400 units including a few major textile units, and their closure resulted in their lawyers pushing for permission for temporary and immediate resumption of production. The lawyers cited financial concerns. Besides the textile units, a huge number of screen printers from the Danilimda-Behrampura area also raised concerns over stalled production and requested the court to permit them to resume work. The screen printers submitted that they have been commissioning their own Common Effluent Treatment Plant and that their drainage network is used by local residents to discharge domestic wastewater. All the lawyers insisted on permission to resume production on the basis of their ETPs (effluent treatment plants) functioning at their optimal capacity and on the promise to abide by all the green norms. “When nothing could be achieved in last 26 years, you expect us to believe that everything will be all right in twelve months and we should allow you to work?” the court said. In 1994-95, the HC had issued a slew of directions to mitigate pollution in the city. The judges further commented, “All of you people are desperate. We can see the desperation, but the situation is very desperate.” The Joint Task Force could not finish its report on the condition of ETPs of textile units. The Ahmedabad MEGA Clean Association, which manages a 27km pipeline carrying treated trade effluents to the river, has promised to complete its report on illegal connections and the possibility of accommodating the litigant textile units in a week. So the high court posted further hearing on January 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/industrial-units-vow-to-go-green/articleshow/89049519.cms||---

The NHSRCL is executing the high-speed rail corridor for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train. The agreement was signed on Friday with IRCON International. The ballast-less slab track system of the Japanese bullet train, Shinkansen, will be used for India’s first high-speed rail project. Japan Railway Track Consultant (JRTC) has provided the detailed design and drawings of major high-speed rail track components such as RC track bed, track slab arrangement, and continuous welded rail. Satish Agnihotri, the managing director of the NHSRCL, said: “We have received support from our Japanese partners in a very effective manner.” He added: “I appreciate the technical support extended by JICC, JARTS, and JRTC for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project.” Minister of economy and development, the embassy of Japan in India, Miyamoto Shingo, said on the occasion: “Under this agreement, Indian contractors will receive the transfer of Japanese Shinkansen technology which will give a big boost to the Make in India initiative.” The new contract for the tracks is a giant step for the project. The contract for the construction of the elevated corridor and bridges and stations has already been awarded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/agreement-with-ircon-giant-leap-for-bullet-train-project/articleshow/89049520.cms||---

The department also filed an affidavit and described in detail how it has created a team of officials to immediately address the problem that an assessee was facing. The petitions were filed after the assessees and tax practitioners faced technical glitches in filing TAR and ITR on the new I-T portal. Two senior officials of CBDT assured the HC of problem resolution and said that a mechanism had been set up to help assessees file their TAR and ITR. The department also informed the high court that an email ID has been created for assessees facing problems in uploading TAR. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore suggested the department could create one more e-mail address for those who find difficulty in filing ITR. This suggestion was immediately accepted by the officers. One grievance the petitioners had raised was that the department is to levy interest under section 234A of IT Act for delay in filing. The court has kept this issue open for adjudication because the deadline for filing TAR and ITR was already extended by the CBDT by one month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cbdt-assures-hc-of-quick-redressal-of-itr-plaints/articleshow/89049521.cms||---

In response to a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal demanding shifting of coal-based industries to gas, the HC had on December 17 asked the state government if its decision to accept coal as an approved fuel can be revoked. In response, the state’s energy and petrochemical department filed an affidavit explaining how generation of electricity through coal and lignite is cheaper than gas. Moreover, the department provided details that in its total installed capacity of 33,496 MW, nearly 40.1% units are generated by using coal and 4.18% units by using lignite. Thus, 45% of units are generated by using thermal energy in the state. The Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd’s purchase of power from state-based plants using coal is 65.4% of its total purchase. Gas-based power generation has 13.8% contribution. The department further said that the Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd (GSECL) bears power generating cost per unit at Rs 3.51 to Rs 4.30 by using local coal, Rs 4.58 by using imported coal, and Rs 2.95 to Rs3.70 by using lignite. But generating a unit costs between Rs 21.37 to Rs 22.54 when gas is used. After supplying all details, the department said, “It is amply clear that the total cost of generating power through usage of coal and lignite is very less as compared to generation of power by using gas and other means…Therefore, the cost of production will be increased substantially if the industries are compelled to shift to alternative sources of energy for carrying out manufacturing activity. They said that additional cost of production will ultimately be shifted upon the consumers and will directly lead to increase in inflation. Usage of gas for energy generation has its own challenges. In Gujarat, gas is not available in sufficient quantity at affordable cost.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/shifting-from-coal-to-gas-will-lead-to-inflation-govt/articleshow/89049522.cms||---

The complaint was filed at the women’s police station (west) on Thursday. The woman, 30, told police that the CG Road man had befriended her when she worked with him briefly in 2018. She said that he took her to his office on CG Road in August 2018 and raped her. She said that he recorded a video of the sexual assault. She told the cops that he later raped her at different locations on CG Road, Memnagar, and Paldi. A crime branch officer said that the man used the video to blackmail the woman into submission. The officer said that one of the places where the man raped the woman was a hotel in Thaltej. The officer said that the man had shot another video at the hotel and used that to augment his pressure on her to have sex with him. The woman did not want any kind of relationship with the man, the officer said. But the man continued to threaten and blackmail her, the officer added. The woman had approached the city crime branch about two months ago with an application to lodge a complaint. The city crime branch called the man to record his statement. He denied all charges and said he considered the woman only a friend. After the preliminary investigation substantiated the rape accusations, the city crime branch on Thursday caught the man and handed him over to women’s police (west).

Speaking to the media on Friday, state Congress president Jagdish Thakor said the government has begun to provide monetary compensation for Covid victims only after a rap from the Supreme Court.“The central and the state governments have adopted a very casual approach towards the pandemic from the beginning. At a time when the death toll was in lakhs, the Gujarat government stuck to the figure of about 10,000 deaths. When Congress said that 3 lakh people had died of Covid in Gujarat, the government denied this outright. It was only after a rap from the Supreme Court that the government sanctioned compensation for over 58,000 victims,” Thakor said.“The Congress demands to know why about 5,000 applications for compensation were rejected by the state government? Also,why are over 15,000 applications still pending. Instead of supporting families who have lost their dear ones, the government is delaying paying compensation,” Thakor said.

The phenomenon continued till late morning before dissipating with the rise in temperature. It caused traffic delays in some areas, said sources.Manorama Mohanty, head of the India Meteorological Department Gujarat, said that the phenomenon was due to the high concentration of moisture with low temperature. “It was also experienced in other parts of the state including Gandhinagar and Kutch. It may continue on Saturday,” she said. She added that on Saturday, some parts of city may experience light showers due to the impact of western disturbance. The city recorded continuous rise in minimum temperature — it rose from 14.1 °C on Wednesday to 16.8°C on Friday. According to IMD bulletin, it was 4.6 degrees higher than the normal. On the other hand, the maximum temperature remained stable at 29.1°C. On Saturday, the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 17°C.

Against the number, many of the city-based private path labs are reporting the TPR of 50%, said sources. It’s among the highest TPR for the city which had recorded TPR of 45-50% during the second wave. Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, a city-based pathologist, said that every timely test would prevent the spread of the epidemic. “Need of the hour is to ensure that all our resources are used optimally. Another issue that has come to fore is of testing in green zones with low cases. While it may reduce the overall TPR, it would not help reducing the pendency,” he said. Dr Kamlesh Patel, head of Sterling Accuris Diagnostics, said that compared to the second wave, the severity of the cases is less. “We are witnessing about 20% more daily tests being done compared to the peak of the second wave,” he said. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health & family welfare), said that testing is going to be increased further in cities like Ahmedabad with high case load. “The testing hours by the government has been increased. We are also tying up with the private labs to improve the delivery time,” he said. He said that they are aware of the over-the-counter usage of RAT kits to detect Covid. “It’s a common practice across the globe, and there is nothing wrong in its usage. But if it’s used only to evade the government rules, it’s wrong. We would take steps if the protocols are not followed,” said Aggarwal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/test-positivity-rate-as-high-as-50-in-many-private-path-labs/articleshow/89049531.cms||Parth Shastri

Curfew will be in force from 10pm to 6am in all these places. The new restrictions will come into force from Saturday and will stay until January 29. While night curfew has already been enforced in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Surat, Gandhinagar, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Anand and Nadiad, towns like Surendranagar, Dhrangadhra, Morbi, Wankaner, Dhoraji, Gondal, Jetpur, Kalawad, Godhra, Vejalpore, Navsari, Billimora, Vyara, Vapi, Valsad, Bharuch and Ankleshwar have been added to the list. The test positivity rate in these 17 towns has shown a steep rise. The decision was made by the core committee that met on Friday. A few days ago, the government reduced the number of people who can attend marriages and social, educational, political, and religious functions from 400 to 150. Ahmedabad restaurateur Rushabh Purohit welcomed the core committee’s decision to allow home delivery of food items round the clock, but added that the government needs to frame guidelines of rules for movement of delivery personnel and restaurant staff, as night curfew comes into force from 10pm. “The government needs to frame guidelines which will allow free movement of deliver personnel and restaurant staff who are engaged in providing home delivery services,” Purohit said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tpr-steep-17-more-towns-under-night-curfew-till-jan-29/articleshow/89049534.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Now, domestic fliers can carry only one handbag||Ahmedabad: Domestic fliers will now have to rework their travel checklist to pack light. According to the latest circular issued by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), domestic passengers will be allowed to carry only one hand baggage. The ‘one handbag rule’ has been imposed across airports. The decision has been taken with a view to ease out congestion and other security concerns on ground and reduce burden at the airport screening points. In a communication to the BCAS on January19, a senior CISF official wrote, “As per BCAS ‘AVSEC’ circular, no passenger should be permitted to carry more than one handbag other than those items already listed in the circular including a lady’s bag.” “However, it has been seen that the passengers, on an average, carry two to three handbags till the screening point. This has led to increased clearance time as well as delays and congestion,” the letter mentioned. Sources at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad confirmed that all airlines have been instructed to take necessary steps to enforce the ‘one handbag’ rule to ease congestion. Sources also said that airlines have been asked to depute staff to guide passengers as and when necessary and verify their hand baggage status. Frequent travellers have welcomed the move stating it will ease swifter movement through the security checkpoints, but some are confused too. “I usually carry a laptop bag and an overnighter trolley bag when on business trips. It is convenient to web check-in and head straight to the security checkpoint. I prefer not having check-in luggage as I have to travel to Delhi every now and then and the queue at the baggage belt is very long. However, I am wondering how it will pan out with the new rules,” said Shantanu D, a professional. Airlines have been directed to display the ‘one handbag’ rule on their tickets as well as boarding passes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/now-domestic-fliers-can-carry-only-one-handbag/articleshow/89049535.cms||---

However, they claim that the benefit of the decision can only be availed of after government announces proper guidelines to allow movement of restaurant staffers and delivery personnel. “The decision will certainly help boost 15-20% of our business with deliveries being permitted round the clock. We will make a representation before the DGP office urging them to exempt movement of restaurant and hotel staffers carrying proper IDs during curfew hours,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA) Gujarat. Dine-ins account for roughly 85% of the revenues for restaurant owners. Therefore, with restriction on public movement from 10pm onwards, the restaurant business is bound to suffer. However, resident doctors or students taking online courses abroad tend to be up till late night and order in food. “This was our major customer segment and allowing delivery of food round the clock will certainly add on to our revenues,” said Meet Lakhani, a city-based restaurateur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/nod-for-24-hr-food-delivery-welcome/articleshow/89049536.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP and BJP urge LG to reconsider decision||New Delhi: Hours after lieutenant governor Anil Baijal rejected Delhi government’s proposal to lift the weekend curfew and relax the odd-even shop opening norm, the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP engaged in a blame game over the decision. Addressing a press conference, AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that it was unfortunate that the LG had rejected the demand of traders and business community to lift the Covid restrictions despite infection cases reducing at a very fast pace. “It is clear that BJP wants to destroy every single business running in Delhi,” Bharadwaj alleged. “How can BJP justify shutting shops in Delhi when shops in BJP-ruled cities like Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon are up and running?” Bharadwaj added that with just 2-3 days of opening of shops in a week due to the odd-even system, the shopkeepers were facing a lot of hardships. The wages of the poor people working in these shops had also been cut due to the decline in sales, affecting their already precarious condition, he said. Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, requested the LG to reconsider the decision to continue the weekend curfew in Delhi and allow the shops in the markets to operate on all days. “It is necessary to give relief to the business class after cases of corona infection have come down,” said Bidhuri. “The proposal of Delhi government should be approved with the condition that it will ensure strict implementation of Covid rules in the markets.” The BJP MLA said that the decision to implement the odd-even scheme in the markets was a big impediment for the business class. He added that with continuous reduction in the cases of Covid, even the weekend curfew had no meaning. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, while saying that his party had also been urging the authorities to withdraw the weekend curfew and odd-even system for shops, accused AAP of misleading traders. “It is saying that BJP is not allowing relaxation in restrictions, but there is no BJP representation in DDMA,” claimed Kapoor. “It will be better if CM Kejriwal calls for the DDMA meeting and gets relief for the traders.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-and-bjp-urge-lg-to-reconsider-decision/articleshow/89048154.cms||---

She told news channel NDTV that contesting in UP elections was under consideration and internal discussions were on. "When there is a consensus, we will let you know," said Priyanka, the Congress's in-charge for UP since 2019. She has never contested any assembly or parliamentary election before. Earlier in the day, at a press conference to launch the party's youth manifesto, she said she was the party's face in UP. "Are you seeing any other faces from Congress? Then? Dikh toh raha hai na sab jagah mera chehra (My face can be seen everywhere)," she said in response to the question if she was the CM face. Priyanka, however, told NDTV later that her remarks were "tongue-in-cheek" because every second question she was asked was about this. "Between me, UPCC chief Ajay Lalloo and the CLP leader (Aradhna Mishra), we are leading the efforts in UP. But it is unlikely that we are officially going to announce this face or that face," she said. "I am the (party) general secretary of Uttar Pradesh. And the responsibility is mine, and I'm dealing with it." She also signalled Congress's willingness to any post-poll alliance in case of a hung assembly, but with a condition. "If such circumstances arise, a decision will be taken accordingly. But if we do, we would certainly want our agenda for the youth and women, especially women, to be fulfilled if we were going to be part of any such dispensation," Priyanka said. Congress under her leadership in UP has been reaching out to the women electorate and has also decided to field women on 40% of seats the party contests in this year's polls. Priyanka said her party will continue to bat for constructive politics that will lead to people-centric, demand-driven development and end caste- and religion-based "divisive politics". Asked if Congress's vision has any takers in a state it has been out of power for three decades, she said: "Yes, to a good extent. And it will increase as we will go on hammering for it. A day is not far when people will question public representatives for even things like a broken water tap in the neighbourhood."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/may-contest-polls-but-that-doesnt-mean-i-am-cm-face-says-priyanka/articleshow/89050767.cms||Shailvee Sharda

He was the chief guest for the first convocation of Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy that was conducted in Visakhapatnam on Friday. Delivering the convocation address, Venkaiah Naidu said that India is the world’s third largest consumer of crude oil, but is still dependent on imports for more than 80 per cent of its needs. “The need of the hour is to increase production, not only to save foreign exchange but also to ensure energy security. The policy reforms such as the hydrocarbon exploration licensing policy are aimed at increasing exploration in new sedimentary basins,” said Naidu. Explaining the impact of population and industrialisation on increased energy demand, Venkaiah Naidu said that India’s primary energy demand is expected to grow at an average rate of more than 3% till 2045 as compared to less than 1% growth for the rest of the world. “IIPE and other energy institutes can bridge the supply gap of skilled manpower for the petroleum sector and build stronger industry-institute linkages with the prominent market players. The PhD students can be encouraged to undertake research on problems faced by the industry, and thus bring in a multi-disciplinary approach into academic research,” said Naidu. The Vice-President expressed confidence that IIPE will show the way forward by becoming an exemplar in the domain of energy research.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/venkaiah-calls-for-rd-efforts-to-ensure-natl-energy-security/articleshow/89049541.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri was hearing a contempt petition after the HC in 2018 issued detailed instructions for maintenance of roads, curbing stray cattle menace on public roads and smooth traffic movement. The judges told the petitioner’s lawyer that this is a noble cause that he was espousing, but the court cannot keep monitoring every road in the state and the city. The judges grilled AMC over its compliance with road maintenance order and pointed out that the HC directions are to be implemented not only in AMC areas, but across the state. The court said, “There is compliance, but not effective compliance.”The court said that there is a pothole at a distance on every road in the city. The court asked AMC to be either ready for framing of charges for contempt or “to salvage things” GSLSA be appointed. AMC’s counsel termed the court’s proposition as Hobson’s choice. The court said that the involvement of GSLSAshould be citizen centric, where people can send their complaint along with a photograph. The judges also said that GSLSA’s involvement would bring some bonafide quality to the exercise. “It will neither be a monitoring agency nor an executing one. It will act as a bridge between applicant, respondents and the court. We will prepare a draft. GSLSA collect information and report to the court,” the court said. Further hearing has been posted on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/let-gslsa-collect-info-on-state-of-roads/articleshow/89049542.cms||---

The cops initiated the action after an 18-year-old resident of the society in Amiyapur village of Gandhinagar approached them with the complaint. Complainant Muskan Sadhwani, a BBA student, stated in her FIR that she has been feeding the strays in Shree Balaji Agora Residency for around four years. On Thursday, she found that two dogs, aged around seven to eight months, were missing. Upon checking the CCTV footage of the premises, Sadhwani saw Jeetu Rajput, the guard, taking the two dogs with him out of the society. When she confronted Rajput, he said that he had abandoned the strays near Narmada canal and would do so again if he found dogs roaming around and being fed inside the society. He told her that he had acted on the instructions of society chairman Kanti Kamani, the FIR stated. Sadhwani went to the canal to look for the strays but could not find them. She then approached the Adalaj police and filed a complaint under Section 11(1) (i) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/two-booked-for-abandoning-strays/articleshow/89049544.cms||---

According to senior party leaders, there is no fixed schedule for appointment of state president who in turn would form the state committee and appoint heads of various cells.The dissolution order had come at a time when RJD, which is part of the ruling alliance, had intensified its public contact programmes in order to strengthen the party’s base in various assembly constituencies.RJD working president Tejashwi Yadav had also promised to spend two days every month in Jharkhand and hold public rallies. Yadav took part in meetings held in Ranchi and Chhatarpur which were termed by the party as highly successful.Speaking on the issue, outgoing president Abhay Singh said that the situation arose due to internal wrangling in the party. He said, “After we managed to hold successful rallies, rival camps felt jealous. It is they who fed wrong information to top leadership leading to the dissolution of state committee in Jharkhand.”Party leaders said that all RJD members are awaiting the formation of new organisation. Sources said that the decision will be taken only after working president returns from his honeymoon.Outgoing RJD general secretary Irfan Ansari had met Tejashwi Yadav earlier this month and discussed about the formation of the new committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/rjd-jharkhand-unit-in-limbo-workers-await-new-committee/articleshow/89049547.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The four buses of Devasthanam have covered about 6.6 lakh kilometres on the ghat road in the last four years, plying devotees from the foothills to the temple on the hill. The ‘electric mobility’ proposal came in the wake of the suggestion made by the chairman of the Simhachalam temple trust board and former civil aviation minister P Ashok Gajapathi Raju. The founder family member of SVLNS Devasthanam and 104 group temples earlier asked the temple authorities to evaluate the feasibility of procuring electric buses to replace the fuel-run buses. Again in his recent letter, dated January 14, Ashok Gajapathi Raju has sought a report on the progress of the proposed initiative. Consequent to this, the temple authorities obtained quotations from an electric bus manufacturer. While the 9-metre electric bus is quoted at 1.55 crore, the 7-metre variant is supposed to cost around 1.45 crore for an outright purchase. Meanwhile the Simhachalam officials made inquiries with the APSRTC officials, who are planning to operate 50 electric buses on Tirumala-Tirupati ghat road. The RTC officials informed that they got approval from the ministry of heavy industries under phase-II of faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (Fame-II) scheme to ply electric buses on an operating expenses basis. They also provided the Simhachalam officials the details of the pricing quotations taken from an electric bus manufacturer for operating the buses on an operating expenses basis. Executive officer, SVLNS Devasthanam, MV Suryakala, said the work order, guidelines, and tender documents will be placed for further deliberations before the Trust Board in the ensuing meeting to introduce electric buses. The proposed ‘electric mobility’ initiative is expected to come with many benefits such as saving on fuel costs and fuel consumption which in turn cut down on pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. On the state government’s side, measures are being taken to set up nearly 400 charging stations for electric vehicles across the state under Fame-II scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/simhachalam-temple-plans-to-adopt-electric-mobility/articleshow/89049548.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Ranchi||Private labs see red over revised RT-PCR test cost||Ranchi: Private lab operators in Ranchi are unhappy with the state health department’s decision to cap the price of RT-PCR tests at Rs 300. Dr Nitin Sharan, the proprietor of Dr J Sharan Labs, said, “We strongly oppose the move. The government should have taken our views into account before taking such a decision. We will write to the department seeking a reversal of the order.”Though Jharkhand has been conducting roughly 65,000 tests a day, the bulk of RT-PCR tests in the state capital are being carried out by the private labs. The labs claimed that operational costs make it difficult to run the tests at the new rates. Apart from that, the labs have to also cover the expenses which include the salaries of their technicians, health insurance and other medical benefits. Dr Pooja Sahay, the director of city-based Micropraxis Lab, said: “Being small labs, we have to procure consumables such as PPE gear, masks and vital transport media kits required for the tests at high prices and not at the rates which government-run labs procure theirs. Besides the technicians, we also have to pay our men who collect samples.” The Jharkhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has been closely watching the development. “So far, the private lab operators have not come to us with their grievances. We will make our move on the issue accordingly,” Dr Pradeep Kumar Singh, the secretary of IMA Jharkhand, told TOI. The private lab operators had sought a meeting with health secretary Arun Kumar Singh on Friday afternoon. “However, the meeting could not be held as the secretary is out of town. We are trying for a meeting next week,” a private lab operator said. While health minister Banna Gupta remained out of reach, sources in his office said the department has no immediate plans to reverse its decision. Meanwhile, advisor to the Medica hospital in Ranchi, Anand Srivastava, said that they aren’t opposing the move in public interest and they will continue to follow the state government’s order. The state health department has issued an order directing all private testing labs to conduct RT-PCR test for Rs 300 and they can charge an additional Rs 100 if the sample has been collected from home.

---||Indore||16 flights cancelled due to poor seat occupancy||Indore: Over a dozen flights were cancelled on Friday following decline in passenger footfall at Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport of Indore. Around 16 flights including that of Indigo and Air India on routes like Indore-Ahmedabad, Indore-Chennai, Indore-Jaipur, Indore-Lucknow, Indore-Prayagraj, Indore-Bangalore, Indore Delhi and Indore-Mumbai routes were cancelled due to lack of passengers on Friday, airport officials said. “Passengers who made bookings in these flights were provided with alternative options by the airlines including refund or seats in alternate flights to their respective destinations,” Airport director Ramesh Kumar said. Officials said that the airport has witnessed cancellation of at least 10 flights on a daily basis, and decline in passengers count is seen as a reason behind the same. Authorities fear that if this trend of decline in passenger footfall continues for a few more days, it would leave airlines with no option but to suspend their operations once again like it happened during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials pointed out that the daily passenger footfall at Indore airport has gone down by 50 per cent in the last 15 days due to the increasing number of cases of Covid-19 and subsequent travel restrictions enforced by the respective state and administration. Daily passengers’ footfall at Indore airport has come down to below 3000 as compared to over 6000 passengers flying in and out of Indore last month. Besides, daily flight has come down to 38 in comparison to over 60 flights a day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/16-flights-cancelled-due-to-poor-seat-occupancy/articleshow/89049561.cms||---

Ironically, the cost of the vehicle was around Rs5.90 lakh.The notice prompted the officials to probe the matter. It was found that the auto dealer through whom the vehicle was purchased by the department in 2007 had withheld the lifetime payment of road tax at the time of vehicle’s registration. The result: escalation in tax amount and the penalty for delay in payment.Following this, forest department officials filed a complaint with Kotwali police. “A case was registered against the auto dealer under section 406 of IPC (criminal breach of trust) on the basis of the complaint,” Kotwali police said on Friday.The forest officials said that the vehicle was bought from Central Motors in January 2007 at a cost of Rs5.90 lakh which included Rs40,000 for road tax and insurance.In the complaint to the police, forest department SDO RK Solanki said that the department had paid Rs40,000 to the auto dealer for lifetime road tax of the vehicle in January 2007.

There were 306 health employees, who had tested positive from January 1 in the district till Thursday amidst a third wave surge. Of those 306, maximum 73 were from Bombay hospital followed by 72 from MGM including 62 resident doctors there, showed cumulative area-wise analysis of Covid-19 infections in the district. The records further showed that in the same period the district had recorded 23,139 Covid-19 cases implying that health staffers constitute for only 1.32% of total infections. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit told TOI, “We had studied the outbreak of infection on campus in the last week of December last year, when the Covid-19 third wave began to surge. It was found that the outbreak was reported after some people with travel history tested positive.” “Later it spread to others in medical college. So, the health staffers including the doctors had got an infection from the community not for the hospital right now”, said Dr Dixit while talking to TOI. “The trends also showed that the spread of virus was not clustered in medical colleges except in a couple of departments including Anastasia”, said Dr Dixit. "The trend further showed that only doctors had tested positive in MGM, not other staffers like nursing, paramedics", added Dr Dixit. “The major relief this time is that most of the infections are asymptomatic, mild and not severe and require hospitalisation. In order to isolate those testing positive in hostels, an isolation area is set up/demarcated”, added Dr Dixit. On the question of how this rising number of infections in health staffers can affect health services Dr Dixit added, “Medical college had a staff strength of around 4000 and a very small fraction of them tested Covid-19 positive. So, the chances of any kind of impact on health services is minimal.” The other hospitals with high number of health workers testing positive are SAIMS (18), Apollo Hospitals (11), Index medical college (22), CHL Hospitals (8), Medanta Hospitals (25), Saint francis hospital (27), CHRC (12), Shalby (6), Unique (4), Vishesh (4), Civil hospital (4).

The protesters gathered near the DC’s office on Friday and raised slogans against the central and the state governments. They said the central government granted the classical status to the 3,000-year old Kannada language only after protests from Kannadigas. “But after granting the classical status, the Centre has completely neglected the language. While it is granting just Rs 1 crore every year for the development of the language, it has given autonomous status to Tamil and set up the Centre Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai and also granted Rs 50 crore in seven years,” they said. The government has sanctioned Rs 680 crore in seven years for the development of Sanskrit, which is spoken by just around 28,000 people. Kannada, which is the mother tongue of 6.5 crore population, has got a meagre amount of Rs 8.39 crore, they said. There is a need for research and academic activities in Kannada language for its development. The central government must immediately release Rs 25 crore for the setting up of the Classical Kannada Studies Centre in University of Mysore premises, they demanded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/discrimination-in-allocation-of-funds-for-kannada-decried/articleshow/89049575.cms||---

---||Raipur||CG a climate-sensitive state, says study||Raipur: Chhattisgarh may experience warmer weather and a wetter future with an increase in maximum temperature during summer and winter and more rainfall over the next 30 years. More than 80 per cent of the state is drought-prone, many districts have moderate to high flood proneness and some districts are prone to residual impacts of cyclonic storms accompanied by lightning—making it a climate-sensitive state. These are among the findings of a study by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) which projected changes in climate patterns from 2021–2050 as compared with the 30-year period from 1991–2019 in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The latest study on “District level changes in climate: Historical climate and climate change projections in central states of India”, by Vidya S and Indu K Murthy, points out that Chhattisgarh’s summer maximum temperature is projected to warm by 1 degree Celsius to two degrees Celsius. Likewise, the minimum temperature is also projected to warm by one to two degrees Celsius during the next three decades as compared to the period between 1990-2019. The rainfall is projected to increase during 2021-2050 in almost all the districts as compared to the previous 30 years, with a notable increase of 20 per cent or more in northern districts of Surguja, Balrampur and Bilaspur. The intensity in the rainfall is going to observe variability during the Kharif season in most of the districts. Besides, heavy rainfall is projected in Chhattisgarh and an increase will be notable in the districts Bilaspur, Dantewada, Jashpur, Kondagaon, Korba and a few others. Rainfall deficient years are projected to decline in some of the districts of the state as compared to the period from 1990 to 2019.The report said this region is prone to loss and damages caused by several natural hazards. The majority of the state, more than 80%, is drought-prone, with five districts of Baloda Bazar, Bemetara, Mungeli, Kabirdham and Raipur exhibiting a high probability of drought occurrence. Similarly, 17 out of the 27 districts have moderate to high flood proneness because of very high-intensity rainfall distributed over a short period of time. The report also quoted the Vulnerability Atlas of India 2019 to point out that about 18.6% of the state is at moderate risk for earthquakes. The four districts of Sukma, Raigarh, Bastar, and Bijapur have reported residual impacts of cyclonic storms occurring in the Bay of Bengal. Furthermore, such storms are accompanied by lightning, which has resulted in more than 1,000 fatalities over a period of five years from 2011-to 2015. Besides, Heatwaves are also a common occurrence, with temperatures soaring over 45°C in the summer months. Pointing out that these characteristics make Chhattisgarh climate-sensitive, underpinning the need for climate information, the report said climate data could serve as the basis for hazard mapping and risk assessment of various regions, sectors, and communities to ensure climate-proof development.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/cg-a-climate-sensitive-state-says-study/articleshow/89049587.cms||---

It all started with Vijayasai Reddy tweeting a fortnight ago heckling Raju for not attending the CID enquiry and sitting in Delhi. He might have responded to the daily news briefing by Raju from Delhi or Hyderabad against the state government, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and parliamentary party leader Vijayasai Reddy. Raju also dragged some other MPs in the recent past making derogatory statements against them. A day ago, Vijayasai tweeted saying Raju had rented out himself like a property or vehicles. He also alleged that Raju had betrayed the voters of Narsapuram. Raju responded saying that Vijayasai had mortgaged his life with A1 in CBI cases and had no justification in blaming him. But the war intensified on Friday, with both Vijayasai and Raju taking to Twitter. Vijayasai tweeted saying that Raju was working hard to get into the good books of someone, sacrificing his 40 years of political career. He said people would vote for those who work for them and not those who sit in Hyderabad or Delhi and instead of visiting them. Raju said Vijayasai was trying to impress A1 to get re-nominated to Rajya Sabha and claimed that this will not happen now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/vijayasai-heckles-rebel-mp-war-of-words-escalates-on-twitter/articleshow/89049586.cms||Gopi Dara

Trader associations of various markets have expressed their concern over increasing losses due to the Covid restrictions and have questioned the logic behind not lifting the curfew when the cases and positivity rate are on the wane. Confederation of Trade and Industries (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said that they would be forced to hold a protest if the odd-even rule was not removed in 2-3 days. In a statement issued by the association, Goyal stated that Delhi’s 20 lakh traders were deeply disappointed. “We failed to understand the reason for the LG’s decision to not approve the proposal forwarded by CM Arvind Kejriwal for lifting the restrictions. After the press conference of deputy CM Manish Sisodia, there was a wave of happiness among the traders that now there will be freedom from odd-even and weekend curfew,” he said. Traders have requested the LG to revisit the decision, which will affect the livelihood of 20 lakh traders and their 40 lakh employees. “When political rallies are going on in other parts of the country, why are traders in Delhi asked to continue with the restrictions? How come we are expected to earn our livelihood, pay salaries of employees by opening shops 8-10 days in a month? Also, why is the administration not acting against the illegal vendors who do not adhere to Covid norms?” wondered Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar Traders’ Association. Praveen Khandelwal of Confederation of All India Traders said that the last 20 days saw about 60% reduction in the trade in Delhi. “Instead of weekend lockdowns, non-vaccinated persons should not be allowed to step out of their homes. Also, the trade associations may be asked to mandatorily comply with Covid safety protocols in their shops, which they are already doing,” said Khandelwal. In a letter, he has requested the LG to allow dining at restaurants, hotels with 50% capacity. New Delhi Municipal Council vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay has also written to the LG and sought relief for the local traders. “Considering Metro and buses are operating with full capacity and as per the latest report of Delhi government, the number of cases is also reducing day by day, the markets may be allowed to open all week (as suggested by associations) after reducing closing time till 6 pm instead of 8 pm,” he stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/traders-rue-decision-to-not-lift-curbs-say-livelihoods-at-stake/articleshow/89048198.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Birds skip Chandlai Lake for overfishing||JAIPUR: The Chandlai Lake at Shivdaspura near here is marred by illegal pumping of water by villagers to irrigate their nearby agricultural farms. This, coupled with indiscriminate fishing, threatens the movement of migratory birds in the winter season. The inland water body, spread over 6sqkm, used to attract birds from Central Europe, Central Asia and China for five months in a year. The figure has now dwindled and the birds’ stay too has come down to two-three months. A group of environmentalists has written to the department of environment that the lake should be declared ‘Important Birding Area (IBA)’ and ‘Protected Site’ to preserve and conserve. Rohit Gangwal, managing trustee of RAKSHA said, “The indiscriminate exploitation of the lake is posing a danger to the historically well-documented birding site. The illegal fishing activities are leaving no food for the birds, forcing them to starve and leave for other avenues. Institutional measures like IBA and Protected Site only can ensure that the area can be preserved.” The highest number of birds counted was 1.5 lakh (303 species) while the current count is less than 40,000 (123 species). The lake thrives on rainwater and polluted water flow from the Dravyawati River which is taking a toll on the flora and fauna. The lake is in records since 1872. Since the population has increased manifold with agriculture as key economic activity, the villagers illegally pump out water during the winter season or for Rabi season. “Earlier they used to carry water in the traditional manner from the catchment area but now with access to water pumping machines they are literally shrinking the lake,” said Sahil Singhal of People for Animals. Reports say that the catchment area of the lake is 3,000 hectares which is marred by mass encroachments. More than 10 species of birds such as northern shoveler, common pochard, redshank, common greenshank, tufted duck, common redshank are being sighted along with bar headed geeses (2,000) and pelicans (1,200) which are in majority. Other than shrinking the lake, another tragedy for birds is removal of trees from the lake and the catchment area which serves as resting place for them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/birds-skip-chandlai-lake-for-overfishing/articleshow/89049619.cms||Shoeb Khan

The lethal impact was also exacerbated due to release of some volatile toxic compounds, it noted.“The contents of the tanker were found to have high sulphide and high cyanide concentration. It is the nature of sulphide and cyanide that it liberates sulphide gases such as H2S and cyanogenic gases such as HCN in acidic medium. Hence the accident may have been caused by abrupt formation of such poisonous gases due to acid base reaction,” the CPCB stated.The pollution watchdog categorically noted that hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas doesn’t not cause significant pungent smell while H2S gas is highly pungent in odour. “Hence people inhaling such four mixed gases in an industrial area may not have been able to alert themselves. Apart from these gases, some short-lived toxic volatile compounds may also have been generated due to illegal discharge which may have further escalated the lethal impact,” the report states. The central pollution control agency further stated that GPCB carried out sampling of leftover hazardous chemicals in the tanker and waste water samples from the drain at various locations. Along with testing at GPCB central laboratory, 15 samples were sent to Vadodara CPCB regional director. In the test results, CPCB stated, “Natural drain was carrying highly acidic wastewater. The pH of wastewater flowing in the natural drain upstream of the accident site, at the accident site and downstream of site was acidic and pHranged from 1.62 to 2.61.” “The natural drain is not supposed to carry such acidic wastewater. Apart from pH, other analyzed parameters namely COD, NH3-N, phenolic compounds, sulphides and cyanides were also observed in high concentration. The concentration of analyzed parameters even exceeds the general discharge standards notified under The Environment (Protection) Act for effluents in upstream and downstream of a site.” the report noted.CPCB findings revealed that samples supplied by GPCB for analysis of physico-chemical parameters pertaining to wastewater characteristics were not preserved.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/victims-didnt-get-a-whiff-of-noxious-fumes-cpcb/articleshow/89049628.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Dhanik Shah, a diamond broker, had allegedly replaced two original diamonds, each weighing around one carat, with lab-grown chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamonds. For six months nobody had a clue about the fraud, until a buyer from Belgium returned one of the lab-grown diamonds to the city unit, Laxmi Diamond Pvt. Ltd. Bhumik Gajera, director of the diamond unit, lodged a complaint following which Shah was booked under Indian Penal Code section 420 (cheating). Shah had replaced the diamonds in June 2021 when he came to examine the precious stones at the unit in the Katargam area of the city. In his complaint Gajera alleged that Shah, a resident of Umra area, saw a few diamonds online and called the unit expressing his desire to physically examine the precious stones. On June 6, 2021, Shah visited the unit and after examining the diamonds returned them to the staff on duty. Later one of the stones was sold to a buyer in Belgium who returned it as it was of CVD variety and not a natural one. “When our officials were told that it is a lab-grown diamond we were shocked. We only polish natural diamonds and don’t manufacture them. We checked our records and it came to light that the said diamond was examined by Shah,” said Vasant Gajera, owner of the diamond unit. The unit then approached police and after preliminary investigation the complaint was lodged. “The accused lives in Mumbai,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/broker-swaps-real-diamonds-with-lab-grown-variety-booked/articleshow/89049650.cms||---

Inspector Digambar Bhadane of Killa police station said, “Once the forensic investigation gives us a clear picture about what are those bones and how old they are, we would get a definite line of investigation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/malegaon-dispensary-was-once-a-mortuary/articleshow/89049662.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Chennai NGO reunites woman with brother in Uttar Pradesh's Kaushambi after 25 years||PRAAGRAJ: Call it the fate or tireless efforts of a Chennai-based NGO, Udavum Karangal, a 53-year- old woman, Kusum Yadav, has been reunited with her family in the neighbouring district of Kaushambi after over 25 years. Kusum, who had developed psychological symptoms and was under extreme depression, had run away from her village Baserhi and was found by this NGO in far-off Tambaram in Tamil Nadu. Kusum will meet family on Wednesday. For over 25 years since 1996, she was under the protection of this NGO. A few years back, she had reluctantly spoken about the name of her village and the chairman of the NGO launched a search for all the villages with the name Basethi. After a marathon effort, he finally found the siblings of Kusum and reunited her with her family on January 19. Kusum, who had seven siblings, six brothers and a sister, was married to a local in her early 20s but unfortunately her husband died after a couple of months of their marriage. Kusum’s second marriage was with Bhailal, a worker in a steel factory at Pune.  However, the happiness of the married life was short lived as Kusum was often thrashed by her drunkard husband. Offended by the repeated torture, she came back to her parents' place but under depression, she developed psychiatric problems and finally ran away from her home. "Kusum was found by a well-wisher of Udavum Karangal at Tambaram lying on a street and people teasing her. She was handed over to us in January 1996 and till date she has been nurtured, given psychiatric treatment and is now in a normal condition," said Pappa S Vidyaakar, founder of the NGO. He further informed TOI that Kusum responded well to psychiatric treatment and after having recovered got involved in various activities in the rehabilitation home at Thiruverkadu. However, she was always reluctant to divulge the details of her native place and said that she did not want to go back. "After repeated counselling, she started giving vague details like her village name and the name of her brothers. With the small details the social worker, Y Srinivasa Rao, found through Google a school called Balamandir School, and spoke to Mallick Chand who knew her family. Soon, we were able to contact Ramchand Yadav and Prakash Yadav, the two brothers of Kusum," informed Vidyaakar. The NGO arranged a WhatsApp video call between Kusum and her family and she was overjoyed. Later, Phoolchand Yadav, her other brother, was contacted in Bengaluru who went to Chennai to take her sister home. "On meeting, the duo hugged each other and were in tears," recalled the NGO chairman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/chennai-ngo-reunites-woman-with-brother-in-kaushambi-after-25-years/articleshow/89049672.cms||Rajiv Mani
---||Nashik||NMC’s micro containment zone policy to continue||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to continue with its current micro containment zone policy instead of introducing large containment zones.An NMC official said earlier they had decided to introduce large containment zones if more than five cases are found in one area. “With significant rise in cases in the city at large, most of the areas would have been sealed if large containment zones were declared. Hence, we have decided to continue with the micro containment zone policy to avoid inconvenience to others,” the official said. Currently, the city houses 200 active micro containment zones that are mainly apartments, row-houses or standalone bungalows. During the last 20 days, a total of 480 new containment zones were declared in the city and 270 of them were closed after recovery of patients.By the first week of February last year, the city had only 500 active patients, but from March onwards there was a spike in new cases. The number of active patients in the city had increased to 28,000 on April 23 last year and the number of active containment zones in the city has increased up to 2,000.But the trend reversed from May onwards and the cases started to drop. The number of active containment zones in the city had reduced to 46 active till December 19. However, now with rise in cases, the number of containment zones during the last three weeks have increased to 210. It should be noted that during the second wave, the discharge period for patients under home isolation was 14 days, which has now been reduced to 7 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmcs-micro-containment-zone-policy-to-continue/articleshow/89049675.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Kalpwasis at Magh Mela rueinadequate arrangements||Prayagraj: Rising level of the Ganga and allegedly inadequate arrangements have left kalpwasis camping in Magh Mela in a lurch. “We have never faced such bad arrangements for kalpwasis in the past four decades than we are facing this year at the ongoing Magh Mela,” kalpwasis camping in Magh Mela told TOI on Friday. “When a kalpwasi takes sankalp or decides to spend a month-long minimalistic life at Sangam — the holy confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, he comes with a lot of hope. However, the lacklusture approach of the Mela authorities has ruined the sankalp of thousands of kalpwasis who were allotted land in Gangdeep pocket of Mela area for stay,” said Rajiv Bhardwaj, a kalpwasi at Gangdeep.Bhardwaj said he comes to camp in Mela area for more than two decades, but has never seen such bad arrangements. He further accused the Mela administration of playing with the sentiments of thousands of kalpwasis, who arrive once a year to spend a month on the banks of the Ganga to earn punya. The fact is that each and every kalpwasi knows that water is discharged into river Ganga before every Amavasya during Mela period, but this time the Mela authorities, particularly the admin (official who allots lands to kalpwasis) has played with the sentiments of kalpwasis,” argued Bhardwaj. The starling fact is that the entire Gangdeep area has now submerged after rise in the water level of Ganga, and Mela administration is shifting kalpwasis to sector five. Mayank Tiwari, a kalpwasi from Reewa, said: “It is totally the failure of the Mela administration and errant officials should be punished by the state government.”He added, “kalpwasis were forced to break their spiritual routine within five days of the beginning of kalpwas and they have been taking rounds for safer places in other sectors of the Mela.” Senior Mela officials are tight-lipped over the anger of the kalpwasis and justified that they had no other option than to shift them from Gangadeep area to sector five. “Despite deputing senior administrative officials and taking up Mela preparations in advance, whom should we blame for this mess,” said 70-year-old kalpwasi PK Pandey from Handia. The kalpwasis have a lot of issues and blame the administration. They said that they had to fight to get a toilet and potable water supply this year. A senior Mela official said, “Adequate water was released into the Ganga and this caused the problem for us. We have been making sincere efforts to overcome the problems of kalpwasis and teams have been deputed to get their grievances sorted out.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/kalpwasis-at-magh-mela-rueinadequate-arrangements/articleshow/89049677.cms||---

---||Goa||ISL: FC Goa hopeful of a turnaround||Miracles do happen, said FC Goa coach Derrick Pereira. Goa and Pereira both need one to break into the Indian Super League (ISL) play-offs this season. Goa struggled from the start, losing three games in a row, and nothing seems to have changed after 12 matches in which they managed only three wins. They now find themselves in the ninth position on table with eight games remaining in the league stage. In the last two games, Goa failed to get the better of NorthEast United FC and SC East Bengal, the only two teams which are below them at the moment. Their remaining fixtures are as difficult as they can get, starting with Bengaluru FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium, Bambolim, on Sunday. “We are going to go with a different mindset with our approach in the remaining matches,” FC Goa head coach Derrick Pereira told TOI during the media interaction on Saturday. “We will try to perform in each and every match to the best of our abilities.” Against the eight teams Goa are drawn to face in the remaining games, the Durand Cup champions managed only nine points in the first leg. Goa have 13 points and a four-point gap separates them from fourth-placed Mumbai City FC. However, the recent rise in Covid-19 cases inside the bio-bubble has made things difficult for them. “We will play as a team and give more than 100 percent to get the maximum in each and every match,” said Pereira. Goa’s main concern has been in defence while the finishing has been below par as well. Goa have attempted the most shots (184) but have the lowest goal conversion rate out of all teams (7.6%). Pereira has been forced to shuffle his midfield due to injuries or non-availability of players. Their biggest miss has been star midfielder Brandon Fernandes who is yet to feature after suffering injury at the SAFF Cup in Maldives. The international has trained and Pereira will hope he is cleared by the medical team to play against Bengaluru. Bengaluru have been unbeaten in five games after suffering a 1-2 defeat against Goa. It was a game where Goa’s Jorge Ortiz and Bengaluru’s Suresh Singh Wangjam picked up red cards. Marco Pezzaiuoli’s side come into the fixture with a morale boosting 3-0 win against defending champions Mumbai. They are just a spot above Goa with the same points but have a game in hand. Full-back Roshan Singh has been in fine form, providing five assists. Three of the 22-year-olds assists came for Prince Ibara. The Congolese striker has been robust and poses an aerial threat for Goa’s back-four. Bengaluru have been in quarantine for 10 days after Covid-19 cases in the side and had two training sessions. “Goa were dominating possession against East Bengal in the last game and were a bit unlucky in finishing. But still for me Goa is the best team with ball possession in this league. We need to be prepared,” Bengaluru coach Pezzaiuoli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/isl-fc-goa-hopeful-of-a-turnaround/articleshow/89065401.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Excavation will resume at Sannati and Kanaganahalli||KALABURAGI: It was in 1986 that Sannati and Kanaganahalli caught the attention of historians, when these two villages in Kalaburgi district were found to be treasure troves of ancient Indian history. However, these two villages wallowed in obscurity for more than a decade after the discovery of their antiquity. In 1997, a full-fledged excavation of the two sites was undertaken, resulting in experts from across the globe flocking to Kalaburagi. However, despite demands from locals and historians alike to continue the excavation across the 23 acres, the exercise was halted a few years ago. Thankfully, Kalaburagi MP Umesh Jadhav drew the attention of the Union government to the problem, following which the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Delhi proceeded to invite scholars and researchers to delve into the past in these two remote villages of North Karnataka. President of the Indian unit of the International Buddhist Youth Organisation Bhante Shaku Bodhidham told TOI, “Sannati could have been a very prominent place for Buddhism. We have two stories wherein it is said that the Emperor Ashoka was in Sannati. The story is that the emperor followed his son and daughter, who were bound for Sri Lanka, till Sannati. The other story claims that he built a monument here in Sannati. Excavation at this site has been halted for 15 years, but there is a need for the past of the site to be explored further. The negligent attitude of the authorities has resulted in many statues being stolen. We were able to express these concerns to Union culture minister Arun Ram Meghwal, whom we met with the help of Umesh Jadhav, and ASI director general V Vidyavati. We are glad that the government is eager to preserve the ruins.” Kalaburagi MP Umesh Jadhav expressed happiness with the ASI chief’s encouraging response to resuming excavation at Sannati and Kanaganahalli. “We have requested Meghwal to transform it into a World Heritage Site, and take steps to preserve relics by building a museum. It is regretful that, despite boasting such a rich historical legacy, Sannati and Kanaganahalli were previously absent from India’s historic map. Archaeologists suspect that the stupa in Sannati is older than the Sanchi Stupa in Madhya Pradesh,” Jadhav said. Bodhidham said that Meghwal would visit Sannati after the assembly elections to Uttar Pradesh. “In response to our request, ASI officials visited Sannati last week. We are planning to meet chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, and request him to educate children about Sannati’s antiquity in textbooks, and popularise the place among tourists. If both the state and central governments wish, they can turn it into a spiritual and cultural hub,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/excavation-will-resume-at-sannati-and-kanaganahalli/articleshow/89049681.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Earlier, the state had issued a circular to colleges on the same. Youth in 15-29 age group are participating in the survey. In schools, kids in 15-18 age group will engage in the online survey. The questionnaire, which is uploaded online, has 43 questions under categories like general information, education, employment, health, leadership and others. The survey also talks about child marriage, drug abuse, and Covid. The schoolchildren should leave out some questions which are not relevant for their age group. According to a teacher from north Karnataka, some students have already completed the survey online, while a few are struggling due to network issues. “The government should have also given the option of taking it offline. Questions, which are apt, touch subjects like how Covid has impacted their lives. Many rural kids are troubled due to the pandemic, and the youth policy should be framed keeping this in mind,” the teacher added.The survey is conducted by the youth empowerment and sports department. The department has formed a committee headed by R Balasubramaniam to frame the policy. Balasubramaniam told TOI: “The survey is to get inputs from the ground. Unless we seek opinion from the youth, the policy will be incomplete. It will be drafted after the opinion-gathering exercise. In order to implement the same, the committee has also advised regular review of the policy implementation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/schoolkids-take-part-in-survey-for-youth-policy/articleshow/89049685.cms||Shreyas HS

When Vartika came to know the condition of her cousin and that the family would be unable to find funds for treatment, she decided to seek support on social media. Netizens, known and unknown from across the state, have till now contributed Rs over 7 lakh and the help is still pouring in. “We got him treated at a private hospital at in Prayagraj. However, the doctors referred him to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS, Lucknow) on June 2021,”shared the 20-year-old. “Here he was diagnosed with severe Aplastic anemia. Sandeep’s elder sister, Pratima’s bone marrow matched perfectly and he underwent the transplant successfully in November, 2021 at SGPGIMS,” she added. However, the medicines given to lower body resistance to transplanted bone marrow ended up creating a complication that resulted in his developing of Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), defined by destruction of red blood cells, low platelets, and organ damage due to the formation of microscopic blood clots in capillaries and small arteries. This resulted in Sandeep requiring daily plasma therapy. However further complications has resulted in him developing Graft versus host disease (GvHD), and for which doctors have now advised that he undergoes a costly but potentially life-saving ‘Mesenchymal stem cell infusion’,” she added. “We need another Rs 10 lakh for which we are hopeful,” explained Vartika, who along with her cousins and other kin are camping in Lucknow to take care of Sandeep’ undergoing treatment under Dr Anshul Gupta at SGPGIMS.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/au-student-collects-7l-via-social-media-for-cousins-treatment/articleshow/89049686.cms||---

It is followed by Vijayapura and Dakshina Kannada. Inland fishing is nothing but fishing in ponds, lakes, and streams. The district has surpassed the related target set by the state government. Yadgir has produced 7,416 tonne of fish — as against the targeted 6,904 tonne — three months prior to March, when the period set for the target ends. The district has 250 lakes, of which 175 are spread within 100 acres, while 75 are spread over 100 acres. Apart from lakes, Yadgir also boasts of two major rivers — Bheema and Krishna — which have helped the district achieve the target. Around 500 farmers in the district are involved in fish production. While many of them have their own ponds, some make use of lakes and rivers. Shrinivas Kulkarni, deputy director of fisheries, Yadgir district, told TOI there is a huge potential in the district to produce fish, thanks to lakes and rivers. “Fish produced in Yadgir district is being exported to Hyderabad and abroad,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/yadgir-stands-top-in-inland-fish-production/articleshow/89049694.cms||Mouneshwar Sonnad
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Children with comorbidities catching Covid in hospital||CHANDIGARH: The third wave of Covid, which has higher transmission rate, has gripped children too. Since December, the PGI has seen 70 admissions of children, who mainly come with underlying diseases and pick up Covid in hospital. During the last wave, around 185 children were admitted in two months. “The number of children getting infected is high because community transmission is also high,” said a faculty member. He said, “In PGI, we are mainly seeing kids with comorbidities and associated Covid. Their admission needs are mostly for their comorbidity. Our hospital admission data reflects referral data.” The recently revised ‘comprehensive guidelines for management of Covid-19 in children and adolescents’ by the director general of health services has not recommended use of antiviral and antibiotics for children. “Antibiotics in kids are prescribed for their underlying illnesses. Most kids are referred for primary illness and are picked up as Covid positive on universal screening at the emergency,” said a doctor in PGI. As per the latest global research on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) report published in Lancet, AMR poses a threat to people of all ages, young children were found particularly to be at high risk, with one in five deaths attributable to this resistance in children under the age of five. The revised guidelines do not recommend antivirals or monoclonal antibodies for children less than 18 years of age regardless of the severity of infection. Also, if steroids are used, they should be tapered over 10-14 days, subject to clinical improvement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/kids-with-comorbidities-catching-covid-in-hosp/articleshow/89049695.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The amount, which is intended to cover machinery and manpower for the work, is being sought under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): 2. The matter will be discussed among general house members. The proposal was approved by the State Level Technical Committee (SLTC) under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). The civic body authority plans to remove the garbage dump at the site through bio-mine. The matter was discussed with UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit and other senior UT officers. “Out of total 25 acres of land, the sanitary landfill site was developed on 8 acres of land in 2008. The MC started dumping garbage, inert, refuse, unprocessed garbage from processing plant etc. The garbage of Rs 7.67 lakh is now lying in this sanitary landfill and has become a garbage mountain about the height of 30 meters, causing nuisance to nearby residents because of foul smell, leachate and frequent fires. It is now proposed to remediate the dump site by bio mining and separating the RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) and Demolition (C&D) Waste and inert,” the agenda says.Sources said senior UT officers have given their consent to the project. Since the waste to energy plant to process generated garbage will take time to set up as per the IIT Ropar’s project report and request for proposal, the civic body authority will hire a private company to run the plant at full capacity till IIT Ropar finalises details. The engineering department has prepared a financial estimate of around Rs 6.33 crore for the project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-seeks-77cr-from-centre-to-remove-garbage-mountain/articleshow/89049698.cms||Deepak Yadav

He also stated that the UT administration was working on its first e-vehicles policy. Recently, the Centre had sanctioned 80 electric buses for Chandigarh under Phase-II of the FAME India Scheme. The first batch of electric buses have already started plying on city roads. The department of heavy industries, under the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises, has been administering the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme since April 2015 to promote adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in India.The UT administration had allotted tender of 40 electric buses to a private firm. The first batch of electric buses was launched last year. Three companies had submitted bids to run the 40 electric buses. The lowest bidder, Ashok Leyland, was awarded the contract to run the environment-friendly buses for 10 years on the basis of km scheme. As per the agreement, all maintenance expenditure, bus charging stations, suspension, HVAC system and major and minor repair of buses during the contract period would be the responsibility of the successful bidder.The department will pay Rs 60 per km to the company and fare collection will be done by the authority. After being charged, the bus will cover a distance of nearly 200 to 300 km. It will take two to three hours to fully charge the bus.Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles in India, with around 12 lakh registered vehicles, including two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The number of vehicles per house on an average is two, which has led to a sharp deterioration in air quality.At present, around 3,000 e-rickshaws ply in the city. The ministry has suggested initiatives to promote vehicles like waiving of toll charges, parking charges and issuance of green registration number plates.The Central government has also framed the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan, which aims at promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/centre-seeks-report-on-e-vehicle-policy/articleshow/89049705.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Sources said not many HCWs are coming forward for the booster dose, as some were reinfected after the jab. “There can be two possibilities. Either they had the virus and during the booster shot, it surfaced turning the asymptomatic to symptomatic, or they got the infection at the site,” said a public health expert. From December 20 to date, around 300 healthcare workers in PGI have been infected with Covid. From January 10, all healthcare and frontline workers and elderly with comorbidities became eligible for receiving the precautionary dose as per the GoI guidelines. These were to be given after a nine-month gap of complete immunisation. “There are studies that establish that Covishield has not been protective against Omicron. A mixed dose should have been given as it has been found to be more effective,” said a PGI faculty member. Those who have not been vaccinated have suffered severe Covid and hospitalisation. The third wave started in the last week of December and since then 16 persons have died. “Though we have vaccinated more than 99% of the targeted population (18 years plus) with the second dose, many deaths were of the unvaccinated,” said Yashpal Garg, secretary, health, UT.

In July, Pal directed officials to simplify the process of government services and minimise regulatory compliance.On the adviser’s instructions, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB), UT hospitality department, UT estate office, UT environment department, forest and wildlife department and many other departments provided a number of services online to city residents.The adviser had told the departments that the aim of the exercise was to examine the relevance and rationale of various compliances under the purview of the government, states and UTs to rationalise and simplify them. This process required thorough scrutiny of various acts, regulations, administrative processes and procedural requirements.A senior UT official said that the burdensome regulatory compliance adds unnecessary procedure, time and cost for citizens and business that hinders the overall ease of living and doing business. These compliances become irrelevant due to innovative practices and economic development.Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) and UT hospitality department were the first two departments to go completely paperless. An official associated with the exercise conducted by CHB and hospitality department said that the idea behind the exercise was to achieve a simplified, responsive, effective and transparent working in the CHB and hospitality department. Box: CHB sets exampleRecently, UT adviser Dharam Pal asked to follow the CHB model, as CHB was first among the government boards, corporations and departments in the UT to fully implement the e-office module in all its departments.

Atkot police in Rajkot registered the offence against Yugen Bhuva and Arvind Hirpara based on a suicide note recovered from deceased Ashok Dholariya (53), who ended life by consuming poison. Police said that Ashok had gone missing from his home in Jasdan on January 17 and his body was found on Thursday near S P School in Atkot, along with a four-page note accusing Yugen and Arvind of cheating and harassing him.According to case details, Ashok had a shop of organic fertilizer in Jasdan. On January 17, he recorded a video on his mobile phone that he was leaving home to end his life as he was tired of harassment from the accused, which he sent to his wife. He also mentioned details of his dealings with Yugen and Arvind in a four-page note that the cops found on him on Thursday.Police said that last year, Ashok took Rs 13 lakh car loan for Yugen. However, Yugen avoided paying EMIs and Ashok had to pay his EMIs. Yugen also took another Rs 7 lakh from Ashok for various reasons. When asked to repay, Yugen started avoiding Ashok for the past few months.Similar was the case with the second accused Arvind. Ashok along with his friend Girish Parmar and Arvind set up a photo studio in Jasdan three years ago. After one year, they decided to close it as they were running into losses. On calculation, it was decided that Ashok and Girish had to pay Arvind Rs 3 lakh each as per partnership deal. Ashok paid his dues in instalments. But Girish ran away. So, Arvind started putting pressure on Ashok to pay up Girish’s share too.

---||Rajkot||Three farmhands held for killing female cop’s parents||Rajkot: The Junagadh police cracked the murder of an aged couple - parents of a woman head constable - and arrested three persons who had looted 21 tolas gold and cash from their house in Sendarda village near Vanthali three days ago.Four teams of Junagadh local crime branch (LCB) and Vanthli police station were formed to trace the killers. They arrested Premchand Kalara, Arjun Baria and Rakesh Baria, all native of Dahod, who had come to Junagadh in search of work as farm labourers. The accused are all in their early twenties.Early on January 17 morning, the trio and another accomplice, Mahesh Bhuriya, smothered the 68-year-old woman Jaluben Jiladiya with a pillow and later strangled her husband, Rajabhai (72), with a shawl. Then they looted gold ornaments and cash from the house before fleeing the spot. Bhuriya is still on the run, said cops.The couple's daughter Kunwar is posted as the head constable in Junagadh, while their two sons - Ashwin and Jagdish - live separately in the village. Looking at the nature and execution of crime, police had a hunch that it could be the handiwork of some tribal people employed as farm labourers.Jagdish is a small-time labour contractor who engages people from Dahod and other places for harvest and other farm-related work for farmers in the district. Police got the entire list of people he had hired and found that Premchand had left the village around a month-and-a-half ago after harvesting of groundnut was completed.The police teams carefully scanned large number of CCTV cameras on Vanthli-Junagadh road, railway crossings, hotels on the state highways and other places. In one of the footage, they saw Premchand, which raised doubts as he had already left the district. They received information that Premchand was working in a farm in Pithadiya village of Jamnagar district's Kalavad taluka. He was detained and during questioning, he confessed to crime. Based on his revelation, cops nabbed Arjun from Savli village near Vadodara and Rakesh from Bhatvadar village of Amreli district. Inspector of LCB police, HI Bhati said that Premchand and Mahesh had worked for Jagdish in his farm in Tinmas village adjoining Sendarda as well as in the deceased's farm for nearly 40 days after Diwali last year. They were aware that the aged couple lived alone and therefore conspired the loot."On January 17 evening, all four of them reached Sendarda village and hid in a farm where tuver (pigeon peas) was grown. As night fell and the couple went to sleep in the courtyard, they entered, killed and looted gold and cash from the house," Bhati said. The four then distributed the booty and dispersed."Premchand had made a blunder. He contacted a farm labourer from his native Dahod when he came here to execute the crime. This helped us narrow down on him," said Bhati.Police recovered a portion of the gold ornaments and Rs 50,000 out of the total Rs 2.5 lakh they had looted. The remaining booty is with Mahesh, who, police said will be nabbed soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/three-farmhands-held-for-killing-female-cops-parents/articleshow/89049718.cms||---

The day temperature is likely to dip to 16 degrees Celsius due to rain and cloudy sky. A Met official said, “Under the influence of a western disturbance, the national capital is likely to receive rain on Saturday and Sunday. Gusty winds at the speed of 30-40 kmph is predicted to blow on Saturday.

According to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) data, Safdarjung received 69.8 mm rainfall in January 1995. The minimum temperature was recorded at 7.6 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature settled at 19.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, IMD said. Moderate fog was reported on Friday morning as the visibility dropped to 500 metres at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station. Palam saw shallow fog as the visibility was recorded at 800 metres during morning hours.

---||Shimla||HP, Hry sign ₹215cr pact to revive Saraswati||Shimla/Chandigarh: The Himachal Pradesh and Haryana governments on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the rejuvenation of Hindu mythological river, Saraswati. For this purpose, they will build a dam with an outlay of Rs 215.35 crore on 77 acres in Himachal near Adi Badri area of Yamunanagar district of Haryana. The document was officially signed by Haryana chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal and his Himachal counterpart Ram Subhag Singh in the presence of CMs Manohar Lal Khattar and Jai Ram Thakur, respectively. Speaking on the occasion, Thakur said with the signing of this pact, the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had shown his commitment to revive the Saraswati while addressing the people on April 3, 2014, in Kurukshetra, would be fulfilled. Khattar said that with this, his 35-year-old dream has come true as he had traveled to the site in 1986-87 in connection with research on the Saraswati. “This journey started from Adi Badri and reached even Kutch (Gujarat). With the construction of Adi Badri dam, 20 cusecs of water will flow continuously into the Saraswati throughout the year... Religious beliefs will be revived with the rejuvenation of the Saraswati,” he said.For conducting research on the mythological river, a chair has been set up in Kurukshetra University and Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board established. Haryana has notified 200km area from Adi Badri to the Ghaggar via Kaithal for the Saraswati. A mention of the same can even be found in the revenue records.Thakur said Haryana would arrange the entire funding of the project while Himachal will get the benefits, including a share in the water. He added that 3.92 hectare metre water per annum would be earmarked for the state for drinking water requirement and 57.96 hectare metre for irrigation. He said the only 21 families to be displaced from the state would be rehabilitated as per the package for oustees. Any unforeseen cost and expenditure related to Adi Badri dam in future would be borne by Haryana and no liability on this account would be passed on to the hill state, he added.Thakur said HPPCL would be the executing agency for construction of the dam and its related infrastructure. Out of the total proposed area, 31.16 hectare land falls in Himachal, which includes 0.67 hectare private land and 30.49 hectare forest land. The dam, 101.06m wide and 20.5m high, would get 224 hectare metre water from the Som that joins the Yamuna near Adi Badri. The dam would also help in water conservation in the region, said Thakur. Both the governments would be free to prepare tourism projects as well as any other infrastructure facilities that may be required for the welfare and development of local people from their own resources, without compromising on the project’s primary objectives, he added.The area around the dam would be developed as a pilgrimage, said Khattar. From Kalka to Kalesar, the area is very important from the tourism point of view as it has many religious and tourist places — Adi Badri, Lohagarh, Kapal Mochan, Mata Mansa Devi. With the development of the lake along with the dam, many tourists will come here, which will benefit both the states, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/hp-hry-sign-215cr-pact-to-revive-saraswati/articleshow/89049724.cms||---

She stated that her son L Manikandan died due to custodial torture in December. Justice G R Swaminathan said that the court had earlier ordered re-postmortem on the body of the deceased. The forensic experts had given a final opinion to the effect that the deceased appeared to have died due to poisoning. The doctors who performed both the postmortems have categorically noted that no injuries were found on the private parts and no major ante mortem injuries were found on the body.The judge observed that no case has been made out to suspect that Manikandan died due to custodial torture and this is a tentative conclusion of this court to deny relief in this petition. The family of the deceased could file a protest petition before the concerned judicial magistrate court when the police file a final report and it is for the magistrate to take a call on this matter, the judge said.The court passed the order after taking into account the report filed by the police stating that the two-wheeler driven by the deceased appeared to be a stolen vehicle. Due to this reason he did not stop the vehicle during the vehicle check. However, he was secured and brought to the police station. The deceased was asked to bring the documents for the vehicle. Fearing that he would be exposed, Manikandan might have consumed poison.Police further submitted that the brother of the deceased had also contacted his relative Hariharan at Chennai and asked to send the RC book of his two-wheeler which was of the same make of that of the stolen vehicle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-for-cbi-probe-into-youths-death/articleshow/89049726.cms||---

Though Promod told TOI that “no authentic paper or proposal has come to the department for consideration”, additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad confirmed that inter-departmental consultation was held on the issue. He, however, refused to reveal the details. But TOI has in its possession a copy of the proposals for amendments under consideration. The amendments, under the title ‘Bihar Prohibition and Excise (Amendment) Act, 2022’, are proposed keeping in view at least 15 hooch deaths in Saran district in the last three days, close on the heels of at least 13 deaths from consumption of spurious liquor in Nalanda district earlier this week. The state government is also mooting some changes in the liquor law in light of the observations made by the Chief Justice of India that the law was enacted without considering its practical ramifications on the courts which have been clogged with liquor law cases in Bihar. One of the proposals is that people caught consuming liquor or intoxicant at home or outside or found drunk or under the influence of any intoxicant for the first time be let off on payment of fine to be notified by the state government. Failure to pay the fine will invite simple imprisonment of one month. However, it will not be applicable on repeat offenders, who will invite additional penalty or imprisonment or both.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/state-mulls-changes-in-liquor-law-min-says-no-proposal-yet/articleshow/89049745.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: Separate link to be created to vaccinate children above 12||PATNA: A separate link will be created on the state health society’s website, where heads of the schools will have to upload the micro planning for the vaccination of children in their respective institutions. Preparation in this regard is going on, especially keeping in mind the vaccination of children above 12 years, which is supposed to start from March. State health society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parasar on Friday said the data hosting work was going on and once completed, each school head will give the micro planning for vaccination in their schools. “This will include the number of children who will fall under the category of beneficiaries for vaccination, name and contact of nodal teacher and that of the head. Once these information are available, we will tag the vaccinators,” said Parasar, adding the state was planning in advance ahead of vaccination of children from 12 and above. Parasar further said this method will help them know the exact number of children and will ease the process of vaccination. Earlier this week, chairman of central government’s Covid-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, Dr NK Arora, had said vaccination of children from 12 to 14 years will start from March. Parasar said they had started the preparation in this regard and once the signal is given from the Centre, they will roll out the vaccination process in Bihar. As of now, vaccination of children above 15 years is going on across the country, including Bihar. The data till Friday afternoon showed that 33.36 lakh teenagers in the state had been inoculated with the first dose of the vaccine and account for nearly 40% of the targeted population. There are a total 83.46 lakh beneficiaries in this age group in Bihar. Parasar further said the state was fourth in the country in terms of vaccination coverage. Till Friday afternoon, over 10.90 crore doses had been inoculated in Bihar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/separate-link-to-be-created-to-vaccinate-children-above-12/articleshow/89049747.cms||Sheezan Nezami

These charges are likely to vary from Rs 10 to Rs 50 per person depending on the class of journey .According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, “Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has been assigned the task of developing 123 stations on public-private partnership (PPP) mode in the first phase at the country-level. Out of this, 11 of them are ECR’s Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Motihari, Begusarai, Singrauli, Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Barauni, Dhanbad and Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junctions. However, passengers travelling from these stations will pay station development fee only after completion of development / redevelopment plan of these stations.”Passengers travelling in local passenger trains have been exempted from the SDF levy, while passengers travelling in unreserved coaches of first class, second class and MEMU /DEMU trains will have to pay Rs 10 per person during short journey trip. However, passengers travelling in the reserved coaches of second class sleeper and first class will pay Rs 25 per person, while in the reserved AC class passengers or users will pay Rs 50 per person.According to sources, railways has also enhanced an additional Rs 10 on each platform ticket price at developed /redeveloped stations making it to Rs 20 per platform ticket price. The concept of SDF was in fact approved by the Board much earlier to enable private players to get an assured revenue source when they stepped into station development/redevelopment plan of any station across the country, sources said . As per the plan envisaged, shortlisted stations of the ECR will get green building and they will be equipped with modern facilities like mall, proper ventilation and multipurpose building for commercial and entertainment purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/rlys-to-levy-stn-devpt-fee-from-passengers/articleshow/89049748.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Patna: Is booster dose safe after reinfection? Doctors divided||PATNA: Even as senior citizens and health workers are being administered booster doses at different health centres in the city, people with a recent breakthrough infection are not sure whether they should go for the booster dose now. Health experts and doctors have varying opinions on administration of booster doses to the people who have recently been reinfected with coronavirus even after getting both the doses of vaccine in the past. Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital said there is no specific guideline on the administration of booster doses to the reinfected people. “As per old guidelines of the health department, anyone with a breakthrough infection should wait for a minimum of three months before taking the booster dose,” he said. Dr Kumar added the booster dose would not harm the individual, but it would not help either. “The body would have developed antibodies with the natural infection. Hence, a booster vaccine may not provide any additional relief to citizens,” he added. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer of Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Patna, said the person with any fresh infection should opt for the booster dose only after a month as per present guidelines. The minimum gap of one month may be extended to three months in future, he said. Dr A K Ashu, joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, Patna, said one should take the booster dose at least six weeks after recovering from the reinfection.  “One develops sufficient antibodies after infection and need not take the booster soon after the end of the infection,” he added. Retired civil surgeon Kumkum Prasad said in the UK and other countries, people are being infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus even after taking booster doses. “There are some cases where the infection has occurred soon after vaccination. It could take 28 days for antibodies to increase,” she said. Former chief medical officer of Patna University Central Dispensary, Dr Prabhakar Devraj, said nothing can be said conclusively about the exact gap required between two doses or between the recovery from infection and the booster dose. “In fact, sufficient studies on the ever-changing variants of coronavirus are yet to be made. Earlier, those infected with smallpox would develop natural immunity. They were not getting reinfected with this virus. But, the coronavirus is behaving quite differently. Hence, there is no harm in getting the booster dose soon after the recovery from any fresh infection,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/is-booster-dose-safe-after-reinfection-docs-divided/articleshow/89049750.cms||---

He said the possibility of a midterm poll became evident when CM Nitish Kumar recently went to different parts of the state on his “so-called” ‘Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan’ (social reforms campaign). “The CM ventures out on such ‘yatras’ (tour) only when he starts preparations for an election. We never saw Nitish visiting a place even after a major incident. Recently in his home district Nalanda, several people died of consuming poisonous liquor, but we did not see the CM visiting the place. He goes on ‘yatras’ only when he is involved in the preparations of an election,” Chirag said. The LJP (RV) chief also said, “I strongly believe that Nitish has understood that the coalition government in Bihar can fall anytime.” Raising questions over the utility of the CM’s ‘Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan’, Chirag said, “Nitish should not have started the so-called ‘Samaj Sudhar Yatra’ because I do not believe there was any need to reform the natives of Bihar.” Referring to the ongoing war of words among the leaders of the NDA allies, Chirag said he had, since the assembly polls results in 2020, been saying that this (Nitish-led) government was not going to last for a long period. “The current squabbling among the leaders shows it,” he said. Recently, the leaders of BJP and JD(U) engaged in a squabble after a JD(U) spokesperson took a swipe at BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal over his offer of monetary assistance to the family members of some people who had died after consuming liquor in his parliamentary constituency Bettiah in 2021. Jaiswal also engaged in a war of words with JD(U) parliamentary board chairperson and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha over the alleged denigration of Emperor Asoka by a Sahitya Akademi award winner. Kushwaha demanded that the NDA government at the Centre must withdraw the Sahitya Akademi award from the controversial writer. To a question, Chirag said his party would contest the forthcoming state council polls for 24 seats alone. “Right now, my priority is to strengthen the organization and expand the party. We will think about an alliance (with any party) when elections are around,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/state-heading-for-a-midterm-poll-chirag/articleshow/89049751.cms||Madan Kumar

The single bench of Justice Sandeep Kumar, while hearing an anticipatory bail plea, directed the SSP of Patna, SPs of Muzaffarpur, Nawada, Nalanda and Sheikhpura as well as the state’s Economic Offences Unit (EOU) -- the nodal police wing to investigate cybercrimes in Bihar -- to expedite investigations and curb cybercrimes and vishing frauds made through deceptive phone calls by tracking the “insiders” of the banks from where the data base of the customers are “leaked”. Justice Kumar orally cautioned the investigating agencies not to be rude with the bank officials during investigation. The court also expressed its displeasure on the attitude of the banks in escaping their responsibilities towards their customers who were falling prey to the vishing frauds. The matter will be next heard on January 27. Additional public prosecutor Jharkhandi Upadhyay informed the court that cybercrime cases are being handled with an iron fist and in one of the vishing frauds probe, the swindled money was recovered. The court directed that the banks in other vishing fraud cases under investigation should also strive for return of their customers’ money after tracking the movement of the money debited fraudulently. The Patna high court through the hearing of this anticipatory bail has been monitoring the crackdown on cyber criminals and vishing frauds in the state. The case is from Nawada. During the hearing of the case on October 21, 2021, the court had observed that “it cannot allow Nawada to become another Jamtara”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hc-to-cops-quiz-bank-officials-in-vishing-frauds-cybercrime-cases/articleshow/89049755.cms||---

Orally observing that it is a “classic example” of procrastinated project, the court reminded the authorities about its previous orders whereby it was clarified that pendency of any application/claim/objection would not preclude them in either taking over possession or demolishing the structures in course of the project works.Additional advocate general (AAG) Anjani Kumar and advocate Alok Rahi appeared for the state, while Dr Maurya Vijay represented the NHAI, Dr K N Singh the Centre and P K Shahi as amicus curiae.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/talk-to-stakeholders-and-expedite-nh-works-court-tells-state-govt/articleshow/89049758.cms||---

Already, Ashok Prashar Pappi, who was once a big face in Congress is contesting on the AAP ticket from Central constituency and now his brother Rakesh Prashar, who has been councillor several times joined AAP on Thursday along with several other Congress leaders. Some of the major names who have switched over to AAP from Congress include former councillors Ajay Nayyar, Satnam Ahuja and Mahinder Saini.According to Prashar, “The rift and factionalism inside the Congress have made the conditions so toxic for the loyal Congress workers and they are feeling choked, moreover they are often being ignored and sidelined. This is why so many well known Congress leaders from Ludhiana central decided to call it quits and join AAP, which is the only party that knows how to honour and value honest and dedicated workers. All of us together will work for ensuring the victory of all AAP candidates in Ludhiana, specially the central constituency where people are desperately demanding change.” Dawar is two-time MLA from central seat and in 2017, Dawar had won by huge margin by getting 47,871 votes and the runner up on the seat, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromanli Akali Dal (SAD) coalition’s candidate Gurdev Sharma Debi managed to get 27,391 votes, while AAP and Lok Insaf Party (LIP)’s joint candidate Vipan Sood Kaka had secured 25,001 votes from this seat.However, this time the situation is very different as BJP, SAD, LIP and AAP are contesting on their own. From BJP, Gurdev Sharma Debi has been announced the candidate while SAD has fielded Pritpal Singh Pali and LIP is yet to decide on the candidate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/trouble-for-dawar-cong-as-several-big-faces-join-aap/articleshow/89049765.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Kanpur||‘Catch the fourth suspect so that case can be investigated properly’||Kanpur: Vijay Awasthi, a software engineer, who helped the city police catch the thief while sitting in the USA, informed the police that he came to know that a man of the locality had provided vital clues to the thieves about his closed house.“I request the police to immediately catch the fourth suspect along with two others who had already been identified so that the investigation of the whole case can be done properly,” Vijay said while talking to TOI over phone from the US.To recall, a burglar’s bid to rob a house in Harihar Dham in Shyam Nagar area of Chakeri was foiled after the house owner’s two sons, staying in the US, noticed his movement on their mobile phones linked with CCTV cameras installed at their parents’ house and alerted the police.The CCTV cameras, which played an important role in preventing the theft, were brought from America. The technology of the cameras is very special due to which they got the thief arrested, he said. After the death of his father and the marriage of his sisters, his mother used to live alone in the house, he further said.“I had employed a care-taker for the security of my house. "About a year and a half ago, I bought the CCTV cameras from Blink Company of America for the safety of my mother. Cameras of this company are not available in India at present," Vijay said. Vijay’s brother Ashutosh said that when he had recently visited Kanpur he took his mother along and locked the house.He and his brother Vijay both are software engineers. Vijay is in HCL and he is working in TCS. Vijay is in Philadelphia while he lives with his family in Chicago, Ashutosh said."On Monday last, it was 11:38 pm in India and about one O'clock in the afternoon in America. While working in the office, an alert message came and in no time my brother Vijay called me and said that someone is present inside the house. We saw through CCTV cameras that the miscreants were jumping down from the roof. They stayed only in the garden area and did not go inside the house," Ashutosh said. He said audio speakers have also been installed in the house along with CCTV cameras due to which he often talks to the caretaker. Through the audio system connected to this CCTV camera, he warned the thieves and said, “You have been outnumbered… it is better to leave the place. After this, they broke the CCTV cameras but some hidden cameras kept the view visible”. He then alerted the neighbours and the police and informed them about the presence of thieves in the house. After this, the police surrounded the house and caught one of the thieves in the encounter. Ashutosh said that he had seen more than three miscreants after which the police did a lot of search in the house but the two other miscreants managed to flee.Around 25000-30000 rupees had to be spent in installing these cameras. “The amount is not big but with the help of technology, the theft bid was foiled,” he said. These CCTV not only remain functional 24x7, but their other special feature is that they cannot be damaged easily. "Speakers are also connected to them and with their help a person sitting far away can also talk. A button is there to talk to someone within 45 feet of range. Even though, after being warned, the thieves broke the camera, the setup continued to work. They had cut the wire, thinking they would cut off the contacts, but the cameras have extra batteries, which keep them active for a long time," he further said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/catch-the-fourth-suspect-so-that-case-can-be-investigated-properly/articleshow/89049767.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Trichy||Conversion bid: Tamil Nadu cops probing ‘nun’ cited by 17-year-old girl who died by suicide||THANJAVUR: With allegations of an attempt to convert the 17-year-old girl, who died by suicide in Thanjavur on Wednesday, taking centre stage, police have brought a ‘nun’ under the ambit of their investigation in this regard. This follows a video of the girl pointing fingers at the nun for asking her to convert to Christianity doing the rounds in social media. M Lavanya, a resident of Vadugapalayam in Ariyalur district, was a Class XII student at Sacred Heart HSS at Michaelpatti in Thanjavur. She had consumed an insecticide on her school campus on January 9 and died at Thanjavur medical college hospital on January 19. She was staying in the school hostel. In her statement to police on January 16, she alleged that hostel warden Sagayamary had made her clean hostel rooms, which pushed her to the extreme step. Sagayamary was subsequently arrested. Meanwhile, in a 47-second video, the girl is seen talking about a nun who asked her parents permission to convert her to Christianity two years ago. When the man behind the screen asks if her parents’ refusal was the reason why she was being harassed by the warden, the girl says “it may be”. Thanjavur medical college hospital police have booked unknown people for recording the video under sections of IPC and Juvenile Justice Act. District superintendent of police Ravali Priya Gandhapuneni told TOI that they had identified the nun mentioned by the girl though her identity can’t be revealed. Parents and relatives of Lavanya refused to receive her body on Friday after the post-mortem. “They are demanding action against the lady. We have asked for time for investigation. The offence has to be made out and for that we have to do proper scientific investigation,” she said. Lavanya’s father S Muruganandham had also alleged harassment by Sagayamari in his statement on January 15. The girl in her dying declaration to the magistrate on January 16 however didn’t mention about the conversion. After the video was out following her death, Muruganandham submitted a petition to the SP on Thursday linking a nun and Sagayamary to the religious conversion. However, police have questioned the timing of the release of the video. “Had they given us the video when she was alive, we would have recorded an additional dying declaration and smoothened things out,” the SP said. She said the statements of her parents were being recorded on Friday to find out if there was any coercion behind their second petition. Attempts to contact Muruganandham went in vain. BJP had protested the alleged religious conversion attempt in Thanjavur and sought compensation for the girl’s family. President of Manithaneya Makkal Katchi and MLA M H Jawahirullah expressed disapproval at BJP and Hindu outfits linking her death to religious conversion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/conversion-bid-cops-probing-nun-cited-by-17-year-old-girl-who-died-by-suicide/articleshow/89048685.cms||---
---||Delhi||SDMC identifies 226 e-charging spots||NEW DELHI: Working on the central government’s stipulation that at least one e-charging station for electric vehicles should be available in a 2x2km grid, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has identified 226 feasible locations and hopes to install most charging stations by the end of the current financial year. While permission has been obtained from various agencies for such stations at 143 places, 35 stations have been energised and work is in progress at 25 sites. On Thursday, SDMC inaugurated e-charging stations for two-wheelers at South Extension, Defence Colony, Hauz Khas and Safdarjung Enclave, with two more to become operational this week. After inaugurating the two stations at South Extension, Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi tweeted, “Electric vehicles are the future of sustainable and holistic mobility. The setting up of charging infrastructure will enable greater adoption of EVs by the public.” The civic body started installing charging stations in 2020. “Initially, the progress was slow because we needed a lot of coordinated action in identifying suitable sites at parking lots, tying up with agencies to put the system in place and ascertaining power supply,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, Remunerative and Project Cell, SDMC. “But things began picking up in 2021 and we could enter into a contract with agencies and subsidiaries of the Indian government.” SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that once these stations became operational in two-three months, south Delhi residents could confidently buy e-vehicles. “At present, there is apprehension among people due to lack of charging facilities. But our aim is to provide such stations every 2sq km, so there will be ample options in the future for motorists,” he said. Of the sites identified for e-charging stations, 10 are in SDMC’s areas bordering New Delhi Municipal Council areas and the south corporation may require the latter's help in power supply. “While uncertainty continues over the implementation of these sites, at the rest of the places we are expecting to complete work by March-end. Depending on the requirement, we will pursue PWD for obtaining permission,” said the official. To motivate people to use electric two wheelers in large numbers, in 2021 the civic body decided to install 35 charging stations for them on main roads. “Even the central government had reduced the rates of electric two wheelers, so we were motivated to go ahead with the project,” said the official. SDMC tied up with TCIL and under the agreement, the latter has the responsibility of installing, maintaining and operating the 35 two-wheelers and 10 four-wheelers e-charging and battery swapping stations, said the official. “Of the 35 sites, PWD has granted permission for stations at 31 sites only so work will not be carried out at other places,” said the official. In November, at eight sites, equipment was installed including South Extension I & II, Bhikaji Cama Place, Sant Nagar and Lajpat Nagar II. Each station for two wheelers has a minimum space for charging four two-wheelers at a time and the civic body may expand it in future depending on space availability.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sdmc-identifies-226-e-charging-spots/articleshow/89048268.cms||Vibha Sharma

Activists working under Punjab Vatavaran Chetna Lehar, a social organisation of environmentalists and religious leaders are planning a special campaign in social media. The activists tried to convince the political parties for including clean air, water and earth in their election manifesto, but leaders did not show much interest so. With Covid cases increasing gradually, the activists have now decided to run the campaign through social media.The major demand of activists is measures to curb the wastage of groundwater, pollution in resources of water like rivers and seasonal drains to be reduced, clean air for people, solid waste management, increase the forest cover and control over sources of noise pollution.Through social media, people will be urged to put their profile picture with a special logo that will be launched in a couple of day. Also, they will be asked to record one-minute video with a message for all political parties demanding clean environment for them. The activists claimed that parties promise everything except that, but people can live without electricity or other facilities, not without water or air. Jaskirat Singh, from Naroa Punjab Manch, said, “We had earlier planned physical events in all major cities and three to four seminars were done already but political parties did not show much response. We handed over our green manifesto to the party heads and manifesto committees. Gradually, Covid cases started increasing so we have now planned online campaign.” Another activist Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja said, “People are very active in social media. We will try to reach out to masses through Twitter, Facebook and other available platforms so that they should ask party candidates about environment security.” He said there is need for the people to join hands to fight for this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/activists-to-use-social-media-to-get-parties-word-on-environment/articleshow/89049769.cms||---

Though some political parties had made some efforts to provide social security to advocates but that was not enough. Pension to senior advocates would give them some social security, he said.He suggested that an advocate who has attained the age of 65 years and has practised for 35 years should be made a beneficiary of the proposed pension scheme with a condition that after retirement he will get Rs 10,000 per month as pension.Similarly, a young advocate who enters the legal profession be given a stipend of Rs 10,000 per month for the first five years till he attains the age of 30 years so that he can use the money in buying law books and journals and also get some financial security, Sharma said. An advocate must also get a health cover insurance of Rs 5 lakh, he added.The Sangharsh Samiti held its meeting virtually on Friday which was attended by senior advocates.

---||Pune||Maharashtra registers 37% fewer Covid deaths in January over November||PUNE: Covid fatalities in Maharashtra dropped by half in December and were 37% fewer in January when compared to deaths reported in November last year. This, despite only around 26,000 new cases being reported in November as against a whopping 6.43 lakh in January alone — a nearly 25-time rise. The state recorded 472 Covid deaths in November last year but the number plunged to 231 in December, the month that saw Omicron starting to dominate. From January 1 to 18, there have been 298 deaths in the state. A state official said though the absolute numbers of Covid deaths have marginally increased this month, the figures are small in proportion to the magnitude of cases. For instance, Maharashtra’s Covid death rate has now plunged to 0.05%, which is the lowest ever since the pandemic began in 2020, a senior state public health department official said. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “The most important takeaway during the current surge is that most cases are mild, and certainly not as severe as those during the Delta wave. Hence, only those with comorbidities or underlying conditions have succumbed to the contagion. Most healthy individuals in the current surge have had asymptomatic/mild to at the most moderate disease profile. This was not the case when the second wave had peaked in Maharashtra, as the virulence was much higher then.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-registers-37-fewer-covid-deaths-in-jan-over-nov/articleshow/89049792.cms||Neha Madaan

The process will start accordingly,” said Ravindra Binwade, PMC’s additional commissioner.He said details about the time limit for accepting suggestions and objections could not be shared now. They would be available after the order from the election commission. It was expected next week. According to the PMC officials, a rough draft for delimitation was given to the state government in December. The commission had suggested 20 changes. The state had also asked the civic bodies to revise the delimitation plan after the SC’s decision to scrap political reservations of OBCs. It would change the reservation of women candidates and also specially reserved seats of OBC aspirants. The delimitation plan was finalized for 173 corporators as the base. The number has gone up from the existing strength of 164. A three-ward panel system has been declared for the elections, which are scheduled in February. The existing system is of a four-ward panel.
