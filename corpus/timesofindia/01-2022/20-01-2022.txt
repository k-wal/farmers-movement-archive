---||India||No 27% OBC quota in local body elections without triple test: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to recall its month-old orders quashing 27% OBC quota in panchayat polls in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and said the state election commissions would dereserve OBC seats in all future local body elections across India unless such quota is determined in strict compliance of SC's triple-test guidelines. A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, DM Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar firmly told the Centre, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, each of which had filed separate applications for recall of the consecutive SC orders on December 15 and 17 quashing 27% OBC quota in Maharashtra and MP, "there is no question of recalling our orders as these were passed after hearing all sides." Giving omnibus status to the two orders by making applicable to all states and UTs the triple test principle laid down by the SC in March 2021 for determining quantum of reservation for socially and economically backward classes (SEBCs), the bench said, if the state governments in future reserved seats for OBC in local bodies "without complying the triple test requirement, then the state election commissions must ensure that the so reserved OBC seats go to election as open category seats." The SC in its March 4, 2021 judgment in Vilas Krishnarao Gawli judgment had provided for the triple test benchmark for states in quantifying OBC quota in local body elections. The three tests are: "1) To set up a dedicated Commission to conduct contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua local bodies, within the State; 2) To specify the proportion of reservation required to be provisioned local body wise in light of recommendations of the Commission, so as not to fall foul of over breadth; 3) In any case such reservation shall not exceed aggregate of 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together." Importantly, the SC clarified that the states cannot rely on the OBC population figure reflected in the Census, conducted by the Union government, for the purpose of determining the quantum of OBC quota in local body elections. The Justice Khanwilkar-led bench said, "In terms of the constitutional amendment for insertion of Article 342A(3) in the Constitution, the state/UT is obliged to prepare a list of SEBCs which can be acted upon for providing reservation to OBCs including in elections to local governments. However, that list will be independent of the Census work undertaken by the Union government under the Census Act. The list to be prepared by States/UTs concerning the SEBCs, in terms of Article 342A(3) of the Constitution which came into force from August 19, 2021, would be independent of the Census to be carried out by the Union government." It said, "The information and data available with the states can be furnished to the dedicated commission, which can examine the efficacy thereof, and take appropriate decision as may be warranted including submission of interim report to the state government making recommendations as may be necessary, which can be taken forward by the concerned states in accordance with law." Article 342A(3) provided that "every State or Union territory may, by law, prepare and maintain, for its own purposes, a list of socially and educationally backward classes, entries in which may be different from the Central List." The list so available with the state, the SC said, would not by itself be the determining factor for quantifying OBC quota in panchayat polls. It said, "This obviously would not override the triple test requirement, which has to be completed in terms of the decision of the SC in Vikas Krishnarao Gawli judgment of March 4, 2021, before providing for reservation of seats for OBCs in local bodies. The Commission may submit an interim report if so advised to the concerned authorities within two weeks from the receipt of information and data from the state government. We may not have understood to have expressed any opinion on the correctness of the information and data to be supplied by the states. It is for the Commission to examine the said data. This observation must also govern the dispensation in other states which intends to proceed with local government elections while providing reservations to the OBC category." The bench said if there is a panchayat poll in future and the commission has not yet given any recommendation, or the state has not relied upon the recommendations of the commission, then there cannot be any reservation for the other backward classes in the local body elections. "If there is an election, it has to be as per the SC judgment laying down the triple test guidelines," it said. However, it clarified that the states can act upon the interim recommendations of the dedicated commission for determining the quantum of OBC quota in panchayat polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-27-obc-quota-in-local-body-elections-without-triple-test-sc/articleshow/89004106.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

After a brief respite for three days — Saturday, Sunday and Monday — when there was a decline in cases, the count is climbing rapidly again for the past two days. With data from some states still awaited, the national tally stood at 3,04,416 as of 11pm. India last reported over 3 lakh cases on May 15 (3,11,077). In the third wave, which has seen a near-exponential rise in cases from December 27, it took just 23 days to push the daily count over 3 lakh. The second wave, which started in the middle of February last year, took over 60 days to reach the mark on April 21 when it was nearing its peak. As many as 356 deaths were reported as of 11pm and the toll is likely to cross Tuesday’s count of 357 as data from Punjab, Jharkhand and Tripura, among others, were yet to come. Since last September, the daily toll had not crossed 300 until recently. Fortunately, the fatality rate of this wave is far lower than the second wave’s. At the level of 3 lakh cases, over 2,000 daily deaths were being reported in the second wave. At the global level, India is the second worst-hit country after the US. On January 17, the date for which the latest data on new cases is available for the US, the country reported more than 8.7 lakh fresh infections. Comparable international data for worst-hit countries shows that in January, Argentina was the only other country apart from India and the US that reported over 1 lakh daily cases. The tally for France and Italy, which had reported more than 1 lakh cases on January 17, was below a lakh for January 18. The death data shows that so far, daily fatalities in India are lower than in countries like the US, Russia, Canada, Mexico and Poland. Barring US, the daily case count for all others is lower than in India. Among states, Maharashtra topped the list and was followed by Karnataka, both reporting more than 40,000 cases on Wednesday. Kerala reported more than 30,000 cases and was followed by Tamil Nadu and Gujarat where the daily count was over 20,000. Six states reported over 10,000 cases; the list included Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Odisha, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in the order of high to low cases. For 12 states, the count was above 1,000 while nine states (mostly in the northeast) and UTs reported less 1,000 fresh cases on Wednesday. Eleven states reported more than 10 deaths on Wednesday. Maharashtra and Kerala — each reporting 49 deaths — were at the top of the list while the count was over 30 for West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-daily-covid-tally-crosses-3-lakh-after-8-months-350-deaths/articleshow/89004160.cms||Atul Thakur

Aparna, who joined BJP at the party headquarters in New Delhi, cited “national interest” as her priority and praised PM Narendra Modi for setting the agenda with schemes targeting cleanliness, women’s empowerment and employment. Although there was no announcement about her getting an election ticket, sources said Aparna was likely to be fielded in the Bakhshi Ka Talab seat as the one she had been vying for — Lucknow Cantonment — was a crowded field in terms of prospective candidates. “Welcome Aparna ji into the BJP family,” CM Yogi Adityanath tweeted along with a picture of her flanked by him and BJP president JP Nadda at the party’s national headquarters. Aparna, the wife of Mulayam’s younger son Prateek Yadav by his second wife Sadhna Gupta, follows in the footsteps of the SP founder’s niece Sandhya Yadav, who joined BJP in 2017, and Sirsaganj MLA Hari Om Yadav, uncle-in-law of Mulayam’s grandnephew and Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap. Hari Om switched to BJP last week, coinciding with an exodus of saffron party legislators to SP. Former MLA Pramod Gupta, a brother-in-law of Mulayam’s wife, is expected to join BJP soon. Congratulating his sister-in-law for joining BJP, SP national president and former CM Akhilesh Yadav said “Netaji (Mulayam)” tried hard to convince her not to make the switch, but she decided to go ahead with it. “I extend my good wishes (to her),” Akhilesh said. “I am happy that this way, our samajwadi (socialist) ideology has reached other political parties. I hope our socialist ideology will help save the Constitution and democracy there (in BJP).” On whether Aparna jumped ship because she was denied a poll ticket by SP, Akhilesh said the process of selecting candidates was still under way. “Tickets are given on the basis of ground reports about a candidate and on the basis of the party’s internal survey,” he said. Aparna had contested the Lucknow Cantonment seat as an SP candidate in 2017 and lost to BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi. For Akhilesh, who had grabbed the bragging rights a week ago after he got three disgruntled ex-BJP ministers from the backward castes and over half a dozen MLAs to his side, Aparna's exit is more of a psychological blow than any setback on the ground, sources said. The buzz in BJP about cracks in the Yadav clan is a throwback to the 2017 assembly poll run-up, when the rift between Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal Yadav came out in the open. Shivpal quit SP to form Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), allowing BJP to brand Akhilesh “incapable” of managing the state as he couldn’t even solve a family dispute. While Shivpal and Akhilesh have buried the hatchet and announced that PSP (L) would contest the ensuing elections under the SP symbol, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya harked back to the 2017 rift on Wednesday to suggest that history might repeat itself with another member of the clan switching to BJP. Aparna had, of course, made her admiration for PM Modi known on several occasions earlier. When Akhilesh criticised VHP’s donation drive for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, calling it the work of “chandajeevis”, she donated Rs 11 lakh. Soon after Yogi became UP CM five years ago, Aparna and husband Prateek had visited him. Yogi returned the favour by visiting Kanha Upvan, a cow shelter being managed by the couple in Lucknow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/msys-daughter-in-law-aparna-joins-bjp-bro-in-law-may-follow/articleshow/89004272.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Lucknow||UP polls 2022: Rallies out, netas go ‘phygital’, step up visits to voters’ homes||Don’t be surprised if you see a politician turn up at your doorstep every other day. Social media remains their main playground in a Covid-restricted election campaign, but candidates across party lines have turned to a more ‘phygital’ strategy to reach out to voters as the first phase of the seven-part UP assembly election draws closer and the limits of cybersphere in matching the warmth of a personal connection are acutely felt. Since physical rallies are banned till January 22, candidates have started going door to door to meet people, picking a few neighbourhoods at a time, with small groups of supporters within the limits allowed under Covid protocols. The candidates are banking on visiting as many houses as possible, which would make the elections unique in terms of personal visits that an MLA aspirant makes to voters’ homes. Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are being used to spread the word about these visits with updates. Manveer Singh, the BSP candidate from Dadri who has been starting his door-to-door visits as early as 6am, described these as “an extremely necessary initiative to connect with people”. AAP’s Noida candidate Pankaj Awana, too, has been active across neighbourhoods, helped by party functionaries, including district chief Bhupendra Singh Jadaun. The current Covid restrictions have made parties cagey about banking on outdoor rallies when permission is eventually granted. They fear the restrictions may be extended by a few more days and time is running out with three weeks left for the first phase and a lot of ground to cover. SP is planning to set up screens to beam its campaign rallies. Rahul Chaudhary, the Ghaziabad city president of SP, said, “Our party is waiting for January 23 to know whether permission to hold rallies will be granted or not. In case it does not happen, we plan to put up large screens in various locations and hold digital rallies. We will make sitting arrangements according to the Election Commission’s norms and other Covid protocols.” BJP, which has an advantage over others with its well-established IT cell, has been using various digital tools to reach voters. Mobile video call applications are playing a big role. BJP’s Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, who has been down with Covid for a week now, is connecting with RWA members and associations through such apps. His Twitter account also gives regular updates about his interactions. Singh had announced on January 16 that he had tested positive but promised to remain constantly in touch with people in the constituency and party workers online. He hopes to get back on the field soon. Independent candidate from Dadri Amit Basoya believes his WhatsApp and Instagram reach will help him match candidates from bigger parties in reach. That way, digital campaigning is a great leveller. Still, with marketing companies being hired by candidates, some have the advantages of amplification that others don’t. Vans carrying LED screens have been deployed in rural areas by some parties where data connectivity is patchy and not many may carry a smartphone. While there is a ban on roadshows, cycle/bike/vehicle rallies and processions, indoor meetings with a maximum of 300 people or 50% of the capacity of a hall are allowed. Anil Yadav, husband of Congress candidate from Noida Pankhuri Pathak and a Congress member himself, said, “We are walking several kilometres during door-to-door campaigning. Party workers and friends are helping us in our digital campaign. We are holding virtual meets as well to connect with our voters.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/rallies-out-netas-go-phygital-step-up-visits-to-voters-homes/articleshow/89004345.cms||Aditya Dev

Six return flights—three of which were scheduled to depart India for the US Thursday—were cancelled, said an airline source. A day earlier, the airline had cancelled eight return flights. A total of 734 passengers who had checked in for three flights scheduled for early Wednesday have been accommodated in hotels, the source said, adding Air India hopes to get a clearance to operate its Boeing 777 flights to the US to fly the stranded flyers. Later in the day, President Biden said service providers have agreed to delay 5G deployment around key airports. Among the Thursday cancellations were Air India flights from Delhi to Newark, Chicago and San Francisco. At the time of going to press, sources said that Air India was likely to operate the Delhi-New York-Delhi and Delhi-Washington-Delhi flights. A decision on the Mumbai-Newark flight was pending. “Washington airport doesn’t have 5G C-band transmission stations in the vicinity and so flights to this destination won’t be affected,” said an airline source. Read AlsoFAA sets rules for some Boeing 787 landings near 5G serviceBy David Koenig Washington, Jan 15 (AP) Federal safety officials are directing operators of some Boeing planes to adopt extra procedures when landing on wet or snowy runways near impending 5G service because, they say, interference from the wireless networks could mean that the planes need more roomThe problem pertains to 5G services using frequencies in a radio spectrum called the C-band as these frequencies are close to those used by a radio altimeter installed on board aircraft. Since a radio altimeter is the only sensor onboard an aircraft that gives accurate information of an aircraft’s height over ground, any interference with its readings could be hazardous. Consequently, in December, the US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), issued a directive that essentially banned all low-visibility landings once 5G was deployed. The 5G rollout was postponed from January 5 to allow the FAA time to work out a solution. Read AlsoExplained: Why airlines are worried about 5G rolloutNEW DELHI: Major international airlines are either rejigging their flight schedules to the US or cancelling them altogether amid concerns over rollout of 5G mobile phone technology near US airports. Two US telecom giants -- AT&T and Verizon -- had announced they would be activating their 5G networksIn a temporary respite to airlines, FAA recently issued a list of radio altimeter models (installed on Boeing aircraft) which were found to be “robust” enough against 5G C-band interference. Among these are the Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft, which are also the planes that Air India operates to the US. Boeing aircraft equipped with these permitted altimeters can continue low-visibility landings in the 5G C-Band deployment areas till January 31, said the FAA in a letter sent to Boeing, dated January 18. Altimeter manufacturers evaluated data from the wireless companies to determine how robust each (radio altimeter) model is, it said. “This work has shown some altimeters are reliable and accurate in the 5G areas, others must be retrofitted or replaced,” it said. The FAA has also issued a long list of airports to which aircraft equipped with these particular radio altimeters can operate even in low-visibility conditions. The list covers all the US airports that Air India operates to, except New York-JFK. “But if Air India’s Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 aircraft are not equipped with that particular model of radio altimeters then the airline’s US flights will continue to be hit till the time the altimeters are not retrofitted or replaced or some other solution is reached,” said a source. Read AlsoAT&T, Verizon agree to delay 5G implementation at some airportsAT&T and Verizon agreed Tuesday to a partial delay in activating their 5G networks to allay airline safety concerns but several major international carriers said they were canceling or amending some US services.A statement from Air India was awaited at the time of going to press. Meanwhile, the US government will be working to find a solution that would allow 5G signals and aviation to safely co-exist, the White House said in a statement dated January 18.

---||India||SC: Reach out to kin for Covid ex gratia, don’t wait for claims||NEW DELHI: After summoning the chief secretaries of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh with three hours’ notice to appear virtually for slow disbursal of Covid compensation, the Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up some states for not taking proactive steps and asked the authorities to reach out to the families of the victims without waiting for them to file claims. The court directed that not even a single family should be deprived of the compensation for losing their dear ones to the Covid pandemic and that claim applications must not be rejected on technical grounds. A bench of Justices M R Shah and Sanjiv Khanna pulled up various state governments, including Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, for not disbursing compensation to even those cases which were officially accepted by the state as Covid deaths many months ago. The bench directed all states and UTs to immediately disburse the amount in all those cases which had already been accepted as Covid deaths without waiting for claims. The court said states have all the information, like names and addresses, of those officially declared as Covid deaths and directed that authorities should reach out to such families to disburse the amount without delay. Hailing the efforts made by Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana — states in which the number of claim applications filed was multiple times the official Covid toll — the bench said a large number of people came forward and filed claim applications because of awareness of the scheme as the governments concerned gave wide publicity to it. “How can the number of claim applications be less than the official death figures. It’s because of lack of information among people and states have to take steps to disseminate information... State governments are not taking steps and we have to take the help of state and district legal services authorities to reach out to those families,” the court said, adding that states are not showing sensitivity in dealing with the issue to extend a helping hand to families, many of whom are in distress. As reported by TOI on Tuesday, the number of Covid compensation claims received by some states far exceed their official count of deaths. As per the data compiled by Centre, the number of claim applications is less than the number of officially declared Covid deaths in some states, including Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab and Rajasthan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reach-out-to-kin-for-covid-ex-gratia-dont-wait-for-claims/articleshow/89003970.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||India at UN: 1993 blasts brain getting Pak’s 5-star treatment||NEW YORK: The crime syndicate responsible for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts is enjoying 5-star hospitality in Pakistan and given state protection”, the Indian envoy at the UN said, in a veiled reference to Dawood Ibrahim. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti on Tuesday told the International Counter Terrorism Conference 2022 organised by the Global Counter Terrorism Council that linkages between terror and transnational organised crime must be addressed vigorously. In August 2020, Pakistan had for the first time acknowledged the presence of Dawood on its soil after the government imposed sweeping sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders. Tirumurti, who is also the chair of the UNSC Counter-terrorism Committee for 2022, said that the UN sanctions regimes, including the 1267 al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, are pivotal to the international efforts in preventing terror-financing, terrorist-travel and access to arms by the terrorist organisations. He, however, voiced concern that the implementation of these measures remains challenging. “It is critical that all sanctions regimes established by the council ensure due process in their working procedures and decision-making. The decision-making process and listing/delisting measures should be objective, swift, credible, evidence based and transparent, and not for political and religious considerations,” the Indian ambassador said. He said that a recent report of the monitoring team on the asset freeze exemption procedures pursuant to resolution 2560 (2020) points to the lacunae of asset freeze measures by member states, partly due to deficiencies in the existing guidelines of the Committee. India also termed as “dangerous” the tendency of several UN members, driven by their political, religious, and other motivations, to label terrorism into categories such as racially motivated violent extremism and right-wing extremism, saying this will take the world back to the pre-9/11 era of labelling them as “your terrorists” and “my terrorists”. Tirumurti said that in the global counter-terrorism domain, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had proved to be a “turning point in our approach towards terrorism.” The September 11 attacks highlighted that the threat of terrorism is grave and universal and can only be defeated by the collective efforts of all UN member states, he said. The Indian envoy said that the Islamic State (ISIS) has changed its modus operandi with its core focus is now on regaining ground in Syria and Iraq, and its regional affiliates are strengthening their expansion, especially in Africa and in Asia. “Similarly, al-Qaida remains a major threat and recent developments in Afghanistan have only served to re-energise them,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-at-un-1993-blasts-brain-getting-paks-5-star-treatment/articleshow/89004538.cms||---
---||World||People who are both vaccinated & have survived prior Covid bout are most protected: US study||NEW YORK: Concluding that getting the shots is still the safest way to prevent Covid-19, a new study in two states that compares coronavirus protection from prior infection and vaccination found people who were both vaccinated and had survived a prior bout had the most protection. But unvaccinated people with a prior infection were a close second, according to the study, which examined infections in New York and California last summer and fall. By fall, when the more contagious Delta variant had taken over but boosters weren't yet widespread, those people had lower diagnoses than vaccinated people who had no past infection.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released the study Wednesday, noted several caveats to the research. And some outside experts were cautious of the findings and wary of how they might be interpreted.  "The bottom line message is that from symptomatic Covid infection you do generate some immunity," said immunologist E John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania. "But it's still much safer to get your immunity from vaccination than from infection."  Vaccination has long been urged even after a prior case of Covid-19 because both kinds of protection eventually wane - and there are too many unknowns to rely only on a past infection, especially a long-ago one, added immunologist Ali Ellebedy at Washington University in St Louis.  "There are so many variables you cannot control that you just cannot use it as a way to say, 'Oh, I'm infected then I am protected,'" Ellebedy said.  The research does fall in line with a small cluster of studies that found unvaccinated people people with a previous infection had lower risks of Covid diagnosis or illness than vaccinated people who were never before infected.  The findings do seem plausible, said Christine Petersen, a University of Iowa epidemiologist. She said a vaccine developed against an earlier form of the coronavirus is likely to become less and less effective against newer, mutated versions.  However, she and other experts said, there are a number of possible other factors at play, including whether the vaccine's effectiveness simply faded over time in many people and to what extent mask wearing and other behaviors played a part in what happened.  CDC officials noted the study was done before the Omicron variant took over and before many Americans received booster doses, and so it's not clear what impact boosters might have. The analysis also did not address the risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19.  The study authors concluded vaccination "remains the safest strategy" to prevent infections and "all eligible persons should be up to date with Covid-19 vaccination."  The researchers looked at infections in California and New York, which together account for about 18% of the U.S. population. They also looked at Covid-19 hospitalizations in California.  Overall, about 70% of the adults in each state were vaccinated; another 5% were vaccinated and had a previous infection. A little under 20% weren't vaccinated; and roughly 5% were unvaccinated but had a past infection.  The researchers looked at Covid-19 cases from the end of last May until mid-November, and calculated how often new infections happened in each group.  Compared with unvaccinated people who hadn't been diagnosed with Covid-19, case rates were six-fold lower in California and 4.5-fold lower in New York in those who were vaccinated but not previously infected.  They were 29-fold lower in California and 15-fold lower in New York in those who had been infected but never vaccinated while 32.5-fold lower in California and 20-fold lower in New York in those who had been infected and vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/people-who-are-both-vaccinated-have-survived-prior-covid-bout-are-most-protected-us-study/articleshow/89004627.cms||---
---||India||SC reserves order on MLAs suspension||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its order on the pleas of 12 BJP MLAs challenging the Maharashtra assembly’s decision to suspend them for one year for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer. Wrapping up the hearing, a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar granted the parties one week to file their written submissions. During the hearing, the aggrieved MLAs submitted that prolonged suspension was worse than expulsion and it’s also a punishment for the constituency which would remain unrepresented in the House for a long period. The one-year suspension was grossly irrational, arbitrary and illegal, they alleged. On December 14 last year, the Supreme Court had sought responses from the Maharashtra legislative assembly and the state government on the pleas filed by the MLAs challenging the resolution passed by the House to suspend them for one year. The MLAs are Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Parag Alavani, Harish Pimpale, Yogesh Sagar, Jay Kumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Bunty Bhangdia. The bench further observed that suspension beyond six months might be against constitutional provisions and such prolonged suspension would be against democracy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reserves-order-on-mlas-suspension/articleshow/89004721.cms||---

He said, “Unfortunately, of late we have in this country, young persons, students, stand-up comedians and the like all being booked for freely criticising the government of the day under sedition laws, which are really colonial in nature and have no place under our Constitution. On the other hand, you have persons giving hate speech, what is called fighting words in Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire, or hate speech, actually calling for genocide of the entire (inaudible). And we find reluctance somehow of the authority to book these people.’’ He added, “We have the other higher echelons of the governing party not only being silent qua hate speech but almost endorsing it.” He also said, “We heard the other day from the very head of the party, a juxtaposition of a Mughal emperor known for being a bigot, namely, Aurangzeb, as against Shivaji who was known to be a secular leader.” Justice Nariman was giving the keynote address on ‘Constitutional Underpinnings of the Rule of Law’ at a virtual inauguration of D M Harish School of Law on January 14 as the chief guest. “It was heartening to note at least that a little later, the vice-president of the country (M Venkaiah Naidu) in a speech said ‘hate speech is unconstitutional’,” he said. He stated, “not only is it unconstitutional it is a criminal act. It is criminalised under Section 153A and 505(c) of the IPC. Unfortunately, in practice though a person can be given up to three years’ imprisonment this never really happens because there are no minimum sentences prescribed. If we really want to strengthen the rule of law as contained in our Constitution, I would suggest that Parliament amend these provisions to prove a minimum sentence, so that it acts as deterrence for others to make hate speech of this kind.” Justice Nariman said “whatever we take for granted in terms of the Constitutional rule of law can never be taken for granted. It is very important to remember that eternal vigilance is necessary not only for liberty but for liberty enforced by courts which is the rule of law of India.” “Now, if as a matter of fact fraternity is a cardinal value in our constituency and you want to engage persons in becoming a brotherhood I would have thought that you should have chosen Mughal emperor Babar or his grandson Akbar. Akbar was famous for being perhaps one of the most secular leaders that any nation has ever known at any point of time…” said the wx Judge. He read out a “beautiful letter” from Babar to son Humayun on how to rule. Justice Nariman had begun his speech by delving into the history of 'rule of law'. He started by saying, “The rule of law has not come down as manna from heaven. As a matter of fact it has involved centuries of struggle. First between a monarch and an elected member of parliament and in its second phase, between elected members of parliament and other so called branches of government. But to begin at the beginning we must go back in Anglo Saxon jurisprudence to the year 1066—in which two cataclysmic events took place, one was Haley’s comet passed over England and most of the World…and the second was victory of William of Normandy over King Herald in England.’’ With Norman rulers came a more ineffective series of laws together with a monarch, said the retired Judge. William the conqueror came and died and then his son William the Second “more ruthless” also died in 1100 and then came Henry the First, he went on. His coronation Charter is perhaps the “first important document that we have in English Constitutional Law that established rule of law.’’ “The nobles bargained with Henry the First, and made him lay down that excessive taxes would not be collected, that justice would be tempered with mercy…’’ adding “It laid down very fundamental rudiments of rule of law.’’ Justice Nariman mentioned how the Magna Carta was signed in June 1215 (document in Latin) between Barons or the Lords and King John. It had 63 clauses. He said that after King John was no more, his son Henry the Third decided in favour of Magna Carta. “We are concerned with famous clauses 39 and 40 which lay down the rudiments of rule of law as we know it today,’’ said the ex-Justice Nariman. Clause 39 and 40 essentially say that no free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgment of his peers and the law of the land. The ex-Judge said, “Great freedoms in article 20 –prohibits self-incrimination--and 21—right to life and liberty (of the Indian Constitution) hark back to Magna Carta. Article 22 allows you a lawyer of your choice and being produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours. He went through several more fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution and pointed to how Article 32 is a “unique feature of our constitution’’ allowing people to move the SC so that their fundamental rights are protected. The judiciary is set up as being as the institution which ultimately gives the person the right to enforce it, he said “it is with this independent judiciary that rule of law is ultimately maintained.’’ Kishu Mansukhani Trustee, Niranjan Hiranandani provost HSNC University and advocate Anil Harish trustee and past president of HSNC Board and others were the other guests of honour at the inauguration event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-sc-judge-sedition-laws-colonial-in-nature-junk-them/articleshow/89004753.cms||Swati Deshpande

It’s a very serious matter and we are going to take action against secretary home in case of any further delay,” a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar said. In this case, the SC had on December 13 granted bail to Vijay Kumar Sharma who was arrested in connection with the Rs 3,500-crore Noida “bike bot” Ponzi scheme and was facing FIRs registered against him across UP. But he was not released even more than a month after SC order and was compelled to bring it to court’s notice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bail-given-month-back-but-man-not-freed-yet-sc-pulls-up-up-govt/articleshow/89004805.cms||---

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said non-compliance of SC’s directions “is wilful and deliberate and amounts to contempt of this court”. The case pertains to claims of state government employees who were asked to join the treasury department from various corporations in the aftermath of fodder scam but their tenure at corporations were not considered by state for pensionary and retiral benefits. The employees thereafter approached the SC through their lawyer Somesh Chandra Jha and the court passed the order in their favour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-contempt-notice-to-bihar-babus-former-chief-secretary/articleshow/89004822.cms||---

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday pointed out a recent case in Dausa where a farmer died with an outstanding kisan loan of Rs 7 lakh. Banks auctioned his land as his family failed to repay the loan amount. “The Congress government in Rajasthan has crossed all limits of cruelty against farmers,” Goyal tweeted, and tagged an agency report that quoted the farmer’s son as saying he had requested the authorities to postpone the auction and give a chance but they refused. “Farmer lands are being snatched on false promises of loan waiver in Congress-governed states,” he said, adding that many of these distressed farmers are ending their lives. An agency report said that the Dausa farmer had taken the loan from Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank and defaulted on its repayment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-slams-raj-govt-as-banks-auction-land-of-defaulting-farmers/articleshow/89004845.cms||---
---||World||June 13 date set for state trial for 3 cops in Floyd's death||MINNEAPOLIS: A state court trial for three former Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd has been rescheduled for June 13, after both the defence and prosecutors requested a postponement. Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao face charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter. Their trial was supposed to start March 7, but both sides sought a delay because the three officers also face a federal trial on allegations that they violated Floyd's civil rights while acting under government authority. Their federal trial starts Thursday with jury selection.  Derek Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder and manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breath. Kueng and Lane helped restrain the 46-year-old Black man as he was on the ground. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back and Lane held down Floyd's legs. Thao kept bystanders from intervening.  Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to a federal count of violating Floyd's civil rights during the May, 25, 2020, arrest. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years on the state murder conviction, and is awaiting sentencing in the federal case.  The killing, which was captured on video, galvanized protests against police brutality around the globe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/june-13-date-set-for-state-trial-for-3-cops-in-floyds-death/articleshow/89004894.cms||---

It also said the press must “eschew” news that promotes enmity or hatred between people on caste, race or communal lines. The PCI advisory said print media should not to publish any news items or other contents in violation of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. It emphasised the responsibility of media in bringing all election related information to the public and asked the press to observe all directions, orders and instructions of the Election Commission, returning officers and chief electoral officer, issued from time to time. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur will go to polls between February 10 and March 7. Counting of votes is to be done on March 10. In its advisory, the PCI said in the event of staggered polls, no newspaper shall publish exit-poll surveys. “However, genuine they may be, till the last date of polls is over,” it added. It also stressed on the “duty of the press to publish objective reports about the contesting candidates”. “Newspapers are not expected to indulge in unhealthy election campaigns, exaggerated reports about any candidate or party or incident during the elections,” it said, adding that “while reporting on the actual campaign, a newspaper may not leave out any important point raised by a candidate and make an attack on his or her opponent."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-violate-rp-act-in-poll-reporting-pci-to-print-media/articleshow/89004886.cms||---

For several categories of loans of up Rs 2 crore – given to MSMEs or as housing, education, personal or auto loans – the government had provided Rs 5,500 crore in the budget for the current financial year. But overall claims now add up to Rs 6,474 crore, requiring an additional provision in the budget, which was cleared by the Union Cabinet, an official statement said. According to official data, some 1,612 lenders have submitted their claims to State Bank of India, which is the nodal agency, with the number of accounts covered under the scheme adding up to almost 24 crore. “By granting ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest during the six month moratorium period to distressed/vulnerable category of borrowers, irrespective of whether the borrower had availed of moratorium or not, the scheme would equitably help small borrowers bear the stress on account of the pandemic and get back on their feet,” the statement said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-clears-rs-974-crore-more-for-interest-on-interest/articleshow/89004914.cms||---

The equity infusion will enhance IREDA’s net worth, boosting the agency’s lending capacity to Rs 12,000 crore. This amount will be good enough for financing up to 4,000 MW of additional renewable capacity. This will lead to a reduction in carbon emission of more than 7 million tonnes CO2 per year. IREDA’s portfolio increased from Rs 8,800 crore to Rs 28,000 crore in the last six years. But according to RBI norms, loans can be extended on 20% of the agency’s net worth. This rule capped IREDA’s financing capacity to Rs 600 crore as its net worth is Rs 3,000 crore. The additional equity will also improve the capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), which will facilitate its lending and borrowing operations, according to a government statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1500-crore-equity-infusion-into-ireda-approved/articleshow/89004919.cms||---

The agency has claimed that besides the cash and gold recovery, it has seized “incriminating documents” related to illegal sand mining business from the premises of the accused during the search which continued until Wednesday. The seizures have sparked a political controversy with both AAP and Akalis attacking Channi. Out of Rs 10 crore cash, Rs 8 crore was seized from premises belonging to Bhupinder Singh. The remaining was seized from other searches. Channi described the searches as Centre's “revenge act” for the security lapse during PM Narendra Modi's recent visit and a conpsiracy, drawing an aggressive response from ED. “Blatant lie,” said a senior source when asked about the CM’s charge. The agency came out with a detailed response emphasising that ED’s investigation was based on an FIR registered by the state police in 2018 when Punjab cops had conducted searches on the premises of many of the accused now being investigated by ED. “In the aforesaid FIR, it was mentioned that a team comprising of officials of mining department, civil administration and police made a surprise check on March 7, 2018 …Consequently, it was found that several mines were being excavated by various machines and mining was being carried out beyond the designated area,” the ED said. The agency mentioned the seized trucks, JCBs and documentary evidence of illegal mining. The ED has named Honey and his close associates in a statement released on Wednesday and said entities involved in the scam included Pinjore Royalty Company and Providers Overseas Consultants Pvt Ltd. The searches were conducted at Mohali, Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Pathankot. Kudratdeep Singh, an accused in Punjab police FIR of 2018 in sand mining case, Bhupinder Singh and Sandeep Kumar are close friends and were earlier based in Ludhiana. The trio were partners in a company which is believed to have been used for laundering the money made by Kudratdeep Singh from illegal sand mining.

---||India||Covishield, Covaxin to get full approval but won’t be retailing||NEW DELHI: The drug regulator’s subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid vaccines on Wednesday recommended full authorisation for the two widely used jabs — Covishield and Covaxin. However, the vaccines will continue to be available and administered only at the centres that are registered under the government’s CoWin platform, official sources said. Once the Drugs Controller General of India gives the final approval, which is expected in a day or two, the manufacturers — Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — will not have to submit safety data and data related to adverse events every 15 days for doses administered under the immunisation programme, a source said. Instead, they will have to do so once in six months as prescribed for other new drugs under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. “SEC of CDSCO has recommended upgrade of Covishield and Covaxin’s status from restricted use in emergency situations to grant of new drug permission with conditions in adult population. DCGI will evaluate the recommendations and give its decision,” an official said. Asked whether individuals will now be able to buy the jabs from chemists, the official told TOI: “That will not be possible because the vaccine comes in a vial of 10 doses. Besides, every dose administered needs to be tracked under the CoWin system. Any centre administering the vaccine will have to be registered under the government’s CoWin platform.” Allowing retail sale will create multiple challenges in monitoring production, availability and administration of the vaccines. The CoWin registration also enables the government to issue vaccination certificates. TOI had reported on January 15 that Covid-vaccines will not be available in the retail market anytime soon although the regulatory expert committee may waive certain conditions that are part of the present regulatory approval. The conditions were imposed because the vaccines were given accelerated approval based on limited clinical trials data in an emergency pandemic situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covishield-covaxin-to-get-full-approval-but-wont-be-retailing/articleshow/89005008.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||Fourth California federal prison worker charged with sex abuse||WASHINGTON: A fourth worker at a federal women's prison in California has been charged with sexually abusing an inmate. His arrest comes months after the prison's warden was arrested on similar charges. James Theodore Highhouse, a corrections worker and chaplain at FCI Dublin, was charged Tuesday with sexual abuse of a ward, abusive sexual contact and making false statements to investigators.  Prosecutors allege Highhouse engaged in sexual acts with a female inmate on multiple occasions between May 2018 and February 2019.  Highhouse then lied to investigators from the FBI and Justice Department Inspector General's office when they asked him about the alleged sexual misconduct, prosecutors said. In interviews on Feb. 21, 2019, Highhouse knowingly made false statements denied engaging in sexual acts with the inmate, prosecutors said.  Court records did not list a lawyer for Highhouse and no telephone number for him was listed in an online directory.  Highouse is the latest latest employee of the federal Bureau of Prisons charged with criminal wrongdoing in a prison system that has been rife with corruption and misconduct. The Associated Press reported in November that more than 100 Bureau of Prisons workers have been arrested, convicted or sentenced for crimes since 2019, as the agency turned a blind eye to misconduct allegations.  Highouse worked at FCI Dublin, where actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin spent time for their involvement in the college admissions bribery scandal.  The warden at FCI Dublin, Ray Garcia, was arrested in September and later indicted on charges he molested an inmate multiple times, scheduled times where he demanded she undress in front of him and amassed a slew of nude photos of her on his government-issued phone. A recycling technician was also arrested on charges he coerced two inmates into sexual activity. In December, a correctional officer was charged with engaging in sexual conduct with an inmate and gave her special privileges and gifts, prosecutors.  Several other workers at the prison are still under investigation.  The Bureau of Prisons has faced a multitude of crises in recent years, including the rampant spread of the coronavirus inside its facilities, dozens of escapes, the deaths of inmates and workers, and critically low staffing levels that have hampered responses to emergencies.  The Justice Department announced earlier this month that the Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal would be resigning amid increasing scrutiny over his leadership. The agency's deputy director announced days later that he would also be leaving his position in a few months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fourth-california-federal-prison-worker-charged-with-sex-abuse/articleshow/89005085.cms||---

The university has started a postgraduate course in Hindu studies, university authorities said on Tuesday, claiming that this is the first such course offered by any university in the country. The course offered by BHU’s faculty of arts will be conducted at Bharat Adhyayan Kendra, a centre established in the centenary year of the university, in collaboration with the departments of philosophy and religion, Sanskrit and ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology. Bharat Adhyayan Kendra coordinator professor Sadashiv Kumar Dwivedi said 45 students, including a foreigner, have been enrolled in the first batch of this two-year course. The course is of four semesters, with 16 papers. “It took more than a century to begin such a course in the university after its establishment in 1914,” Dwivedi said. The course was inaugurated on Tuesday by the rector, professor VK Shukla. “The course is an interdisciplinary programme, which is in line with the New Education Policy 2020,” Shukla said, adding that the beginning of this course symbolises innovation.  Addressing the programme, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts director, Vijay Shankar Shukla, underlined the need for such courses on Hindu studies. “The idea behind this goes back to the 18th century scholar Pt Ganganath Jha and travels through time to Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya. However, the link was broken for some reason. But with this course, the goal appears to have been achieved.” Chancellor, Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha, and centenary chair professor at Bharat Adhyayan Kendra, Kamlesh Dutt Tripathi, who chaired the programme, highlighted the values and mantra of unity that are core to the Hindu dharma. He added that one cannot separate Hindu dharma from being constantly logical and scientific. The speakers at the function called upon scholars to come forward and preserve the ‘sanatana parampara’. They said that the course is important for building ‘sanatana’ life values. They also spoke about what they saw as the scientific aspect of the Gayatri Mantra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhu-offers-hindu-dharma-course/articleshow/89005098.cms||Binay Singh
---||World||Supreme Court justices deny report they were at odds over masks||WASHINGTON : Two Supreme Court justices say a media report that they were at odds over the wearing of masks in court during the recent surge in coronavirus cases is false.  The court on Wednesday issued an unusual three-sentence statement from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch. It read: "Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends."  Sotomayor is an appointee of former President Barack Obama while Gorsuch was appointed by former President Donald Trump.  Sotomayor, who has diabetes, has been attending arguments remotely from her chambers this month during the surge of the coronavirus' omicron variant. Her colleagues, with the exception of Gorsuch, have been wearing masks this month while hearing arguments in the courtroom.  Later Wednesday, Chief Justice John Roberts responded to inquiries about whether he had asked his colleagues to wear masks with his own statement: "I did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench." He said he would have no further comment.  Gorsuch has never said why he is not wearing a mask on the bench. He has not responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press.  Both statements from the justices came after NPR's longtime Supreme Court correspondent Nina Totenberg reported Tuesday on an alleged conflict between Sotomayor and Gorsuch, who normally sit next to each other during arguments at the high court.  Totenberg reported that unidentified court sources said "Sotomayor did not feel safe in close proximity to people who were unmasked" and that "Chief Justice John Roberts, understanding that, in some form asked the other justices to mask up." She did not elaborate.  Gorsuch's decision not to wear a mask "has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone," Totenberg reported.  Totenberg did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from The Associated Press.  Following NPR's story, CNN also reported that "a source familiar with the situation" said Sotomayor didn't "feel comfortable sitting on the bench near colleagues who are not masked." Neither NPR's story nor CNN's story said Sotomayor had directly asked Gorsuch to wear a mask. The justices' statement did not say what reporting it was referencing.  Since the justices returned to hearing in-person arguments in October, Sotomayor has worn a mask during arguments at the high court while her colleagues have not. They changed their practice this month during the surge of the coronavirus' omicron variant.  All the justices have been vaccinated against the coronavirus and received a booster shot. Attorneys who argue before the justices also have to have a negative coronavirus test or argue remotely by telephone, and journalists who attend in person are also asked to have a negative test.  So far, three attorneys have had to argue by phone this month because of positive tests. The public is not currently allowed to attend arguments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-justices-deny-report-they-were-at-odds-over-masks/articleshow/89005121.cms||---

Luckily, a radar controller spotted the potentially grave error and alerted pilots in both flight decks. One plane swerved sharply to left and the other to right to avoid a collision. The serious situation didn’t end then as local authorities allegedly tried to hush it up by not reporting it to DGCA, possibly avoid a probe, and punishment. Directorate General of Civil Aviation chief Arun Kumar has taken a very serious note of the incident. A probe has been ordered and Kumar told TOI that “strict action will be taken against” those found responsible for it. The distance between the two airstrips at Bengaluru is not sufficient enough to allow parallel and simultaneous take-offs or landings. A certain time difference has to be maintained between flight movements for operational safety reasons. “On January 7, 2022, two IndiGo flights — 6E-455 to Kolkata and 6E-246 to Bhubaneswar — were involved in breach of separation at Bengaluru airport. That morning, Bengaluru airport’s north runway was meant to be used for take-offs and south for landings. Later, the shift incharge (WSO) decided to have single runway operations by using the north runway for both arrivals and departures,” said a DGCA official. At this time, the south runway was supposed to have been closed for operations. However, this was not conveyed to the south tower controller. As a result, the “south tower controller gave departure (clearance) to 6E-455 and at the same time north tower controller gave departure (nod) to 6E-246 without coordination. Both aircraft after departure were moving towards each other. The approach radar controller gave diverging heading and avoided a mid-air collision,” the DGCA official said. Shockingly, Airports Authority of India neither reported this incident nor was it recorded in any logbook. Bengaluru ATC officials were not available for comment. A query to IndiGo Airlines didn’t receive a response till Tuesday evening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/babus-try-to-hush-up-bengaluru-near-miss-probe-ordered/articleshow/89005120.cms||Petlee Peter

After realising that 6E-455 to Kolkata and 6E-246 to Bhubaneswar were headed towards each other, this air traffic controller directed the two Airbus A320s apart by asking the pilots of one to head left and the other to the right. Read AlsoTwo planes fly close, major midair collision in Bengaluru skies avertedPeople onboard two IndiGo flights had a miraculous escape when the aircraft were cleared to take off simultaneously in the same direction from the Kempegowda International Airport's parallel runways on January 7.Singh’s alertness is being applauded as it is learnt the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) in the two aircraft had not gone off due to lateral separation.

This will be the first engagement of its kind between India and the central Asian countries at the level of leaders. “The first India-central Asia summit is a reflection of India’s growing engagement with the central Asian countries, which are a part of India’s ‘extended neighbourhood’. PM Modi paid a historic visit to all central Asian countries in 2015. Subsequently, there have been exchanges at high-levels at bilateral and multilateral forums,” said the foreign ministry. “The inception of the India-central Asia dialogue at the foreign ministers’ level, the third meeting of which was held in Delhi from December 18 to 20, 2021, has provided an impetus to India-central Asia relations. The participation of the secretaries of National Security Councils of Central Asian countries in the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan held in New Delhi on November 10, 2021 outlined a common regional approach on Afghanistan,” it added. During the summit, the leaders are expected to exchange views on regional and international issues of interest, especially the evolving regional security situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-host-central-asia-summit-online-on-january-27/articleshow/89005266.cms||---

Sherman briefed him about the “extremely dangerous” situation in Ukraine with Russia which, as per US authorities, is ready to attack Ukraine “at any point”. According to a US statement, Sherman and Shringla agreed to remain closely coordinated on shared goals and priorities and reiterated the importance of a strong US-India partnership to mitigate Omicron variant’s rapid advance. India, however, didn’t mention Ukraine in the list of issues discussed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-us-official-talks-to-shringla-on-ukraine-crisis/articleshow/89005272.cms||---
---||World||US to set 'common goals' on Indo-Pacific economic cooperation in early 2022||WASHINGTON: A senior US policy official for China said on Wednesday that Washington aims to establish "common goals" on economic cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries in early 2022, as Washington seeks to counter Beijing's influence in the region.  US President Joe Biden told Asian leaders in October that Washington would launch talks on creating an Indo-Pacific economic framework. But few details have emerged and the administration has avoided moves towards rejoining trade deals critics say threaten US jobs. White House senior director for China Laura Rosenberger told a webinar that discussions with partners in recent months had helped "crystallize" the administration's thinking on how to pursue such a framework.  "Our initial ideas on proposed areas of economic cooperation include trade facilitation, digital economy standards, supply-chain resiliency, infrastructure, decarbonization and clean energy, export controls, tax and anti-corruption," Rosenberger told the National Bureau of Asian Research think tank event.  "And we will continue to focus on establishing common goals and end states that we would jointly announce in the coming months, early period of 2022," she said without giving details.  Conversations on different pieces of the framework "will move at different speeds," she said.  Rosenberger said she had nothing new to say on the administration's view of a regional trade framework now known as CPTPP that the Trump administration quit in 2017. But she stressed the importance both of promoting a free and open region and protecting American workers who critics argue would be threatened by U.S. participation in the pact.  U.S. officials "all feel a sense of general urgency" to put the United States in the best position to be able to compete, she said.  U.S.-China relations have sunk to their lowest point in decades as Biden has sought to leverage ties with allies and partners to counter what Washington sees as Beijing's increasing economic and military coercion.  The White House has touted its so-called AUKUS pact, under which the United States and Britain have agreed to help Australia acquire nuclear submarines - as well as leader-level summits between the United States, Australia, India and Japan - as evidence that U.S. partnerships are causing China "heartburn."  But some Indo-Pacific countries, many of which count China as their top trading partner, have lamented what they see as lacking U.S. economic engagement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-set-common-goals-on-indo-pacific-economic-cooperation-in-early-2022/articleshow/89005274.cms||---

---||World||After a year in office, Biden says it was one of 'challenges' as well as 'progress': Key points||NEW DELHI: President Joe Biden, during a rare press conference on Wednesday to mark his first year in office, said the first 365 days have been that of "challenges" but also of "enormous progress". "It's been a year of challenges, but it's also been a year of enormous progress," Biden said. He touched on various issues at the press conference, from his inauguration amid a pandemic to Build Back Better plan, from relations with Russia to Afghanistan pullout and the future of American democracy. Here are the key points: On CovidBiden conceded on Wednesday that the United States should have done more earlier to boost Covid-19 testing while he pledged not to return to lockdowns and said the Omicron variant was not a cause for panic. "Should we have done more testing earlier? Yes," Biden told reporters at the White House. He added the Supreme Court decision on Covid-19 testing was a mistake. On inflationPresident Biden called on the Federal Reserve to do more to fight inflation by pulling back on its monetary boosting of the US economy. "Given the strength of our economy, and the pace of recent price increases, it's important to recalibrate the support that is now necessary," the president said in his opening remarks. Inflation at nearly a 40-year high has dogged the Biden administration, causing his public support to tumble even as economic growth and hiring has surged. "Given the strength of our economy and recent price increases, it's appropriate, as... Fed chairman (Jerome) Powell has indicated, to recalibrate the support that is now necessary," Biden told the news conference. "The critical job of making sure that the elevated prices don't become entrenched rests with the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate: full employment and stable prices," the president said. Lowering the record rate of US inflation will "be a haul", President Biden added, insisting the price increases will subside if supply chain snarls and component shortages are resolved. "The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain," the president said, adding that his Build Back Better spending proposal, which is stalled in Congress, would improve the situation, but "it's going to be hard and take a lot of work". On social spending billPresident Biden said he was confident "big chunks" of his stalled social spending bill would be passed. "I'm confident we can get pieces, big chunks of the Build Back Better plan signed into law," Biden said. On RepublicansPresident Biden blamed Republicans for blocking his legislative agenda for political purposes, saying the party is more interested in defeating his presidency than doing things for the American people. Biden said he did not over promise on his agenda, but did underestimate Republican opposition. "Name me one thing they're for," Biden said of Republicans. Promising to confront what he called the unexpectedly "stalwart" opposition of Republicans, Biden promised to take his case for action directly to voters as Democrats seek to defend their congressional majorities in a November 8 election. On voting rightsBiden insisted he still had hope of passing all-but-doomed voting rights reforms he says are needed to protect the US democracy, saying: "We've not run out of options yet." On Kamala HarrisPresident Biden confirmed on Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris would be his running mate in the 2024 presidential election. "She is going to be my running mate," Biden said of Harris during the press conference. He also said he was satisfied with vice-president Harris' work on voting rights. Harris, the first woman and person of colour to be elected US vice president, has seen her approval ratings plunge since she entered office. On RussiaBiden also faced questions on rising tensions with Russia over a military build-up in and around Ukraine. He vowed unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades its European neighbour. "Russia will be held accountable if it invades," Biden said. "They'll pay a stiff price." Biden added he could hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "I still think that is a possibility," Biden said. He also said it was important to keep everyone in Nato on same page. On Afghan pulloutBiden said there was no way to get out of Afghanistan easily. "Only reason more Americans were being killed because the last president has promised Taliban to take forces out by May 5, 2021," said Biden, targeting Donald Trump.

According to the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (Adaptation of State Laws) Second Order, 2022, notified by the Union home ministry on Tuesday, the Bombay Animal Preservation Act, 1954, as applicable to the erstwhile UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and as in force in Gujarat, as well as The Goa, Daman and Diu Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, as applicable to the erstwhile UT of Daman and Diu, now stand amended and shall apply to the merged UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. As per the amendments introduced in two Acts, the definition of scheduled animal whose slaughter will be completely banned and also a cognisable and non-bailable offence across the UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu includes ox and heifer and not just cow, calf, bull and bullock. However, this would not apply for slaughter of any animal above the age of 15 years, other than a cow, heifer, bull, bullock or ox, for bona fide religious purposes as may be prescribed or on prescribed religious days. Importantly, no person shall transport or offer to transport a scheduled animal from one place to another in the same UT, for purpose of slaughter or with the knowledge that it is to be slaughtered. A permit will be required to transport the animals for bona fide agricultural or animal husbandry purpose, and if done without a permit, it will be deemed that the animal was being transported for slaughter, unless proved otherwise by the suspect. Any vehicle used for transportation of a scheduled animal will be liable to be seized along with the animal. The seized vehicle will stand forfeited to the government. The amended Animal Preservation Act and Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act now applicable to the merged UT prohibit a person from directly or indirectly selling, keeping, storing, transporting, offering or exposing for sell or buying beef – defined as flesh of cow, calf, heifer, bull, bullock of ox -- or beef products in any form. Whenever any person transports or causes to be transported beef or beef products, the transport vehicle shall be liable to be seized and forfeited to the government. As per the new penalties, which now are more or less on par with those introduced by Gujarat in 2017, slaughter of an animal, other than cow etc, without a certificate where shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine up to Rs 10,000. Slaughter of cow, calf, bull, bullock, heifer and ox will invite minimum 10 years in jail and maximum life term, along with fine which may range from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Contravention of provisions against transport of cow, bull etc within the UT without permit or transport of beef or beef products -- would be punished with jail term between 7 years and 10 years and fine that may extend from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act notified on Monday does away with exception of flesh of cow contained in sealed containers imported into the UT, from the beef ban. It further states that cow slaughter will include maiming, poisoning, insensate and inflicting of physical injury which in the ordinary course will cause death. It also does away with exceptions to cow slaughter ban, such as killing of cow suffering enough to render its destruction desirable or afflicted by contagious disease notified by government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ut-makes-anti-cow-slaughter-laws-stringent/articleshow/89005349.cms||Bharti Jain

Mahesh Agarwal was arrested after a Jharkhand court turned down his “no coercive action” plea. A special NIA court on Wednesday sent him to a four-day transit remand, reports Rohit Khanna. “There was a stay on the non-bailable warrant against him. The stay was vacated on Tuesday,” said NIA lawyer Debashis Mallick Choudhury. A team of NIA officers and officers from Bidhannagar Police reached his Salt Lake home around 10.30am on Tuesday. Sources said Agarwal allegedly tried to flee in a car with a Nagaland number plate but was intercepted.

Marking the one-year anniversary of his presidency, Biden, a Democrat, faced a flurry of questions on the country's bumpy COVID-19 response, relations with Russia and the future of American democracy during a rare formal news conference.  Promising to confront what he called the unexpectedly "stalwart" opposition of Republicans, Biden promised to take his case for action directly to voters as Democrats seek to defend their congressional majorities in a Nov. 8 election.  "Our work's not done," said Biden, whose approval ratings have sagged in recent months with COVID-19 hospitalizations at a record . "Should we have done more testing earlier? Yes," Biden said.  Asked whether he had promised more than he could deliver, Biden was adamant: "I didn't over-promise."  But he acknowledged that his signature economic and social spending legislation, Build Back Better, was all but dead in its old form.  Instead, the president said, he expected that he could get "big chunks" of that bill passed, if not the full package.  With much of his domestic agenda stalled, Biden also faced questions on rising tensions with Russia over a military build-up in and around Ukraine. Biden vowed unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades its European neighbor.  "Russia will be held accountable if it invades," Biden said. "They'll pay a stiff price."  His aides said they envisioned the news conference as an opportunity to frame the president's approach to his second year and to sell the American people on the accomplishments of the first. A more expansive message will follow when Biden delivers his State of the Union address to Congress on March 1.  Four-fifths of qualified Americans have received at least one vaccine shot even as the virus continues to kill nearly 2,000 people per day in the United States, and the unemployment rate has dropped amid record job creation.  Biden's fellow Democrats are fighting to retain their control of Congress in the coming elections amid a flood of Republican-backed state laws that civil rights advocates say could suppress Black and other minority votes.  Biden has held nine total news conferences in his first year in office, including six solo, a slower pace than his most recent predecessors, according to the American Presidency Project at University of California, Santa Barbara.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/on-track-to-meet-challenges-from-covid-inflation-biden-says-addressing-skeptics-at-one-year-mark/articleshow/89005489.cms||---

Shah tweet came after a meeting with chiefs of Apna Dal and Nishad Party, union minister Anupriya Patel and Sanjay Nishad respectively. आज श्री @JPNadda जी, श्री @myogiadityanath जी व यूपी के सहयोगी दल श्रीमती @AnupriyaSPatel जी और श्री संजय निषाद जी… https://t.co/qMQjqoCAYZ— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) 1642593484000Patel and Nishad are part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Although details of the tie-ups, mainly how many seats the two partners will get to contest, were not shared but Shah’s tweet suggested that the NDA allies may have sorted out the issue. Patel and Nishad addressed the media at the BJP headquarters along with Nadda, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is overseeing BJP’s effort to retain power in UP, Yogi’s deputies Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma and I&B minister Anurag Thakur. The partners said that details of seat-sharing will be announced later. Apna Dal represents an important section of Kurmis while Nishad Party enjoys support among fishermen and boatmen. BJP strategists feel that alliance with the OBC outfits will blunt the perception of an exodus of “backwards” from the saffron-fold. Both Patel and Nishad praised the Modi government for working for the interests of OBCs and hit out at BJP’s rivals for “denying” a large section of backward communities their rights in what appeared to be an attack on Samajwadi Party. They applauded the Modi government for granting constitutional status to the OBC commission and giving the community reservation in education, including in the National Eligibility cum-Entrance Test (NEET). They also praised the Yogi government and said BJP will return to power in UP. Nadda said the three NDA partners in the state will fight the elections to the 403-member assembly together and lauded the Yogi Adityanath-led government for its performance on a host of issues, including restoration of law and order, boosting investment and improvement in social indicators. Nadda claimed that the mafia used to be active in Uttar Pradesh in nexus with the government before BJP came to power there but the Yogi Adityanath dispensation had restored rule of law in the state and made it a destination for investment. Earlier, investors were withdrawing their investment, he alleged. Under the ‘double-engine’ government, a reference to the BJP being power at the Centre as well as in the state, Uttar Pradesh has made an improvement on social indicators, with connectivity and education, especially medical education, receiving a boost, the BJP chief said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/nda-will-form-govt-in-up-with-thumping-majority-amit-shah/articleshow/89005533.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Delivery agent murdered as duo ‘needed cash for drugs’||GURUGRAM: Two suspects have been arrested in the murder of a 30-year-old Zomato food delivery agent in Rewari, police said on Wednesday. The accused, police added, were drug addicts, roaming around the city with country-made pistols on Sunday night when they came across delivery man Mahendra Singh near the Ansal township. The duo allegedly tried to rob Singh, who was in the area for delivering a food order. According to police, Singh resisted them, following which one of the accused whipped out a gun and shot him in the stomach. After that, the accused allegedly took Rs 7,000 in cash and a mobile phone from Singh and fled the spot on their motorcycle. Singh was found bleeding on the road near the Ansal township by two passersby on a scooter. They took him to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. But Singh succumbed to his injuries later that night. Police said that after finding out about the crime the same night, they had launched raids at various places in Rewari and the neighbouring districts to track down the culprits. Later on Tuesday, the accused, Leon alias Little and Krishan alias Danny, both from Rewari, got arrested. According to the police, the duo would commit robberies and buy drugs with the money. Police have recovered one country-made pistol and three live cartridges from them. During police interrogation, the duo allegedly confessed to the crime, adding that they needed money to buy drugs. “On Sunday night, they were near the Ansal township when they spotted Mahendra Singh. They stopped him and asked for money. But when they tried to snatch his wallet, Singh protested fiercely. So, Leon alias Little shot him in the stomach and the duo escaped after snatching Singh’s money and mobile phone from his pocket,” said deputy superintendent of police Mohammad Jamal. Police said that Leon already had 16 crime cases registered against him in various police stations across Rajasthan. Meanwhile, Danny has four previous criminal cases in his name. Singh’s family members said he had asked Zomato for a transfer to Rewari from Palwal just a couple of months ago in the hope of better opportunities. In Rewari, he had shifted to a house near his sister’s along with his wife and 10-year-old son. A spokesperson for Zomato said that the company would provide all possible support to Singh’s family. “We will provide a job to one of the brothers as a delivery agent. We have also raised funds internally to hand over to the family. We will provide unconditional support to the family,” the spokesperson said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/delivery-agent-murdered-as-duo-needed-cash-for-drugs/articleshow/89005559.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Contract fraud: Police file one more FIR in case||Gurgaon: Police on Wednesday registered one more FIR in the Rs 125-crore NSG contract fraud. The fifth FIR was filed on a complaint from a contractor who was allegedly duped of Rs 1.6 crore by BSF deputy commandant Praveen Yadav, the mastermind, in the name of awarding a contract for the construction of boundary walls on the NSG campus in Gurgaon. Police had earlier registered four cases.Praveen, his wife Mamata, his sister-in-law Rituraj and another accomplice — identified as Dinesh — were also produced before a court by investigators on completion of their police remand earlier in the day. While Mamta, Rituraj and Dinesh were sent to judicial custody, the court extended the police remand of Praveen by four more days.According to the investigators, BSF officer Praveen paid Rs 3 crore to Dinesh, a property dealer, for fixing meetings with owners of different construction firms and government contractors and convincing them about the fictitious projects. Dinesh, cops said, played a key role in the fraud that was orchestrated by the BSF deputy commandant while on deputation on the NSG campus in Manesar.“Praveen, during interrogation, had admitted transferring large sums to around 50 different accounts to clear his debts,” said an officer of the Gurgaon police. “We are collecting the details of all the account holders to verify the claims of Praveen.”Meanwhile, the crime unit of Manesar, led by its in-charge Inspector Sandeep, have been conducting raids to nab another accused in the case, ITBP officer Naveen, the brother-in-law of Praveen. Naveen’s wife Rituraj has already been arrested by the police.Earlier police had registered four different FIRs against the accused for cheating different firms on the pretext of awarding contracts for construction of internal roads, residential houses, a sewerage treatment plant and boundary walls inside the NSG campus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/contract-fraud-police-file-one-more-fir-in-case/articleshow/89005560.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Soon, automatic piezometers to check water levels in city||Gurgaon: To improve monitoring of water levels in the city, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority plans to use automatic piezometers, devices to help determine the pressure of groundwater at the points where they are installed. Initially, 10 such devices will be installed in “closed campuses”, such as parks, boosting stations and sewage treatment plants, at an estimated cost of Rs 50 lakh.“Earlier, the district hydrologist used to set up piezometers for monitoring the water level, but the devices were all manual and their readings were taken only thrice a year – pre-monsoon, during monsoon and after monsoon. Our plan now is to instead put automatic piezometers and connect them to our integrated command and control centre so that we get daily data for the entire year,” said Subash Chander Yadav, additional CEO, urban environment division. The issue was also raised last year at a meeting led by Keshni Anand Arora, chairperson, Haryana Water Resources Authority. It was decided then that GMDA should install piezometers in urban areas for better monitoring of water levels in view of “depletion due to greater exploitation”. “We don’t want anyone to damage the device so for the time being, we will only put it in closed campuses where someone is always present,” said Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/soon-automatic-piezometers-to-check-water-levels-in-city/articleshow/89005561.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Civic waste piles up near Bandhwari plant, poses threat to Aravali wildlife||Gurgaon: Several fresh mounds of municipal waste have come up outside the Bandhwari waste treatment plant in a 3km stretch in the ecologically-sensitive Aravalis in Faridabad, showed a spot visit by TOI on Wednesday. While the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) said it would look into the matter, the concessionaire tasked with processing waste at the Bandhwari site, Ecogreen Energy Pvt Ltd, when contacted, acknowledged the issue, adding it had nothing to do with it. The forest department, meanwhile, passed the buck to the MCG.The areas where the waste mounds have come up are protected by sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Protection Act (PLPA), 1,900, which prevents all non-forest activities in the wildlife-rich zone. Locals, however, alleged that waste gets dumped in the open forest land daily. “At least ten or more trucks dump municipal waste, construction and demolition waste and plastic here, daily, endangering the wildlife, including nilgai, hedgehog, golden jackal, peacock, snake, etc.,” said Mukesh, a local villager of Mangar.Ecogreen, while saying that garbage gets dumped in the area, shifted the blame on a second firm. “Waste gets dumped outside the boundary of the plant, and we are trying to manage the situation. The waste has nothing to do with us; it does not belong to us. Recently, the MCG gave the contract for waste processing to another firm. We are talking with that firm, asking it to remove waste from forest areas,” Ecogreen representative Sanjay Sharma told TOI.The MCG, however, stressed that Ecogreen is responsible for municipal waste processing. “Ecogreen has the contract for the processing of municipal waste in Gurgaon. And no one is supposed to dump waste in the forest area. We will investigate the matter and take action accordingly," said Hariom Atri, joint commissioner, MCG.Meanwhile, the forest department said it would write to the MCG to remove the waste. “We will write to the MCG to take action and remove the waste from the forest land,” said Raj Kumar, district forest officer, Faridabad.Environmentalists claimed that the Bandhwari plant has been polluting the Aravali groundwater for some time now and poses a threat to wildlife and residents in nearby areas. “We have been informing the civic body about the dumping of waste by Ecogreen, but there has been no strict action against the firm. Only the amount of waste near the plant has increased over the years,” said Vivek Kamboj, an activist.“The dumping of waste in the Aravalis poses a serious health hazard to residents in the neighbouring cities of Gurgaon and Faridabad because these areas are at a higher elevation in terms of natural water drainage and groundwater recharge. It is also destroying the wildlife in the area,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, another activist.According to the 2017 Wildlife Institute of India (WII) report, the Aravalis is a critical leopard habitat, with more than 32 animals reported from the wildlife corridor. Last year, a survey by the wildlife department had found that Ecogreen was “intentionally” spilling thousands of litres of leachate from the Bandhwari plant into pits in the eco-sensitive Aravalis, resulting in the contamination of groundwater of five nearby villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/civic-waste-piles-up-near-bandhwari-plant-poses-threat-to-aravali-wildlife/articleshow/89005562.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Cotton left in woman’s abdomen during surgery, court directs FIR against doctors||GURUGRAM: Two doctors of a private hospital in Sector 12 have been booked for alleged medical negligence after a woman claimed they had left a cotton gauge inside her abdomen during a C-section procedure in 2020. The woman claimed that she had been unwell since the procedure and the cotton gauge was found in her abdomen during follow-up tests and examination. It was finally removed after the seven months but the family claimed that the surgery was performed without their consent. In October last year, the family approached a local court after failing to get an FIR registered despite filing complaints. Subsequently, a case has been recently registered at Sector 12 police station on the court’s order, the family said. Sikanderpur resident Diwas Rai claimed they had consulted a doctor at Neelkanth Hospital on April 12, 2020, after his wife, Swastika, had conceived. The couple later approached a government dispensary at Sikanderpur Ghosi for consultation after Rai had lost his job during the lockdown. According to Rai, they met an Anganwadi worker at the dispensary who allegedly had threatened the couple to visit Shiva Hospital for the childbirth. On November 16, the complainant’s wife was admitted to the private hospital in Sector 12 where the doctors advised Swastika to undergo an immediate cesarean section and asked the couple to deposit Rs 15,000 for the procedure. Swastika gave birth to a girl and the mother-daughter was finally discharged on November 18 after the couple deposited another Rs 15,000. Swastika, meanwhile, was advised to visit the hospital for dressing every three days. After a week-long dressing, however, Swastika started complaining of intense pain and redness on her abdomen. At Shiva Hospital, a doctor allegedly told the couple that the pain was a result of the surgery and prescribed some medicines. As the pain and swelling persisted over the next one-and-half months, the doctor prescribed her some more painkillers, which allegedly led to a further deterioration in her condition. On May 31, Rai finally took Swastika to Jageram Hospital in Sikanderpur where the consulting doctor advised her to undergo a blood test and CECT scan. On June 1, after the CECT scan report indicated the presence of a cotton gauge or some metallic object inside Swastika’s abdomen, Rai took his wife to Shiva Hospital. “A doctor at Shiva Hospital asked us to admit Swastika immediately for diagnosis,” Rai said, adding that the doctor said Swastika might have to undergo another surgery. “ On June 2, the hospital sent an ambulance and Swastika was admitted to the hospital immediately. They made us sign blank papers saying that it was just for diagnosis,” Rai claimed. The complainant, however, claimed he was told that Swastika was undergoing surgery three hours later by the hospital management. A complaint was filed with Sector 14 police station against Shiva Hospital on the same day. On June 4, Rai also submitted a complaint with the commissioner of police and chief medical officer (CMO). However, on June 8, Rai was allegedly forced by the police to sign an Rs 85,000 bill prepared by the private hospital. “Police threatened me to sign the bill,” he alleged. In October, after Rai approached a local court, a case was registered against two doctors of the Shiva Hospital and the facility at the Sector 12 police station under IPC Sections 304A (death by negligence), 417 (cheating), 336 (endangering life), 337 (danger to life), 338 (grievous hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (intend to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (common intention). The private hospital denied all the allegations and claimed that the patient had gone home "happy" after the treatment. However, they failed to explain the need for the second surgery and refused to comment on the allegations of medical negligence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/cotton-left-in-womans-abdomen-during-surgery-court-directs-fir-against-doctors/articleshow/89005564.cms||Bagish Jha

---||Gurgaon||10 Covid deaths in this wave, most were in hospital for other ailments||Gurgaon: The city has seen more Covid deaths in the past 10 days than in the five months between August and December last year, coinciding with the latest wave of the pandemic and an increase in hospitalisations that it has led to. Ten patients have died after testing positive in the city since January 10. In comparison, there were seven deaths in the past five months.During the current wave, the first Covid death was officially recorded in the city on January 10. There was another on January 12, two more on January 14, one each on January 15 and 16, two on January 17 and two on January 19. These patients had two things in common — all of them were aged over 60 and had comorbidities. Barring two, the rest were fully vaccinated.So far, the city’s official Covid toll since the pandemic began is 937. Of them, 620 had comorbidities. Gurgaon’s current fatality rate is 0.4%.Although Covid first struck the city in March 2020, the first death related to the infection was reported in May — four persons had died that month. The highest number of deaths was reported during the height of the second wave in May 2021, when 343 patients succumbed to the infection (455 if deaths are counted for April, when the deadly second wave began). In June, 85 Covid deaths were reported in Gurgaon, which fell to 18 in July and three in August. Through September and October last year, when cases had declined considerably, Gurgaon did not report any Covid death. The city again started to witness deaths from November. Two Covid deaths each were reported in November and December.According to the health department, most of the patients who succumbed to Covid this month had been brought to hospitals for other illnesses and not Covid. They were tested during admission and found to be positive a few days later. “Barring one, none of the patients had any symptoms of Covid while being wheeled into hospitals. They were admitted for other complications related to their own comorbidities,” said Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer.The first person who died after testing positive in the current wave on January 10 was a 67-year-old resident of Sector 43, who had comorbidities such as hypertension, heart and chronic liver diseases and diabetes. He was hospitalised with dizziness and high fever on January 7 and suffered a cardiac arrest three days later.On January 12, a 66-year-old fully vaccinated man with congestive heart failure died. Two days later, there were two Covid-related deaths — one a 61-year-old man with diabetes and chronic liver disease and the other a 63-year-old woman with liver and kidney ailments. The woman was yet to complete her vaccine doses.On January 15, a 75-year-old man with lung cancer, diabetes and hypertension died after testing positive. The city recorded another Covid death on January 1, when an 83-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes and chronic dementia died.On January 17, a 60-year-old man with chronic liver disease and an 80-year-old man with hypertension suffered cardiac arrests. On January 19, a 69-year-old man, who had tested positive earlier, was admitted to hospital after suffering from fluctuation in blood pressure and anxiety. He died of cardiac arrest. The other Covid death was of a 78-year-old man with diabetes who suffered a cardiac arrest. He tested positive after being admitted to hospital. Both hospitalisations and fatalities are much lower this time compared with the second wave. As of January 19, there were 24,163 active cases in Gurgaon and 165 hospitalisations. Across Haryana, there were around 60,000 active cases and 1,636 hospitalisations.“The rate of admissions is far less. The infection is mostly affecting high-risk patients, such as the elderly, those with comorbid conditions, and those not fully vaccinated. The admission rate among those without these risks and those fully vaccinated is far less. Very few are requiring advanced respiratory support at the moment,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/10-covid-deaths-in-this-wave-most-were-in-hospital-for-other-ailments/articleshow/89005567.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Why some budget schools are calling students back||Gurgaon: Even as the schools have been shut till January 26 due to the Omicron-led third wave, several budget private schools have begun calling students back for physical classes. These schools say that exams are round the corner and keeping the academic institutions closed is only leading to learning gaps.Schools, largely the ones in rural districts like Rewari, Mewat and Palwal, argue that the challenge of exclusion in online classes is a major reason for them to start calling back students. Moreover, parents of these budget private schools are refusing to pay fees for the online classes that are infrequent due to patchy networks. This, they claim, has led to migration of students to state-run schools in the past two years.Yashpal Yadav, the president of the Haryana Siksha Sansthan Sangathan, said, “In Gurgaon, very few schools have so far opened up. But in rural districts like Rewari, a huge number of schools have started calling students back. And in days to come, more schools across the state will openly ignore the closure orders as we see no evidence-based research on the need of keeping schools closed.”“The Covid situation is under control, teachers and some students are already vaccinated, and schools have developed capacities to follow Covid-safety protocols. Due to perceived danger, we cannot continue to inflict definitive damage on the education of kids,” he added.A director of a private school in Rewari told TOI that the school has started holding physical classes since Monday. “If we keep the schools closed, we’ll be dead as online education is just not working out. Patchy networks in rural areas, lack of smartphones, unavailability of trained teachers, absence of capital to expand digital infrastructure are the reasons online classes are an utter failure. We’ve lost 40% of students in the past two years. We may lose all of them if we are shut for longer,” he added.The education department, on its part, has claimed that it has formed teams to conduct inspections at the block level to ensure that the school closure orders are not violated.“We have informed all the block education officers to keep an eye on all these private schools in their respective areas to see if they are following the government orders. Whenever we receive any complaint, we conduct a raid there and issue show-cause notices. We are also conducting surprise checks,” said an education department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/why-some-budget-schools-are-calling-students-back/articleshow/89005569.cms||---

A prominent dhaba, constructed in illegal manner, was also razed during the drive.Recently, deputy commissioner Yash Garg, during a district task force meeting, had directed the town planner of enforcement wing of town and country planning department to carry out sealing drive in Saraswati Kunj area.The DTCP during survey and on the basis of complaints received from the residents identified several illegal commercial establishments. On Wednesday, enforcement team led by DTP RS Batth sealed 10 such commercial properties, including restaurants, dhabas, car showrooms, service stations, being run from residential plots. “Adjoining Baba dhaba which was illegally constructed in violation of the norms was razed by the team,” said Batth.Sources informed that there are several residential buildings, who after procuring occupation certificates from the government, but made changes in the structures to start commercial activities including gym, salon, showrooms, clinics, educational institutions and others on the premises.The property owners are not worried about the government norms, they are openly flouting the rules hinting at nexus with the officials of concerned department, informed a source.“The enforcement wing of DTCP which is responsible for taking action against such activities has failed to curb them. These buildings have been approved for residential purpose, running commercial establishments from here put additional load on infrastructure thus causing inconvenience to the other residents,” said a local resident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/10-illegal-structures-along-golf-course-rd-sealed/articleshow/89005572.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Gurgaon||Model school teachers told to clear HTET, warn of stir||Gurgaon: The teachers of Mewat Model Schools are upset with a recent education department notification, saying that they will have to clear the Haryana Teacher Eligibility Test (HTET) for permanent status. Issued on Wednesday last week, the notification follows the government takeover of the model schools in November 2021 to run them on the lines of Model Sanskriti Schools, a move the teachers had welcomed.The state education department noted that it is taking over eight schools, but only “the employees working in Mewat Model Schools and having a qualification at par with their counterparts working in the school education department will get absorbed as regular employees in the Mewat cadre of the school education department".The teaching and the non-teaching staff asserted that the notification meant that all the employees would be working on an ad-hoc basis till clearing the HTET. The schools, earlier run by the Mewat Development Agency, had employed the staff as regular employees. “This is gross injustice by the department. All our qualifications were examined and verified while establishing these schools. Also, in 2016, the CM had announced that the merger would be unconditional. Imposing the HTET rule is an injustice because we all know about the malpractices that go on in these exams and the selection issues. We oppose this notification,” said Satish Khatana, district president, Mewat Model School Employees Welfare Association (MMSEWA). The teachers have threatened to go on a strike if the notification is not rolled back and demanded a new notification inducting them into the permanent cadre of the education department. They are also being supported by the Sarv Karmachari Sangh. “The staff have been waiting for nearly six years to be absorbed into the department. They have been imparting education at par with that in the Model Sanskriti Schools. The government should roll back this order or there will be protests,” said Sarv Karmachari Sangh state president Subhash Lamba.The education department, however, called the objections misplaced. “The notice clearly said that the teachers who do not match the criteria would get two years to clear the exams.

A case has been registered against the doctor and his three associates under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994 and Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 in Gurgaon. The team recovered Rs 20,000 and an illegal ultrasound machine from their possession. The civil surgeon of Gurgaon had received the information about a nexus of people conducting illegal sex determination of foetus in Gurgaon. “Our team took a decoy pregnant woman who was contacted by the accused. She was asked to pay Rs 20,000 for the process. She informed the health department about it and thereafter, our team nabbed the four accused. We got a tip-off that the gang used to charge Rs 20,000 to 25,000 from people in Gurgaon for the illegal practice. This particular gang was operational for the past two years in the region,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. According to an official, a quack conducted the sex determination test with the help of a potable ultrasound machine at a private clinic in Bijnor. The team followed the decoy patient till Bijnor where they informed the police. “It was an inter-state sex determination racket. We will be conducting multiple raids to curb such practices. We conducted several raids in Gurgaon, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as the issue is not only related to the district,” Yadav added. The team has conducted 15 raids in the last one year and has arrested more than 20 people. The investigations in several other cases are still going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/illegal-sex-determination-racket-busted-four-held/articleshow/89005575.cms||---

On Tuesday, it had plummeted to around 9.8% after hovering around 17-18% over the past few days, district health officials said.

They have also intensified inspections at each of the border points, guest houses, hotels and other places in the district.

---||Noida||Two weeks after launch, few takers at pink vending zones||Noida: To promote women entrepreneurs, GB Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh had inaugurated over 50 vending zones across nine locations under the ‘Mission Shakti’ scheme on January 3. Two weeks later, only a handful of these vends were found operational.On Tuesday, when TOI visited the kiosks at Sectors 37 and Sector 76-77, no vendors were found at the spot, while only three of the five slots at the Sector 125 vending zone were found occupied.Rubi Devi 42, one of the street vendors at Sector 125, said, “It has been 15 days here but we are not earning much. There is Amity School in front of us, which is closed right now. So, hardly anyone visits this area.”Devi claimed that the two other vendors who were allotted the slots may not come any time soon since “business is down these days”. She also pointed out that the pink vending zones were largely open. “We have to usually arrange a cover on our own,” she said.Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 76, said the pink vending zone was a unique and excellent initiative by Noida Authority. “But it is sad to see that its execution has not yielded any good results in Sector 37. A few days ago, I found the street near the vending zone in the area completely dark. The Authority has rectified the issue now. But if the women vendors are not coming here, then this initiative holds no good,” Sharma said. Nisha Rai, the secretary of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations, meanwhile, questioned where have the women vendors, seen on the inaugural day, gone? “During the inauguration, we saw several women vendors at their respective stalls. Where have they gone now? Why can’t we see them at their kiosks? If they are not eager to work here, then the stalls should be allotted to someone in need of the location,” said Rai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/two-weeks-after-launch-few-takers-at-pink-vending-zones/articleshow/89005586.cms||---

But the builder has not complied with the repeated requests. The residents also claim that their demands for a state hospital and better public transport facilities have not also been addressed.There are 1,340 flats in the housing society and some 3,000 eligible voters — and all are supporting the ‘No CAM, No Vote’ campaign.Anupam Jain, the AOA president of Gaur City 1, said, “We have been demanding the handover of CAM funds for a long time. But this has not happened yet. This is affecting the society’s maintenance. That is why we have now put up banners.”“We are also facing many other issues. If I particularly talk about Greater Noida (west), it is a small town, the population of which is increasing by the day. However, it still lacks basic facilities like metro connectivity. Lakhs of residents are dependent on autos and cabs. Also, there’s no Ganga water supply here,” he added. Sanjay Rajput, AOA general secretary of the apartment complex, said that while the area lacks a government hospital, there is not a single foot bridge or signboard on the main road and no bus connectivity between Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. “Before lockdown, there was a bus service from Gaur City to the Sector 32 metro station in the mornings and evenings. However, this is not available now,” he said. On the society’s condition, he said, “The poor maintenance has resulted in plaster peeling off the walls and water leaks in the basement. So why should we vote?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/residents-stern-message-to-all-parties-no-cam-no-vote/articleshow/89005590.cms||---
---||Noida||Yogi on ‘Noida jinx’: Previous CMs were scared, but I’ve come here many times||Noida: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath was in NCR for the second time in three days, visiting GIMS in Greater Noida on Wednesday to review the facility for serious Covid patients as well as the Covid control room. The CM, who has during his tenure brushed aside a political superstition that has stuck to Noida for a long time – coming to be known as the Noida jinx for apparently bringing bad luck to chief ministers who couldn’t get re-elected if they visited the NCR city – has made several visits here, personally inaugurating projects and overseeing pandemic preparedness.Also in the middle of the assembly election campaign now, Yogi, while speaking to reporters later, chided his predecessors for being “scared of visiting Noida in fear of losing the CM’s seat”. “It was all the more important that I should come here as previous chief ministers were afraid of coming to Gautam Budh Nagar,” he said.Taking a jibe at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who did not visit Noida during his tenure as CM from 2012-17, the CM added, “For him, his own life and power were more important rather than the interest of people and development work. Since they had no agenda for the betterment of people, they avoided coming here. But I have got a chance to come here many times during the first and second wave of the pandemic. Now, I have come here once more to witness the good work being done at GIMS by the team of doctors.”Other than visits related to the pandemic, the CM has made other trips to Gautam Budh Nagar. He visited Dadri last September to unveil the status of Samrat Mihir Bhoj and again in November along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Noida International Airport at Jewar. The CM also rode the inaugural train of the DMRC’s Magenta Line to Botanical Garden in December 2017.This was in stark contrast to previous years when the ‘Noida jinx’ often circulated in political circles and made a chief ministerial visit to the city that drives UP’s economy rare. In any case, no incumbent CM has returned to office in UP in the last three decades and one can hardly blame that on the ‘Noida jinx’ alone. The last time a CM returned to office was ND Tiwari of Congress in 1985. During his visit to GIMS, Yogi commended the facility for treating many Covid patients during the first and second waves, noting that out of the 450 beds at GIMS, 300 are equipped with oxygen and 120 are ventilator-enabled. The CM also pointed out that during the third wave, hospitalisation has been less than 1% but the district is well-prepared. Later, talking to TOI, GIMS director Brig Rakesh Gupta (retd) said, “The CM, during his visit to the facility, was very happy with our achievements during both waves of Covid and our management of the patients even during the third wave. GIMS has recently been awarded the best Covid care centre among 67 medical colleges across Uttar Pradesh on parameters like treating a large number of patients, bringing out publications, etc.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/yogi-on-noida-jinx-previous-cms-were-scared-but-ive-come-here-many-times/articleshow/89005592.cms||Abhijeet Singh

A video of the men barging in the house has gone viral and police have launched a search for the accused. Speaking to TOI, Abhay Bhadauria, a resident of Sector 71, said that the incident took place at his four-storey building in Sector 70. “I have rented the flats out in my Sector 70 building. The incident took place around 3.30 pm on Wednesday on the first floor, where a family of three members – a married couple and their daughter live,” Bhadauria said. He went on to add that the three men very smoothly entered the building premise and went directly to the first floor. “They knocked at the door and when the daughter opened it, the miscreants pushed her aside and held the mother at knife-point. Later, they ransacked the flat and fled with gold jewellery worth Rs 8 lakh and some cash,” he informed, adding that the 50-year-old woman had received some injury while trying to resist. Police scanned the CCTV footages of the area and a video has been found in which the three men have their faces covered and can be seen entering the building. One of the suspect was also seen carrying a backpack. “Initial investigation has revealed that two men entered the flat while the third person stood at the door and guarded them. A case has been registered under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC against three unknown people at Phase 3 police station,” Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police, (ADCP) Noida Central said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/robbers-enter-flat-in-sec-70-steal-cash-and-jewellery-at-knifepoint/articleshow/89005593.cms||Advitya Bahl

Also taking inputs from the companies keen on the project, the Yamuna Expressway Authority has revised the terms and conditions of its bid documents.Officials said the date of evaluating the technical bids was pushed from January 24 to April 13 and the annual turnover of firms required for participation was brought down from Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 1,500 crore at the request of the 21 companies that participated in the pre-bid meeting.Though the CEO of the authority was on leave, one of the officials handling the project told TOI that the decision to relax the conditions was taken in consultation with higher officials in Lucknow.“We have brought down the threshold technical capacity by Rs 1,000 crore. It was done to accommodate more companies. The participants said they’re not eligible for constructing a project worth Rs 2,500 crore and asked us to reconsider the ceiling up to Rs 1,500 crore,” he said.Moreover, instead of considering the five financial years, the Authority agreed to accept execution of construction works or for similar works executed over the past seven years. “But we have clearly told the potential bidders that only the background for the construction of similar projects is going to be considered. The cost of land is not going to be included while gauging their financial standing,” said another officer.Meanwhile, the deadline to apply for the project with relaxed conditions has also been pushed to a later date. Instead of January 22, the Authority is going to accept bids up to April 11.Floated by the Yogi Adityanath government, the Film City project is going to be developed with a budget of Rs 10,000 crore out of which a capital of Rs 2,000 crore is going to be required upfront.Director of Prius Communications in NCR, Baldev Raj said, “We all are waiting for Film City to come up in Greater Noida. It is going to bring a lot of opportunities in the region and I am going to take up a commercial space within the city.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/film-city-conditions-eased-up-firm-to-be-finalised-after-assembly-polls/articleshow/89005595.cms||---

But the builder has not complied with the repeated requests. The residents also claim that their demands for a state hospital and better public transport facilities have not also been addressed.There are 1,340 flats in the housing society and some 3,000 eligible voters — and all are supporting the ‘No CAM, No Vote’ campaign.Anupam Jain, the AOA president of Gaur City 1, said, “We have been demanding the handover of CAM funds for a long time. But this has not happened yet. This is affecting the society’s maintenance. That is why we have now put up banners.”“We are also facing many other issues. If I particularly talk about Greater Noida (west), it is a small town, the population of which is increasing by the day. However, it still lacks basic facilities like metro connectivity. Lakhs of residents are dependent on autos and cabs. Also, there’s no Ganga water supply here,” he added. Sanjay Rajput, AOA general secretary of the apartment complex, said that while the area lacks a government hospital, there is not a single foot bridge or signboard on the main road and no bus connectivity between Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. “Before lockdown, there was a bus service from Gaur City to the Sector 32 metro station in the mornings and evenings. However, this is not available now,” he said. On the society’s condition, he said, “The poor maintenance has resulted in plaster peeling off the walls and water leaks in the basement. So why should we vote?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/residents-curt-message-to-govt-no-cam-no-vote/articleshow/89005602.cms||---

In the first 12 days of this month, cases from outside Bengaluru accounted for barely 22.6%, and in the next six days, their share went up to 34.7% taking their overall share this month to 31%. The number of cases outside Bengaluru has seen more than 200% rise in the past six days while cases in Bengaluru jumped 72%. Health commissioner Randeep D told TOI: "Going by past trends, other districts trail Bengaluru. We expect Bengaluru to stabilise around 40,000 cases a day and district numbers picking up is an indication that we are nearing the peak and then the cases would go down. Bengaluru trails cities like Mumbai and Delhi by around a week to 10 days, while districts trail Bengaluru by around the same time." January surge: 5 districts have over 1 lakh casesIn the first 12 days of January, districts outside Bengaluru had cumulatively reported only 20,843 while the capital reported 71,339 cases. In the next six days (January 13-18), Bengaluru added 1.2 lakh cases and Rest of Karnataka (RoK) added 65,789. The state has more than 2.5 lakh active cases, the highest since June 2021. The average daily cases give a better perspective. In the first 12 days, Bengaluru reported 5,945 fresh cases every day on average, while it was 1,737 in RoK. Between January 13 and 18, Bengaluru reported 20,565 cases on average each day, a jump of about 245% compared to a 532% jump recorded in RoK which had 10,965 daily cases on average. Overall, from only three districts having more than 1 lakh cases as of December 31, the January surge has five districts — Mysuru, Tumakuru, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan and Ballari — with more than 1 lakh cases. The sharp increase in cases is also reflected in the Test Positivity Rate (TPR). The TPR for January 17, the latest district-wise break-up available for a single day, shows some districts like Hassan, Tumakuru and Mysuru with more than 30% while 21 of 30 districts reporting a double-digit rate. A seven-day average for the past week shows there are more than 10 districts with a double-digit TPR, led by Bengaluru. Randeep, while urging people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour, reiterated that low hospitalisation is a relief for authorities and the medical fraternity. "If walk-ins (where patients get admitted without triaging) at private hospitals are included, the number of patients occupying beds is still under 5%. We're putting in place all measures, including dedicated beds for Covid, to handle any unforeseen situation," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/blurus-share-of-fresh-cases-dips-in-past-6-days/articleshow/89005609.cms||Chethan Kumar

---||Mumbai||Old Worli crematorium in Mumbai to get world-class makeover||MUMBAI: At a time when death has literally become a part of life, Mumbai will soon have a world-class public crematorium open to all communities. The Mata Ramabai Ambedkar crematorium, just off Worli Naka, is being transformed into a series of eight covered pavilions where the last rites can be conducted under vast skylights and amidst landscaped gardens, with in-built closed circuit cameras that can relay the ceremony to friends and family across the world. Spread over 9 acres- currently peppered with decrepit buildings, sheds and giant banyan trees-the Worli crematorium is among the oldest in the city. Of the total 202 venues for last rites in Mumbai, the BMC manages 64-it has 43 crematoriums (of which 11 are electric), 13 cemeteries for Muslims and 8 Christian cemeteries. Each of 8 pavilions at the crematorium will be lit up by natural skylightThis particular one also features a Parsi prayer hall for those who opt for cremation, which will remain. Parts of the ground are being converted into public parks. “The pandemic has brought into focus the fragility of life. And everyone deserves to die with dignity,” says Bharat Parekh, trustee of Antim Samskar Seva, a Mumbai organisation that offers free cremation services to all communities, and took the next logical step by reimagining an existing crematorium. Designed by renowned architect Rahul Mehrotra, the project aims to create a space that is both poetic and functional, while also being environmentally responsible. The first set of pavilions are expected to open this March, though there may be some delay due to the pandemic as well as the nearby Metro work, says Parekh. The trust will manage the new Antim Prasthan for the next five years. The Rs 40 crore project has been generously supported by individual and corporate donors, perhaps resonating with anyone who has confronted death in a city too busy to pause and take notice of this lacuna. Philanthropist Hemendra Kothari says, “I could not help but notice the rundown neglected condition of the Worli crematorium when I attended the cremation of a family member recently. While I was seriously thinking about doing something about it, Dr Ramnik Parekh and Dr Bharat Parekh, as if by telepathy, brought forward their proposal to give a dignified last journey to the deceased and a calming environment for those mourning their loved ones.” His view is echoed by many other benefactors. RGopalakrishnan, former director of Tata Sons, says, “The project reminded me that nobody is more than a second away from death, and certainly the senior citizen. Renovating the Worli crematorium as a modern sarvadharma free institution is laudable.” Indeed, many in the city know that this is potentially their final resting place. When the resident of a neighbouring highrise noticed the new buffered steel chimney come up, she walked in and offered a cheque for Rs 50,000 towards the project. The idea of transforming a space of mourning into one that exudes beauty and serenity also serves as an entry point into a larger discussion on aesthetics in public life. “We have focused too much on imagining physical infrastructure as in flyovers and roads, we need equal emphasis on social infrastructure—schools, hospitals, crematorium, and so on,” says Mehrotra, who currently chairs the department of urban planning and design at Harvard University while continuing to engage with projects in India. The layout has been envisioned such that one leaves the city behind the moment one crosses the threshold. An entry court leads to a 10,000-square-foot open courtyard, with a water body, around which are air-conditioned waiting lounges as well as prayer halls. The flow of the spaces enables social distancing as well as privacy. Piped gas will replace the traditional electronic crematoriums and the remains will go through a process that would be least environmentally damaging for the congested residential neighbourhood that includes both highrise buildings and low-income colonies. “We imagined the crematorium as a space where a human being rests for the last time in bodily form,” says Mehrotra. “Their loved ones are whom the building should really be responding to—as a container of grief and celebration. How then can the building be spatially articulated to create a sense of enigma and transcendence for a journey to another world while yet meeting the pragmatic needs of those left behind?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/old-worli-crematorium-to-get-world-class-makeover/articleshow/89005613.cms||Namita Devidayal

On the other hand, you have persons giving hate speech, what is called fighting words in Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire, or hate speech, actually calling for genocide of the entire (inaudible). And we find reluctance of the authority to book these people.’’He further said, “We also have unfortunately the other higher echelons of the ruling party not only being silent qua hate speech but almost endorsing it.’’ Justice Nariman was giving the keynote address on ‘Constitutional Underpinnings of the Rule of Law’ at a virtual inauguration of D M Harish School of Law on January 14. The former judge said, “Not only is it unconstitutional, it is a criminal act. It is criminalised under Section 153A and 505 (c) of the Indian Penal Code. Unfortunately, in practice though a person can be given up to three years’ imprisonment, this never really happens because there are no minimum sentences prescribed. If we really want to strengthen the rule of law as contained in our Constitution, I would suggest strongly that Parliament amend these provisions to prove a minimum sentence, so that it acts as deterrence for others to make hate speech of this kind.’’“So when you have 19 (1) (a) being administered as it is being administered today, there is a big red signal that is put up so far as the rule of law is concerned. It is time to do away completely with these sedition laws and allow free speech, so long as ultimately it does not exhort someone to violence and ends up as being hate speech,’’ he stressed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sedition-laws-colonial-in-nature-junk-them-says-justice-nariman/articleshow/89005615.cms||Swati Deshpande

BMC officials said the extra nine seats will be scattered equally — three each for the island city, eastern and western suburbs. A senior BMC official said that the first draft of the revised ward boundaries was sent to SEC a fortnight ago with rise in seats done strictly by sticking to natural area boundaries and civic administrative wards. However they asked BMC for changes.“Once the revised draft is submitted, the next step will be to invite suggestions and objections that will be done by SEC. Unlike the 2017 election when the lottery for ward reservation was held in 2016, this time it is yet to be done and it will happen after suggestion/objection is done. It will be done as soon as boundaries are finalised. We expect the polls to be held on schedule or with very slight delay,” an officials saids. While 50% of these are reserved for women candidates, there is parallel reservation for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and OBC category candidates among women in these seats. The last time the number of electoral wards went up in the city was in 2002 when the number of wards rose from 221 to 227.“The average voters in each electoral ward is now around 54,000. With nine more seats, this average will now drop to 51,000, with a 10% here and there. Mumbai’s population is around 1.24 crore. Once we get orders from the state government, we will rework ward boundaries keeping in mind the new average voters per ward and redraw boundaries,” the official added. Total registered voters in Mumbai is 94.55 lakh as per the figures in 2019. Officials said redrawing of ward limits is done to balance voter population across wards. As per the 2011 census, population growth in suburbs and drop in island city were factored in while redrawing electoral wards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/redrawing-limits-of-236-poll-wards-final-to-be-submitted-to-sec-today/articleshow/89005620.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cost of Hancock bridge rebuilding to rise by Rs 11 crore||MUMBAI: Cost of reconstructing Hancock bridge, near Sandhurst Road station, will cost BMC Rs 11 crore more — up from the earlier Rs 75 crore, according to minutes of a meeting accessed by TOI. To get around the extra cost, BMC plans to invite fresh tenders for the extra work that needs to be done. When the British-era bridge was razed in 2016, cost of its reconstruction was pegged around Rs 50 crore which went up by Rs 25 crore. TimesViewReconstruction of Hancock Bridge has already been inordinately delayed ever since tenders for the work were floated in May 2016 and the winning firm was found to be under police probe in BMC’s road scam. The high court ordered the tender to be scrapped and the BMC administration was forced to go back to the drawing board. Finally, in 2018, BMC’s standing committee cleared the proposal to reconstruct the bridge. However, work has been going at a snail’s pace. The matter had reached Union minister Piyush Goyal, who in a letter to the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in August 2018, had said that despite central clearances, reconstruction of the bridge had not begun. BMC must now ensure that the new bridge is ready soon.At a meeting held in November, the chief engineer (bridges) stated that scope of work on the bridge is increased due to addition of three viaducts to give proper access to adjacent properties and it will escalate the cost by Rs 11 crore. However, BMC’s chief engineer (bridges) Satish Thosar told TOI that the cost not will not rise. “No revision in contract will be done. Extra work proposed beyond contract cost will be done later by inviting a separate tender,” he said, adding that one lane on either side may be open for traffic by April end. However, activist Kamlakar R Shenoy said cost of the bridge has risen due to delay of construction at right time. “I have documents stating that in 2012 the cost was Rs 14 crore which rose to Rs 50 crore...,” said Shenoy. MLA & corporator Rais Shaikh said shops near the bridge have suffered as BMC drags its feet. MLA Amin Patel of Congress said the bridge is unlikely to be thrown open even till June.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cost-of-hancock-bridge-rebuilding-to-rise-by-11cr/articleshow/89005621.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Ex-Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh shivering when quizzed, says former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh||MUMBAI: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday told the Justice K U Chandiwal commission that the then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh when summoned to the council hall was in the dark and was shivering when asked about the planting of explosives in an SUV parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and murder of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran. Justice Chandiwal is probing into the allegations made by Singh in his March 20, 2021, letter to the chief minister levelling allegations against Deshmukh of demanding assistant police inspector Sachin Waze (now dismissed) to collect money from bar owners for him. Later, Singh almost backed out, saying he would neither like to depose before the commission nor he would like to be cross-examined by the witnesses. “When myself and three additional chief secretaries sought details of the incident, Singh was virtually shivering. He told us he was unaware of the bomb scare episode. We insisted upon Singh, when Waze was so proximate to him, how it could be that he was unaware of the event,’’ Deshmukh said. Further, he said, when a few senior officers suggested to transfer the probe to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), Singh opposed and insisted that Mumbai police continue the investigation. On March 6, 2021, a decision was taken to entrust the probe to the ATS, and on the same day Waze was shifted out of the crime intelligence unit. When Waze’s counsel Yogesh Naidu asked Deshmukh about the dismissed cop’s style of functioning, he said his pattern of working was discussed and indicated in the report submitted by joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambe on March 30, 2021. Deshmukh said he agreed with part of the report where it was mentioned that Waze was not reporting to senior officials in the crime branch and that he restrained all his subordinates from reporting to senior crime branch officials and in all sensitive cases, he used to accompany Singh for briefing to the cabinet members. When asked if Bharambe was asked to conduct a probe into Singh’s letter, Deshmukh said he was not aware. “As home minister, I never asked Bharambe to conduct an inquiry. I have no idea as to whether the CM directed such an inquiry to the additional chief secretary through the police chief,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/singh-shivering-when-quizzed-says-deshmukh/articleshow/89005622.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Aaditya Thackeray backs Kanjurmarg shift but says options open for Metro-3||MUMBAI: State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray who said the state government is now "actively considering" an alternate location for Metro 3 shed insisted that Kanjurmarg still remains the best option since it has been proposed as a hub for a car shed for three different Metro lines: 3,4 and 6 would criss-cross the entire MMR region, extending beyond Mumbai. "The final clearances and approvals are yet to be taken, but other locations are under active consideration of the government and being discussed," Aaditya said. The delay in finalising a location has already set the project back by a couple of years and led to cost escalations. Proposed site for Metro car depot in KanjurmargOn his first day in office in 2019, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray scrapped the car shed at Aarey Colony in deference to protests from citizens and environmental groups. On October 12, 2020, the CM declared that the car shed would be shifted to Kanjurmarg where, he said, the proposed plot was owned by the state and would entail zero cost. However, with the Bombay high court staying an order by the Mumbai Suburban District Collector that transferred 102 acres of land in Kanjurmarg to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority to build the Metro car shed, the Kanjurmarg plot remains out of bounds. And while the 33.5 km line remains without a plot for a car shed, its overall cost has risen by around Rs 10,000 crore. TimesViewOver two years after it scrapped the Metro 3 car shed at Aarey, the Shiv Sena-led government has failed to find an alternate site. The cost of this underground rail project has already escalated by Rs 10,000 crore and funds from the Japanese lending agency too will dry up soon because of the government’s inaction. The state must resolve the car shed dispute and set a strict timeline to get the project back on track. If the depot can't come up at Kanjurmarg then a new technically and financially sound location must be finalized fast."The Kanjurmarg plot was supposed to be a car shed for multiple Metro lines like 3, 6, and 4. It was the designated land for the Metro 6 car shed. Where was the previous government going to build the car shed for Metro 6? It was at Kanjurmarg only," Aaditya said. "During the BJP government they had no issues for a Metro 6 car shed on this (Kanjurmarg) plot but now the Centre has moved the courts." However, the MVA regime's refusal to look beyond Kanjurmarg at other options is increasingly being seen as jeopardising a high value project that can transform the quality of life for millions of commuters in Mumbai. "The state government has wasted two years in finding a location for the Metro 3 car shed. Since it is finally acknowledging that Kanjurmarg may not work out, they must now find another location and get the project on track. Two years has led to lot of delay and cost hike. This can't go on. The government must also take the bureaucracy to task for the mess," said RTI activist Anil Galgali.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/aaditya-backs-kanjur-shift-but-says-options-open-for-metro/articleshow/89005624.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Knowing the tuition fees of private institutes helps students decide their college options if they fail to get a government seat. While some colleges have put out interim fees on their portals and some are planning to continue with last year’s fees, the fee fixation process is delayed owing to the pandemic this year.Kashibai Navale Medical College, Pune, has put out an interim fee structure for the 2021-22 on its portal. The tuition fee for open category will be Rs 13.6 lakh, but it added that the final fee will be as per the decision of the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA). Two other colleges, NKP Salve and Ulhas Patil Medical College, have declared their fees at Rs 10.5 lakh and Rs 6.6 lakh, respectively.KJ Somaiya, Terna and Vendantaa Institute of Medical Sciences in Mumbai are yet to issue a circular on fees.Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said that it will be good if the colleges are planning to continue with last year’s fees.“But colleges should put out notices stating that the fees may change if the FRA approval comes later. Students will currently fill their choices based on the fees mentioned on their portals, so there should not be any surprises later,” said Shenoy.An FRA official said there have been delays in submission of proposals owing to the pandemic and lockdowns.

Prima facie, the blast occurred due to a malfunction in the 4,000-tonne warship air-conditioning compartment 'possibly linked to Freon gas leak', said a source. The 11 injured crew members are undergoing treatment at INHS Asvini hospital at Colaba. Their condition is stable. There were around 300 Navy personnel on board when the blast occurred. "The three victims were asleep three floors lower from the main entrance of the ship when the blast occurred. Those who sustained injuries were in the mess on the second lower floor (one floor above the explosion spot)," said a police officer. "Many of the had inhaled smoke, while others had sustained injuries after running into the walls as the smoke had filled the room." A police team will again visit the warship to collect further details, said sources. The bodies of the deceased sailors, Krishan Kumar (46), Surinder Kumar (47), and A K Singh (38)-assigned the roles as signal and communication, sports PT master, and anti-submarine instructor, respectively-were sent to the Navy after post-mortem examination at JJ Hospital. "The family members of the deceased sailors have been informed. The bodies will reach their respective homes where the final rites will be performed along with the Guard of Honour. Meanwhile, the board of inquiry has started a probe into the cause of the accident," said the defence spokesperson. INS Ranvir was on a cross-coast operational deployment from the Eastern Naval Command since November 2021 and was due to return to the base port at Visakhapatnam shortly, the Navy said. "There are no major material damages on board. The warship will sail once the board of inquiry is over and the damaged compartment and equipment repaired.

The carcass was noticed by motorists near the Chena creek on Ghodbunder Road, which is surrounded by the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Forest officials reached the spot and took custody of the carcass. Forest data identified the leopard as C-40, a male leopard aged around three years. The postmortem was done at the Wildlife Hospital, Borivli. Post mortem findings were suggestive of blunt trauma (probably due to fall from height) resulting into rupture of liver leading to internal hemorrhage and subsequent hypovolemic shock as probable cause of death. Forest officials have ruled out the big cat being hit by any vehicle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/3-yr-old-male-leopard-found-dead-on-ghodbunder-road/articleshow/89005629.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to take up proposal to reopen schools from Monday||MUMBAI: Following demands by parents and schools, the school education department has submitted a proposal to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking reopening of all schools, including pre-primary classes, in the state from Monday, January 24. The proposal is likely to be taken up in the cabinet meeting on Thursday. In the wake of rising cases of the third wave, physical classes at schools and colleges in the state were shut till February 15. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said they are empowering the local bodies to decide on details like which classes to start, frequency and from when. “In the proposal that we have sent this time, we have suggested reopening of pre-primary classes, apart from classes 1-12, but the final call has to be taken by the local administration as to which classes they want to start taking into account the Covid-19 situation in the area,” said Gaikwad. The minister said they have sought vaccination camps for 15-17-year-old students in schools and want it made mandatory for teaching and non-teaching staff to be fully vaccinated. “We have sent the proposal and are hoping for a positive response. The local administration has to plan how they want to call the students and they have to ensure that all the SOPs given by the state government are followed,” said Gaikwad. Officials said the SOPs will continue to be the same as they were, and parents’ consent will be mandatory. Shivnath Darade, president, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Samiti, said schools should reopen but teachers testing positive should be given paid leave. Principals said the abrupt closing of schools puts a financial strain. “Each time we shut and reopen, we have to spend on sanitisation. The state should allow schools to decide on opening and shutting,” said a Bandra school principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cm-to-take-up-proposal-to-reopen-schools-from-mon/articleshow/89005632.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Mumbai||‘Superbugs claim 1.3 lives a year, 3.9 lakh in soutth Asia alone’||MUMBAI: Superbugs kill around 1.27 million people globally every year, according to the first study to measure (as against estimate) the burden of drug-resistant microbes. Traditional antibiotics and antifungal medications are increasingly failing to act on the bugs affecting people. To track this phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance, University of Oxford and the Institute of Health Metrics & Evaluation studied 471 million actual individual records/isolates from 204 countries to work out the death burden. The paper has been published in the medical journal ‘The Lancet’. “This study is important because it has for the first time found the burden of AMR in terms of mortality. It also found an alarming burden in South Asia,” said senior scientist Dr Kamini Walia who leads Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s AMR initiative. Almost 30% of the 1.27 million AMR deaths or 3.89 lakh occurred in South Asia in 2019. The study also underlined how high levels of hospitalisations from Covid-19 have possibly accelerated the burden of AMR as most patients were prescribed antibiotics. In India, a five-day course of common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin was given to several Covid patients. While India didn’t contribute to this study, past researches by Dr Walia have shown that AMR is a big concern, especially during the pandemic. “We have AMR data from big cities that have hospitals and good laboratories. To calculate the nationwide burden of AMR, we need data from 50 to 100 hospitals,’’ said Dr Walia. The ICMR has recently begun a study in nursing homes and smaller hospitals. Meanwhile, the Oxford study has underlined three concerns: growing drug resistance in children, tepid response by governments and lack of research for new antibiotics. In 2019, one in five global deaths attributable to AMR occurred in kids under five—often from previously treatable infections.  Leading pathogens in South Asia, including India, are Klebsiella pneumoniae (61,800 deaths attributable to AMR in South Asia in 2019) and Ecoli (63,300 deaths), said the paper, adding current action plans on AMR are not ambitious or fast enough. Between 1980 and 2000, 63 new antibiotics were approved for clinical use, and 2000 and 2018, just 15, it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/superbugs-claim-1-3m-lives-a-year-3-9l-in-s-asia-alone/articleshow/89005636.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination: Booster uptake slow in Maharashtra, 40-42% vital workers covered||MUMBAI: Almost 10 days since the country’s immunisation programme rolled out booster shots against Covid-19 for essential workers and people above 60, the response has been less than enthusiastic in the state. Maharashtra has administered 4.63 lakh doses out of more than 60 lakh delivered in the country. The turnout has been particularly slow among healthcare workers, who were the first to get vaccinated against Covid in the country. Since January 10, out of over 4 lakh eligible healthcare workers (HCW), barely 40% (1.6 lakh) have taken it. The numbers are marginally better for frontline workers (FLW), where just 42% or 1.3 lakh out of nearly 3 lakh eligible have taken their precautionary jabs. More senior citizens (1.4 lakh) have taken the precautionary shot compared to the FLWs. More than hesitancy, the raging Omicron wave may have been responsible for the low uptake. Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of the state Covid-19 task force, said in every medical institution, nearly 30-40% healthcare workers have caught the infection in the past few weeks. “Their booster shots are now easily delayed by at least 2-3 months. But for those who haven’t got Covid recently, they mustn’t delay taking the precautionary shot,” he said. In Mumbai, many HCWs had taken the booster before the formal launch of the third shot and that could be denting the official numbers, said a hospital head. The city has given booster shots to 32,466 HCWs, 41,403 FLWs and 27,174 senior citizens. A closer look at the district-level performances shows that the bigger urban districts are mainly making up the numbers. Across the three groups, Mumbai, Pune and Thane are leading. As many as 23 districts are below the state average when it comes to FLWs, while in case of healthcare workers, 26 districts are below average. The variation between high- and low-performing districts is stark. Compared to Raigad that has covered 4,259 FLWs, the highest (86%), Buldhana has managed to give the third shots to only 5% or 200. Among HCWs, Bhandara has covered 100% of its eligible 3,300 beneficiaries, whereas Gadchiroli has boosted less than 400 (9%). Only those who have completed nine months since their second shot are eligible to get the booster. Dr Anil Rudey, civil surgeon of Gadchiroli, said the tribal-dominated district has been slow in accepting the first two doses as well. “At present though, the reason could be infections among frontliners in big numbers,” he said, adding that he was in isolation himself after testing positive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/booster-uptake-slow-in-state-40-42-vital-workers-covered/articleshow/89005637.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The commission has to submit its interim report on the data in two weeks,” said Bhujbal. “Now at least there is some hope and a deadline of two weeks,” he added.The Opposition BJP has said the government is fooling the public. “Till now, the MVA government said that the Centre was not parting with its data on OBCs and this had become a hurdle in getting the quota. Now it is saying it had the data all along. It is just making a fool of the public,” said BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who belongs to the OBC community.The SC clarified that the states can act upon the interim recommendations of the dedicated commission for determining the quantum of OBC quota in panchayat polls. The court still calls upon states to fulfil the requirements of the triple test.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mva-govt-sc-has-opened-window-for-obc-quota/articleshow/89005640.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||High court junks 2017 Telangana GOs to raise PG medical fees||Hyderabad: The state government transgressed its purview in fixing fees for PG medical courses in private medical colleges, the Telangana high court said on Wednesday as it struck down two GOs (41 & 43) issued in 2017 raising it substantially. The HC also directed private colleges to refund the excess money collected from students and to release the original certificates of those who had completed their PG courses within 30 days. "Colleges cannot insist that students clear dues related to the excess fee," said a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Shameem Akther while disposing of PILs filed by the Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association and a few others challenging the state's action. Agreeing with the argument of petitioner's counsel Sama Sandeep Reddy, the bench said that fixing fees is the job of the Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (AFRC) and the state has no role. The state, in this case, had done this job even after being aware that the same was done by the AFRC for the block period 2016-19. In fact, the state itself had notified the AFRC recommendations for the period 2016-19, but subsequently the special chief secretary kept urging the AFRC to review the fee structure which the latter refused to do. When the HC asked additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao about state's authority to issue GOs 41 and 43 on May 9, 2017, raising PG medical course fees for minority and non-minority medical colleges even after it was fixed by AFRC, he admitted that the job belonged to the AFRC and the Supreme Court too had made it clear that state governments should not venture into tasks meant for AFRCs. Sandeep said that the HC decision to strike down the GOs would help thousands of PG medical and dental doctors sitting idle because all their original certificates were being illegally withheld by colleges in the state. "All these doctors will now be available for service in both government and private sectors. This would strengthen the medical and health infrastructure in the state, especially during the pandemic," Sandeep said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-junks-2017-t-gos-to-raise-pg-med-fees/articleshow/89005679.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Business||A third of Indian enterprises already on multiple clouds: Nutanix survey||BENGALURU: A survey by enterprise cloud company Nutanix found that about a third of respondents in India have adopted multi-cloud. It found that remote work is a key driver fuelling companies’ enterprise cloud deployment strategies. Multi-cloud was followed by traditional data centres (29%) and private clouds (23%). More than half in India (58%) expect to support multi-cloud within three years. “There is a lot of emphasis on interoperability, on not being locked in by a vendor, and on integrated security from a private cloud perspective,” said Faiz Shakir, managing director – sales in Nutanix India & Saarc. “We have had customers who are early adopters of public cloud dating to 2013 and 2014, and there are customers who have indicated that they are on different legs of their cloud journeys. Digital natives and startups are looking at the goodness of the public clouds, security, convenience and cost-benefits, and economics of the private cloud,” he said. Shakir said that customers are embracing different clouds for different applications, but with interoperability. Nutanix’s survey found that nearly one in five respondents from India (19%) are already using three or more public cloud providers, outpacing the global figure of 13% and the Apac average of 12%. The same percentage in India (19%) said all their employees currently work remotely, significantly more than the global (7%) and APAC (8%) averages. Nearly half (46%) in India said their expected multi-cloud growth in the next three years would be driven by this factor, and 60% said remote work solutions such as virtual desktops are important to their organisations. As multi-cloud deployment accelerates, so does the importance of application mobility and cloud interoperability. Most enterprises surveyed in India (93%) said they have moved at least one application to a different infrastructure in the past year. They put security and compliance (55%) as the top reason, followed by improving data access speeds (49%), gaining better control of the application (48%), and integration with cloud-native applications (48%). The report finds Indian enterprises prioritising security more than their global counterparts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/1/3rd-of-indian-enterprises-on-multiple-clouds-nutanix/articleshow/89005683.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

However, six umpires from India, chosen by five associate countries, are part of the 19-member team.They include Bengaluru’s Nitin Bathi (Netherlands), Rahul Asher (Oman), Vijay Prakash Mallela, Sameer Bandekar (both USA), Sarika Prasad (Singapore) and Arnold Maddela (Canada).Bandekar was a former BCCI panel umpire who officiated in an ODI in India against Zimbabwe in 2002 before migrating to the US while Sarika Prasad from Visakhapatnam is one of the senior umpires in the ICC associate panel for more than a decade.Unlike the previous editions, this year’s umpiring team mostly consists of those from Associate countries while full-member countries are represented by Pakistan, England, West Indies and Ireland.It is learnt that Sri Lanka’s upcoming tour of India and the pandemic resulted in the BCCI not picking any umpire for the U-19 World Cup.According to ICC’s special playing conditions, home umpires can be appointed for international matches, which means India’s umpires in the ICC Elite and International Panel would be busy officiating the home series.Nitin Bathi, a 35-year-old electronic engineer at Intel, said: “It is a great opportunity for me. I never thought cricket would still be part of my life when I moved to Europe. However, things turned out differently and I was given the opportunity by the KNCB (Royal Dutch Cricket Association) to do ODIs against Scotland and Ireland last year and was also inducted into the development panel. I was at the right place at the right moment.”Rahul Asher from Oman said the global event was a great learning experience for him. “This is a dream come true for me. It is amazing to watch the future stars of cricket. I am proud to represent Oman and being an Indian to be at this stage and I would like to thank Oman Cricket for this wonderful opportunity,” the 42-year-old IT professional from Vadodara said.Vijay Prakash Mallela from Kodad in Telangana said the event was an excellent opportunity to showcase their skills. “So far, the experience has been excellent, in a safe environment. There were pre-tournament workshops and team briefings that all members of the playing control team were part of to reinforce our knowledge of both on-field and TV umpiring and game processes,” the 40-year-old techie, settled in the US, added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/indians-give-umpiring-a-global-feel/articleshow/89005684.cms||Harigovind

City-based RTI activist T Narasimha Murthy had sought information on total expenditure incurred during the PM’s swearing-in ceremony. However, Murthy claimed the RTI reply didn’t furnish all the details he had sought. Murthy first filed the RTI on May 30, 2019 — the day Modi was sworn in — with Rashtrapati Bhavan. He sought to know the total cost/detailed item-wise expenditure with break-up of expenses on high tea, food arrangements — both vegetarian and non-vegetarian — for all participants, including foreign dignitaries, transportation, including air fares for foreigners, light, sound, flower decoration, invitation cards and other expenditures in connection with the ceremony. The query was transferred to different departments like the president’s secretariat, president’s estate division and horticulture department of the central public works department. On July 5, 2019, Murthy received a reply from the president’s secretariat and it read: “There is no separate account maintained for individual function. The expenditure is incurred from the annual budget allotted to the section of the secretariat.” On July 19, 2019, Murthy wrote to Rashtrapati Bhavan. “The central public information officer has not invoked any exemption as provided under RTI Act to deny the information. Once expenditure is incurred by the public authority, the same cannot be denied stating that ‘no separate account is maintained or not available in the secretariat, etc’ since such information is held by the public authority under section 2(F) and citizens are entitled to know such information,” Murthy stated. On August 8, 2019 the office of executive engineer, president’s estate, central public works department from Rashtrapati Bhavan, furnished the expenditure incurred on mobile toilets. Since no information was forthcoming on his other queries, Murthy filed an appeal with the Central Information Commission on November 15, 2019, stating that details sought by him were not furnished. During pendency of the appeal, Murthy was provided details on expenditure towards temporary lighting and sound on December 20 last year and on flower decoration the next day. According to the three replies, a total of Rs 73,15,505 was spent on mobile toilets, light and sound and flower decorations. While Rs 32,11,953 was spent towards mobile toilets, Rs 11,79,750 was the bill incurred for temporary lighting, Rs 18,63,744 for sound system and Rs 10,60,058 for flower arrangements and display of potted plants. “Keeping in view the facts of the case and submissions made by both the parties, the commission is of the view that adequate information as per the RTI Act has been provided... at this stage,” the CIC said, disposing of Murthy’s appeal on December 24, 2021. Still pursuing matterClaiming that information cannot be refused to his unanswered queries, Murthy has now written to YK Sinha, chief information commissioner, New Delhi, seeking a direction to the public information officer, Rashtrapati Bhavan, to provide him the detailed break-up of expenses incurred toward air tickets, high tea, food arrangements, transportation, invitation cards, boarding and lodging for foreign delegates, CCTVs and other expenditure for the PM’s swearing-in ceremony.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/pm-swearing-in-toilets-light-sound-flowers-cost-73-lakh/articleshow/89005685.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Court upholds BDA rule, dismissessite allottee’s appeal||BENGALURU: Upholding the amended rule 13(1) of BDA (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 2008, the high court has dismissed a writ appeal filed by an Arkavathy Layout site allottee. “It is clear the facility to pay in instalments within three years is extended only to those allotted sites of small dimension. In this case, the petitioner was allotted a bungalow site measuring 50x80ft. Therefore, there is no discrimination among a particular class of allottees here,” a division bench headed by justice PS Dinesh Kumar observed while dismissing the writ appeal filed by BC Latha. Latha was allotted site no. 589 under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes quota, the total value of which was Rs 7,58,500. She gave Rs 3.65 lakh on August 24, 2006, and Rs 1 lakh on October 11, 2006. She did not pay the remaining amount in time. BDA issued a notice on August 5, 2009, asking her to explain why the allotment shouldn’t be cancelled. Thereafter, she approached the authority for reconsideration of her case. BDA, meanwhile, cancelled the allotment on November 13, 2009, and refunded the amount deposited by her. However, Latha claimed to have redeposited the amount with the authority. Later, she challenged the cancellation of site allotment and refusal to extend instalment facility to pay the balance amount. She also questioned the amended rule 13(1), saying it is unconstitutional and violates Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. She said the rule creates a distinction between allottees of sites measuring 6x9m (20x30ft), 9x12m (30x40ft), and 12x18m (40x60ft) over grant of instalment facility. On October 1, 2012, a judge rejected her petition. She subsequently challenged the ruling before a division bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/court-upholds-bda-rule-dismissessite-allottees-appeal/articleshow/89005686.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka biggest buyer of IOC ‘smart cylinders’||BENGALURU: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) sold the maximum number of composite LPG cylinders in Karnataka so far. Of 5,221 sold since August 2021, a whopping 4,300 have been from Bengaluru. IOC officials said these fibre-made cylinders are transparent and consumers can see how much gas is left. “The rust-free and sleek composite cylinders are suitable for modern kitchens. They are safer and 50% lighter than steel gas cylinders,” said an IOC spokesperson. Of 5,221 composite LPG cylinders sold in the state, 5,184 were 10kg ones and 37 were of 5kg. Across the country, IOC sold 20,831 composite cylinders, including 20,166 weighing 10kg. Karnataka is followed by West Bengal (3,947), Uttar Pradesh (2,357), Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (1,784), Delhi and Haryana (1,646), Bihar (1,367), and Tamil Nadu (1,061). IOC launched composite cylinders in New Delhi in March last year and in Bengaluru in August. “At present, composite cylinders are available in 5kg and 10kg sizes. The refundable security deposit for domestic non-subsidised category is Rs 3,350 for the 10kg variant and Rs 2,150 for 5kg. Indane customers can replace their existing steel cylinder with a composite one by paying the difference in security deposit,” said an IOC official. He said composite cylinders will be delivered home like the existing gas cylinders through Indane distributors. At present, refill cost for composite cylinder is Rs 635.5 (for 10kg) and Rs 332.5 (5kg). Ramesh Kumar, secretary of All-India LPG Distributors Federation (Karnataka chapter), said: “A majority of composite LPG cylinder customers are techies in Bengaluru who are ready to pay extra deposit. The refill cost for a normal 14.2kg domestic cylinder is Rs 902.5 and deposit amount for an LPG connection is Rs 1,450 (for one cylinder). Existing customers can opt for composite LPG cylinders by paying the difference amount.” He said these modern cylinders are safe compared to steel ones, thus reducing the risk of LPG blasts. Other oil companies such as BPC and HPC are yet to launch composite cylinders. Many customers are happy with composite cylinders. “The idea is good but we are worried it will be scrapped midway even after people paying more for deposit. The authorities should facilitate an online option to switch to composite LPG cylinder without visiting an LPG distributor. At present, the facility is available only for new customers,” said Megha S, a Hebbal resident. “The biggest advantage of such cylinders is we know how much gas is left, so we can book a refill accordingly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-biggest-buyer-of-ioc-smart-cylinders/articleshow/89005687.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Officials from the chief minister’s office said the meeting will mainly focus on the Mekedatu dispute as the case is coming up for hearing in the SC on Monday. The apex court will hear Tamil Nadu’s petition seeking the court’s direction to restrain Karnataka from taking up the project that envisages constructing a reservoir across Cauvery. Mekedatu has become a politically sensitive issue after Congress led a padayatra to seek its early implementation. Officials said the CM would send out a message that his government is not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring justice to Karnataka in getting its share of water. Disputes related to Krishna and Mahadayi rivers will also be discussed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cm-to-discuss-water-disputes-at-virtual-meeting-on-saturday/articleshow/89005688.cms||---

The man has now been directed to pay Rs 25,000 as cost to his wife within one month, failing which he should pay a sum of Rs 250 for every day’s delay.The petitioner, who worked as a college lecturer and was later promoted as principal of an evening college in the city, had challenged the family court order dated August 2, 2017. While allowing an application filed by the wife under Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the family court had awarded a monthly maintenance of Rs 5,000 to her and Rs 2,500 each to the two minor children.Opposing the petition, the wife claimed though the order was made way back in August 2017, the petitioner-husband hadn’t bothered to pay one single rupee.On the other hand, the husband is gainfully employed. He further claimed if the wife hands over custody of their children to him, there would be no difficulty in paying maintenance and the children would be taken care of by his parents, who stay at his house. “If the petitioner had no means of paying maintenance, such a submission wouldn’t have been advanced at all,” the judge observed while rejecting the plea.However, justice Dixit pointed out that the petitioner did not produce any material evidence to substantiate his claims about his wife’s employment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/obligation-to-maintain-wife-not-linked-to-income/articleshow/89005689.cms||Vasantha Kumar

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Landlords face 6 police cases over illegal layouts in Varthur||BENGALURU: At least half-a-dozen criminal cases were registered against landlords in Varthur area near Whitefield between January 11 and 15, for allegedly developing layouts illegally and selling them to gullible people. According to police, the suspects developed residential layouts without getting land-use conversion approved from the department concerned and without obtaining permission from competent authorities to develop layouts. In 2018, staff from the office of tahsildar, Bengaluru east taluk, KR Puram issued notices to the suspects. The revenue officials sought explanation from the landlords about illegal residential layouts and asked them to furnish documents to show they had developed the layouts legally. But neither did any of them produce any documents, nor did they give clarifications. So, the revenue officials decided to file police cases to enquire about the suspect’s illegalities before taking any action against them, including demolishing buildings standing in those illegal layouts. Police said they have registered six cases filed by Pundalik Chowhan and Sudhakar, revenue officials for Varthur circle. “We will investigate the cases and submit a chargesheet before the court. The revenue officials may take further action to demolish the illegal layouts,” a police officer said. According to sources, police registered the first case on January 11, related to a layout developed in Gunjuru village. Sudhakar filed a complaint against Narayanappa GR, Rajappa, Vijayalakshmi, Nagappa, Kavita Yakul and Manjunath, who together owned 2.3 acres. Five more cases were filed by Chowhan related to illegal layouts in Varthur. Police have named Puttamma, Nagappa, Yallamma, Venkatamma, Muniyappa, Ramayya, Krishnappa, Munireddy and Jayarama Reddy as suspects in the five cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/landlords-face-6-police-cases-over-illegal-layouts-in-varthur/articleshow/89005691.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The protest unfurled at the Syndicate Hall in Jnana Bharathi campus. They said the meeting took decisions even though there was no quorum and blamed the vice-chancellor for the alleged violation. Syndicate member Sudhakar said: “There was no quorum at the special syndicate meeting convened where major decisions like giving Rs 50 crore to the PG centre at Ramanagara and making 13 daily-wage workers as permanent employees, were taken without following rules. Though ex-officio members have no voting powers, they were counted to overcome the lack of quorum.” Sudhakar said including the vice-chancellor, there were only six members present at the meeting. “We will continue to protest until the decisions are withdrawn,” he added. “The decisions taken during the special syndicate meeting will be discussed thoroughly before implemented. The syndicate members can give suggestions on how they will be implemented or on changes required. The special syndicate meeting was held as per the requests of members themselves. It was decided two months ago. Why are they raising an issue now?” vice-chancellor Prof KR Venugopal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bu-syndicate-members-want-meet-decisions-withdrawn/articleshow/89005692.cms||---

The accused are Purushotham N alias Manja, 26, of New Timber Yard Layout, Kiran R, 21, of Srinagara, Kartik V, 21, of Cottonpet and Rahul L alias Arjun, 28, of Kanakanapalya in Jayanagar. Police recovered 20kg of ganja worth Rs 6 lakh, a car, mobile phones and a machete from them. According to Harish Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (south), they are associates of rowdies Kullu Rizwan and Star Rahul. Rizwan and his associates were into drug peddling to make quick money. KG Nagar police had arrested four teenagers from Andhra Pradesh on January 7, when they had come to hand over 201kg of ganja to Rizwan’s gang members. Police learnt about the involvement of Rizwan and Star Rahul in drug peddling. Police knew there were warrants pending against Rahul and launched a manhunt for him.

---||Bengaluru||Peenya bus terminus in Bengaluru may get tech park||BENGALURU: With its Rs 40-crore Basaveshwara bus terminal at Peenya — meant for KSRTC buses heading towards north Karnataka — remaining defunct, the cash-strapped, state-run bus corporation is mulling setting up a software park there.  Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) recently floated a tender for selection of a consultant for feasibility studies and transaction advisory services for the construction of office space (software park) and commercial establishments at Peenya under a PPP model. “The project involves greenfield development of a software park, commercial space in a land to an extent of two acres at Peenya. The said land is next to the bus terminal and Metro depot. There is also a proposal to construct a Metro station adjoining the bus station,” the tender reads. Many passengers said the location of Peenya bus terminal is wrong. “It’s difficult to reach the terminal from anywhere in the city as it lacks direct Metro connectivity. When most private buses are operating from CBD areas, why will someone go to Peenya bus terminal to board a bus? No wonder the bus terminal has now become a white elephant,” said Sathish A, a regular KSRTC passenger. In 2020, BMRCL had planned to set up a new station at the Peenya terminal. Though two Metro stations — Peenya Industry and Jalahalli — are in the vicinity, passengers are reluctant to use the terminal because of poor connectivity. Due to poor patronage, KSRTC had shelved the plan to shift buses heading to Tumakuru, Pavagada, Davanagere, Hassan and Chikkamagaluru to the terminal. KSRTC bus station is 1km from Jalahalli Metro station and 1.4km from Peenya Industry station. However, proposals for a skywalk and travelator between Metro and bus stations remained on paper. Currently, Kerala State Transport Corporation is operating some schedules from Peenya. Similarly, KSRTC floated a tender for the greenfield development of an office space and residential area in one acre of land at Wilson Garden on PPP basis. In Deepanjalinagar, it decided to construct a commercial complex and passenger amenity centre. “The proposed site is next to the Metro station. We are planning to develop this project on a PPP basis,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/peenya-bus-terminus-may-get-tech-park/articleshow/89005695.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Hijab row: PU department to discuss uniform for students||BENGALURU: Following the recent controversy in a PU college over wearing of hijab by some students, the department of PU education plans to raise the issue with the education minister at the next meeting. At the discussion, the department plans to propose introduction of uniform for PU students. “We will take up the issue. We will see if we can propose a uniform, probably from the upcoming academic year,” said Snehal R, director, department of PU education. She, however, said the department is yet to formulate any recommendation for the proposal. Muslim students of an Udupi PU college haven’t been attending classes for three weeks after they were not allowed to wear hijab to class. It is not the first time that this issue is rearing its head in Karnataka. In January 2021, at Pompei College in Aikala, several students started to don saffron shawls, as pupils from te minority community were wearing headscarves to the college. There were incidents in 2016 too where a pharmacy college in Valachil, Dakshina Kannada district, banned students from wearing headscarf and in another first-grade college students in Bellare wore saffron shawls. However, uniforms in PU colleges have been a much-debated topic. While one section argues that uniforms curtail freedom of college-going adolescents, the department in the previous years decided against the move as there were concerns that colleges would compel students to buy uniforms, thus turning it into a lucrative business. St Joseph’s PU College, one of the first PU colleges in the city to start uniform on campus, said it has given the institute a formal structure. “Our students from the boys’ school had uniforms till class 10. When they came to the PU college, we thought we could continue with the system, giving it a formal and professional look. It also brought discipline in classrooms, something students need to have as they move forward in life,” said Fr Roshan Pereira, director, St Joseph’s PU College, Bengaluru. But there are educationists who choose to differ. “Uniforms have meaning in school, when children are immature. As long as a student’s dress does not hinder the learning-teaching process in a college, and does not harm peers in any way, there should not be an issue with it. It will be infringing upon the fundamental rights of individuals — their right to choice of dress and right to follow a certain faith,” said Niranjanaradhya VP, educationist. Signature campaignCampaign Against Hate Speech, a social initiative, has initiated a signature drive condemning discrimination against hijab-wearing Muslim students, particularly in Udupi, where women students have been denied access to classrooms. They are calling it a blatant violation of Article 25 of the Constitution. The campaign has garnered over 1,000 signatures so far. College holds meeting to resolve issueAnother attempt was made on Wednesday to resolve the hijab row at the Government PU College for Girls, Udupi. Principal Rudre Gowda, said another round of meeting was held in the presence of government officials, including the assistant commissioner, tahsildar, minority welfare department representatives, parents and six students. The assistant commissioner interacted with the students. It was decided the students can wear a hijab in the classroom, however, once the teacher arrives and classes begin, they will have to remove it. In case they do not agree to this, they will have to wait for the government order. They can also wear the hijab during sports day, cultural day or any other social gathering. The principal said only six students are refusing to enter class if they are not allowed to wear the hijab. About 75 other Muslim students are attending classes like any other student, Rudre Gowda said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hijab-row-pu-dept-to-discuss-uniform-for-students/articleshow/89005699.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||BMRCL refused to give land for parking e-buses: BMTC||BENGALURU: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited has turned down a request from Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation seeking vacant land behind Kengeri Bus Terminal Metro Station. BMTC officials said they had asked for the land mainly for electric buses and also to set up a small bus stand. “We are inducting 300 12m electric buses from Ashok Leyland. We want to set up opportunity charging (charging battery for short periods through the day) stations for these vehicles,” said a senior BMTC official. He said the current Kengeri Traffic Transit Management Centre is a small bus terminal. “The TTMC can accommodate only 20-30 buses. Many buses from Mysuru side coming from places like Bidadi are being parked on the roadside due to lack of a bus stand. Traffic police issued multiple notices for parking them on the roadside as it is causing severe congestion,” the official added. He said they have proposed an underpass for buses there. “BBMP could construct an underpass so our buses will be able to reach BMRCL’s vacant land behind Kengeri Bus Terminal Metro Station without hassle. This will also reduce the bottleneck on Mysuru Road, especially during peak hours,” he said. However, BMTC officials said they received a negative response from BMRCL. “It has a large parcel of land behind the terminal Metro station which has been lying vacant for the past few years. The space is ideal for a small bus stand as well as an opportunity charging station, but BMRCL stated it wanted it for commercial development,” said an official. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “In most of the places, we have acquired land for Metro purpose only. I will look into this case.” BMTC officials said BMRCL is taking over a large parcel of their land in Hebbal for Metro work. “We have a bus depot in Hebbal and that land is now required by BMRCL. Our operations will also be affected and our buses will be parked on the road,” they said. The Metro corporation recently decided to scrap the proposed intermodal transit hub (IMTH) at Challaghatta across NICE Road and along Mysuru Road. IMTHs are common in foreign cities to help passengers shift from one mode of transport to another without hassle.

---||Bengaluru||Police didn’t oppose bail todrug-peddling accused cops||Bengaluru: Two police constables from the chief minister’s security detail and two of their associates who were arrested for alleged drug peddling managed to obtain bail within five days of arrest because police did not file objections to their bail petitions though they had been booked under NDPS Act.Taking serious note of the failure to file objections, police commissioner Kamal Pant suspended inspector Ashwath Gowda and sub-inspector Veerabhadraiah, both attached to RT Nagar police station where the peddling case against the four was registered, for dereliction of duty.Constable Santosh Nowkar, 33, and head constable Shivkumar, 34 both attached to Koramangala police station, and two others — Amjad Khan and Akhil Raj — were arrested on the night of January 13 after the four were caught red-handed near the CM’s house with 500 grams of ganja. The accused were sent to judicial custody the next day, and were granted bail by a local court on Tuesday. DCP (south-east) Joshi Srinath Mahadev and DCP (VIP security) Manjunath Babu have been served notices, seeking an explanation on the constables’ deployment in the CM’s security detail. Pant told TOI, “The two had not raised the matter of the constables’ arrest in the drug-peddling case to senior police officers. Further, they failed to file objections to the bail petitions filed by the accused, including the constables, in a serious case like NDPS. The two DCPs have been asked to explain why the constables were selected for the CM’s security detail,” he said.Will act against errant cops: Home ministerHome minister Araga Jnanendra on Wednesday warned the police department that the government will take stringent action against personnel who indulge in illegal activities. “Forget suspension, I have asked the heads of the police force to even dismiss them if the crime is proved,” he said. He said the one lakh-strong police force is being seen in bad light due to some illegal acts, and a few bad apples in the department are causing a problem. Jnanendra said he will announce a reward for the honest officers involved in apprehending the accused in the RT Nagar drug-peddling case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/police-didnt-oppose-bail-todrug-peddling-accused-cops/articleshow/89005701.cms||---

Three of his accomplices were also caught. The gang primarily supplies drugs to people from the film industry and college students in Chennai. Sources with NCB said the arrests took place on Monday evening after the anti-narcotics agency received information that the Nigerian and his gang had come to the city to purchase drugs. The sleuths raided a four-star hotel in Electronics City and busted the gang, which was in possession of 84 grams of cocaine, 40 grams of MDMA and small quantities of hashish and ganja. The seized substances are worth Rs 50 lakh in the international market. NCB refused to reveal the identity of the suspects citing investigation hurdles. But sources said the Nigerian is a notorious drug peddler in Chennai and has strong links to Kochi. He had come to Bengaluru for a specific deal. He was previously arrested in drug cases involving those from the film industry. In 2015, a famous Malayalam actor was nabbed in a drug raid and was later found to be a regular buyer from the Nigerian, sources added. All four suspects are in judicial custody. They are lodged in Central Jail (Parappana Agrahara) and further probe is under way . tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/drug-dealer-3-aides-nabbed-narcotics-worth-50l-seized/articleshow/89005703.cms||---

Both the AIADMK and the BJP demanded Central armed police force for protection. At an all-party meeting convened by the commission, parties, including the DMK and the AIADMK demanded a single phase poll. “The state had seen elections to Lok Sabha and assembly in single phase and witnessed irregularities during the two-phase rural local body polls. When we have elections for only corporations, municipalities and town panchayats, why can’t the state have a single phase?” AIADMK election wing secretary Pollachi V Jayaraman said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/parties-demand-single-phase-election/articleshow/89005704.cms||---
---||Chennai||Maruthu brothers to come alive in TN’s tableaux||CHENNAI: What Tamil Nadu could not display on Rajpath will roll out on Kamarajar Salai in Chennai, complete with Subramania Bharati, V O Chidambaram, Velu Nachiyar and Maruthu Pandiyar brothers. The elements will appear with modifications in two tableaux, accompanied by a third tableau with the freedom fighters of Tamil Nadu summing up the theme ‘Tamil Nadu in Freedom Struggle’. There would not be tableaux of government departments nor cultural programs, a customary event, due to the surge in Covid cases in the city, sources said. With the expert committee of the Union government rejecting the state’s seven sketches after three rounds of suggestions and modifications, chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday expressed his disappointment over the ‘denial of opportunity’ for the state to take part in the prestigious R-D Parade in Delhi. He announced that instead the tableau will be part of the R-D celebrations in Chennai. “It has been decided that the elements proposed originally for Delhi will be showcased here with certain modifications,” said a source. Freedom fighters VOC and Bharati, whose 150th and 138th birth anniversaries are celebrated this year, would find prominent place in the tableau. The design approved by the committee in the third round had the bust of VOC on a ship model, but the state government’s latest design has the leader, imprisoned by the British, pulling the oil press in jail, beside the ship model. The second tableau will have queen Velu Nachiyar, the first queen to have fought the British, riding a horse with a sword with women soldiers holding spears. Kalaiyar temple will form part. The hanging of freedom fighters Maruthu Pandiyar brothers in public would be part of the tableau, which was earlier rejected by the committee, which felt it was a “harsh portrayal”. The tableaus will be taken to all important cities in the state after the R-Day event in Chennai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/maruthu-brothers-to-come-alive-in-tns-tableaux/articleshow/89005706.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Urban local body election notification likely on January 22||CHENNAI: The State Election Commission is likely to make an announcement on January 22 and issue notification on January 24 for the urban local body polls in the state, while the elections will take place within three weeks of the notification, multiple sources told TOI. The commission has been holding a series of meetings with officers and political parties just ahead of making the announcement that would involve voting by half the population in the state. The elections would be held in 21 corporations, 138 municipalities and 490 town panchayats, including the local bodies that have been upgraded and expanded by the DMK government after assuming charge. “With the Supreme Court deadline inching closer, the commission is gearing up to make the announcement on January 22. The notification of polls will be made two days after the last date of filing nominations, scrutiny and withdrawal of papers. Elections are expected to take place in the second week of February,” said a source. The state government notified the reserved seats for SC (women), SC (general), ST (women) and women (general) based on the 2011 census and on rotation basis for all urban local bodies, leaving the parties to search for women candidates in the run up to the polls. Taking a cue from the Election Commission that issued guidelines recently for the five poll-bound states, the state election commission indicated, at an all-party meeting held on Wednesday, that a series of restrictions would be enforced. They would include a ban on physical rallies for political parties and candidates, and roadshows, reduced capacity for indoor meetings, and a maximum of three people, including candidates for door-to-door campaigns. The commission sought views from the parties on the conduct of election in phases, polling time and Covid-19 measures. When the DMK representatives urged the commission to hold elections similar to the recently-held polls to rural local bodies, AIADMK election wing secretary Pollachi V Jayaraman said the commission should conduct the polls at the earliest as per the orders of the Supreme Court. “We wanted the commission to spell out campaign restrictions during total lockdown,” Jayaraman said. The state Congress urged the commission to consider setting up vaccination camps in the polling stations and mechanism to check the genuineness of Covid-19 patients, who would be allotted the last hour for polling. BJP general secretary Karu Nagarajan said the list of Covid patients, who wanted to exercise their franchise, should be made available. A booth in every polling station could be allotted for Covid patients instead of a separate hour of polling, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/urban-local-body-election-notification-likely-on-jan-22/articleshow/89005707.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||O Panneerselvam hits out at Tamil Nadu govt on MGR statement||CHENNAI: AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam on Wednesday strongly criticised the state government’s recent press statement that claimed late chief minister M Karunanidhi named the medical University in Guindy after the AIADMK founder. In a press release, the former chief minister said that the Tamil Nadu Medical University Act was enacted by the AIADMK government in 1987 and subsequently named it Dr MGR Medical University, Tamil Nadu, through an amendment in the same year. The DMK government in 1991 amended the legislation by only prefixing Tamil Nadu. “Belittling the famous leader of Tamil Nadu, who has huge popularity and who still remains in the minds of people, is strongly condemnable. I wish to bring to the notice of the chief minister to give up attempts to distort history in the future,” Panneerselvam said. The government’s statement about release of special commemorative stamp on MGR and unveiling the statue of the leader, was nothing but seeking publicity given that a memorial had been built for the leader on Marina front, coveted Bharat Ratna conferred on him and a statue installed in Parliament, Panneerselvam said. He also criticised the attempts to portray that MGR got fame because of the films in which the screenplay and dialogues were penned by former chief minister M Karunanidhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ops-hits-out-at-state-govt-on-mgr-statement/articleshow/89005709.cms||---
---||Chennai||M&M, Hero Electric announce EV partnership||Chennai: In one of the most significant tie ups in electric mobility, Mahindra Group and Hero Electric have announced a tie up that will include joint product development, supply chain synergy, capacity and platform sharing. As part of the collaboration, Mahindra “will make Hero Electric scooters for India market in its Pithampur plant,” said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto & farm sectors, Mahindra & Mahindra. M&M on the other hand will jointly develop new products with Hero Electric as well as use the EV market leader’s existing platforms to spawn products for its European motorcycle brand Peugeot. “We will look at using electric platforms of Hero Electric to create to build Peugeot products for global markets,” said Jejurikar. “Hero Electric will leverage our Pune development centre for joint development of products.”The tie up is a win-win because it will allow Hero Electric to expand its production capacity and use M&M’s supply chain without huge capex spend. The tie up is “part of Hero’s growth and expansion plans to cater to the growing demand for EVs,” said the company statement. As part of the partnership, Mahindra Group will manufacture Hero Electric’s most popular electric bikes – Optima and NYX at their Pithampur plant to meet the growing demands of the market. “With this collaboration along with the expansion of their existing Ludhiana facility, Hero will be able to meet its demand of manufacturing over 1 million EVs per year by 2022,” said the statement. Naveen Munjal, MD, Hero Electric said, “This coming together of two industry leaders is to further enhance the manufacturing capabilities to meet demand and utilize Mahindra Group’s robust supply chain to reach newer centers in the country. The long-term partnership will also see both the companies make the most out of each other’s deep knowledge of EVs and drive new product development in the next few years.” For M&M, the partnership will be key to developing electric platforms for its Peugeot brand globally. Said Jejurikar, “Peugeot Motocycles has ambitious plans in the EV mobility space in several regions of the world and particularly in Europe. This strategic partnership will bolster these efforts through joint development and a platform sharing approach leveraging the combined strengths of the two businesses. Our R&D Centre in India will be integral to this arrangement as will the manufacturing facility at Pithampur, that already supplies Peugeot with EV products.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mm-hero-electric-announce-ev-partnership/articleshow/89005710.cms||---

The company is planning to expand its EV footprint, tie up joint ventures and tech agreements with global players for its sensor and connected vehicles solutions, nearly double production capacity and exports ahead of its organizational restructuring which will “commence in April 2022 and end by March 2023,” said MD Vikram Mohan. Armed with a capex of around Rs 600 crore for the next three years, the company is looking to increase its capacity value from Rs 2,200 crore right now to Rs 4,000 crore even as it works towards becoming a long-term debt free company in the next 12 months by wiping out the Rs 100 crore debt on its books right now.“Our DIS (driver information system) business, which contributes 50% of our revenue, will continue to be relevant for electric vehicles, but we are moving up the value chain into connected clusters, navigation, vehicle management system apart from developing controllers for both EV and ICE vehicles as well as battery management systems,” said Mohan. The company is in advanced talks with American and European partners for joint ventures and tech agreements in the battery management, sensor and connected cluster segments to get into higher value products and increase its EV product range. “Currently EV is 5% of revenue, but we are targeting 15% by 2025 and are working with both ICE players getting into EV as well as new all-electric names,” he added. The Rs 600 crore investment – 50% debt and rest internal accruals – in products, new technology and capacity will also help Pricol service its Rs 2,000 crore current order book. The company is not only adding capacity at its Sri City, Pune and Satara factories, it is also ramping up its R&D muscle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pricol-kicks-in-growth-with-ev-new-business-capacity-addition/articleshow/89005711.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Wait for RT-PCR results gets longer||CHENNAI: If you have given your sample for a RT-PCR test, it wouldn’t be a surprise if you get the result only after three days. Earlier, the results came within 24 hours. The reasons for the delay, officials say, are staff shortage, festival holidays and increased testing by asymptomatic people. Greater Chennai corporation claims it tests nearly 30,000 samples daily, of which 15,000 are those collected at government-run centres. The weekly positivity rate is more than 20%, but it takes the corporation 2-3 days to deliver results. Symptomatic patients who have tested themselves have been asked to be in quarantine until the results are out. The city has seven labs, each with a capacity to test 5,000-10,000 samples daily. “The problem is not capacity. Samples collected at 9am reach labs only at 6 pm and are verified and tested the next day. The results need to be manually uploaded on ICMR portal which takes time,” said an official. VIPs testing at corporation sampling centres get results within six hours. In private labs, it takes 18-24 hours. Health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said ICMR guidelines were being followed and urged people to follow the same. “Only those with symptoms, comorbidities and unvaccinated should get tested. We will increase technicians and ensure delay is reduced.” The focus, he added, was on those still infected by delta variant and the unvaccinated with comorbidities. City health officer Dr M Jagadeesan said the corporation had passed orders for additional 25 lab technicians to be hired. “They will join this week. We are also ensuring there is a shift system in labs so that technicians get adequate rest. Many technicians also tested positive and samples from some labs had to be shifted to the others. We have now introduced a system where samples tested at 9am will be sent at 2pm. And those collected after 2pm will reach labs by 8 pm. This way, the time taken to deliver the results will reduce,” he said. Experts have urged people to not panic. “People just need to follow ICMR guidelines. Many continue to give samples before discharge and within seven days of home isolation. This is not required,” said T S Selvavinayagam, director of public health.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/wait-for-rt-pcr-results-gets-longer/articleshow/89005715.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Despite doing RAT, people told to undergo RT-PCR at all hospitals||Chennai: Several symptomatic patients have been picking up the easily available antigen self-testing kits for Covid-19 over the past few days. However, after testing positive when they go to a hospital for screening — blood tests, X-rays and CTs — all hospitals advise them to give samples for RT-PCR instead. While the state claims they have the capacity to screen more than three lakh samples a day, labs in cities such as Chennai are already overburdened. Doctors say they have no options but to suggest a repeat Covid-19 test as the state does not accept results of antigen tests. At the government Covid hospital in Guindy – the exclusive Covid 19 hospital – patients are not admitted without RT-PCR. Hospital head Dr K Narayanaswamy said the hospital does the test free of cost ahead of screening or admission to Covid ward. This means, a patient has to wait in isolation for at least 24 hours for screening or admission. Most private hospitals have the same rule. “It’s a very tricky situation,” says infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan.These tests detect viral proteins (antigens) of the infected person at the peak of the infection. It is not as accurate as RT-PCR because some infected people may pass the test as a false negative. But for most patients, who are symptomatic, it is an advantage as it can be done at home at a cheaper cost and results are available in less than 30 minutes. “So there are chances of false negatives in antigen, but chances of false positives are very marginal. I tell patients that they are positive. Yet, I suggest a repeat test,” he said.Vellore-based microbiologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said PCR was definitely the right test two years ago when RAT was not very good. “RAT pretty good now. Don't need confirmatory PCR,” she said.Experts who are a part of the state panel have asked the state to consider RAT including home tests, which are approved by the centre. The state says they receive the results of all RAT positive cases including those who take home tests, but as a policy the state has decided to stick to RT-PCR.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/despite-doing-rat-people-told-to-undergo-rt-pcr-at-all-hospitals/articleshow/89005716.cms||---
---||Chennai||Medicos complain of pending incentives, accommodation||CHENNAI: Government medicos on Covid-19 duties have complained that they are finding it difficult to arrange accommodations during their quarantine period and many still haven't received the promised incentive amount. The government last year announced that all healthcare professionals in state-run health facilities will receive Rs15,000 as incentive for their work during the second wave. (April to June) Dr. Ganapathy, General Secretary of Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association, said that many still haven't received this amount and some among them have received only Rs7000 to Rs8000. In response, R. Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education said that the incentive amount was fully credited for all healthcare professionals who worked for the entire three month period. The government sanctioned Rs98 crore towards this and the incentive amount was credited to all eligible healthcare workers on November 2 and three reminders were sent to deans of all government medical colleges. However, the government order doesn't specify incentives for those who joined in May or June. Deans are worried that financial audit teams might rise an objection later, he said. As far as quarantine issues are concerned, Ganapathy from TNMSA said, "Medical officers, who were initially recruited for mini clinics, were later shifted to government medical colleges. However, they were told to arrange their own accomodations. (Not in hostels) Some of these doctors who tested positive are finding it difficult to find rooms or houses for quarantine. On top of that, some haven't got their salaries for the past two months". So, TNMSA demanded immediate release of the pending salary and increase in quarantine period as the present norms and conditions are leading to significant surge in cases among healthcare workers. DME Narayana Babu said that during the first wave healthcare workers who tested positive were allowed to be in isolation for two weeks followed by a 7-14 day quarantine. But now, many have received two doses of vaccine and government norms have changed. It has come down to one week, but, these are not hard and fast rules as deens have been advised to extend the quarantine period of affected doctors if necessary, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/medicos-complain-of-pending-incentives-accommodation/articleshow/89005717.cms||Ram Sundaram

The petitioner, G S Mani, alleged that despite allocation of huge funds by the state government for storm water drain projects, the corporation had failed to maintain sewe lines in the city. When the plea came up for hearing, the first bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu refused to entertain the PIL. According to the petitioner, improper management of sewerage and drainage pipelines by the corporation and illegal encroachments has led to water-logging. The state has recorded deaths in the past few months due to inundation and thereby immediate action is needed, he added. Mani wanted the court to monitor the ongoing storm water drain projects by setting up an expert committee to prevent and resolve water logging in the city during rains. Responding to the plea, Chennai Corporation submitted that a similar case was already pending before the court and status reports had already been filed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-rejects-pil-seeking-experts-committee-to-tackle-waterlogging/articleshow/89005718.cms||---

The sum shall be paid within three months, said the southern bench of the NGT on Wednesday. It also asked the principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden to utilise the amount to implement measures to avoid man-animal conflicts, including electrocution of wild animals, in forests and fringe areas where wild animal passage is anticipated. The bench comprising judicial member, Justice (retd) K Ramakrishnan and expert member Dr Satyagopal Korlapati further directed Tangedco to ensure that wherever electricity supply lines pass through forest areas, underground cable with necessary sensors be adopted. It should also follow the measures recommended by National Board for wildlife (NBWL), such as burying transmission lines underground, setting up reinforced electric poles with spikes to prevent elephants from rubbing against them among others. The bench also noted that transformers could be a cause of concern and directed Tangedco to prepare an action plan to insulate the transformers and suggested barbed wire fence around transformers. “Tangedco is directed to provide numerical relays with necessary scientific and technological protective mechanism so as to disconnect electric supply automatically whenever such displacements or snapping of live wires happen,” the NGT bench stated and directed the state government to provide necessary infrastructure as well as financial assistance for implementation of directions issued by this Tribunal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/animal-deaths-tangedco-told-to-pay-75lakh-compensation/articleshow/89005720.cms||Ram Sundaram

People would die if elections are permitted under such circumstances,” senior advocate S Prabakaran argued on Wednesday. When the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu commenced their proceedings on Monday, Prabakaran made an urgent mention highlighting the issue. He cited a news report published in TOI dated January 19 titled ‘Civic body beings containment process, blocks 387 city streets’ and wondered how elections could be conducted when the streets were blocked. Prabakaran wanted the court to take up the plea for hearing on urgent basis as the election notification would be issued any time soon. Accepting the same, the court informed the senior counsel that the plea would be taken up for hearing either on Thursday or the day after. According to the news report, the number of Covid-19 cases is set to rise in the coming days and the city corporation has begun the containment process on streets with more than three cases. “So far, 387 streets with 10-25 Covid-positive cases have been barricaded,” the report said. According to the petitioner, M Nakkeeran, former joint director of the state Medical Recruitment Board, conducting elections to the urban civic bodies at the height of the pandemic would be disastrous. “It is inevitable that once the elections are announced all the political parties will organise rallies, campaigns and gatherings with scantest respect and regard for social distancing,” he said. Despite stringent guidelines issued by the election commission, headlines carried by all the newspapers revealed that huge public rallies were being organised in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/citing-containment-zones-pil-wants-election-to-urban-civic-bodies-postponed/articleshow/89005721.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Chennai||Elephant Gate bridge in north Chennai will be ready by July||CHENNAI: Relief from traffic congestion may soon be in sight for north Chennai commuters, with the city corporation and Southern Railway expected to finish construction of the Elephant Gate bridge by July. Greater Chennai Corporation will evict 45 families living along the slopes of the bridge. S Devendiran, Superintending Engineer, Regional Deputy Commissioner’s Office (north), said all the evicted families would be given alternate accommodation. The railways has constructed a part of the over-bridge, while the corporation would begin construction of the entry and exit slopes. “Once the eviction is done, we will construct the slopes. Work to construct storm water drains is on,” he said. The 32.95 crore bridge reconstruction, done on a 50-50 sharing basis between railways and the corporation kicked off in 2019 and the bridge demolished later that year. However, there was not much progress until 2021 due to issues with shifting underground electrical lines. Once the bridge is completed, traffic from Mint towards Central railway station on one side and Vyasarpadi on the other is expected to become smoother. Currently, snarls during peak hours last up to 1 hour. Without the Elephant Gate bridge, commuters heading towards Central need to take a 2-km detour either through Wall Tax Road or through Basin Bridge via Raja Muthiah Salai. The bridge is also crucial for vendors and small-scale traders ferrying goods from Wall Tax Road to Choolai.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Rainy season is over, but subways remain wet||CHENNAI: It’s been more than 20 days since the rain stopped, but several subways of the city continue to be riddled with puddles. Experts believe this is due to subways being eight to 10 feet below the ground level coupled with water table near the subways attaining saturation point following a downpour. To prevent this phenomenon, the city corporation had embarked on a costly measure to stop water seepage by coating the subway walls with polyurethane. But the project did not help much. “It cost about 15 lakh. We tried doing this at the Nungambakkam subway, but when we coated one part of the wall, water found its way and seeped from the other part. It became an unfeasible process,” said Karuppasamy G, executive engineer, bridges department of the corporation. Following this experiment, the civic body did not implement it at other subways. As a result, several subways such as the one at GA Road in north Chennai, Thillaiganga Nagar subway in Nanganallur and RBI subway in Parrys are filled with puddles. Subramanian P, a hydrogeologist with Chennai Metro Water and Sewerage Supply Board (CMWSSB), said the water table has attained saturation in many places, and the only way out is to wait till it naturally subsides. “There’s not much that can be done here. Places like Nanganallur have weathered hard rock surface, and water table there may have attained saturation,” he said. GIS expert Dayanand Krishnan suggests grouting, a process to fill in the pores in the walls. He, however, blamed the poor construction quality that allowed water to leak ionto the roads. “The subways, when constructed, must have been waterproof. Joints must be made waterproof too,” he said. With no end to the water seepage in several subways, a commute through the puddled stretch is risky for motorists. This also leads to traffic snarls in the subways, said a regular commuter from Nanganallur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/rainy-season-is-over-but-subways-remain-wet/articleshow/89005723.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Cancer survivors at Egmore hospital in urgent need of diapers||CHENNAI: It’s been a year since G Vijayalakshmi and her husband made their way from the Andamans to the Government Children’s Hospital in Egmore to seek medical help for their son, who was diagnosed with stomach cancer. For the parents, who are already struggling to make ends meet, what takes a real toll financially is the number of diapers they have to purchase regularly for their son. “On a regular day we run through four or five diapers a day. And when he has chemotherapy, he gets loose motions, and we need many more. We have lost count of how many we have to buy in a month,” says Vijayalakshmi. “While he gets free treatment, we have had to pawn our jewellery to meet our other expenses and are struggling to raise money to buy the diapers as he cannot do without it.” To help families like that of Vijayalakshmi, Ilayugam Trust recently launched a Diaper Drive, requesting people to donate or sponsor diapers for children in the cancer ward of the hospital. “One of the volunteers there contacted us for help. When we visited the hospital, we found that there are a lot of families there who need help. Many of them come from other districts of Tamil Nadu and there are a few from other states,” says Alexander Athisayanathan, director, Ilayugam Trust. “While the children get free medicines, the parents have to spend about Rs 70 a day on diapers. And it’s tough as many of them are unable to work as they are tending to their sick children.” Celine Mary, who has been volunteering with the hospital for the last six months, says that people often don’t realise how much money parents end up spending on just diapers. The trust has managed to distribute 2,500 diapers so far. “But we need more as there are many families who need it every day,” says Athisayanathan. “People who wish to help can donate diapers or money directly or to the Trust.” Vijayalakshmi says donating diapers will really help families that are struggling. “We have received diapers from the Trust three times. Each regular packet contains 10 pieces, which last about a day, and bigger ones will last a few days,” she says. “It will really help a lot of children here.” People who wish to donate can contact Ilayugam Trust at 8072467559 or mail ilayugam.org@gmail.com.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cancer-survivors-at-egmore-hospital-in-urgent-need-of-diapers/articleshow/89005726.cms||Priya Menon

According to officials, ITD Cementation India Limited has been awarded contracts to build twin-tunnels and 10 underground stations from Lighthouse near Marina Beach to Kodambakkam flyover. The 10-km long route will be part of the 26.1km corridor-4 from Lighthouse to Poonamallee bypass. With this, contracts for the entire corridor-4 along with Poonamallee depot have been awarded. While the deadline for the new stretch is four years, the 118.9km phase-2 is expected to be ready by 2026.“Once a tender is awarded for an underground stretch, it usually takes an average six months for the construction to begin because the firm has to mobilise machinery and manpower. In case of underground lines, they have to import tunnel boring machines,” said R Ramanathan, former CMRL director.Officials said the construction firm was awarded contracts for two underground stretches on corridor-4 from LightHouse to Bharathidasan Road station covering a 5.15km underground line linked by five stations. These include Light House, Kutchery Road, Alwarpet, Bharathidasan Road. An interchange station linking corridor-3 and 4 at Thirumayilai (Mylapore) will be built as part of corridor-3. The other contract includes a 4.87km underground line from Boat Club to Kodambakkam flyover. The stretch will have five stations at Boat Club, Nandanam, Panagal Park, Kodambakkam and Kodambakkam flyover as well as a crossover at Panagal Park for trains to switch tracks.Ramanathan said usually before the construction of the tunnel begins, the diaphragm wall or the outer walls of the stations will be built by cutting through the soil from the surface of the road. Then the soil within the four walls will be excavated before tunnel boring machines are assembled and deployed through a shaft cut through the soil. The building of the walls may take a few more months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tender-awarded-for-building-underground-metro-rail-line/articleshow/89005727.cms||---

The techie moved the labour court stating that he resigned of his own accord, but arrears that were due to him were not settled by the company despite repeated communication. According to Santosh Kumar, the company had promised to settle the dues to him within a year, but did not do so. The petitioner moved the labour court in Kancheepuram in 2018.

---||Chennai||Court upholds 50% quota and incentive marks for govt doctors||CHENNAI: In a reprieve to serving government doctors, the Madras high court has confirmed Tamil Nadu’s decision to reserve 50% PG medical seats to in-service candidates working in rural areas in the state-quota and additional 30 marks as an incentive. Justice M Dhandapani passed the order while dismissing a batch of pleas moved by candidates from private medical colleges challenging the decision. “…state is not only empowered to create channels of selection by prescribing quotas for open category and in-service candidates, but it is also within its powers to lay down norms with regard to the basis in which the merit list is to be prepared for determining the inter se merit of the candidates competing in the two different categories,” the court said. It is also empowered to decide how the inter se merit is to be arrived at by considering the marks obtained by the candidates in the eligibility test conducted by the testing agency coupled with the incentive marks awarded to the in-service candidates, Justice Dhandapani added. Pointing out that the Supreme Court expanded the scope of the state governments in such issues, Justice Dhandapani said: “The reasons for expanding the scope and armouring the state with the necessary ammunition to lay down relevant guidelines for filling up the seats in the state-wise quota for in-service candidates is only with the laudable object of enabling them to pursue higher studies and, thereafter to serve in rural and difficult areas.” Otherwise it would weaken the public health system and make medical assistance a distant dream for those living in difficult/hilly/remote/rural areas, the judge said. Therefore, the decision of the state does not suffer the vice of any illegality, irrationality, arbitrariness or perversity and the same is founded on well guided principles and application of law, Justice Dhandapani concluded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/court-upholds-50-quota-and-incentive-marks-for-govt-docs/articleshow/89005730.cms||---

According to traffic police, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) workers closed a portion of the road on Wednesday after pouring concrete to level an uneven section of the thoroughfare. CMRL, however, did not remove the barricades when the rush hour began, saying the concrete was yet to set. This forced motorists to rely on only one side of the road, causing a major traffic jam. On information, the traffic police ordered CMRL workers to open the roadfor motorists. Police said they would ensure that the traffic is not disturbed from Thursday. “Traffic was smooth on Wednesday evening and caused no inconvenience to motorists,” said an officer. A Tamil Nadu Road Development Company source said CMRL sought permission from the city police to undertake Metrorail work in the locality but is yet to get clearance. The work is likely to take a year to wind up.

A sub-inspector was suspended over a social media post with political connotations, while two policemen who were on vacancy reserve (VR) for attacking a law student were also placed under suspension.  Flower Bazaar police station SI G Sekar’s social media post has since been deleted. Joint commissioner (North) R V Ramya Bharati said that the post was made a few days ago and action was initiated since there was no proper explanation from Sekar, 55. “He was in total denial about the post, but it clearly shows his allegiance to a political party. He should not have recorded it in public since it is against the conduct of a police personnel,” the officer said. In the other incident, joint commissioner of police of west Chennai S Rajeswari confirmed that two policemen, involved in the alleged assault of a law student in Kodungaiyur, have been placed under suspension since internal inquiry revealed that that the policemen could have handled the situation in a better manner to avoid the confrontation. Action had been initiated against inspectors Rajan of Kodungaiyur police station and Nazima of MKB Nagar all-women police station as they did not guide the personnel properly, the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/si-among-3-city-cops-placed-under-suspension/articleshow/89005733.cms||---

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug that induces intensified thoughts, emotions, and sensory perception. These stamps are sold for 1,000 to 2,000, an officer said.Police secured close to 500 LSD stamps from seven accused, including R Rakesh, 21, of Nesapakkam and I Kishansaran, 25, of Villivakkam who moved the special court seeking bail.The men stated in their petition that they were not present at the scene of initial capture, the Korattur railway station, and claimed that police had falsely implicated them. In response, the prosecution submitted that prime accused Rohith, 24, and Daniel Jacob, 22, were secured near a pump house at Korattur railway station subway and police recovered 23 LSD stamps from their person at the time. Based on voluntary statements from the Rohith and Daniel, five others were arrested and 481 LSD stamps recovered, the prosecution submitted and objected to the bail as the seized contraband is of commercial quantity. Of the seven arrested in the case, one is a college student. The prime accused in the case used a messaging app to form a network and procure stamps from other states, which were couriered over. The accused sold the LSD stamps in and around Korattur. On December 12, 2021, police Rohith and Daniel based on a tip, which led them to other distributors in their network. Special judge J Juliet Pushpa held that the prosecution submitted enough documents to show that the seizure is of commercial quantity and denied bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/spl-court-denies-bail-to-two-held-for-lsd-possession-sale/articleshow/89005734.cms||---

There are close to 10,000 medical and 5,000 dental students in Telangana. All the batches are staring at a possibility of losing a year. Many students rue that they have not appeared for a single examination for the last 8-15 months now, thus throwing the academic cycle completely out of gear. "Technically, my batch should have been in third year by now. But we are stuck in second year, syllabus of which is not even half complete. The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed us back by almost a year and we are not even sure when the next set of exams will be held," said Sai Nath, a student of Gandhi Medical College. The AYUSH students have not appeared for a single exam in the last 15 months, thereby delaying the completion of their undergraduate course. "Our last exam was held in November 2020. After that our exam was postponed for two to three times due to bad weather conditions and Covid-19 cases. We have already wasted a year due to the delay and if this continues I wonder when I'd complete my course," said Akhila, a student of Gandhi Nature Cure College. Lack of clarity on the academic schedule has also added to students' troubles. "Our first year exams which should have been held by early 2021 was held in May. In comparison, other states such as Andhra Pradesh completed the examinations by January, 2021. We are informed about our exams only 20-30 days in advance," said Mohan Dharavath, a student of Osmania Medical College (OMC). It has also put a spanner in their plans to pursue post-graduation and internships as well, students said. "If exams are delayed further, we won't be able to pursue our internships on time, thereby delaying the prospects of appearing for NEET-PG. We will not get sufficient time in our postings which may also affect our learning levels," said Sai Dinesh Reddy, a third year medical student of OMC. Officials at the Kaloji Narayana University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) admit to the delay and said that colleges are now rushing through the syllabus to allow eligible students to appear for NEET in 2023. "Every course is running behind by a few months. We are under immense pressure to complete the syllabus and complete the exams on time as there are regulations for each course. Even when exams are held, we have to ensure there is sufficient gap between all the exams so that students are not stressed," said Karunaker Reddy, vice-chancellor of KNRUHS.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/med-students-stare-at-losing-a-year-as-covid-hits-classes/articleshow/89005737.cms||Preeti Biswas

Khan, a controversial cleric who was earlier booked for making derogatory comments against PM Narendra Modi, told TOI on Wednesday, “After Congress won in 2009 with our support, I had said that ‘Muslims have not forgiven them for the Batla House incident’. They had promised to probe the encounter, but didn’t fulfil it. I have always opposed Congress, but after meeting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra recently, I found that Priyanka and Rahul are true seculars and can bring the country back on the right track.” Khan further said, “We will campaign for Congress in five (poll-bound) states and ensure they get every possible support from our followers. However, we may also oppose the party if they go wrong in future.” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra condemned Khan’s remarks on the Batla incident, calling it “highly deplorable”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/those-killed-in-batla-martyrs-up-cleric-who-joined-congress/articleshow/89005738.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Chief secretary Somesh Kumar along with GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar on Wednesday inspected the Bahadurpura flyover and the Aram Ghar flyover works, which are part of the strategic road development plan (SRDP). The six-lane Aram Ghar flyover would be raised on 119 piers for a distance of 4.08 kilometres and is being built at an estimated cost of 636.80 crore. Of the budget, 300 crore has been earmarked for civil work, while the remaining, 336.80 crore, has been set apart for land acquisition, compensation, dismantling of structures, shifting of utilities and carrying out electrical fittings during execution of the project. The CS directed officials to speed up the construction and examined the existing plans. The flyover, falling under GHMC Charminar zone, would be the second longest in terms of length after PV Narasimha Rao Expressway, which is 11.6 km long. Somesh Kumar told the officials to ensure that the flyover, being constructed between Aram Ghar and Zoo Park, would be of great use to the residents of the Old City, especially those visiting Zoo. The engineers explained that the construction of the flyover was getting hampered as 163 properties were yet to be acquired. The CS directed officials to ensure work was done in coordination with power utilities, affiliate biodiversity and aquaculture departments to ensure that Aram Ghar-Zoo Park flyover construction work was carried out without any hindrance. On the other hand, officials said that Bahadurpura flyover, being built at a cost of 69 crore which abuts Aram Ghar flyover, might be completed by March-end.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/citys-second-longest-flyover-to-open-in-2023/articleshow/89005771.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Not 80 square yards. It is not charity. Give her 300 square yards within a month,” a division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili said on Wednesday The bench said it was not ready to believe the state counsel’s argument that there was no land with the government in Warangal to give her. The bench was hearing a petition filed by Bairoju Chulkamma from Warangal whose husband Lakshmaiah was a freedom fighter from Hanamkonda. She was seeking a house plot as per the policy and the district authorities had already given such plots to nine others. In her case, they were offering 80 square yards plot citing lack of land as a reason. Chulkamma had, in fact, withdrawn her initial petition after the authorities promised her 300 square yards. But later they ignored her request again. When she filed a writ petition, the authorities told a single judge that this was her second petition on same grounds and the judge dismissed her plea.

From Marredpally, the accused entered the adjacent Tukaramgate police station limits. This time he targeted 65-year-old Rambai while she was walking on the road. The accused came from the opposite direction and snatched her 2.5 tola of gold chain. From here, he entered Cyberabad and committed two snatchings besides a failed attempt all in a span of just an hour. By this time, police officials in Tukaramgate and Marredpally had started the investigation. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage confirmed that the accused in both cases was the same and he was using the same bike. Using the registration number of the assailant’s vehicle, police tried to trace the owner only to find out that the bike was stolen a day earlier from Asif Nagar. The bike owner had parked his vehicle in front of his shop and left the keys in the ignition making it easy for the accused to steal it. In Petbasheerabad, offences took place in Raghavendra colony and Jeedimetla village, where the victims Anuradha and Vara Lakshmi lost gold chains.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/1-snatcher-robs-5-chains-in-7-hours/articleshow/89005779.cms||---

These tests show the presence or absence of S gene, indicative of the Covid-19 variant. Many patients keen on cocktail treatment have been taking the extended RT-PCR to check the variant to seek specific treatment.Even though Omicron variant is slowly becoming predominant during the current wave, Delta is still being detected in around 10% of these samples, labs offering these tests said. “We have been doing RT-PCR and checking Omicron or Delta for the past 7-10 days. Most centres are reporting just 5-10% Delta cases, but these are still there. Every day some 500 people are seeking these tests and the numbers are increasing day by day,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, director, KIMS-USHALAKSHMI Centre for Breast Diseases, adding that there is a need to make this test widely available. “Currently, there is a shortage of kits for these tests. These kits should be made widely available. There should be more awareness about extended RT-PCR testing. This will help in deciding the line of treatment,” he added. Underlining the fact that there is a huge demand for extended RT-PCR test, Dr Sandeep Juvvadi, director, radiology, Tenet diagnostics, said, “This test detects three genes. If all the three genes are present, it could be Delta variant. While if the S gene is missing, it is Omicron. This test is a specific indicative tests for detecting the variants.” He said an analysis of tests at their centre showed Omicron was fast overtaking Delta variant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/variant-worry-many-peopleturning-up-for-genomic-tests/articleshow/89005795.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cost of new Parliament building rises 24% to Rs 1,200 crore||NEW DELHI: The estimated project cost of the new Parliament Building has shot up by nearly 24% to about Rs 1,200 crore due to additional works, changes in construction plan, and also to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court. The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has sought an in-principle approval of the Lok Sabha secretariat for the revised estimated cost, sources said. The CPWD recently presented the cost details and work-in-progress details of the project to a five-member panel which has been constituted by the government for monitoring the pace of all works under the mega Central Vista redevelopment project, they added. The new Parliament Building project was awarded to Tata Projects at Rs 971 crore and 40% of the work is now complete. The government set October 2022 as the deadline so that the winter session can be held in the new building. While a spokesperson of the project consultant, HCP Design, Planning and Management, said the CPWD or the housing and urban affairs ministry was better suited to answer the questions about cost escalation, neither of the government agencies responded to TOI’s queries. Questions sent to the Lok Sabha secretary general were also not answered. Sources said while the project was planned to meet the requirements of safe structure in areas falling under seismic zone-IV, later it was felt that for increasing the lifespan of the building it should meet the requirements of structures built on areas falling under seismic zone-V. “Though Delhi falls under zone-IV, the structures have been strengthened to comply with the norms for buildings in zone-V. This has resulted in an increase in the cost to some extent,” said an official. Also, the connectivity through the tunnel from the proposed Prime Minister’s residence and similar connectivity to the proposed chambers of MPs have also resulted in an increase in cost. This was not factored in the original estimate. Besides, fresh provisions have been made also for a modern audio-visual system to be installed in both Houses of Parliament, meeting rooms and chambers of ministers, leading to an increase in cost. Compliance with the directives of Supreme Court also contributed to the hike in construction cost. Citing an example, an official said all the earth excavated from the project site has been transported to the proposed Eco Park in Badarpur, though as per the bid condition, the contractor was allowed to sell the excavated earth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cost-of-new-parl-bldg-rises-24-to-rs-1200cr/articleshow/89004537.cms||Dipak K Dash

However, this no longer appears to be the case with as many as 33 students in three schools in Dharwad villages testing positive for the novel coronavirus in the past week, leaving both teachers and parents worried. Hubballi rural block education officer Ashok Sindagi told TOI that 22 students, and a teacher, at the Government High School in Kusugal had tested positive for Covid-19 following a random testing procedure. “On Tuesday, we tested 220 students of classes nine and ten, of whom 22 tested positive. We have sealed the school till the coming Monday, and the campus is being sanitised. All the students who have contracted Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and their condition is stable,” Ashok said. The BEO said that the Kusugal school was the third in rural Hubballi to have been sealed in the past week. “At the government high school in Tarihal, 10 students tested positive for Covid, while three students at the high school in Gopankoppa were confirmed infected with Covid. Workers from the health department are frequently visiting students who have tested positive, and are quarantined at home, and monitoring their condition,” added Ashok. He said that the department of public instruction was testing students and staff of schools at random on the one hand, while the drive to vaccinate those in the 15 to 18 age group was being intensified on the other. “Of the 7,611 students eligible to receive the vaccination in my jurisdiction, we have already vaccinated 7,239, and will administer the jab to the remaining students in the next few days,” said the BEO. Ashok affirmed that all precautionary measures were being taken in schools in the villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/22-students-at-high-school-in-rural-hubballi-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/89003396.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

As part of the collaboration, Mahindra “will make Hero Electric scooters for India market in its Pithampur plant,” said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto & farm sectors, Mahindra & Mahindra. M&M on the other hand will jointly develop new products with Hero Electric as well as use the EV market leader’s existing platforms to spawn products for its European motorcycle brand Peugeot. “We will look at using electric platforms of Hero Electric to create to build Peugeot products for global markets,” said Jejurikar. “Hero Electric will leverage our Pune development centre for joint development of products.” The tie up is a win-win because it will allow Hero Electric to expand its production capacity and use M&M’s supply chain without huge capex spend. The tie up is “part of Hero’s growth and expansion plans to cater to the growing demand for EVs,” said the company statement. As part of the partnership, Mahindra Group will manufacture Hero Electric’s most popular electric bikes – Optima and NYX at their Pithampur plant to meet the growing demands of the market. “With this collaboration along with the expansion of their existing Ludhiana facility, Hero will be able to meet its demand of manufacturing over 1 million EVs per year by 2022,” said the statement. Naveen Munjal, MD, Hero Electric said, “This coming together of two industry leaders is to further enhance the manufacturing capabilities to meet demand and utilize Mahindra Group’s robust supply chain to reach newer centers in the country. The long-term partnership will also see both the companies make the most out of each other’s deep knowledge of EVs and drive new product development in the next few years.” For M&M, the partnership will be key to developing electric platforms for its Peugeot brand globally. Said Jejurikar, “Peugeot Motocycles has ambitious plans in the EV mobility space in several regions of the world and particularly in Europe. This strategic partnership will bolster these efforts through joint development and a platform sharing approach leveraging the combined strengths of the two businesses. Our R&D Centre in India will be integral to this arrangement as will the manufacturing facility at Pithampur, that already supplies Peugeot with EV products.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mm-hero-electric-announce-ev-partnership/articleshow/89003924.cms||---

This funding round is led by previous Asana investor, 8VC, with participation from Nexus Venture Partners, Matrix Partners India, and prominent angel investor, Gokul Rajaram. With this new round of funding, it brings the total capital invested to $21 million. The raised fund will be used to help businesses accelerate their time-to-value, boost customer satisfaction, and reduce churn. Srikrishnan Ganesan, chief executive officer (CEO) & co-founder, Rocketlane, said, “This funding round follows on the back of very strong early customer growth, and validates the market pull in the category as well as the clear product leadership position we’ve established. We were also just named a leader by G2 in the client onboarding category.” The idea for Rocketlane grew out of the founding trio’s own problems with onboarding customers for Freshchat—Sri, Deepak, and Vignesh had built Konotor, an in-app messenger that was acquired by Freshworks and relaunched as Freshchat. “The Rocketlane team is off to a fast start towards establishing category leadership in the customer onboarding domain and has grown at a rapid clip in the last six months. We’re excited to double down on our investment here and welcome 8VC to the partnership,” said one of its investors Vikram Vaidyanathan, MD of Matrix India. Rocketlane’s customers included global companies like Chargebee, ParcelLab, Yellow.ai, LinkSquares, Appcues, and Netcore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rocketlane-raises-18-mn-led-by-8vc-others/articleshow/89003889.cms||Mamtha Asokan

At the time of opening up the industry, the reinsurance level was 20%, which was gradually liberalised to 5% over two decades. The government-owned GIC Re will lose some business because of this move. Reinsurance is purchased by primary underwriters to protect their balance sheet. Mandatory reinsurance ensures they buy protection from the government-owned GIC Re, which has been classified as a national reinsurer. The process of transferring the risk to the reinsurance is called cession. GIC Re accepts the risk in exchange for premium. “The percentage cession of the sum insured on each general insurance policy to be reinsured with the Indian reinsurer(s) shall be 4% in respect of insurance attaching during the financial year beginning from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, except the terrorism premium and premium ceded to nuclear pool, wherein it would be made ‘NIL’. The entire obligatory cession is to be placed with GIC Re only,” said a government notification issued by the Irdai. Shares of GIC Re closed flat at Rs 141 on the BSE on Wednesday. In a review of GIC Re’s rating on December 28, Care Edge said that the reinsurer is expected to maintain its market leadership with around 74% market share in India’s reinsurance industry. “According to regulations, GIC Re gets a certain cession of reinsurance business as obligatory business domestically and has first right of refusal for residual risks, which is advantageous for GIC Re. Nearly 30% of domestic premium is through obligatory cessions,” said Care Edge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gic-re-to-get-lesser-biz-from-insurers/articleshow/89004351.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Rising US yields, crude prices spook St, sensex dips 656 pts||Mumbai: The slide in the sensex continued for the second successive session on Wednesday as yields on US government bonds rose while the price of crude oil neared the $90-per-barrel mark, both multi-year high levels. After the 656-point drop on Wednesday, the sensex has lost 1,210 overall in two sessions to settle at 60,099 with IT stocks witnessing strong selling. The selloff in the domestic market was in reaction to a slide in global markets, analysts said. This also took a heavy toll on several of the recently listed stocks, some of which dipped to life-low levels. Among the sensex stocks, the day’s session saw Infosys, ICICI Bank, HDFC and TCS lead the slide, while buying in SBI and Maruti cushioned the fall partially. The selloff was led by foreign funds which recorded a net outflow of Rs 2,705 crore, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 195 crore, BSE data showed. Wednesday’s selling also left investors poorer by about Rs 1.4 lakh crore, with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 277.8 lakh crore. Global markets continued to see a selloff as US treasury yield surged to a near two-year high, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. “Investor sentiment was weighed in by the likelihood of a tighter monetary policy to curb inflation across the globe. Inflation in the UK rose to 5.4% in December, the highest since March 1992. Oil prices too hit their highest since 2014 amid an outage on a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey and global political tensions,” Khemka said in a post-market note. Market players feel that a rising US benchmark yield would put pressure on its central bank, the US Federal Reserve, to raise interest rate — a move that would increase the cost of funds. This in turn could prompt foreign funds to look unfavourably at emerging market stocks, including Indian ones, than during a low-interest regime. Further, rising crude oil prices could lead to increased petro product prices and in turn higher inflation in India since crude is the biggest import item for the country. Both — less foreign fund buying and higher inflation — are negatives for the Indian market and the economy, and hence the nervousness among investors, they said. In the US, after opening marginally higher, leading indices entered the negative territory. Notably, Nasdaq was down 0.6% in mid-session, which took it to a technically corrective zone as the index was down over 10% from its November all-time peak. On Dalal Street, among the newly listed stocks, One97 Communications (Paytm) broke below the Rs 1,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday and closed at Rs 997 on the BSE. Listed just two months ago, the stock has now lost more than 50% from its IPO price of Rs 2,150. Among other high-profile recently listed companies, the stock price of FSN E-commerce (Nykaa) closed in on the Rs 2,000 mark and settled the session at Rs 2,028, while PB Fintech (Policybazaar) neared the Rs 900 level and closed at Rs 929. Zomato, however, continued to hold steady around the Rs 130 level and closed the session at Rs 129, BSE data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rising-us-yields-crude-prices-spook-st-sensex-dips-656-pts/articleshow/89004403.cms||---
---||Business||ICICI Lombard’s profit flat on higher claims ratio||Mumbai: ICICI Lombard General Insurance reported a flat net profit of Rs 318 crore for the quarter ended December 2022 as compared to Rs 314 crore in the year-ago period. The figures are not comparable because the financials for the current quarter represent that of the merged entity (with Bharti Axa), while the previous quarter numbers pertain to ICICI Lombard alone. Profits were flat despite a 16% jump in gross direct premium income to Rs 4,699 crore for the quarter up from Rs 4,034 crore in the corresponding quarter last year due to a higher combined ratio. The combined ratio (ratio of claims and management expenses to total premium) was 105% in Q3 FY22 as compared to 98% in Q3 FY21. One of the reasons for the worsening of the combined ratio was the merger with Bharti Axa, which had a higher expense ratio. For the nine months, the premium was Rs 13,311 crore, 26% higher compared to Rs 10,525 crore in the year-ago period. ICICI Lombard MD& CEO Bhargav Dasgupta said that claims pressure on the motor insurance business was increasing as the third-party premium has not been revised for two years. Also, the motor ‘own damage’ portfolio has seen an increase in the number of claims. He said that underwriting margins had come under pressure because of competitive pressures created in the market by some players in a bid to increase market share. On Covid, Dasgupta said that in Q3 there was not much of an impact of Covid in the third quarter how the numbers have been picking up in the fourth quarter. “While the aggregate numbers are high the hospitalisation number, we are getting is low. We are seeing around one-fourth of the claims that we were seeing during the peak of the second wave. We will have to wait and see how the wave continues,” he said. He added that the cost of treatment was also lower as the infection is milder and people have to stay in hospital for a shorter duration but unnecessary treatment was a cause of concern.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/icici-lombards-profit-flat-on-higher-claims-ratio/articleshow/89004411.cms||TNN

These acquisitions further enhance Prodapt as the partner of choice for the largest companies in the ‘connectedness’ vertical, a statement from the company said. Prodapt had earlier announced plans to invest $45 million in deepening its capabilities in the network virtualization and cloudification segment, and the Synophic acquisition is part of this investment strategy. Additional investments have been planned in areas around Network cloud, Autonomous networks, and NetSecOps.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/prodapt-acquires-silicon-valley-based-synophic-worldwide/articleshow/89003956.cms||TNN

Their sojourn is set to only become friendlier as four state villages adjoining the UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on the southern tip of Gujarat and a part of land in close proximity to the UT of Diu on the Saurashtra coastline are set to be included within limits of Union territories. One of the big implications would be that liquor will be freely available in these areas which were located in dry Gujarat until now. The move is expected to give a fillip to liquor and leisure tourism even as Gujarat steadfastly guards its decision to continue with prohibition. The four villages of Kaprada taluka of Valsad district in south Gujarat which are likely to be soon part of the neighbouring UT are Meghval, Nagar, Raymal and Madhuban. On the Saurashtra coast, a part of Goghala village, will be handed over to the UT of Diu. The Union ministry of home affairs has decided to include the merger of four villages of Valsad into Dadra and Nagar Haveli and part of Ghoghala village in Gujarat into the UT of Diu. A formal ratification of the decision is likely at the western council standing committee meeting scheduled to be held on January 28 in Goa, top sources said. Key officials said, “Meghval village is completely surrounded by the Union territory while three other villages fall between Madhuban dam reservoir and Dadra and Nagar Haveli area. In the monsoon most of the areas of these villages get submerged and their only access point remains through the Union territory. There was long pending demand and suggestion to merge these four Gujarat villages into the Union territory. It will boost tourist activities in the villages and employment.” While the state government has reportedly agreed to hand over administration of Meghval village to the UT, it has raised a demand of preserving rights over the Madhubani dam water for Gujarat. “The Union government has, in principle, agreed,” officials said. As far as the Ghoghala land is concerned, Diu had given a plot of land to Gujarat back in 1989 for developing a fishing port, and in return, the state was expected to give a plot of land to Diu. This has been pending for over 30 years. “The collector of Diu has identified a piece of land on the Ghoghala village beach line. Handing over the land will further boost tourist development in the UT. Administrator of Daman & Diu has also requested Gujarat chief minister in writing to give the said land to Diu which will increase tourism in Diu. The Daman & Diu administration has also demanded possession of the once famous but now defunct Magico Do Mar resort of Gujarat tourism department,” sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/4-gujarat-villages-will-no-more-be-dry/articleshow/89004297.cms||Kapil Dave

The company is planning to expand its EV footprint, tie up joint ventures and tech agreements with global players for its sensor and connected vehicles solutions, nearly double production capacity and exports ahead of its organizational restructuring which will “commence in April 2022 and end by March 2023,” said MD Vikram Mohan. Armed with a capex of around Rs 600 crore for the next three years, the company is looking to increase its capacity value from Rs 2,200 crore right now to Rs 4,000 crore even as it works towards becoming a long-term debt free company in the next 12 months by wiping out the Rs 100 crore debt on its books right now. “Our DIS (driver information system) business, which contributes 50% of our revenue, will continue to be relevant for electric vehicles, but we are moving up the value chain into connected clusters, navigation, vehicle management system apart from developing controllers for both EV and ICE vehicles as well as battery management systems,” said Mohan. The company is in advanced talks with American and European partners for joint ventures and tech agreements in the battery management, sensor and connected cluster segments to get into higher value products and increase its EV product range. “Currently EV is 5% of revenue, but we are targeting 15% by 2025 and are working with both ICE players getting into EV as well as new all-electric names,” he added. The Rs 600 crore investment – 50% debt and rest internal accruals – in products, new technology and capacity will also help Pricol service its Rs 2,000 crore current order book. The company is not only adding capacity at its Sri City, Pune and Satara factories, it is also ramping up its R&D muscle. “We will spend around Rs 60 crore in a world class technology centre in Coimbatore for 400 engineers complete with endurance and test labs,” said Mohan. As for exports, the target is to double revenue contribution from 10% now to 20% by 2025 on a topline of Rs 4,000 crore driven by the pump business, he said. The company is looking at becoming a more dominant player in the sensor business and is looking at a JV in this vertical. It is also adding capacity for the offroad business which is primarily export driven. Pricol is currently working on a restructuring plan as part of which its three main verticals will become separate companies under a listed holding entity. “Pricol will continue to be the listed entity under which there will be a company focusing on the DIS and connected vehicle solutions business, and another focusing on the sensor business and the third on controllers and fluid management system business,” said Mohan. Pricol will hold 100% or 49% or 70% stake in each of these entities, he said. This process will be complete by March 2023.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pricol-kicks-in-growth-mode-with-ev-new-biz-capacity-addition/articleshow/88996127.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

He had filed nomination papers as a candidate of the RLD-SP alliance on Monday, but SP later allotted the ticket to party’s Sanjay Lather. RLD chief Jayant Chaudhry then asked Nauhwar to take his candidature back but the latter was adamant. Talking to TOI, Nauhwar said, “I will not withdraw my nomination, and if the party has any issues with my candidature, they can withdraw my symbol.” Nauhwar is an influential leader in the region and took part in the farmers' protests as well. In a social media post, Nauhwar stated, "Main janata ke sharan mein hoon (I have taken refuge among the people)." SP district president Lokmanikant Jadon said the seats were pre-decided. Two were supposed to be allocated to SP and three to RLD. "The confusion was created by RLD leaders only," he said. Data indicate that this constituency is dominated by Jats, as over 1 lakh voters from the community (considered to be RLD’s core vote) constitute the highest among the major castes. Brahmins, with a population of 45,000, are the second biggest group, followed by Baghel community at 40,000. Population of Thakurs and Vaishyas at 25,000 each, Muslims at 20,000, and Gurjars at 15,000. "Others" constitute 40,000 in numbers. The Maant seat has been won by Shyam Sundar Sharma eight times consecutively. In 2017 assembly elections, he won from a BSP ticket. He has been contesting from this constituency since 1989 from different parties. However, he lost in 2012 against RLD chief Chaudhry but won in the subsequent by-elections because the latter vacated his seat. So far, RLD has fielded three candidates, Tejpal Singh from Chhata, Preetam Singh from Govardhan, Babita Devi from Baldeo (SC). SP has fielded two -- ex-MLA from Sadabad Devendra Singh from Mathura (city) and Lather from Maant. However, confusion still persists in the alliance over Lather.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/confusion-in-sp-rld-over-fielding-candidate-in-maant/articleshow/89004050.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Generali currently owns 49% in the non-life Future Generali India Insurance Company as against the 73% that is permitted under foreign direct investment (FDI) laws. The private non-life company, which has been among the fastest-growing in the top 10 private insurers, has an established track record of profitability since break-even in 2014. It has increased its market share from 3.1% in FY19 to 3.9% in FY21 with a gross written premium of Rs 3,899 crore and is Generali’s biggest operation in Asia. Future Generali India is now pursuing growth through an increase in its motor insurance portfolio, which is currently 38% of its portfolio. Speaking to TOI, Future Generali India MD & CEO Anup Rau said that the company does not need to turn to its shareholders for equity since 2019 as its claims ratio is among the best in the industry. “Our loss ratio is the lowest in the industry and better than some of our bigger peers. Our combined ratio for most of the industry is still above 100 because the industry has shown double-digit growth for over two decades now. As we scale up, our cost of acquisition and our fixed costs will get defrayed over a larger top line, lowering our combined ratio. The key to controlling the loss ratio is the quality of underwriting,” said Rau. The uncertainty that the Future Group is going through with both Amazon and Reliance groups engaged in a tussle over ownership of a group company has not impacted the insurance venture. The foreign partner Generali continues to strongly back the joint venture. “Generali is very excited about India and the opportunities being afforded by the new FDI regulations and they are examining it. They have reiterated multiple times that India is a market they would be keen to invest to the fullest extent,” said Rau. He added that they are extremely patient and focused on building a long-term franchise, which would generate a healthy return of equity. Rau added that the quality of underwriting has helped ensure faster claim settlement and a better claim settlement ratio. “We do our due diligence at the time of accepting the proposal. There is no underwriting done while settling the claim. In terms of net promoter score, we are among the best in class not just among the insurers in India and Asia but among the top 1% globally, across service industries,” said Rau. While Future Generali India’s combined ratio (ratio of claims and management expenses to total premium) is still over 100%, it manages to remain profitable through investment income. “We have also built an AUM (assets under management) of a substantial amount. So, this has helped us continue to drive growth without running a capital deficit even at a combined ratio of over 100%. We have always been profitable since we broke even in 2014. This has allowed us to run a deficit on the combined ratio. We haven’t needed capital since 2019, while we have continued to grow significantly faster than the industry.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/generali-keen-to-up-stake-in-indian-jv/articleshow/89004442.cms||Mayur Shetty

The group of cyclists had started offering delivery services during the second wave when the state government had declared a complete lockdown. They are connected with volunteers from Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Cyberabad. Now, with Covid-19 numbers surging yet again, the cyclists group has resumed services two weeks back. “We are largely delivering medicines and essential items to senior citizens and those under isolation with no support,” said Ravi Sambari, who started the initiative along with Santhana Selvan, ‘bicycle mayor’ of Hyderabad. The group receives close to 20 requests every day, including from areas such as Gachibowli, Kondapur, Sainikpuri and Alwal. “We have been getting requests from children living in the US seeking medicine delivery for their parents in Hyderabad. We circulate these requests on our WhatsApp groups and volunteers come forward to attend to it,” said Sambari, who is a director in a logistics company. “My mother was on oxygen and I was in desperate need of medicines for her. That’s when one of my friends told me about ‘Relief Riders’. I approached them and one of them came to my doorstep and delivered the medicines,” said Satyam, a student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cyclists-back-on-track-to-deliver-meds-essentials/articleshow/89005796.cms||Preeti Biswas

With less than a month to go for the assembly polls, TMC has declared the names of just 11 candidates so far for the 40-member assembly, leaving the ground open for allies to be accommodated. TMC, which is on its first venture beyond its home turf of West Bengal, contesting the Goa assembly polls, waded into the Congress’ bastion in the state, inducting leaders from Congress to establish its footprint in the state. Naturally upset for losing its leaders to TMC, Congress has been cold so far to its overtures for an alliance in the state along with NCP and Shiv Sena.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-congress-will-be-responsible-if-bjp-wins-goa/articleshow/89005797.cms||---

This will be the first 400kv GIS substation in the country with Monopole technology, Telangana Transco officials said. The substation, which is being constructed at a cost of 1,400 crore, is expected to meet power demands from IT companies, IT campuses and also major infrastructure projects coming up in Gachibowli, financial district and surrounding areas. Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy, chairman and MD of Telangana Transco and Genco D Prabhakar Rao and CMD of Telangana SPDCL G Raghuma Reddy inspected works on Wednesday. “As of now 400kv power is being drawn from Shankarpally to Gachibowli and being supplied to the IT sector from the substation. Now 400kv lines have been laid directly from Kethireddypally on Vikarabad road near Moinabad and substation is being constructed with ultra-modern technology,” an official said. The 400kv substation will not only ensure uninterrupted power, but also provide high voltage power supply without major transmission losses. Jagadish Reddy said generally for constructing a 400kv substation along with 220kv, 132kv and 33 kv substation on one premises, 100 acre is required. But all the substations are housed at one place in just five acre at Raidurg around the ring road for the benefit of consumers. The minister said the state government has been focussing on improvement of power infrastructure in the state especially Hyderabad. The facilities are being provided to meet the power demand for the next 30 to 40 years. A power circuit is being developed around Hyderabad to ensure that there would be no power interruption in any corner of the city. “The GIS substation will also help to get an additional 2,000 MW of power to meet the city requirement,” the minister said. He said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao would formally inaugurate the sub-station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/400kv-gas-insulated-substation-to-power-it-corridor/articleshow/89005799.cms||Koride Mahesh

Trinamool Town Committee member Asim Roy, 54, was targeted when he was waiting for an autori-ckshaw around 8am to get to the party office at Rathtala Bazar. After the miscreants missed hitting him, someone gave Roy a shove, making him fall to the ground. Locals took Roy to Bhatpara State General Hospital where he got four stitches on the head. “Local BJP leaders hired miscreants to kill me so they could get back control of the area,” he alleged. Trinamool senior and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said BJP was using such tactics in constituencies they won in 2019. “The BJP leaders hire sharpshooters from outside the state to kill people. It won’t work any more,” Hakim said. Barrackpore’s BJP MP Arjun Singh said Roy was a victim of “bitter factionalism” in local TMC. “Asim Roy, alias Bhulu, is a known extortionist.

The seven female and three male turtles were tagged with GPS transmitters. According to an official, this will be the first ever GPS tagging and tracking of any freshwater turtle in India. Only a handful of these turtles may exist in the wild across the vast expanse of mangrove swamps and tidal rivers of the Sunderbans, spanning southeast India and southwest Bangladesh. The wild population declined drastically due to unsustainable harvesting. With so few wild adults, the species is now considered to be on the brink of functional extinction.“The move will help us understand survival and dispersal patterns of these turtles. This will help generate the basic ecological data on the conservation requirements of the released animals. The GPS-based tracking will allow field researchers to track batagur baskas across the vast expense of mangrove swamps and generate hitherto lacking data to better inform future releases,” the official added. In 2008, a joint survey of the Indian Sunderbans by a team of TSA and STR led to tracing of eight males, three females and a juvenile batagur baskas at a pond on the Sajnekhali Interpretation Centre compound. Sunderbans Tiger Reserve and the Turtle Survival Alliance soon initiated a conservation breeding programme of the species with the goal of establishing breeding colonies and re-wilding of the species within strictly regulated protected areas of STR. The breeding initiative commenced with 12 adult turtles from Sajnekhali. Today, this sustained breeding programme holds 12 adults and close to 370 juveniles of the species, said a forest department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/10-endangered-turtles-released-with-gps-tags/articleshow/89005810.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Matuas push BJP to come clean on CAA in Bengal||Kolkata: The recent groundswell in Bengal BJP centring around the Matua belt in North 24 Parganas and Nadia has brought the party to a crossroads when the Centre has to decide whether to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bengal and if so when.CAA is of prime importance for Matuas and issues such as accommodating former BJP state office-bearers in the new state committee are just add-ons. Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya was only buying time when he assured at a press meet that the Centre would implement CAA ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “Framing of rules for CAA is taking time due to the Covid situation. It will be implemented before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” he had said days after junior Union minister and Matua Sanghadhipati Santanu Thakur raised the issue and threw a challenge to a “specific person” in state BJP without naming Amitava Chakraborty.The BJP brass’s overtures was not going to work this time because Union home minister Amit Shah had made a similar promise about CAA ahead of the 2021 Bengal assembly polls.Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a step forward to win over Matuas by reaching out to the seat of Matua religion at Orakandi in Bangladesh, following which BJP won as many as eight assembly seats having a heavy Matua presence.Matuas now want BJP to fulfil its promise and give them citizenship they were waiting for since 2019. Bengal BJP, hoping to form the state government in 2021, had promised the party once voted to office would implement CAA in its first cabinet meeting. Their hopes didn’t come true. Later, Bengal BJP went silent on CAA while the party brass took different positions in different states. Thakur has been meeting voters at Nahata in Bongaon, Matiganj and Kalyani since Monday, apparently trying to consolidate his support base for a showdown. “He will continue with the mass contact based on feedback from his supporters,” said a BJP leader close to Thakur. Matuas seem determined in their cause. The CAA, if not implemented in Bengal, might cost the party dear in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/matuas-push-bjp-to-come-clean-on-caa-in-bengal/articleshow/89005812.cms||Saugata Roy

---||Kolkata||Cong will be to blame if BJP wins Goa polls: Trinamool||Kolkata/Panaji: Trinamool Congress on Wednesday blamed Congress for a fractured opposition heading into the February 14 Goa polls.“Congress will be responsible if BJP wins Goa,” TMC sources said a day after the party announced its first list of 11 candidates for the Goa assembly polls. The candidate list named its Rajya Sabha MP Luizinho Faleiro from Fatorda constituency, where he is pitted against Goa Forward Party chief Vijai Sardesai. Incidentally, it was Sardesai who had floated the issue of opposition unity earlier in January, prompting a response by Trinamool that it would do “everything possible to defeat BJP in Goa”. Sardesai’s GFP is a Congress alliance partner in Goa.Both NCP and Shiv Sena too had mooted alliance talks. However, this did not take shape. “Maha Vikas Aghadi (the trio of NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra) cannot be formed in Goa and NCP and Shiv Sena both hold Congress responsible for the failed talks,” sources said. Congress sources, however, said both NCP and Sena made unreasonable demands leading to the talks’ failure.TMC is contesting polls in alliance with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which on Wednesday rubbished claims that the alliance was under strain.

Speaking at a webinar organised by CII, the Policy Bazaar CEO advocated for a different category for tax concessions by saying it would give a big boost to pure insurance where penetration in India is very low. “Inclusion in tax concession instruments will give a big fillip to the term product. There should be tax advantages for pension products as well,” he added. Dahiya also batted for reverse mortgage products for elderly people and inheritance tax for transfer of assets to next generations. Earlier, the chairman and MD of National Insurance, Suchita Gupta, and SBI General Insurance senior VP and head of health insurance S Deshpande said that health insurance as a sector has overcome motor cover segment following Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dont-bundle-term-covers-with-others/articleshow/89005816.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Cop plea for net along entire Maa flyover||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is planning to reconsider the Kolkata traffic police proposal on installing nets on the entire Maa flyover stretch to prevent kite strings from injuring bike riders. At least five such two-wheelers met with accidents within one week and a total of 27 have been reported since the pandemic started. Sources said that the Kolkata Police on Wednesday sent a fresh proposal to KMDA to instal nets on both sides of Maa flyover stretch from Park Circus seven-point crossing upto Parama Island crossing. The proposal was forwarded only after discussion with KMDA who expressed fresh interest to review it. “At present, the model which has been set up on the 900 metre stretch of the flyover has been highly successful in preventing kite strings accidents,” cops reminded.“The matter has also been discussed with the minister,” said an officer debunking theories that KMDA had shot down the earlier plan citing technical and structural weight issues.“We have requested them to cover the entire stretch with additional three layers of wires to cover the lower portion closer to the railing to stop chances of riders falling over. Similarly, iron bars installed may be wrapped with retro-reflectors to warn riders,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cop-plea-for-net-along-entire-maa-flyover/articleshow/89005823.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Khopde breaks home isolation yet again, meets CP as part of BJP delegation||Nagpur: Even though Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) showcause notice to BJP MLA Krishna Khopde clearly states that his home quarantine continues till January 19, the politician stepped out yet again for public events on Wednesday. It started with a meeting with none other than city police commissioner Amitesh Kumar, whose department had registered an offence against Khopde just a day earlier.The East Nagpur MLA shrugged off concerns over violation of home isolation guidelines, by standing firm on his statement issued on Tuesday. “I was given a green signal by NMC health officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar. And I have been without symptoms now for many days, hence it is not an issue at all,” said Khopde.When asked about NMC’s showcause notice clearly mentioning January 19 as the last day of quarantine, Khopde disagreed. “No no, it’s not like that. They have issued a showcause notice so now I will give my reply. You will get clarity when I put it in writing,” said Khopde. However, Khopde did not reply to the showcause notice by NMC within the deadline of 24 hours. The NMC too did not take any action on Wednesday. NMC officials even said they did not receive any letter from Lakadganj police seeking details. A day ago, PI Amita Jaipurkar had told TOI that a letter was sent to the civic body seeking details of when Khopde tested positive and what were the guidelines of home isolation.The city police commissioner not only met a delegation of which Khopde was part, but was also seen in close physical proximity to the the MLA in a photo taken there. The top cop told TOI he was not aware that Khopde would be part of the BJP delegation. “Also, the MLA’s symptoms appeared on January 12, so the seven-day isolation ended on January 18,” said Kumar.Later, on Wednesday evening, a complaint was filed with Sadar police station by social activist Jwala Dhote against Khopde and the CP over the former breaking isolation rules, and the latter allowing him access to his office. She has asked the cops to check CCTV footage at the Police Gymkhana and commissioner’s office, and take action against the police commissioner.BJP leaders who accompanied Khopde to CP office had a different interpretation of home isolation guidelines. Former MLC Anil Sole and Central Nagpur MLA Vikas Kumbhare said, “We asked Khopde about this before going to meet the CP. He told us that isolation is mandatory only for five days as per guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Khopde also said that he ended isolation only after consulting concerned doctors. Therefore, there seems to be no issue in this case,” they said.Cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said he was disappointed that a public representative was disputing the set Covid-19 guidelines. “We expect that publicly elected persons should be the first to follow norms. If he is venturing out in public, despite being mandated by authorities to remain in home isolation, it’s completely wrong and we will follow up on this,” said Wadettiwar.“These rules have been put in place for the safety of both, the patient and also for those around them. So stepping outside of home means you are potentially putting others in danger too,” the senior Congress leader said. His cabinet colleague Sunil Kedar said Khopde should have led by example. “Khopde is a lawmaker and hence should not behave like a lawbreaker. In the assembly, he is representing the people of Maharashtra and what example will be set if he displays such type of behaviour? I would expect every public representative to strictly follow Covid-19 guidelines else how can we expect people to follow the same,” said Kedar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/khopde-breaks-home-isolation-yet-again-meets-cp-as-part-of-bjp-delegation/articleshow/89004084.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

As a result, colleges, even though they did not report any Covid-19 cases, have shifted to the online mode of learning. St Agnes College here has shifted to the online mode of learning for second and third year undergraduate students, whereas physical classes continued for first-year students. “We are conducting both physical classes as well as classes in the online mode, as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A lot of students who stayed in paying guest accommodations or hostels outside the campus, had informed that some of the other inmates had tested positive. We did not want to take a risk, and decided to switch to a blended mode of learning. This will help in stopping the spread of the virus among students,” said Sister Venessa, the principal of the college. “The arrangement may continue till we complete our end-semester examination scheduled in a few weeks,” she added. Two days ago, another hospitality management college situated in the outskirts of the city, shifted to the online mode of learning for some time. “We are informed that classes will be held online for a week, and may resume after that,” said a student of the college. The city’s oldest college too is holding online classes as well as examinations, as a precaution. The campus had not reported any positive cases. P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University, said that currently only one college under the varsity has shut down, as it reported more than five Covid-19 cases among students. The university will follow the district administration’s guidelines, where it is directed to shut down any educational institutions that report five or more Covid-19 cases. He also added that colleges have been asked to conduct online classes during weekend curfew. “It’s a good step that colleges are shifting to the online mode of learning as a safety measure. This was the need of the hour, since the positivity rate is high, and Covid-19 cases are expected to peak in a few days,” said Shreya D’Souza, a hotel management student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/containing-covid-edu-institutions-go-back-to-online-mode/articleshow/89003234.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The opening up of economic activities at this juncture will ensure that economic losses are minimised, and economic recovery can happen at the earliest,” Ficci’s director general Arun Chawla said in a letter to health minister Satyendar Jain. “The latest variant Omicron is highly transmissible, but emerging evidence suggests it is mild, does not require intervention in most cases, and hospitalisation is significantly lower than the previous wave. This has been observed even in the case of Delhi where the peak of Covid cases has been reached and the hospital occupancy has not yet saturated, and a large portion of Covid-19 beds are lying vacant,” stated the Ficci’s director general.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police tips for traders to bolster market security||KOLKATA: A cyber security sensitisation drive by cops for traders of central business district has highlighted loopholes of the physical safety of the markets, businesses and their owners. Some of lapses include defunct CCTV cameras in most shops, untrained security guards and fire hazards due to faulty wiring and cooking inside the markets. Lack of night security too is making them vulnerable to thefts. Since the pandemic hit in March 2020, online transactions surged in the markets of Burrabazar, Posta, Canning Street and Brabourne Road, leading to cyber frauds. The cops shared guidelines on cyber security, which include not sharing one-time passwords, debit card pins and account details. The central business district consists of city’s and eastern India’s biggest retail and wholesale markets which deal with several thousand crores of daily turnover. “We conducted an online workshop with secretaries of several market committees on Tuesday to create awareness about cyber security. Several traders procure goods and make payments online. Similarly, many of them sell and accept payment online. There have been several instances of forgeries in the past two years,” said an officer of Burrabazar police station. The cops also alerted the traders about the physical safety of the markets. “More than 25% of the shops either do not have CCTV cameras or they are lying defunct. Many traders have installed CCTVs, but they are incorrectly installed. In most markets the guards are old. Gates of several markets are open till late night for employees who sleep inside and hawkers to keep their wares. This makes the markets vulnerable to burglary. Cooking food inside too increases risk of fire incidents,” said a cop. Market committees said they would soon meet traders and discuss the issues with them. “It is correct that there are several loopholes in the security system. We will try to strengthen it with the help of the police and the traders,” said the secretary of a market in Burrabazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/police-tips-for-traders-to-bolster-market-security/articleshow/89005825.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Pandemic-affected toy market in Kolkata in turmoil over raids by quality watchdog||KOLKATA: Search and seizure operations at toy stores in malls by quality control agency Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in the past couple of days has spread panic among toy retailers in the city. Retailers in New Market, Gariahat, Fariapukur and other parts of the city on Wednesday went on a “clean-up” drive to remove toys without ISI mark from their shelves before being caught out. Confiscation of non-ISI-certified toys from a retail store can lead to stringent action, that of a minimum penalty of Rs 1 lakh that can go up to five-times the value of the “illegal toys” seized, in addition to imprisonment. BIS Kolkata branch office 1 head Atindra Chatterjee said a large number of toys without ISI mark were seized from some of the largest branded stores at South City and Mani Square. BIS Kolkata branch office 2 head AK Purohit, too, confirmed similar contraventions at toy stores in City Centre. “All toys sold in India are BIS compliant to ensure they are safe for children. For instance, they should not have sharp edges, they should be made from virgin plastic and there should be no toxic material. The law came into force in October 2020. In January 2021, a notification was issued, making sales of toys without ISI mark an offence. In between, there have been awareness drives. We have only now, after a year, started raids,” Chatterjee said. While acknowledging they were aware of the rule, retailers cited poor sales during the pandemic for the high stock of non-ISI toys in their stores. “Sales of toys are down 80%. So, 70% of the stocks with most retailers still do not have the ISI mark. We need more time to exhaust the current stock,” said a retailer at a mall. Another retailer pointed out sales had also been impacted after the high-demand, battery-operated made-in-China toys disappeared from the market following the BIS regulation. A wholesale dealer of toys on Canning Street said the watchdog agency should penalize manufacturers that were still making toys without BIS certification. In Bengal, only two toy manufacturers have taken the BIS certification. Shiv Daswani, owner of a retail chain that sells children’s products including toys, admitted he was lucky as toys comprised only 10% of his offerings and around 10% of them were non-ISI ones that had not yet been sold due to the slump in the market. “Toys sell when children are around. In this pandemic, sales of toys are among the worst hit,” he said. Rajesh Lahoti, owner of Maxwell India that manufactures toy parts, said many retailers were also to blame for the current situation as they had hedged their bet on non-ISI toys at a lower price. “There is always resistance to change. But once this happens, parents of children will breathe easy,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pandemic-affected-toy-market-in-city-in-turmoil-over-raids-by-quality-watchdog/articleshow/89005826.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops warn netizens of WhatsApp fraud||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police have warned users against possible attempts at WhatsApp cloning which can even lead to SIM swapping. Kolkata police took to Twitter on Wednesday to caution netizens to be careful while clicking any suspicious link received via WhatsApp. Police said one should follow the WhatsApp security features which is effective in battling this fraud. “You may receive a message on WhatsApp, asking you to click on a link and share the WhatsApp Verification code. These forwards might come from people who are extremely close to you. Sharing this code will give fraudsters access to your WhatsApp. If you receive such a message from your friend or relative, verify whether it is really them,” the cops wrote on Twitter. The development comes after some ethical hackers received such fake WhatsApp and KYC updates and immediately reported the matter to Lalbazar. Sources said some of these scams can also begin with a message that they send to their target. It is a simple message like “hello mum” or “hello dad”. The scammers send the message followed by an SOS to immediately transfer money to an account because their son or daughter is in need. Earlier, Kolkata Police had taken to its Facebook page to warn netizens about the new dangers. “WhatsApp Getting Hacked! If you receive this kind of message and if any person on your contacts list (even if known) asks you to forward the same, please don’t do so. Fraudsters are using this to take control of your WhatsApp account. We have received a few such complaints and seek your cooperation,” the message stated. Cops have also warned citizens that there can also be a direct request to transfer money posing as a person in distress instead of asking for verification code. “You must treat your WhatsApp messages with as much caution as you treat random FB messages,” said a cyber cell officer. Police commissioner Vineet Goyal has asked his officers to concentrate on smashing cyber crime. Barely a couple of months ago, the arrest of a 27-year-old man from Indore had blown the lid of scamsters who are hacking WhatsApp profiles and duping them of their money. The Kolkata Police cyber cell arrested the accused — Jayesh Patidar — who allegedly hacked identity of Kolkata man, used a temporary IP address of Pakistan and duped a businessman of Rs 6 lakhs. Cops also shared example of a woman from Alipore who was charged a fortune as ransom to get back her profile.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-warn-netizens-of-whatsapp-fraud/articleshow/89005828.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||After PM2.5 dip in 2020, Kolkata air now 29% more polluted than safe level||KOLKATA: The city needs nearly 29% cut to meet the annual average standard of 40µg/m3 for PM2.5, the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), revealed the latest analysis of air quality status of Bengal cities by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). PM2.5 is the tiniest particle in air, considered to be the most harmful for lungs. The analysis of data further stated that Howrah needs 34%, Asansol 32% and Durgapur 50% reduction in PM2.5 level to meet NAAQS. However, the trend in average annual PM2.5 concentration shows a dip in 2020, which had several pandemic-linked lockdown phases. But the levels rose again in 2021. Despite the rise, the levels in Kolkata, Howrah, and Asansol are lower than the 2019 levels. But Siliguri shows levels higher than even 2019. “This analysis of real-time air quality data for the period 2019-2021 shows the downward dip in pollution, which was induced by the lockdown phases, is threatening to bounce back with the levels already rising. But in many cases, the levels are still lower than 2019. This underscores the urgency of scaling up action across all sectors to arrest the trend in this region,” says Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at CSE. “The study corroborates our experiences at hospitals and clinics. There was a drastic drop in patients with breathing distress and related hospitalization in 2020 because of the clean air in 2020. But we are almost back to 2019 level as far as influx of non-Covid patients with breathing distress and related hospitalization is concerned,” said pulmonologist Arup Haldar. Analysis of days as per the categorisation of the national air quality index related to PM2.5 shows that in Kolkata, there were eight days of severe air quality (AQI: 401-500) in 2019. The total number of poor (AQI:201-300), very poor (AQI 301-400) and severe category days have reduced from 93 in 2019 to 83 in 2021. Good air quality (AQI: 0-50) days have increased from 101 in 2019 to 140 in 2021. While satisfactory (AQI:51-100) days have reduced from 111 to 80, poor (AQI: 201-300) days have increased from 45 to 53. However, 2020 was cleaner with higher number of good air quality days at 192.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-pm2-5-dip-in-20-city-air-now-29-more-polluted-than-safe-level/articleshow/89005832.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

It started rolling for its Down journey again at 11.10pm. Metro now has 29 rakes for Line 1 or the Dakshineswar-Kavi Subhas corridor. All are air-conditioned. The Medha rakes are from the Integral Coach Factory near Chennai. The remaining 13 are older, made by BHEL. East-West Metro or Line 2, on the other hand, has 14 BEML-make rakes. Thus, Metro Railway’s newer rakes now outnumber the older “snag-prone” ones. “Seven new trains, made at ICF near Chennai, have arrived since September 2020 and are part of the operational fleet. Two more are due to arrive soon,” a Metro official said. Metro is currently focussing on getting the Medha rakes as the railways is not showing any interest to procure the Chinese rakes that were supposed to replace the carrier’s aging fleet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/new-metro-medha-rake-starts-rolling/articleshow/89005834.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Kolkata duo on 566km walk to link Netaji with Vivekananda||By Aheli Banerjee KOLKATA: Photographer Buddhadeb Das and teacher Mrinal Das have embarked on a 566km padyatra from Kolkata to Cuttack, commemorating the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as well as the return of Swami Vivekananda to India. The padyatra was flagged off from Swami Vivekananda’s Shimla Street house in Kolkata on January 12 on the occasion of his birth anniversary while the duo will reach Netaji’s birthplace in Cuttack on January 23. The padyatra also celebrates 75 years of Indian independence. January 15, 2022 also marks the 125th anniversary of Vivekananda’s return from Europe, after which he had founded Ramakrishna Mission. Swami Jnanlokananda, secretary of Ramkrishna Mission, who had flagged off the padyatra, said, “I offer my thanks to Buddhadeb and Mrinal for undertaking such a Himalayan task to offer their homage to Swamiji.” Buddhadeb and Mrinal had previously planned a bicycle rally to celebrate these events with the help of 100 Miles, a Kolkata-based travel agency. “Later, we decided not to pursue the bicycle rally due to the pandemic situation. Despite the risk, we thought we will not get this opportunity to celebrate these three events in this way again. So, two of us decided to opt for a padyatra instead,” said Buddhaded. “We are pleased that the padyatra is getting so much attention from every segment of the society. We are also touched by the hospitality and warmth of the locals who are taking an interest in our endeavour,” he said. When asked about their plans of celebrations upon reaching Netaji’s house, Buddhadeb said, “We have not planned anything yet. We are eager to interact with locals and engage them in the legacy of our national heroes.” On Tuesday night, the duo stopped at Bhadrak. Swarajit Roy, who helped the duo organise the padyatra, said, “The two stay at tents at night and along the way stop at various places to interact with locals, spread awareness and distribute pamphlets. We hope these events will inspire people for similar journeys celebrating national events.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-duo-on-566km-walk-to-link-netaji-with-vivekananda/articleshow/89005836.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Sector V gets first cycle lane, more in the offing||KOLKATA: Following the New Town model, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) is demarcating cycle lanes on one-way stretches in Sector V for cyclists to move on the streets freely. Officials said they had decided to set up cycle lanes and cycle stands in the IT hub after noticing that many people come for work there by riding cycles from nearby areas. Even the food delivery boys mostly use cycles in Sector V. To begin with the project, a cycle lane has already been demarcated with a green marker on the right flank of the College More crossing-bound road from SDF Building. The authorities have recently set up free cycle parking stands at four places of Sector V — near Webel Bhavan, Godrej Waterside, below the Wipro flyover and inside Nabadiganta Bhavan. About 25 cycles can be parked at each stand. The NDITA officials said they are demarcating reserved lanes for cycles in Sector V. Conveniently, there are several stretches including the main thoroughfare from SDF building junction, where both the flanks are one-way. As there is already much space for vehicles to pass, only half a lane of the right flank is being demarcated as cycle lane,” said an official. “The cycle stands have been set up so that cyclists can move on freely using the cycle bay. More cycle stands are going to be set up soon,” said the official. “It is helping us as we can move on both ways through the cycle bay to enter on the inner lanes,” said a food delivery boy. The NDITA has been exploring options to maximise the use of cycles in Sector V. Earlier, the authorities issued a notification, asking all office complexes and parking lots to reserve some space for parking cycles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sector-v-gets-first-cycle-lane-more-in-the-offing/articleshow/89005837.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bangur Ave-Lake Town still a concern||KOLKATA: A cluster of densely populated housing complexes and multi-storey buildings in the neighbourhood, along with a large number of department stores, take-away food joints and stationary shops that remain open till late in the night — attracting a large number of outsiders — have led to a stretch of Lake Town and Bangur Avenue remaining micro-containment zones for more than two weeks. While cops claim to have identified the problem and have been deputing men in uniform, the South Dum Dum municipality has introduced a three-days-a-week (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) restriction in the area. “The demography of the area is such that there is always a heavy population of outsiders, as well as locals, at the markets and shops. We have struggled to manage crowding at the markets throughout the pandemic, but this time, we have somehow controlled it to some extent by shutting shops thrice a week. Hopefully, by February, this neighbourhood will come out of the micro-containment zone list,” said Pachu Roy, former chairman of South Dum Dum Municipality. Since January 3, multiple high-rises and buildings in Lake Town and Bangur Avenue have remained micro-containment zones. Last week, the number of micro-containment zones climbed to 13. According to the updated list on Wednesday, the number has come down to seven — two in Bangur Avenue, one in Lake Town’s Block B and four high-rise complexes in Lake Town, including VIP Tower, Lake Plaza, Aradhan Apartment and Alcove Gloria. Homemaker Ruma Chakraborty, a local, said, “Even on days the markets and shops have been asked to shut down, there are some shops that operate stealthily, which attracts an even bigger crowd in the small area.” TOI took a tour of the neighbourhood on multiple days over the week and found a number of shops operating on Tuesday, flouting the civic body-introduced norm. Several residents were also found moving about without masks and not maintaining physical distancing. “We are trying our best to contain the infection in the neighbourhood and have succeeded to some extent. But if people come from outside to shop or to work, we cannot ask them to go back,” said Lake Town resident and state fire minister Sujit Bose, who has just come out of isolation this week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bangur-ave-lake-town-still-a-concern/articleshow/89005839.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation fresh Covid case count shows steady decline over a week, but deaths surge||KOLKATA: From over 1,300 fresh Covid cases daily a week ago, the number in the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area has been on a decline, to only 420 new cases reported on Tuesday. However, there has been a sudden surge in Covid deaths with seven reported in the last eight days. The number of daily new Covid cases has been declining since January 15. Daily cases in the BMC area had broken the 1,000 mark to reach an all-time high of 1,312 on January 10. On January 14, a total of 1,233 new cases were reported, after which, the number dipped below the 1,000 mark the next day with 903 cases reported. The number further declined to 767 on January 16, 557 on January 17 and 420 on January 18. The civic authorities, however, said the decline may be due to fewer people undergoing Covid tests despite having mild symptoms. “With the majority of people only showing mild symptoms of fever, body ache, sore throat and cough, many are not undergoing tests. This may be one of the reasons why the daily numbers are on the decline,” said a civic official. As of now, there are around 8,000 active Covid cases in the BMC area. Over 55,400 people have been affected by Covid since March 2020, when the first Covid case was reported in BMC and a total of 369 Covid deaths have occurred till date. There are 14 micro-containment zones across BMC at present. The number of daily Covid cases has also come down in the adjacent South Dum Dum municipality area in the last few days. From about 150 daily cases reported last week, only about 50 were reported on Tuesday. At present, there are 17 micro-containment zones in the South Dum Dum civic body area. The civic authorities are keeping markets and commercial establishments shut thrice a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, when thorough sanitisation is taking place. This will continue till the end of this month, after which, the authorities will review the situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bmc-fresh-case-count-shows-steady-decline-over-a-week-but-deaths-surge/articleshow/89005841.cms||---
---||Kolkata||3rd-wave Covid contrast: Most get well at home but ICUs fill up in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Even as the Covid-19 patient count in general wards is declining gradually in most hospitals in the city, there is a rising trend in positive patient count in Covid critical care units. Some have already hiked their Covid intensive care beds. “From 20 Covid ICU beds about a week ago, we have increased the number to 30. All are now occupied, mostly by aged patients with co-morbidities,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. All 130 critical care unit Covid beds in three units of AMRI Hospitals are currently occupied. It has around 112 patients undergoing treatment in general beds. Till last week, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences had 45 Covid CCU beds. It added 40 more on Monday. “We had to add more beds as many patients with conditions of the heart, kidney and other issues also tested positive and they need intensive care treatment,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east) Narayana Hospital. While majority of patients in Covid-19 CCUs have been those battling other existing ailments and Covid-19 being incidental, hospitals said they are also seeing a rise in complications caused by Covid infection. “Some patients are also coming with complications of Covid, including pneumonitis, prolonged fever and respiratory issues. So, there is an increase in demand for intensive care beds,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Last week, Covid patient count at CMRI had gone up to 120. While the hospital is seeing a 20% drop in patient count, the dip is being registered in general ward. “There is a slight rise in patients needing treatment in Covid ICU but most do not need oxygen support,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO CK Birla Hospitals. CMRI currently has 48 patients in general ward and 49 in ICU. “We are finding lung involvement in some younger patients,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. Twenty-six patients are currently under Dhar’s team in CMRI’s respiratory intensive care unit. Some hospitals, though, still have fewer number of patients in Covid ICUs. “Currently, the Covid ICU vs Covid ward bed ratio of patients in our hospital is 1:4. We have seen a rise in Covid ICU admissions especially in elderly patients with co-morbidities turning critical,” said Rupali Basu, MD & CEO, Woodlands Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/3rd-wave-covid-contrast-most-get-well-at-home-but-icus-fill-up/articleshow/89005842.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Tuberculosis co-infection worry in Omicron wave||KOLKATA: Two major takeaways from the revised protocol on clinical management of Covid patients — use of steroid and screening for tuberculosis (TB) — could help reducing the misuse of steroids and enhance TB detection, health experts said. The Government of India on Tuesday had issued a revised guideline on treatment of Covid-19 patients that is expected to be followed by all physicians managing these patients. The revised guideline has included people suffering from TB into the high risk category of patients developing severe Covid-19 infection. Doctors treating positive patients through the three waves of the pandemic said they had come across sporadic cases of Covid-19 and TB as co-infection in patients. “In some Covid patients, who were coughing for a longer period, we noticed changes in the chest infection, resembling TB and later the disease was detected in some. Moreover, steroid use can aggravate and unmask cases of tuberculosis. Therefore, the changed protocol is a welcome move,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray of IPGMER. “This protocol is also a reminder that TB is a major public health issue. We need to catch the cases early for timely intervention that would limit disease progression and transmission,” added Ray. TB and the coronavirus infections involve the lungs and both are infectious. Doctors said that it would be a double whammy for a person suffering from tuberculosis, known or latent, if infected by the virus. “In majority of TB patients there already is the issue of lung fibrosis. So, if they get Covid-19 infection they have a bigger risk of developing severe disease resulting in poor treatment outcome. The new guideline could also bolster TB detection. So it is a positive step,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar, director of pulmonology wing at CMRI. The new protocol says the patient should be screened for TB and other respiratory ailments if the cough persists for over two to three weeks. The rampant use of steroid has always been a concern as doctors also said that over indulgence of steroid could cause more harm than benefits in some patients. For steroid use the new guideline has a rider that there is no evidence of steroid in patients not requiring oxygen support and continuation of it after discharge. “Steroid has to be used in the lowest possible dosage within the shortest possible duration on selected patients under observation. Otherwise, it causes side effects, including mucormycosis. And also there has been several cases of tuberculosis flaring up post Covid infection. Hence the two paradigm changes in the protocol is much needed,” said Asis Manna, MSVP, Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tb-co-infection-worry-in-omicron-wave/articleshow/89005845.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private hospitals start planned ops on Covid patients||KOLKATA: Close on the heels of government hospitals, several private hospitals, too, have started conducting surgeries and procedures on asymptomatic Covid patients. While some have created a separate ward for mildly symptomatic patients who got admitted for other treatment, others are not even testing them for Covid before conducting procedures on them. Peerless Hospital is now conducting around 15-20 surgeries and procedures a day, almost half of them on mild Covid patients with no pronounced symptoms. It has created a ward for them with 18 beds. “Since they had come to us for either treatment of other diseases or a surgery, we are going ahead with it unless Covid symptoms are very pronounced,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has stopped testing patients seeking admission for cardiac, renal, neuro or orthopaedic treatment unless they have pronounced symptoms. “We are being lenient especially in case of those who need a surgery even if it is an elective one. We are following government advisory and getting them under the surgeon’s knife unless they have a very strong symptom triggered by Covid,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Number of surgeries at Medica has gone up 20-25 a day from less than 15 last week. Woodlands Hospital has not been cancelling any planned surgeries or postponing them because of patients’ Covid status. “We have established our protocol on doing safe surgeries with Covid positive status, similar to other infective diseases now,” said Rupali Basu, MD & CEO. Others like RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, AMRI Hospitals, Belle Vue Clinic and Ruby General Hospital, however, are still desisting from surgeries and procedures on all Covid positives, barring emergency cases. At RTIICS, elective surgeries for asymptomatic patients with no co-morbities are being done two weeks after testing positive. For asymptomatic patients with co-morbidities, surgeries are being done after four weeks of testing positive. “No retesting will be done for all these cases between 14-90 days, unless they have fresh symptoms,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Belle Vue and Ruby are going ahead with emergency procedures on patients testing positive. “The rest are being given a later date,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. At Ruby, emergency surgeries like those on patients with multiple fractures are being regularly done. It has recently conducted a C-section on a Covid positive woman, said GM (operations) Subhashish Datta. It would be difficult to carry on normal operations if elective surgeries on asymptomatic patients are deferred, felt Mitra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-start-planned-ops-on-cov-patients/articleshow/89005846.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

While the civic body shows great speed in fining common citizens on the spot, it is dragging feet when it comes to MLA Krishna Khopde who according to NMC itself violated home isolation guidelines for Covid positive patients.A city bookshop owner recalls how he was fined Rs10,000 because of alleged overcrowding. “I had a top NMC official marching into my shop with 10 of his staff, of whom three were simply recording on their mobile phones. Also, there was no overcrowding as alleged but he did not listen,” the shopowner said and added, “Now, when I read about MLA Khopde, it is very frustrating for me. Do NMC officials have the guts to fine him on the spot?” Two weeks ago, a caterer was fined by NMC citing overcrowding during a wedding reception. Over the last three months many more like him faced fines even as the number of guests in attendance was disputed. TOI got in touch with a few of them through their association but none wanted their identities to be revealed.Rakesh Sharma (name changed) rents a lawn in the city and provides full catering services. “Some NMC staff entered the venue and started recording videos and taking snaps. One of them said people are not wearing masks. Of course, they won’t wear masks while eating, that’s common sense. And while on the way to fill the plate too people won’t be covering up again and again,” he said and added, “But we had no choice and rather than create a nuisance in front of our clients, I decided to accept their claim. Another friend of his who operates a mangal karyalaya said that NMC should now treat everyone fairly. “All of us must now be given a show cause notice only like the MLA. We too shall reply through our lawyers and challenge their allegations. But on the streets the NMC has the final say, like the courts,” said caterer Bikram Singh (name changed).Shantilal Kumeriya (name changed) was pulled up for violating home isolation guidelines. “I live in the city alone and earn for my family that’s out of the state in a village. My job is such that If I have to earn, then I have to step out. But if you say that politicians are not facing any action then it is very bad. It just confirms that all the rules are for the poor people like us, not the rich. These politicians seem to be getting away with everything,” said Kumeriya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/unfair-say-citizens-against-whom-nmc-took-swift-action/articleshow/89004088.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Education department to digitise notes to help UG, PG students in Covid times||KOLKATA: The higher education department has decided to digitise the study material generated by under graduate and post graduate faculty members of several colleges across the state during the pandemic when teachers shifting from the traditional offline mode to online method of teaching. The study material which will be collected from different colleges will be scanned and scrutinised and then uploaded on the West Bengal State Council of Higher Education (WBSCHE) website which will function as a reference material for students and teachers in the future. Several colleges have started collecting the study material from their teachers and doing the first round of checks before forwarding them to the council. “In the last 22 months or so since the outbreak of the pandemic, online classes became the dominant mode of teaching. Teachers across colleges in the state at the UG and PG level have worked very hard to produce simple yet comprehensive notes for students so that their learning doesn’t get hampered. This has created a huge pool of e-content or study material which needs to be classified and organised carefully before it is preserved so that it helps teachers and students in the coming years,” said a WBSCHE official. Initially notes for commerce, humanities and social science and languages will be aggregated and processed for the purpose of digitisation. Colleges have been requested to form a screening committe which will scan the study material before handing it over to the council. “The pandemic forced us to change our traditional methods of teaching and adopt newer ways. Our teachers made very lucid notes for the students to retain their attention and ensure that absence of in-person classes doesn’t adversely impact their learning. We are aggregating them to be forwarded to the council,” said the principal of a central Kolkata college. Schools, colleges and universities shut down in March 2020 after the Covid outbreak. Educational institutes reopened in November last year but had to be shut down within a few weeks due to the third wave. “We don’t know when colleges and universities will reopen fully again. In such a scenario these notes will be very helpful for students who have just taken admission or will be taking admission in the next session,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/edu-dept-to-digitise-notes-to-help-ug-pg-students-in-cov-times/articleshow/89005848.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Agra||Veteran Ambedkarite files papers for 94th election of his life||Agra: The upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh will mark 74-year-old Hasanuram Ambedkari's 94th election as a candidate. On Wednesday, he filed his papers at the collectorate to contest elections from Kheragarh seat of Agra district as an independent. Ambedkari was a senior member in the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (Bamcef) founded by Kanshi Ram before the Bahujan Samaj Party came into being. He told TOI that he fought all elections according to the ideology of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Ambedkari has been contesting elections since 1985 for various bodies, including the Lok Sabha, state assembly, and panchayat elections from different seats. However, he has never won. In 1988, his nomination for the post of the President of India was rejected. He said, “I contest elections to lose. The winning politicians forget the masses. I want to set a record of losing elections 100 times. I don’t care who my opponents are as I contest elections to give an option to voters who believe in Ambedkar's ideology.” Ambedkari contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri seats but was unable to retain his deposits. The last election he fought was for the post of a district council member in 2021. His best performance was in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections when he secured 36,000 votes from the Firozabad seat. Ambedkari said, “On Wednesday, my nomination to contest the assembly election from my home constituency Kheragarh was accepted. My fellow Ambedkarites want me to also file a nomination from the Agra (rural) seat, which is reserved for scheduled castes. I will do it on Thursday.” He added that he had already started door-to-door campaigning with his wife and supporters. "If people vote for me, I will work according to constitutional principles. My agenda has always been impartial and corruption-free development and welfare of the marginalised in society,” he said. Ambedkari has been active in politics for over 40 years. He served as the district president and state vice-president of Bamcef from 1977 to 1984. He was briefly a member of the BSP as well. “I was a dedicated worker of Bamcef and also worked for the BSP to strengthen its roots in UP. In 1985, when I asked for a ticket, party leaders ridiculed me and told me that not even my wife would vote for me. I was humiliated for being financially weak. I was deeply disheartened by the entire episode and since then have been contesting every election as an independent candidate,” he said. Ambedkari said he works as farm labour and has an MNREGA job card. He added that he has no formal schooling, but can read and write Hindi, Urdu, and English.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/veteran-ambedkarite-files-papers-for-94th-election-of-his-life/articleshow/89001495.cms||Deepak Lavania

The party is calling it the Booth Vistarak Yojana (Booth Expansion Scheme). The exercise they claim is part of the birth centenary year celebration of Jan Sangh patriarch Kushabhau Thakre. From January 20 to 30, all BJP leaders including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state BJP chief VD Sharma, state cabinet ministers, MPs, MLAs, party office-bearers will hit the rural areas to train booth workers for 100 hours – ten hours per day. State BJP chief VD Sharma said that this initial training will prepare 20,000 BJP master-trainers who will be on the field for strengthening organization. The final target is to increase the party’s vote share by 11% per booth. On Monday, as the first step to implementation of the Booth Vistarak scheme, the state party office launched an app named Sangathan (organization) to digitally connect 65,000 booths to the organization headquarters here in the state capital. Speaking at the launch of the app, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, “In the organizational year, we are reaching every booth. And will hold discussions with booth level workers. From the point of politics, this will be our biggest campaign.” In the 2018 assembly elections, Congress secured 40.89% votes while BJP got 41.02%. Even though BJP garnered slightly more votes, its seat count reduced from 165 in 2013 to 109 in 2018. The 56 seats lost by the BJP was gained by the Congress. While Congress gained 4.60% votes compared to last elections, BJP vote share reduced by 3.86%.This is the reason why BJP has started early on strengthening the booths.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bjps-booth-expansion-training-for-2023-polls-from-today/articleshow/89005865.cms||---

Referring to incidents that have taken place on the university campus, JNUTA said, “The incidents point to the grave situation of insecurity on campus, particularly for women, that is in many ways a direct result of the administrative incompetence and general misogyny of the JNU administration.” “With women faculty being systematically sidelined from administrative positions and the dissolution of GSCASH by the ex-but-still-acting vice-chancellor, professor M Jagadesh Kumar, there is a lack of representation leading to a skewed sense of male entitlement. GSCASH was an active body of elected representatives from all sections of the university community that helped create a sense of security for women on campus,” JNUTA said. The body also stated that it was important for a residential university like JNU that the incidents served as a “wake-up call”. It added, “Vast amounts of money spent on security cameras and bringing on board a security service with no experience of civilian security matters will address the issue. Elected representative bodies have to be trusted to take up the work of gender sensitisation and follow through on complaints through due process.” JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) circulated a sketch and claimed it to be of the alleged perpetrator. “The survivor has identified the following as the accused in the case. Delhi Police has issued this sketch for the identification of the accused,” it claimed. However, DCP (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said, “This is to inform that no sketch of any suspect related to JNU incident has been shared or circulated by the southwest district police on any forum.” Senior officials of the JNU administration could not be reached for a comment on the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/focus-on-campus-security-jnuta-wants-committee-on-sex-harassment-back/articleshow/89004565.cms||TNN

The Shahdol tigress’s carcass was found in Amjhor range at Kauwa Sarai village, said officials, adding that all its organs were found to be intact. Officers say it probably fell prey to an electrical wire trap. “Villagers must have tried to hide the carcass, fearing action. Some suspects have been rounded up and they are being interrogated,” said an officer. Environmentalist Ajay Dubey has called for a high level inquiry into the death of the Shahdol tigress. This is the third tiger death in MP barely three weeks into the year. On January 7, a tiger cub was found killed and partially eaten in Bandhavgarh. The carcass was almost severed in two.

---||Bhopal||Over 8,000 new Covid-19 cases in Bhopal again||BHOPAL: At least 23 patients were hospitalized with Covid-19 infection in Bhopal on Wednesday. The rise in hospitalization came after a drop in the cases for three consecutive days. Out of 8,031 Covid-19 patients in a day, at least 249 were hospitalized on Wednesday in Bhopal. Suspecting Covid-19, a delay in seeking medical attention, especially for patients with co-morbidities can be fatal, warned Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Prabhakar Tiwari, here on Tuesday. Daily infection spike was limited to 1,341 new cases on Wednesday. A day before, 1,339 new infection cases were reported in Bhopal as per the state health bulletin on Tuesday. For the month of January, 10,000 Covid infections have been diagnosed in Bhopal leading to two deaths. The first was a former railway employee who was a case of late presentation. He waas in cardiac arrest when brought to Railway hospital. The other was a 62-year-old Govindpura resident and was rushed to hospital after he complained of chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Covid-19 was confirmed after his death. “With medical attention in time, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is preventable and treatable,” said Dr Tiwari. He also characterized another Covid-19 disease deceased who developed complication that led to inter-diverticular hemorrhage. Experts warn that getting testing for Covid should be a priority for those with comorbidities given the persistent respiratory symptoms like progressive breathlessness and cough is not always the case with new variant Omicron. There have been two other deaths not classified as due to Covid. One of them was a Hoshangabad district resident who died in Bhopal. Two other deaths took place in Hamidia hospital. Deaths compared to earlier Covid-19 surge has been far less. For context, Bhopal had 10 Covid-19 patients who require intensive care hospitalization, on January 1. On that day 27-new cases of the infection were diagnosed – reported ‘as the highest single day spike in cases since June 2021’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/over-8k-new-covid-19-cases-in-bhopal-again/articleshow/89005870.cms||Jamal Ayub

---||Bhopal||Excise policy in Madhya Pradesh gets mixed response||BHOPAL: The new excise policy approved by the state cabinet on Tuesday received a mixed response. While a section of liquor industry sources welcomed the policy terming it as good and effective to curb spurious liquor trade, another group opposed it saying that the government has “doubled” liquor shops by proxy through composite liquor shop policy. Those hailing the policy said illicit liquor trade will suffer as prices will come down. While those opposing it alleged government is promoting sale of liquor despite chief minister pledging not to open new liquor shops in the state. Two things, however, stand out on how the new excise policy would impact the liquor market: liquor would sell more, would be more accessible and excise revenue of the state government would go up even as prices of liquor reduce nominally. Excise commissioner Rajiv Dubey while talking to TOI said that the department expects excise revenue to go up by 20% in the new financial year. As of now, state’s excise revenue is Rs 10,300 crore. When asked whether the composite liquor shop i.e. shops selling both the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and country liquor would be optional for contractors or all the shops will be composite shops, he said “We shall give licence to all the shops; what they keep and sell is their prerogative. It's like a grocery shop owner may keep certain things and may not keep some other. The contractor will have the freedom to keep both the IMFL and country liquor and he would pay the licence fee likewise, he may decide to only keep IMFL and not sell country liquor or vice versa," he said. On avowed target of the new policy to reduce prices of liquor and rationalise it to check the sale of spurious liquor, he said on an average both country liquor and IMFL would be cheaper by 10%. When asked that a 10% reduction in prices would mean hardly anything going by the fact that liquor shops are abnormally high in the state, he said, “There are several brands, and they are priced differently. Prices of some will reduce more and some less and on an average it would be about 10%. On allowing micro breweries to operate, he said, “Rules in this regard have not been framed. They will be framed by March.” Rinku Bhatia, who knows the intricacies of liquor trade inside out, while welcoming the new excise policy said due to its provisions prices of liquor will drop and it would be easily available, thereby curbing illegal sale of liquor. Bhatia said that the new policy would also work to end the monopoly of a cartel in the liquor trade as liquor shops would be auctioned in small clusters and there would be several players. Bhatia said that the provision for allowing setting up of micro brewing units is a step towards modernising liquor trade in the state as in the metros. It would allow hotels and resorts at tourist destinations and bigger cities like Bhopal and Indore to serve fresh beer. He, however, suggested that if the state government allows open tender for country liquor, prices of country liquor could come down drastically. “As of now, the country liquor trade is in the hands of distilleries. As a result, a box of 55 quarters (nip), which should cost Rs 400 to a trader, is costing Rs 700, if open tender is allowed in allotting the liquor shop outlets, in addition to 10% decline in prices, a quarter of country liquor would start costing Rs 7-8 less,” he said. However, a liquor contractor, on the condition of anonymity, said that through composite shop culture, the state government has been able to do what it had been trying to do for quite some time- increasing the number of liquor shops. “There are 6,500 liquor shops in the state- 4,000 dealing in sale of IMFL and the remaining 2,500 selling country liquor. When you allow each shop to have counters for both, the number of shops are doubled by proxy. If you remember, the Shivraj government had tried to do it earlier as well but had to revoke the order due to stiff opposition. Since the chief minister had pledged not to open any new liquor shop, officials of the excise department have tried to do it by proxy," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/excise-policy-gets-mixed-response/articleshow/89005874.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Bhopal||Cyber cops in Bhopal set up new helpline to prevent fraud||BHOPAL: Bhopal police on Monday issued helpline numbers to prevent incidents of cyber fraud through immediate intervention. DCP, cyber crime, Amit Kumar, said that on receiving calls on helpline no (0755-2920664) or (9479990636), immediate action would be taken and the portal, bank or e-commerce company related to the incident would be alerted so that the incident of fraud could be prevented and on failing to avert the incident, trace the fraud as early as possible and initiate action against him as per the law. He further said that in the cases of cyber fraud, the initial hours after the incident are very crucial. Once a cyber criminal withdraws money from his bank account, it becomes difficult to recover the amount fraudulently transferred from someone else's account. In many cybercrime cases reported to police, it was seen that the victims delayed in reaching out to police, which gave enough time to the fraudsters to withdraw the money from their bank accounts. So to address this problem, the cyber crime branch started the helpline for people on July 14. Urging people to immediately make a call on the helpline no. in case of cyber fraud, he said it allows the police to freeze the account of the fraudster with the help of the bank or agency concerned and retrieve the amount to the victim.  He said 2 to 3 complaints are being received on the helpline nos. as of now and they wish the cyber fraud helpline nos. to become a common knowledge so that increasing cases of cyber theft could be checked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cyber-cops-set-up-new-helpline-to-prevent-fraud/articleshow/89005876.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh government's love for liquor has been exposed again, says Congress||BHOPAL: The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government finds itself under Congress attack after the state cabinet on Tuesday approved the new Excise Policy for 2022-23. It will be interesting to see senior BJP leader and former CM Uma Bharti’s reaction as she has been campaigning for prohibition. Former CM Kamal Nath on Wednesday said that the state government will deliver liquor “house-to-house” so everyone can remain intoxicated. The BJP government’s “love for liquor” has been exposed, Nath remarked. The state cabinet on Tuesday slashed duty on foreign liquor by 10% to 13%, decided to give licence for bars at homes and increased the limit of alcohol, which can held at one’s disposal by four times. Till now, keeping one crate of beer, six bottles of wine and four bottles of spirit was permitted. But under the new policy, a person will be allowed to retain four crates of beer, 24 bottles of wine and 16 bottles of spirits. It also allowed micro-breweries in hotels for production of fresh beer. On Wednesday morning, Nath tweeted, “Shivraj government’s love for liquor has been exposed again. Duty has been slashed and liquor will be cheaper in Madhya Pradesh while diesel-petrol is expensive with no relief in taxes. People have been demanding reduction in fuel taxes for a long time. Government has shown its priority.” Madhya Pradesh cabinet’s excise policy comes three days after former Union minister Uma Bharti’s deadline for prohibition of alcohol in the state. शिवराज सरकार का शराब प्रेम एक बार फिर उजागर…मध्यप्रदेश में शराब अब होगी सस्ती , ड्यूटी में कमी , वही दूसरी तरफ़ पे… https://t.co/icnnZ6I5sZ— Kamal Nath (@OfficeOfKNath) 1642571519000In September last year, Bharti threatened an agitation from January 15, 2022 if the BJP government did not enforce a ban on alcohol. On the contrary, the cabinet not only made a liberal excise policy but also approved the Heritage Liquor Policy 2022, giving permission to pilot projects for manufacture of Mahua-based liquor in two tribal districts of Alirajpur and Dindori. In a series of tweets, Nath also pointed out that under the new excise policy, the government has facilitated selling foreign and country liquor from the same shop and liquor has been made available in supermarkets and airports. The government’s policy is to encourage liquor business and increase sale of liquor. “The government has no control over the liquor mafia, illegal business of illicit and poisonous liquor continues in the state. Those who spoke of prohibition of liquor during the elections, have become the biggest supporters of alcohol today. This is the reality,” Nath tweeted. BJP’s Narottam Mishra said, “This is that Congress party and the same Kamal Nath who during his regime was going to sell liquor separately to women, deliver alcohol to households. What has the Congress government done in Chhattisgarh regarding liquor, what is the Congress government doing in Punjab about alcohol? There under Congress rule, it has become Udta Punjab.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/govts-love-for-liquor-has-been-exposed-again-cong/articleshow/89005877.cms||Suchandana Gupta

---||Nagpur||Only 1,200 cryogenic oxygen vessels at hospitals in country||NAGPUR: There are not more than 1,200 cryogenic vessels which can store liquid oxygen at hospitals in the entire country. Storing in cryogenic or liquid form makes oxygen management easier as against relying on gas cylinders. The cylinders have to be taken out for a refill involving considerable time. This had aggravated the oxygen crisis during the second wave of Covid-19. One cryogenic vessel of up to 1,000 litres capacity is equal to at least 160 cylinders of 55 kg capacity. The cryogenic vessels can be filled up right at the spot by a tanker. The norms for permanent installation and filling of cryogenic vessels were eased in 2016. The root of the problem perhaps lies in the little space available in a number of hospitals throughout the country, say experts. The situation is no different in the city. It’s probably because most of the hospitals are in rather congested premises, only a handful of have been able to install the vessels by meeting the distancing norms, said sources. The data collection and approvals come under Petroleum and Safety Organisation (PESO) based in the city. After 2016, it became much easier to have a cryogenic storage vessel at hospitals. The process happened faster in Covid times. However, the key criterion include having a certain minimum space. Even on the higher side it is not more than 7.5 metre for a vessel having capacity above 10,000 litres. Yet, there may be many hospitals that may not have even 7.5 metre to spare, said sources. The criterion is defined in the Static and Mobile Pressure Vessels (unfired) Rules 2016. For installing a vessel of up to 1,000 litre, the distance between two vessels should be 0.5 metre; they should be 2 metre way from any building or pedestrian passes. A distance of three metre has to be maintained between the vessel and a flammable structure, naked flame, electric installation or places of public assembly. The distance increases along with capacity of the vessel. Experts says a 1,000 litre vessel is enough for a small or mid-sized hospital. However, not more than 80 hospitals have installed the vessels of 1,000 litre capacity. During the second wave only 600-odd hospitals had cryogenic storage facility. This has increased a little more than double after that. Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), accepted that 1,200 is indeed a very small number as compared to hospitals all over the country. VHA alone has 160 members. Marar said at Orange City Hospital they had the facility which made oxygen availably much easy during covid times. He accepted that space is indeed a constraint in the hospital while saying that the norms can be easier. Sources aware of the matter said a minimum distance is needed for safety purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/only-1200-cryogenic-oxygen-vessels-at-hosps-in-country/articleshow/89004095.cms||Shishir Arya

The court in an order on January 18 said that the status report seems like a mere formality and nothing has been stated in it about the progress of the investigation being carried out. Metropolitan Magistrate Gaurav Sharma noted that in terms of previous order, copy of reply in the name of Additional DCP has been filed as per which status report was filed before the court of Presiding Officer, MACT, on January 4, however, there was no occasion for a status report to be filed there as the court had directed it to be filed before this court. It further said that the concerned inspector was absent before the court despite directions to that effect by the Additional DCP. “No proper explanation has been given for the same,” it remarked. The court issued notice to the DCP concerned to furnish a status report for the present case clearly delineating the progress of investigation. It directed the DCP to also account for the non-presence of the concerned inspector. The trial court had earlier directed the concerned DCP to transfer a property dispute case from the present investigating officer to another official, saying it felt that he would not be able to reach the truth of the matter.

When the petition came up on Wednesday, via virtual hearing, senior counsel Vivek Tankha, representing Chodankar, told the court that there’s an element of urgency as the five-year term of the MLAs is coming to an end. He told the division bench that the whole exercise becomes infructuous if the court doesn’t pass an order either way. “With elections around the corner, Mr Tankha do you think there’s anything left in these matters seriously?” the division bench comprising Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Manish Pitale asked. Tankha said the precedent has to be adjudicated because it can happen after this election also, to which the bench said, “You’re right, with Goa anything can happen.” Tankha said it is not only in Goa, but this will be a precedent for the rest of the country also. “..this problem, Mr Tankha is more in smaller states, smaller legislatures and it is creating a problem. We have Uttarakhand coming up now,” the bench said. Tankha said that he is keen that after the hearing, if there’s an order of the court, it would at least be like a “beacon for the country”. Counsel Dhaval Jhaveri said it is a question of constitutional importance. Tankha stated that he has already submitted his written submissions and said the other parties were expected to do so too and added that giving written submissions will facilitate the court and shorten arguments. Chodankar is challenging the order passed by Patnekar dismissing his petition seeking disqualification of the 10 Congress MLAs who defected. Similar petitions/ applications have been filed by MGP’s Sudin Dhavalikar and Goa Forward Party’s Durgadas Kamat. In November, the high court issued a notice to the 10 Congress rebel MLAs as well as Patnekar calling for replies by December 6 and written statements by December 9. At the time, Tankha with advocate Abhijit Gosavi, representing Chodankar, apprised the bench that the matter was purely a question of law which needs to be addressed urgently in order to protect the credibility of democracy. Chodankar’s case is that the speaker, who upheld the “merger” of the 10 Congress MLAs into BJP, failed to take documentary evidence while deciding the disqualification petition. Congress party has alleged bias and malice by the speaker in deciding the matter. “The speaker deliberately delayed the proceedings pending before him since August 2019 and finally passed the order in the matter, after an inordinate delay of 20 months of filing of the disqualification petition, that too only after the Supreme Court intervened by passing orders,” Congress stated. During an earlier hearing in June last year, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Chodankar, had argued that there is urgency in the matter considering the term of the assembly was ending by March 2022, with only a few months left.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-sets-february-1-as-final-hearing-of-congress-disqualification-plea/articleshow/89004622.cms||---

The century-old building, from where the city’s municipal administration began during the British-era, will be demolished to develop Kanara Chamber Road. In fact, Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) was planning to restore the century-old building as a heritage structure. A proposal in this regard was mooted by the then managing director of the MSCL, Mohammed Nazeer, in 2018. The plan was to restore the old building with an area of 6,000 sq ft, into a monument. The MSCL had also invited suggestions from citizens, for the restoration of the building and its premises. However, MSCL recently decided to demolish the building to facilitate the widening of the road. MSCL general manager (technical) Arun Prabha K S told TOI that the building is in such a dilapidated condition, and that it cannot be restored. “The road development work through MSCL is under progress in the Port ward of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC). Accordingly, work on the Kanara Chamber Road, that connects Badriya School junction in the ward, is also progressing. To facilitate the work, the old building needs to be demolished, and a letter in this regard was sent to the MCC in November, seeking permission. The land where the building is located belongs to the MCC. As per MSCL’s plan, it requires 35.6 sq m for the road. The old building is in a dilapidated condition, and it is not being used,” he said. Mayor Premanand Shetty said that the MCC council has approved the proposal to demolish the building, and a resolution has been sent to the Town Planning Standing Committee for final approval. The municipal council of Mangalore was established in 1866, through the Madras Town Improvement Act, 1865. Later, the Mangalore City Corporation came into existence in 1980.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/100-year-old-mangalore-municipality-building-to-be-razed/articleshow/89003284.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hawkers did not impede access of tenders during Nehru Place blaze, high court told||New Delhi: Arguing that the hawkers did not impede the movement of fire tenders at Nehru Place, an NGO asked Delhi high court on Wednesday to note that five of the six fire tenders sent to extinguish a fire at the market last August had actually reached the site within a minute. Representing the interests of hawkers and vendors in the area, congestion in which has been taken up suo motu by the court after the blaze, NGO Manushi Sangathan said in a plea filed through advocate Indira Unninayar, “Applicant has recently located a report from the Delhi Fire Service website which shows that it took just 1 minute for the Delhi Fire Services to reach the site of the fire scene at Nehru Place on the date of the fire on 12.8.2021.” Manushi added that on further inquiry, it found that five of the six fire tenders reached the fire site on time, and only one vehicle, running on an alternative route, took longer because the person with the key for a locked chain on the boom barrier had to be located. There were also hindrances in the form of diggings, including for a rain harvesting pit.” Urging the court to permit it to be heard as a party in the matter, Manushi contended that even in the mock fire drill conducted on court orders in October last year, the report hadn’t mentioned the obstructions posed by the ongoing construction and repair works at Nehru Place. It added that the NGO and other vendors had been temporarily moved from their regular business sites due to ongoing construction and so hadn’t hampered the movement of the fire tenders. “It worth understanding how the fire authorities reached the site of the fire on 12.8.2021 in one minute but why it took 11 minutes for them on 7.10.2021 during the mock drill,” the plea said. “The vendors are also concerned about the well-being and safety of the citizens and desire the safety of all concerned,” the NGO said. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court upheld a Delhi high court verdict of 2017 and withdrew the interim protection granted to vendors while directing SDMC to remove them from Nehru Place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hawkers-did-not-impede-access-of-tenders-during-nehru-place-blaze-high-court-told/articleshow/89004562.cms||Abhinav Garg

The party leadership has already said the Thiruvathira programme should have been avoided. The state secretary and district secretary have already clarified on it,” said the minister, when reporters pestered her with questions regarding the rationale behind CPM flouting Covid restrictions in the wake of an Omicron scare.CPM has been facing flak for organizing district conferences, flouting Covid restrictions. The party district unit had made headlines for organizing a mega Thiruvathira dance in which over 500 members of Janadhipathya Mahila Association participated. As the three-day conference turned out to be one of the major Covid clusters reported in the district, several delegates – including education minister V Sivankutty, former minister Kadakampally Surendran, MLA IB Satheesh – contracted Covid immediately after the event.But, CPM leadership tried to save its skin with the claims that the public meetings in connection with the district conference were cancelled in view of the Covid situation.Meanwhile, opposition leader VD Satheesan accused the health department of being passive and said that the CPM district conferences were a major reason for the spread of Covid at the current pace.“Congress and UDF shelved all public programmes in view of the dire Covid situation in state. But Thiruvathira dance and party conferences are more important for the government. Around 300 people, including four MLAs who attended the conference here, turned positive. CPM still says it will go ahead with party programmes,” he said.The opposition leader said the government has taken no concrete step to face the third wave of Covid. “There is not enough medicine in stock. The district collector who banned public gatherings with over 50 people was forced to give permission to conduct Kudumbashree election,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-curbs-applicable-to-political-parties-min/articleshow/89005890.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Provide aid to parents of murdered girl: Opposition leader V D Satheesan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader V D Satheesan has asked the government to provide compensation to the parents of the 14-year- old girl who was murdered in Kovalam a year ago. The family alleged that the police had tortured the parents claiming that they had murdered their own child. The opposition leader said that the government should take action against the police officials who tortured the parents. After visiting the parents in Kovalam on Wednesday, the opposition leader said the police had behaved brutally to the parents and were continuously tortured for days. The police had forced the parents to admit to the murder of their child. This is quite unheard of in the past and the police are behaving like goondas, Satheesan alleged. If father had to face brutal physical torture in the custody, the mother who is a cancer patient, was tortured mentally. The police were trying to put the murder charge on the parents since they were unable to find the real culprits. When the police world over are using several scientific techniques to solve the murder mysteries, the state police are using third degree to resolve the cases, which is shameful for a state like Kerala, said Satheesan. He also said that despite the atrocities done by the police coming out and the real people behind the murder of the 14-year-old girl have been arrested, the government has not even taken a single step to apologise or meet the girl’s parents. “The government should take strict action against the police personnel who were involved in the torture against these parents. The government also should provide adequate compensation to them and take care of the treatment of the mother who is a cancer patient,’’ said Satheesan. If the government is not willing to provide help to these parents, then the opposition will provide all support to them. The opposition will also provide all legal support to the parents to punish the police officers involved in the brutal custodial torture, he added. He said that he will be writing to the chief minister and the state police chief soon in this regard.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/provide-aid-to-parents-of-murdered-girl-cong/articleshow/89005898.cms||---

While the state government is taking all adequate steps, we do not want to resort to punitive action as we seek support from citizens to control the cases,” said Patel. He added that the state now has a capacity of producing 1,500 metric tonnes of oxygen against which the daily requirement is 70 metric tonnes. “It is apprehended that the possible third wave might have its peak effect in Gujarat around January-end and beginning of February. If people are not cautious, the daily spike can reach up to 50,000 or even 1 lakh cases,” said Dr VN Shah, a city-based diabetologist. “Do not make the mistake of taking Omicron as (lightly as) the common flu. The manner in which the cases are rising, it is possible that hospitalizations will increase. Children and others who have not been inoculated need to be especially careful,” said Dr Sudhir Shah, a city-based neurologist. “The original weapons against the virus are still the most effective – sanitization, masking and social distancing (SMS),” he added. The members of Covid task force had met Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel on Tuesday in Gandhinagar and put forth their suggestions to rein in the cases. Sources close to the development, however, said that there are no immediate plans to introduce new curbs. Experts said that the trials of Remdesivir have given good results when used in the early stages of infection. Dr Tushar Patel, a city-based pulmonologist, said that some of the symptoms this time around include low-grade fever, muscle pain and scratchy throat among others. “The patients must remain hydrated and gargle with salt water periodically for relief,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/its-official-omicron-forms-70-80-of-gujs-daily-cases/articleshow/89005899.cms||---

Their sojourn is set to only become friendlier as four state villages adjoining the UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on the southern tip of Gujarat and a part of land in close proximity to the UT of Diu on the Saurashtra coastline are set to be included within limits of Union territories. One of the big implications would be that liquor will be freely available in these areas which were located in dry Gujarat until now. The move is expected to give a fillip to liquor and leisure tourism even as Gujarat steadfastly guards its decision to continue with prohibition. The four villages of Kaprada taluka of Valsad district in south Gujarat which are likely to be soon part of the neighbouring UT are Meghval, Nagar, Raymal and Madhuban. On the Saurashtra coast, a part of Goghala village, will be handed over to the UT of Diu. The Union ministry of home affairs has decided to include the merger of four villages of Valsad into Dadra and Nagar Haveli and part of Ghoghala village in Gujarat into the UT of Diu. A formal ratification of the decision is likely at the western council standing committee meeting scheduled to be held on January 28 in Goa, top sources said. Key officials said, “Meghval village is completely surrounded by the Union territory while three other villages fall between Madhuban dam reservoir and Dadra and Nagar Haveli area. In the monsoon most of the areas of these villages get submerged and their only access point remains through the Union territory. There was long pending demand and suggestion to merge these four Gujarat villages into the Union territory. It will boost tourist activities in the villages and employment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/four-gujarat-villages-will-no-more-be-dry/articleshow/89005764.cms||Kapil Dave

The strike call comes at a time when the state is witnessing the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases. The Gujarat Government Doctors Forum on Wednesday said that despite verbal assurances from the state government in the past, most of its demands are still pending. The association, which has in-service, GMERS, and Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association doctors as members, stated in a media note that the doctors will continue the strike till all their demands are fulfilled. The doctors will stop all routine, emergency, and exam-related work beginning Thursday. GGDF has been protesting against reduction in salaries and pressing for other demands from the government. Over the past few months, professors have been facing salary cuts in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 96,000 per month. The government gave a dearness allowance for about five months but decided to withdraw it, and recovered the money paid from the salaries of professors. Some of the doctors’ demands are very old and this is the seventh time that the government has assured them that it will look into the matter, said sources aware of the developments. Earlier this year, GMTA m mbers called off their strike when they were assured by the government that their demands will be addressed. The demands included a higher non-practising allowance in line with the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Another demand is related to abolition of contract appointments. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. GMTA had demanded that teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/10k-docs-on-strike-till-demands-are-met/articleshow/89005900.cms||---

SHO at Fardhan police station, Rakesh Singh Yadav, said the accused was caught red-handed by the girl’s parents and handed over to police after a sound thrashing. Subsequently, an FIR under sections of rape and Pocso Act was registered against him. On Wednesday, he was produced in a local court, which sent him to judicial custody while the girl was sent for medical examination. In shock, the girl’s parents said that the accused, a neighbour, used to call their daughter his "granddaughter" and that they still can’t believe the man could commit such a crime. Seeing the girl play outside her house, the man approached her and lured her with sweets. He then took her to the terrace of his house. When the girl did not return home, her parents started looking for her. On being told that she was last seen with their neighbour, they barged into his house and caught him red-handed. Yadav said, “The girl knew the accused for years so she didn’t hesitate to go with him. The man told us that the girl was "an easy prey" and he was sure she would not tell anyone about the assault. He has been booked under relevant sections of the IPC along with sections 3 and 5 of the Pocso Act. We will soon file a chargesheet against him in court to ensure a speedy trial.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/hearing-speech-impaired-girl-9-raped-by-man-60/articleshow/89004101.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

This is a 40% spike compared to 5,998 cases on Tuesday – one of the highest daily rises in new cases. The city also accounts for 40% of the state’s daily tally of 20,966 – again one of the highest in the recent times. On Wednesday, the city recorded deaths of six patients, doubling the number in a day from 3 on Tuesday. In just a week, the city recorded deaths of 15 patients — the highest weekly deaths since July last year, reveals the analysis. Experts from the city said that the spike is quite high compared to the second wave due to the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variant, which is confirmed to be the dominant variant in Gujarat. “Almost all testing domes run by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) are witnessing long queues since morning, a clear indication that there is a rise in daily cases. In fact, the number could be much higher than the official tally,” said an epidemiologist. “Due to the milder nature of the infection, many are avoiding formal tests at labs or going to doctors. Instead they are resorting to self-medication, which is not advisable.” While the government-run hospitals have over 150 patients now, private hospitals have 132 patients out of which 7 were on ventilator and 16 in ICU wards. Officials said that several of the patients have not taken one or two doses of vaccination. With the update on Wednesday, Ahmedabad district added 4,618 new active cases, taking the total to 31,876, accounting for one-third of the state’s total active cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-sees-40-spike-in-a-day/articleshow/89005902.cms||---

He fled to Goa where he began catching fish and ran a business. But, as fate would have it, his crime caught up with him when the 42-year-old decided to pay a visit to his sister in Ahmedabad and got stuck here due to rise in Covid cases. The city crime branch tracked him and arrested him on Tuesday for the loot he allegedly committed in 2005. Police said, “D’Souza, who was a resident of Amraiwadi in 2005, had looted a bag containing 41kg of silver bars and ornaments. He fled to Panjim and settled down there. While in Ahmedabad, he stayed away from his family. However, in 2019, he established contact with his sister and brother through a social media platform. They stayed in Chandlodia and D’Souza would occasionally come to the city to meet his sister. However, he would never stay for more than two days.” On December 9, 2021, he came to the city to meet his sister who was pregnant. “As Covid cases began to rise, D’Souza decided to extend his stay. He avoided going out and stayed at her house for more than a month, waiting for the wave to subside. Meanwhile, crime branch officers received information about his whereabouts,” said police. They raided the house on Tuesday night and caught him. The crime branch will hand over his custody to Navrangpura police who had registered a case of loot in 2005.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/locked-by-covid-fear-2005-loot-accused-held/articleshow/89005905.cms||---

Yellow metal prices have remained steady over the past fortnight. The last time gold breached the Rs 50,000-mark was on January 3 after which it hovered around the Rs 49,500-mark for about two weeks. According to analysts, the yellow metal prices have stayed more or less the same, as the US treasury yields firmed over to two-year high, expecting a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. In the wake of a fresh spike in Covid-19 cases, overall demand has continued to remain muted. “Even though gold prices are stable, demand for gold and gold jewellery has taken a hit over the past week or so in the wake of a rapid spike in cases of Covid-19. A number of weddings have also been deferred due to which demand took a big hit,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). “With the kamurta period — considered inauspicious for weddings or gold purchases — lasting till Uttarayan, the demand was muted. Also, with weddings getting deferred and the union budget just a couple of weeks away, the overall demand has remained low-key. As cases begin to recede, demand will pick up yet again,” said Acharya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gold-prices-inching-towards-50000-mark/articleshow/89005907.cms||---

The court said its writ will have an effect across the country. At present, the deadlines to file TAR and ITR (for specific tax payers) for assessment year 2021-22 are February 15 and March 15, respectively. An association of chartered accountants has already sought a deadline extension, citing glitches in the newly introduced I-T portal. They also sought permission for physical filing of tax returns and reports. During a hearing on Tuesday, the CBDT turned down the request for physical filing of I-T returns and said that it would not be feasible. This led the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore to instruct the central government lawyer, “Ask the highest authority to file an affidavit with regard to the problems that have cropped up and they may be immediately attended. If the problem is not attended, the officer will be personally responsible for it. If the CBDT is to adopt a very obstinate attitude, which we don’t appreciate, they should also keep in mind the assessees’ problems as on date. There is no need for CBDT to be happy because 35% of assessees are finding it difficult to upload their reports and 65% are yet to file their tax audit report and IT returns and now we have less than one month left.” The HC refused to issue directions on Tuesday, but insisted on assurance from the “highest authority” that in case of difficulty faced by any assessee, the problem would be attended within 48 hours with whatever means the authorities have to adopt. The HC has called for an affidavit in this regard from the authorities by Thursday. The judges said that there are glitches in filing reports on I-T portal and the authorities cannot run away from it. “When they are confident of taking care of the situation, let them solve it,” the court said. While posting further hearing on Friday, the bench said that even on February 10, just five days ahead of the deadline, if the assessees continue to face the problem, the court would extend the deadline to March 15, 2022. “Issuance of a writ will have its effect across the country. Let’s see what CBDT has to say about it,” the judges said and added that the court would also clarify that the assessees would not be fastened with any liability of penalty or interest, if the department is not able to solve the problem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fix-i-t-portal-glitches-or-we-will-extend-itr-deadline-hc/articleshow/89005911.cms||---

The PIL was filed by the Ahmedabad National Company Law Tribunal Practitioners Association. In demanding a bench at Ahmedabad, the petitioner relied on Swiss Ribbons’ judgment passed by the Supreme Court in 2019 when it had directed such benches be established at the seat of the high court within six months. The petitioner has contended that the right to access to justice is a fundamental right under the Constitution. At present, litigants from Gujarat are required to travel to New Delhi to file an appeal before NCLAT. There are only two benches available across the country – New Delhi and Chennai. The petitioner urged the HC to direct the concerned authorities to implement the apex court’s directions.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC refuses to evict woman on father-in-law’s plea||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has refused to order the eviction of a woman with her minor daughter from a house at the behest of her father-in-law. The senior citizen wanted his property back under the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. The HC had to decide whether the Act has an overriding effect on the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (PWDV) Act, 2005. The high court cited a judgment by the Supreme Court. “…the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act, 2007,” the high court observed in its January 18 order. The case involved one Jagdishbhai Patel, who owns a house near Sardar Patel Colony in Ahmedabad. His son, Ruchin, married Reshma Patel in 2017. The couple lived for some time in the house and when the husband left for the US, the woman moved to her flat. Last year, the woman instituted a family suit in the family court. Patel also filed an application seeking to remove his daughter-in-law from his house and complained that she forcibly entered the property in September 2020. Patel cited Section 3 of the Senior Citizens Act and submitted that the Act has an overriding effect on the PWDV Act. In response, the woman’s advocate submitted that the PWDV Act will prevail over the Senior Citizens Act and hence she cannot be evicted from the matrimonial home. The husband stood with his father in the legal battle and insisted that his father is entitled to the possession of the house. After hearing the case, Justice A C Joshi said that the court was faced with “a tricky issue”. The judge further observed that allowing the Senior Citizens Act to have an overriding effect in all situations would defeat the object and purpose which the Parliament sought to achieve in enacting the PWDV Act. “The law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to ensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their children or relatives,” the court said. “Equally, the purpose of the PWDV Act, 2005, cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory interpretation. Both sets of legislation have to be harmoniously construed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-refuses-to-evict-woman-on-father-in-laws-plea/articleshow/89005919.cms||---

Over the past four years, about 250 schoolchildren of Ahmedpur village in Dehgam have been collecting discarded kite strings which are then used as fillings for cushions. The kids begin their collection drive after Vasi Uttarayan, the second day of the Uttarayan festival. They gather the strings from roads, terraces, poles, and fences. Typically, a string pile of 60-80kg is brought to the school ground and the dangerous trash is bought by the school and parents for Rs 20 per kg. The pile is sent to a tailor’s shop in the village, where chair cushions are made with strings as fillings. The cushions are used by the school and also by the gram panchayat office. The initiative was launched four years ago by Hasmukh Patel, the principal of Ahmedpur Government Primary School. He was pained to see scores of birds suffering injuries after getting caught in these sharp kite strings for many days after Uttarayan. “I kept thinking about a solution. Four years ago, it struck me that I could ask the kids to collect the strings,” Patel said. “They are energetic and keep running around the village. So they might as well collect the strings.” The primary school of Ahmedpur has 250 students studying in Classes 1 to 8. The tiny village’s population is about 2,000. “I talked to the kids before Uttarayan about this idea. I did not know how they would respond,” Patel said. “I also told them that the biggest string collection will get a gift. A couple of days after Uttarayan, I saw students carrying extra bags.” He added: “They had collected strings from the entire village. I was astonished that the total collections weighed 80kg!” Patel said that after the manja menace was cleared from the village, he did not know what the next step should be. “So we piled up the strings and set them afire,” he said. “But later, some village residents pointed to the environmental hazard.” The next year, the kids again brought in about 80kg of kite strings, Patel said. “As an experiment I took some of it to the tailor’s shop and asked him to make a chair cushion for me,” he said. “The cushion he made was very comfortable to sit on!” The remaining pile of strings was also sent to the tailor and many cushions were made. Patel said that then the School Management Committee (SMC), composed of parents, took over this effort. “The next year, village members paid Rs 20 per kg to the kids and the pile was again converted into comfortable cushions,” Patel said. “I asked the president of the SMC about the source of the funds. I was told that village residents had donated!” Gulabsinh Zala, the president of the SMC, who runs a grocery shop in the village, said: “We thought that this initiative will die out gradually if the kids don’t get an incentive.” Zala added: “So my friends and I asked people to donate whatever they could. Some donated Rs 5, some Rs 10, and others Rs 200. Using this fund we bought strings from the kids.” Zala’s two daughters and one son study at the school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cutting-edge-recycling-kids-help-turn-manja-into-cushions/articleshow/89005920.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Residents of the area where 67 vendors were to be relocated are now up in arms against the civic body’s decision.SDMC had directed the hawkers to move from the Nehru Place complex to a place around a kilometre away at Aggarwal Dharamshala near Govindpuri Metro Station. A raised platform in front of the dharamshala has been identified as the location where the hawkers could carry out their business. “This place is overcrowded already and if such a huge number of hawkers come here, the residents will be fully inconvenienced,” said Khavinder Singh Captain, former councillor, who has written to the commissioner of SDMC on the matter. “This wrong decision has been taken without verifying the ground realities. The narrow road is already a traffic mess at peak hours. The area will become a living hell for Kalkaji residents and also create a law and order situation.” There are other concerns because there is a Jain temple, a government girls’ school and the Ram Sharnam temple in the vicinity. Pradeep Singhal, president, Akhil Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Parishad, said, “Many hawkers are sure to cook non-vegetarian food in front of the temple and dharamshala. This will hurt our religious sentiments. We oppose SDMC’s move. It must withdraw the order.” Keeping in mind such imperatives, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti held a meeting on Wednesday with the legal department and other senior zonal officials. According to sources, the meeting decided that the corporation should wait till the final hearing in the Supreme Court on the matter on January 20. “Yes, we have received a representation from residents who oppose the shifting of hawkers to that area. We are looking at all legal angles in the matter and everything will be considered after the court’s final hearing,” assured an SDMC official.

Tourism department deputy director Manikya said work on the ‘Welcome to Dakshina Kannada’QR code is ready, and is expected to be launched within a fortnight. The department is already in touch with the DK Taximen’s and Maxicab Association for the distribution of QR code stickers, that will be put up in every vehicle, for the convenience of tourists. QR code stickers are efficient to use, and cost-effective for the travel industry to implement. It allows the travel industry to lessen touchpoints in providing services to tourists and stakeholders, he said. District tourism consultant Chethan V said that the department has been working on the project for over three months. “In many hotels, menu cards have been replaced with QR codes, and when every sector is going digital, we decided to incorporate technology for the betterment of the tourism industry. A tourist these days does a lot of research over the internet, before visiting a destination. This technology will help tourists to get better details and more access to places around the district,” he said. “The department has with it all data regarding tourist places, as well as the necessary statistics. Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra has been the backbone of this project. When we discussed this idea with software experts in the National Informatics Centre, state unit, they agreed to take this project forward. The QR code is ready, and the stickers have been printed. We are finalising details on the official launch,” Chethan said. Once the tourist scans the QR code, details, including the tourism map of the district, information on each destination like temples, beaches, hill stations, waterfalls, connectivity details, culture, cuisine, flora & fauna and trekking locations will be available. There is scope for more technology-based updates in the future. Chethan said that once the QR code is scanned, the user can even view a teaser highlighting the significance of the district, that was released during World Tourism Day celebrations recently.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-all-set-to-showcase-its-tourist-spots-through-qr-code/articleshow/89003295.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Gandhinagar district has 1.38 crore trees of which 93.46% are timber trees and only 3.73% are fruit trees, the least in all the 33 districts of the state. Gir Somnath district has the most fruit trees and the lowest number of timber trees in the state. Surat has the most balanced distribution of fruit, timber, and other trees in the state. “Among the reasons Gandhinagar has few fruit trees are the type of soil and weather,” said a forest department official. “The weather in Gandhinagar is similar to those of semiarid regions and the soil type is conducive to timber trees such as Nilgiri and neem.” The official added: “The soil type and humidity in Gir Somnath are more favourable for fruit trees such as mango.” According to the survey data, Gir Somnath district has 91.93 lakh trees of which 77.46% are fruit trees and 8.97% of the total are timber trees. The remaining 13.56% are other species of trees such as Pipal, Peltoforum, and Asopalav. Surat is the only district with the most balanced distribution of tree species. Surat district has 1.64 crore trees of which 32.57% are timber trees while 32.76% are fruit trees such as mango, drumsticks, and Sitafal, and the remaining are other tree species. The state’s tree population in the total non-forested rural area of 1.54 crore hectares has increased to 39.75 crore trees, up 5.40 crore trees as compared to the 2017 survey figure of 34.35 crore trees. The number of trees has increased by 15.73% over the past five years. The last tree census was carried out in 2017. The official said that the department has now decided to encourage people to plant more fruit trees, if not more than timber trees then at least in equal numbers. “Timber trees are no doubt more valuable if we consider the carbon processing capability,” the official said. “But fruit trees are more beneficial in terms of their produce. Having a balance between the two types is advisable.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/timber-dominates-gnagar-treescape/articleshow/89005922.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

According to industry players, cumin production in Gujarat, the largest producer of the spice in the country, is likely to plummet by 30-40% this year. “Cumin is a weather-sensitive crop and a lot depends on climatic conditions over the next one month. Going by the current acreage figures, the production is likely to come down by 40%,” said an industry player, not willing to be named. “The yield, however, may improve if the weather remains conducive in days to come. This may narrow down the possible reduction in output to 30% for the season,” he added. According to the Spices Board of India’s advance estimate, Gujarat’s cumin production stood at 4.29 lakh tonnes in 2020-21. The area under cumin crop across Gujarat decreased 35% to 3.07 lakh hectares as of January 17, 2022 from 4.69 lakh hectares during the same period last year, shows data compiled by the state agriculture department. The cumin acreage has dwindled during the Rabi season with farmers turning to other crops, especially mustard and gram (chana), said market players. Mustard acreage moved up 59% to 3.4 lakh hectares from 2.14 lakh hectares and that of gram surged to 11 lakh hectares from 8.18 lakh hectares in the last Rabi season, according to the state government data. The prices of cumin for 20 kg in Unjha market yard touched a record high of Rs 11,111 on January 19. It, however, registered a low of Rs 2,800 as well, according to price quotes available on the website of Unjha Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).

Upset with little sale and piling inventory. toy makers in Ahmedabad have requested the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) that they be allowed to use the existing BIS-approved inventory of toys and sell it. Ahmedabad Toy Association (ATA) sought the intervention of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) in the matter on Wednesday. Effective January 1, 2021, the BIS had issued a notification terming non-BIS approved stocks of toys to be illegal. However, the toy traders had already procured a sizeable inventory till December 31, 2020. “Most toys are imported and the inventory which was procured till 2020 was cleared by BIS for sale. However, in the wake of the notification, the toy traders are not able to sell the inventory as it is termed illegal and many have ended up paying hefty fines to the tune of Rs 2 lakh following raids by BIS members,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, GCCI, explaining the issue.“In the wake of the pandemic, toy traders did not do good business and many lost their existing customers to their online counterparts. The association has now demanded GCCI’s intervention to represent their issues before the government. Traders want that they be allowed to sell the existing inventory without any hassles and therefore, the deadline for selling previously procured stocks be extended so that they don’t have to bear hefty penalties,” said Patwari.Representations previously sent by ATA to the BIS have evoked no response or action as yet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/toymakers-seek-deadline-extension/articleshow/89005927.cms||---

In a government order (GO), principal secretary (health and family welfare) Anil Kumar Singhal said the cost of Covid-19 testing kits and reagents has decreased due to increased availability of these consumables as well as competition among the manufacturing firms. The technical committee convened on January 4 recommended a revision of RT-PCR test rates. After careful examination of the matter, the state government revised the test price to 350. It was as high as 2,900 in June 2020 when the first five private labs got approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research for Covid-19 test through RT-PCR mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/rt-pcr-test-rate-slashed-to-350/articleshow/89005934.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Covid cases double every 2-3 days as virus spreads at alarming rate||VISAKHAPATNAM: The third wave of Covid-19, believed to be driven by the Omicron variant, is spreading at an unprecedented rate in Andhra Pradesh. Hardly three weeks into the surge, the case positivity rate has almost reached the peak levels of the second wave. While the peak daily case positivity rate during the second wave had touched the 26% mark, it already crossed the 24% mark during the ongoing third wave on Wednesday. It took almost three months during the second wave to reach its ascension, while it had happened in a more gradual fashion in the first wave in 2020. But the Omicron variant seems to have sparked a steep surge in the third wave. For instance, Visakhapatnam district recorded a scary 48.5% case positivity rate on Tuesday and 49.3% positivity rate on Wednesday, meaning that one in two are testing positive for the pandemic. At least 40 urban local bodies/rural mandals recorded over 20% weekly case positivity rate, including Renigunta (38.4%), Rajahmundry (38%), Tirupati (36%), Sullurpeta (35%), Puttur (32.8%) and Tadepalli (32%). The daily case positivity rate consistently remained under 1% in December 2021 with the average monthly positivity rate being limited to 0.5%. But just within three weeks from the presumed end of the second wave, the state is now posting skyrocketing daily positivity rates. From 0.3% daily case positivity rate on December 27, it jumped to 24% on Wednesday, implying a frightening 80-fold increase in the positivity rate in three weeks. As per the SBI’s research report released on Tuesday, rural areas of Andhra Pradesh are contributing to about 73% of the total daily caseload. As per the report, the national peak may come within the next two to three weeks. South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first reported, took only 22 days to reach its peak, while the USA reached its Omicron peak in 78 days. Even though it is difficult to determine a single factor behind the steep surge in the case numbers in Andhra Pradesh, experts attribute it to the high transmissibility and spread of Omicron variant, laxity among some people regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour, increased mobility and gatherings during the festival season, etc. The state officials anticipate that the cases may witness a dip as fast as it reaches the peak in the third wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/cases-double-every-2-3-days-as-virus-spreads-at-alarming-rate/articleshow/89005935.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Delhi||Low-cost meals for poor: SDMC revives project||New Delhi: Aiming to give a fresh impetus to Atal Aahar Yojna, which provides nutritious meals to the poor at subsidised rates, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) plans to open facilities at 40 sites. The decision comes ahead of the upcoming municipal elections scheduled in April this year. The initiative to offer a subsidised thali to the poor was part of the BJP manifesto before the 2017 civic polls. The scheme was launched by SDMC on December 25, 2017. However, the facilities opened in four places were discontinued in just six months over a dispute with vendors, as the locations were not considered ‘optimum’ and didn’t attract enough people. SDMC said it will finalise the sites after administrative approval from the commissioner. The civic body will not provide any land or space for these facilities, which would belong to the vendor/applicant. An amended proposal will be placed for approval in the next meeting of the standing committee on Friday. Lt Col (Retd) BK Oberoi, chairman, standing committee, had also made an announcement about the initiative in his budget proposals presented in the House on Tuesday. “As per Section 430 of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, it will be mandatory to get the approval from the commissioner or the empowered officer before finalising the site. Once the proposal is accepted, we will invite tenders for opening these outlets. People or self-help groups who have got shops and spaces will be allowed to run the facilities,” he said. “The applicant will need to submit details about the total area of the shop or land and its location. Officials can check the viability and ensure activity in that place does not cause traffic jams,” he added. As per norms, applicants will need to provide breakfast and lunch at subsidised rates, which have been fixed by SDMC, to the general public. “Breakfast and lunch will be offered at Rs 10 and Rs 15, respectively. However, to make sure that the person doesn’t face losses in running these outlets, he/she will be allowed to generate revenue by selling confectionery items for the rest of the day at market cost,” said the chairman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/low-cost-meals-for-poor-sdmc-revives-project/articleshow/89004619.cms||Vibha Sharma

The department also released a landline number (0651-7122712), Whatsapp/SMS (8797891222) for seeking farming related assistance.The department also launched a ‘blockchain technology’ interface to create transparency in seed distribution and distribution of other agriculture schemes. After Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand will be the second state to use blockchain technology in government works, officials said.State agriculture director Nisha Singhmar Oraon told TOI over the phone, “The USP of this call centre will be that operators can speak in multiple languages such as Santhali, Mundari, Oraon, etc, besides Hindi so that farmers calling from any part of the state can get proper assistance. Here, one can lodge their problems, or take any kind of agriculture related assistance. We have set a 15-day period for resolution of the problems. In case of failure, it will get escalated to a higher level.”On the blockchain technology, she said it will initially be used in seed procurement and distribution but they will gradually expand it for other activities. She said the department has come up with a website for blockchain technology and they are planning to train grassroots workers and other stakeholders on how to use it.She said, “Last year, we rolled out a token system for farmers based on their unique ID for distribution of seeds to curb forgery or duplicity. Now, all those token IDs will be fed into the website. In case of enrolment of new farmers, new token ID will be created and registered on the website. Based on the allocation of seed to a particular farmer as per his/her requirement, we can track the entire detail of the distribution through the website.”Farmers too can equally track their consignment. “For example, when one orders anything from e-commerce sites, they can track the status of consignment. Our system too will work in the same manner. Another USP of this technology will be that if any lot of seeds fails in any district, we can track the whole chain of its distribution and recall them back,” she said, adding that the main aim behind its introduction is to create transparency in the procurement and distribution process. “Jharkhand will be the second state after Andhra Pradesh to use blockchain technology in government works,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/multi-language-call-centre-to-address-farmers-woes/articleshow/89005948.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Medical representatives from state join nationwide strike||Ranchi: Thousands of medical, sales representatives of Jharkhand joined the nationwide strike on Wednesday, demanding implementation of Sales Promotion Employees Act, waiver of GST on medicines and stoppage of online sale of medicines. More than 8,000 sales promotion employees abstained from work in support of the 16-point demand at the call of Federation of Medical and Sales Representatives Association of India (FMRAI). Anirban Bose, president of Bihar Jharkhand Sales Representatives' Union, said their main demands include abolishing GST on medicines and essential medical equipment by the central government, recalling of the amendments made in the labour laws and deletion of all four labour codes besides continuation of the Sales Promotion Employees Act of 1976.While talking to TOI, Bose underlined the need for extending insurance benefits to medical staff as they are the frontline workers who are dealing with patients regularly. “We are totally vulnerable. During the pandemic, more than 1,000 medical representatives lost their lives across the country. But none of their kin have received any sort of compensation. Although the companies earned profit by exploiting the situation and black-marketing, they are consistently showing their inhumane behaviour towards the employees.”In the state, there are around 8,000 union members spread across 10 district units and two sub-units — Gumla and Ramgarh — which are under the Ranchi district unit of the union. They all campaigned for the demands through mass meetings and picketing at the workplaces. Bose said the trend of online medicine is a big concern. “Big parties like Ambani and Tata are making forays. Many people can get their medicines via these online platforms. However, it will still be a challenge to reach out to the rural belts. It will also impact the livelihoods of many who are working in the pharmaceutical shops. Therefore, it is important to curb the online sales of drugs,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/medical-representatives-from-state-join-nationwide-strike/articleshow/89005952.cms||---

In a letter to the CM on Wednesday, PSCWA (state) president Alok Dubey cited World Bank’s education director Jaime Saavedra’s remark who allegedly said that there’s no evidence to suggest that reopening of schools has led to the virus spread.Dubey said that the private schools have remained closed for the past 22 months owing to the pandemic and resultantly, kids’ education has been adversely affected. He added that though several schools are conducting online classes, the learning process has been hampered as many do not have access to a proper and high-speed internet connection and many students do not even have smartphones.Dubey further said, “Due to the financial hardships experienced during Covid by many, a number of private schools have shut down while others are on the brink of closure. Under such circumstances, the state government should take a step to protect the livelihood of a large number of teaching and non-teaching employees of thousands of private schools.”He said that private schools would cooperate with the government in making the vaccination drive for teenagers a success. “If children take the jab in schools, then parent will also follow suit,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/childrens-welfare-association-demands-reopening-of-schools/articleshow/89005957.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Tribals prefer kerosene to grid power: Study||Ranchi: If energy consumption patterns are any indicator of development, the tribal households in Jharkhand have been worst impacted during the Covid-induced lockdown and job losses. According to a study conducted by the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), John Hopkins University titled “Energy in Rural Jharkhand” carried out under the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP), it was noticed that despite increase in penetration of grid electricity, the number of tribal households depending on grid power reduced from 87% to 74% whereas those depending upon kerosene, as primary source of lighting, increased from 11% to 21% in the state.The study across ISEP surveyed a total of 1,440 rural households in all 24 districts of Jharkhand between July and August 2019. Further, a follow-up round was conducted in July 2021. The report prepared thereafter attempts to study the progress — or lack thereof — on energy access parameters in the state over the course of two years, and in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. In each district, the team randomly sampled six villages, with larger villages having a higher probability of being selected. Within each village, 10 households were selected on a random basis for responding to the questionnaire.The findings of the study were released on Wednesday after conducting a webinar titled “Energy access in rural Jharkhand”. Release of the report marked the conclusion of two-yearlong research initiative aimed at suggesting policy measures for access to cleaner, affordable and sustainable energy to the masses.The survey found that 87% of households have access to electricity (from grid, micro-grid or solar home systems). However, 24% preferred to use kerosene as their primary lighting fuel. Further, about 34% of the respondents were dissatisfied with grid electricity. One of the main reasons for these responses was unreliable and poor-quality electricity supply — the average household only had access to about 10 hours of service per day, thus forcing them to rely on alternative energy sources.The report points out access to electricity for tribals increased from 82% to 86%. Of them, 80% of tribal households use the grid for lighting. “Among electrified tribal households with grid access, the proportion using the grid as their primary source of lighting went down from 87% to 74%, while those using kerosene went up from 11% to 21%. Of all the households that used kerosene lamps as their primary lighting source, the proportion belonging to the Scheduled Tribes community went up from 32% to 47%,” the report highlighted.Proportion of tribal households with LPG access went up from 40% to 43%, and those who use firewood and chips as primary fuel went down from 89% to 85%. But in terms of using the cleaner fuel, a downhill trend was observed.“Decreased satisfaction with LPG, with the main barriers to access being cost of connection and refill. Cost was still the main reason for dissatisfaction, followed by the distance to travel to obtain a refill. Despite interest to get LPG, cost of connection and the monthly expense of LPG refills discouraged people from relying on it,” the report pointed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/tribals-prefer-kerosene-to-grid-power-study/articleshow/89005958.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

On Wednesday, pictures went around on social media, showing ‘this house is for sale’ scribbled on the walls of homes in Surana. The home minister asked the administration to sort out the issue and file a report. At Wednesday’s choupal, villagers accused sections of both communities of involvement in illegal activities, encroaching government land, creating nuisance and making false police complaints just to show their dominance and forcing the others to leave the village. A section of Muslims said their complaints are not entertained by authorities while criminals are allowed to move around freely.

---||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation to collect and dispose of scrap||NEW DELHI: After an encouraging response to its schemes for collection of plastic and electronic waste from households and industrial areas, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has finalised a private contractor for collection, transportation and safe disposal of scrap, including discarded metal, old vehicles and iron items. A public notice has been uploaded on the EDMC website informing people about the initiative. Details of rates for different materials, contact numbers and time taken for collecting items will be provided within a week once the final agreement is signed, said an official. The agency has also been assigned the task of integrating the unorganised sector in this chain. “Many unorganised sectors and industries generate huge volumes of scrap but are still not under the ambit of any regulations for scientific disposal of the material. Therefore, it is essential to create a system for chain management and integrate various stakeholders. Now that we have appointed a contractor, the next step is to engage the scrap collectors in the process so that no material is treated in an unscientific manner,” said a senior official. TIMES VIEWDisposal of scrap is a problem in most homes. Getting it collected in an organised manner is an environmentfriendly move, which will also benefit the public.To begin with, one contractor fulfilling all the norms has been finalised but others will be added in the list eventually. The initiative is aimed at motivating residents and owners in commercial areas to contribute to EDMC’s effort to recycle waste in an environment-friendly manner, rather than selling it to local scrap dealers, the official said. “Besides collecting scrap from residential, commercial, institutional and industrial areas under EDMC in a time-bound manner, the concessionaire will also ensure its recycling and disposal as per the waste management rules,” the official added. The empanelled agencies are allowed to operate for a period of three years after paying a fixed monthly royalty to the civic body. “They will be responsible for developing collection centres and engaging vehicles for transportation. EDMC will act as a facilitator,” said the official. The demand for non-renewable natural resources like metal and minerals is growing across sectors, making it imperative to reuse and recycle them, according to the civic body. “We are, therefore, adopting initiatives that focus on reduced wastage and scrap management in compliance with rules and bylaws,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/door-to-door-east-corpn-to-collect-dispose-of-scrap/articleshow/89004641.cms||Vibha Sharma

Just put discipline in place, put it in the minds of the government staff that it will not be tolerated. Why should it take six months or one year,” he said. Palekar caught Kejriwal’s attention when he joined a hunger strike demanding the demolition of an illegal bungalow being constructed within the Old Goa Unesco heritage zone. After ending his five-day hunger strike, he was lauded by Kejriwal and projected by AAP as its Santa Cruz candidate for the February 14 assembly election.

Several pro-Hindutva organisations are speaking of ‘taking over’ the mosque as the claim that it was previously a Sri Hanuman mandir grows louder.Pro-Hindutva organisations claim that the mosque was earlier a Sri Hanuman mandir and erstwhile ruler Tippu Sultan built a masjid upon it. To support their claims, they say that the structure still has ample evidences in the form of inscription of Hindu Gods on the pillars and walls of the masjid. “The Jamia masjid has Hindu inscriptions on its pillars and walls. So it could not have been a masjid and it was built upon Sri Hanuman temple. The inscription of snake and other inscriptions could still be seen on pillars and walls,” Hindutva activists claimed.Noted historian Professor Karimuddin from Srirangapatna said Tippu had built the masjid for both militaristic and religious purposes. “It is true that the Jamia Masjid was earlier Sri Hanuman mandir. The place where the mandir stood was at a higher elevation from where the movements of enemy armies could easily be spotted, Tippu, with the consent of Hindu dewans and senior officers of his government, shifted the mandir and built a masjid,” he said. “As to why Tippu shifted the mandir and built the masjid could easily be understood from the fact that masjid has two tall minarets, which were being used as watchtowers by the army to spot the enemies,” he said.However, the Hindutva activists claimed that by force, Tippu had built the masjid over Hanuman mandir and it shows Tippu was a fanatic and intolerant towards the Hindu religion. “The Muslim clerics usually denounced the masjids if they were built on the sites of other communities or had inscriptions of other religions. When it is a known fact, we cannot fathom how Tippu could have decided to build a masjid at the site of Hindus as his decision was contradicting what Islam preaches. Tippu’s deed was nothing but a vengeful act and we have to take over the masjid and build a grand Hanuman mandir there,” said a Hindu activist. Historical factsTippu Sultan is said to have built the Srirangapatna Jamia Masjid in 1782 as a Persian inscription inside the masjid claims he (Tippu) was the builder of it. Two minarets were claimed to have been used as watchtowers in his reign. A madrasa is now being run at the masjid and it is being maintained by Archeological Survey of India (ASI).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/srirangapatna-jamia-masjid-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-yet-again/articleshow/89006010.cms||---

Soyabean meal exports have fallen sharply in this new oil year due to high prices in the international market. According to data compiled by SOPA, exports of soyabean meal in the new oil year from October to December 2022 stood at 3.81 lakh ton as against 6.89 lakh ton in the same period a year ago. Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) said that the government should consider allowing subsidized inland freight or transport subsidies to help exporters compete for export of soy products in the international markets.Davish Jain, chairman, SOPA said, “We have prepared a document to be submitted to the policy makers for taking cognisance of the various aspects of the ecosystem around soyabean.” Jain said soy processors were subjected to pressure of the increased input costs and government pressure to maintain price. In its recommendation SOPA suggested that imports of soybean oil or soyabean meal should be restricted only to actual users with conditions to keep a check on undue speculative activities. The processors body said the finished product which is edible oil should be imported at a high tariff so as to balance demand and supply.

The BJP MP exhorted the Bsavaraj Bommai-led government to explore other options to check the spread of Covid-19 infection.Pointing out that nearly 99% of the eligible populace in the state had already received one dose of the vaccine, while 80% had been administered both doses, Simha said, “Healthcare workers, Covid warriors and the elderly are even being given the booster dose. These are the steps that need to be taken to arrest the Covid curve. When we have successfully vaccinated most of the people, and the state boasts good healthcare infrastructure, what is the need to impose a curfew or lockdown?”Reiterating his support for those who have been demanding relaxation of restrictions, Simha said that the government must turn its focus towards protecting people’s livelihood. “The Election Commission has decided to hold polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, which is the most populous in our country. The EC’s decision not to ban rallies is an indication that life must go on. The Karnataka CM must take note of these developments, and do away with restrictions,” said Simha, pointing to the need to lend a hand to the beleaguered business community, which had suffered a severe setback owing to the lockdown.

Congress has decided to approach the high court and seek a probe into the case by a special investigation team. “Please refer to your (Amonkar) petition, regarding offences of sexual exploitation and other offences committed by Naik. The detailed enquiry was conducted by SDPO, Vasco, wherein the victim (name withheld) has given a written application rebutting the contents of your complaint and as such no cognizable offense is made out,” women police station police inspector stated in a letter to Amonkar. Congress media cell chairman Amarnath Panjikar alleged that the chief minister was behind the closing of the case so that he can give Naik a ticket. “We want to know who all were called for the inquiry. Did you call the complainant? Amonkar submitted a complaint with proof and now it is closed. We are surprised,” Panjikar said. He alleged that the government pressured the survivor to refuse the allegation made by Amonkar. After Congress exposed the alleged sex scandal, the survivor had filed an FIR against Amonkar at a police station in Bihar, which was transferred to the Mormugao police station and later to the crime branch.

They are among the more dominant teams on the continent and, along with China, have made it to the semifinals for the last 14 editions. For most, that should be a good enough achievement. Not Japan, who have won the last two titles (2014, 2018) and are now hunting for a hat-trick in India. Japan kickstart their title defence in group C – the toughest -- against Myanmar at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune on Friday. “The aim is to win this competition three times in a row, but we should take this match by match. Only then can we fight our way to the top,” Japan captain Saki Kumagai told reporters during the pre-match media briefing on Thursday. The defending champions will have to do without star player Mana Iwabuchi, who tested positive for Covid-19 after reaching Mumbai from England. The Arsenal midfielder will be in isolation for seven days and return to the squad after she tests negative. Japan, though, will still be heavy favourites to score a comfortable win against Myanmar, whose preparations for this tournament were hampered by Covid-19 “Most of our players are still very young, and I hope they’ll give their best performance in this tournament. This is a tough group,” said Myanmar coach Tin Myint Aung. The group also has South Korea, who will commence their campaign against Vietnam on Friday. Despite not having won the Asian Cup, Korea are one of the strongest competitors and could give anyone a run for their reputation. “We believe that we have a strong team, but we need to produce our best performance in every phase of the game. That’s what we’ve been working on over the two years I’ve been in Korea Republic,” said coach Colin Bell The top two teams from each group, along with two best third-placed sides from the three groups, will progress to the quarterfinals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/asian-cup-2022-japan-begin-quest-for-hat-trick-of-titles/articleshow/89025941.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Notably, Chaprauli was the only seat that the RLD had managed to win in the 2017 UP polls. The move has rekindled the hope of party cadre and leaders who had been sulking after 8 "winnable" seats were given to SP candidates on RLD symbol, though Rathi is an RLD leader and ex-MLA from Chaprauli itself, and not an SP leader. The new candidate, Ajay Kumar, had won the 2002 elections by a margin of 64,000 votes. According to sources in Baghpat, there was a strong protest against Rathi's candidature owing to intense infighting in the RLD stronghold, with a majority of Jat community not wanting him as a candidate. Reacting to the development, a senior RLD leader who did not wish to be quoted said, "Change of the candidate is a positive signal and raises hopes of party leaders who feel sidelined due to denial of tickets. Jayantji must talk to Akhilesh Yadav and boost the morale of the force he leads." The RLD is in a pre-poll alliance with SP in UP. Hours after the announcement of alliance candidates for the two constituencies of Meerut, an agitation broke out against the party (RLD) on Tuesday. Angry workers even “burnt” the RLD flag in Siwalkhas constituency. The two candidates - Ghulam Mohammad and Manisha Ahlawat -- were actually SP leaders given tickets on RLD symbol. According to RLD leaders, at least 8 seats across west UP have SP candidates on RLD symbol. "In Muzaffarnagar alone, out of five seats given to RLD in alliance, four have SP candidates fighting on RLD symbol which infuriated the RLD cadre,” said an RLD leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/after-massive-protest-rld-changes-chaprauli-candidate/articleshow/89004135.cms||Sandeep Rai

Though the fire was small and was doused quickly, smoke engulfed the building making it difficult for people to breathe. The fire department got a call about the fire around 3am. Two fire tenders were rushed to the location and it was found that fire had broken out in seven electrical meter boards. The building, consisting of ground and three other floors, was completely engulfed in smoke. “While the fire was quickly doused, the smoke spread rapidly. The only exit was the staircase, which was filled with smoke. Since people had just woken up, they didn’t know how to escape. In such situations, we prefer to evacuate them as they can inhale carbon monoxide and get suffocated,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service (DFS). Two rescue teams were formed. While one team quickly reached the top floor to open the terrace door for ventilation, the other knocked on the doors of flats to wake up people. The residents of the first floor were rescued after putting a ladder, while the others were brought down through the staircase with the help of firefighters. Meanwhile, several firefighters have tested positive for Covid-19 during the third wave. DFS data revealed that from January 1 to 10, firefighters attended to more than 600 calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/22-rescued-from-four-storey-bldg-after-fire/articleshow/89004646.cms||---

The ambulance was ferrying a pregnant woman from Tharadhale to the Government Hospital in Nanjangud, as the woman was suffering from labour pain. The ambulance driver tried to drive over the heap of millet straw, which was spread on the road, causing hay to get stuck to the wheels and the axle of the vehicle, preventing the ambulance from moving further.The villagers who were using the road, immediately rushed to clear the hay from the wheels of the ambulance, and it took them nearly an hour as the wheels had gotten entangled in the hay. The driver rushed the woman to the hospital after that.

The Raman Singh government, which ruled the state for 15 years, executed the capital project and developed large-scale infrastructure to make it a well-planned city for the future. NRDA manages the affairs of the capital project.“This is the Congress party’s Chhattisgarh model, which is going down,” tweeted BJP vice-president and former CM Raman Singh, sharing a copy of the public notice issued by UBI. “Now the bank is taking over government property for default of loan,: he said, adding that “everything will get mortgaged because of this government’s habit of spending lavishly by availing loans”. Opposition leaders pointed out that the state government is already deep in debt as it has availed loans of more than Rs 51,000 crore between December 2018 and October 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/bank-takes-over-nrdas-nava-raipur-property-after-loan-default/articleshow/89006030.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘New’ Chandni Chowk Enters Its Second Leg||New Delhi: Delhi government’s Public Works Department has initiated the second phase of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project with the building and maintenance agency hiring a private consultancy firm to survey the areas around Jama Masjid for revamping. “We hope to send a proposal on the estimated cost of reconstruction and other details for approval by the government by early February,” said a PWD official overseeing the redevelopment project. The plan is to redevelop and beautify six other roads in the area, including Netaji Subhash Marg from Delhi Gate to Kashmere Gate, in the same manner as the main thoroughfare at Chandni Chowk. The consultancy firm has been given nine months to complete the survey of the area, during which the surveyors will inform the department of the buildings and structures there, encroachments, bus shelters, public amenities and other such aspects that will have to be considered in the redevelopment plan. The 1.3km main road of Chandni Chowk having been fully revamped and opened to the public, the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation is now paying attention to the second phase of the historic city quarter’s renewal. This heritage market and residential area, redolent of the old culture of Delhi, was until a few years ago on the brink of collapse due to poor maintenance, forcing PWD and the civic authorities to plan the beautification of the area. In the second phase, the façades of the buildings around Jama Masjid are to be restore and better amenities will be installed for pedestrians on Netaji Subhash Marg. There will be a non-motorised vehicle zone on the road and new signboards and bollards will be put up at various points. The segment chosen for revamp and beautification starts from Netaji Subhash Marg near Red Fort and then goes from Old Delhi Railway Station to Church Mission Road. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is also constructing its mega multi-level parking facility at Dangal Maidan, and this is expected to help reduce congestion on this section. There are very few bus stops on this stretch, which is another aspect that PWD will be addressing along with the transport department. The redeveloped segment from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid has been paved with red sandstone and granite. At regular intervals benches and plants have been placed for visitors. CCTV cameras have also been installed for security and monitoring. Similar work will be carried out in the second phase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-chandni-chowk-enters-its-second-leg/articleshow/89004647.cms||---

In a purported video that went viral, Masood can be heard saying that his people (the residents of Saharanpur) had made him touch the feet of “these people” (from SP) and "the day all of you come together, everyone will touch my feet.” “I was treated very badly and humiliated,” he added in the clip. While there is no confirmation from the BSP about Masood, rumours are abuzz in Saharanpur and the region that the ex-Congress member and his kin are set to join the BSP to contest polls. “I will let you know,” Masood told TOI on Wednesday when queried about the issue.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation to link Mansarovar with 200-ft Bypass on Ajmer Road||JAIPUR: To bridge the metro connectivity between Ajmer Road and Mansarovar, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has prepared a proposal to construct a 2-km elevated stretch by spending approximately Rs 400 crore. The project’s Phase 1 (D) (extension of Phase-1-Mansarovar to Ajmer Road) is said to be economically viable as the JMRC will not have to upgrade infrastructure and its existing rolling stock and depot can be utilised. The proposal mentioned, "It will provide connectivity to commuters from Ajmer Road, Vaishali Nagar, and nearby localities. The location also has potential as majority of buses coming from Ajmer, Udaipur, Bhilwara, Delhi, Ahmedabad stops here and it will act as an interchange point for passengers." The proposal was tabled in the meeting last year, which was chaired by the urban housing and development (UDH) minister. "The minister was apprised of a probably proposed extension of Phase -1 from Mansarovar. He agreed to the same and instructed the corporation to go ahead. He also desired that at the new stations, the possibility of parking should be explored," said a JMRC official. Under the extension project, the JMRC has proposed to construct only one station on Ajmer Road. The projection of traffic can be assessed after the preparation of the Detailed Project Report (DPR). "For the preparation of the DPR, the state government has been requested to allocate Rs 40 lakh in the 2022- 2023 budget," said an official. The extension of the Jaipur Metro network is the slowest in the country. The project will become viable if extensions happen at regular intervals and the city is linked with the metro. "To improve the ridership, the JMRC has to improve its network and work on providing last-mile connectivity. The traffic is expected to reduce drastically when both the corridors Ambabari to Sitapura and Ajmer Road to Transport Nagar are constructed," said a retired DMRC official. When the project was conceived, the JMRC had claimed that the ridership will reach 1 lakh in 2020 and 1.25 lakh after the underground (Chandpole to Badi Chaupar) corridor was opened. But so far, it has failed to achieve the desired results. An official said, "The Metro is facing operational losses of approximately Rs 40 crore per annum. A policy has to be devised to promote the greener mode of transport."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jmrc-to-link-mansarovar-with-200-ft-bypass-on-ajmer-road/articleshow/89006043.cms||---

The notification for the same was issued on January 18 and now the North Western Railway’s Jodhpur division railway station will be called Mahesh Nagar station. Apparently, the villagers had been seeking this name change since Independence claiming that the original name was Mahesh Ro Bado and Miyan Ka Bara made it appear as a Muslim village because of which they were having trouble in arranging nuptials. The renamed village is located in Siwana tehsil of Barmer and has a population of approximately 400 people. Former sarpanch Hanwant Singh said, “Since the year 1656, our village was called Mahesh Ro Bado but over the course of decades, the name changed to Miyan Ka Bara. When I became the sarpanch in 2010, I decided that I would get the name back to its original form. While we managed to get the name change done on June 1, 2018, the railway station was still being called by the old name. We started the process again and sent the required documents to the authorities and finally the notification was issued. We are very happy that now both the village and the railway station will have the same name.” “The village and the railway station can have different names but we wanted that they should be same to avoid any confusion. As the notification has been issued only recently, very soon the board will also be replaced at the station”, added Singh. The notification’s copy has also been sent to the state government along with other stakeholders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/renamed-village-in-barmer-gets-railway-station-rechristened/articleshow/89006049.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tin cans turn pigeon homes in Bundi||KOTA: An initiative to protect pigeons from preying cats and dogs that started almost two decades back has now turned into a mission for the entire village of Sankarda in Bundi district. Currently, over 500 pigeons safely shelter in around 300 bird houses created by converting 15 kg edible oil tin casks into safe dwellings, which are lined up in festoonery near the village Bawari (step well). “The initiative, which started with just 60 such bird houses has now become a huge success and marks a unique identity for the village. Initially, the pigeons hesitated to dwell into these new homes but after some time they got accustomed to living in them,” said Urmila Kushwah, an ASHA worker, serving in the village since 2006. Located around 12 km from Bundi, in Kalpuria Panchyat, Sankarda has a population of around 850 people in 150-160 houses. It now, frequently attracts a large number of visitors from nearby areas and conveys them an effective message on bird and environment conservation. Three villagers, Ramswroop Gurjar (65), late Dayaram Saini and Prabhuji Kushwah along with a few other villagers in 2003, decided to shelter and protect the pigeons, housing in the village bawri, who were frequently falling prey to cats and dogs of the area. The villagers, who used to frequently meet at the bawri, were disturbed with the plight of the birds. Soon, Ramswroop along with his friends collected the used tin casks from houses and turned them into pigeon shelter by cutting three rectangular faces of one of the four walls of the tin cask. They then folded the fourth rectangular face into a shade to protect the bird from sun and rain. They then made a festoon (bandarwal) of around 60-70 tin pigeon houses and hung it around the village Bawari. Families from every household of the village regularly feed these pigeons near the Bawari or on the rooftop of their respective houses, said Rajesh Saini (35), who was part of the group with Ramswroop and late Dayaram, who initiated the conservation efforts. Entire work is done through mutual contribution and efforts. No villager sells out the used oil tin casks and instead, donates it for the pigeons’ home. Also, the oil tin casks, left empty from any community feasts or any celebration at any home, are used for the same purpose, she further said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tin-cans-turn-pigeon-homes-in-bundi/articleshow/89006053.cms||---

Addressing a cabinet meeting, Gehlot said, “It has come to my notice that children from two years are getting vaccinated in several countries around the world. Already, children in our country are facing nutrition-related problems. The central government should soon take a decision on vaccinating kids in the 12-14 age group without further delay.” During the meeting, ministers’ concern was raised on the precaution dose being given only to 60+ age group with comorbidities as a similar condition could occur to anyone in any age group.  “Booster dose should be allowed for all age groups. Also, time period for precaution dose should be reduced from the current nine months to three or six months,” reads the statement. Health minister Parsadi Lal Meena informed that the state was prepared to handle the third wave. “In all, 94.4% people in the age group of 18 years + have been administered the first dose across the state while 78% have been given the second shot. The performance of the state is much better than the national average. The vaccination in the age group of 15-17 age group has crossed 56.5%,” said Meena. The council of ministers expressed concern over the rising positivity rate in the country. “In just a week, the positivity rate has jumped from 7.61% to 15.52%. It is important for the people to follow Covid protocol to control the situation,” said the official statement.

---||Delhi||Wife’s consent in focus in marital rape hearing||New Delhi: The issue of wife’s consent gained centrality before Delhi High Court on Wednesday during the hearing on a batch of petitions seeking to punish sex imposed by a husband as rape. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who is hearing the matter with Justice C Hari Shankar, remarked that there was an “anomaly” in the earlier IPC Section 377 (carnal intercourse against the order of nature) and the rape law provison under Section 375 that currently protected husbands. The judge pointed out that even if the wife consented, the law punished husband for anal sex under the decriminalised Section 377, but if he forced himself on wife for sex without consent, it won’t attract conventional rape charge. “Before decriminalisation of Section 377 (punishment for unnatural sex) — and I am talking about heterosexual couples, wasn’t there misalignment in Section 375 and Section 377? It is ironic that it continued in happy marriages and no one complained. If there is consent, that is not rape. But in Section 377, prior to the Supreme Court judgment, that anomaly remained,” he said. On the court’s observation, amicus curiae and senior advocate Rebecca John said consensual anal sex no longer attracted penal provisions. She also highlighted that Section 375 was the only provision in the IPC that talked about consent of the woman. “This is the only provision that invites penal consequences if a woman doesn’t consent. In the case of the IPC section on adultery struck down by the Supreme Court, it spoke of husband’s consent, but only Section 375 talks of woman’s consent, which shows that consent is implicit even in the ‘exception’ carved out for husbands,” John contended. She maintained that the wife’s consent was “an underlying condition” in the protection granted to husbands under Section 2 of IPC 375. John also submitted that there were two exceptions to Section 375 — for medical procedures or interventions in a woman’s body and for marital sex. In the first exception, a woman’s consent is necessary for a doctor/gynaecologist to carry out a procedure, and the same is also implicit in the case of marital sex, she contended. Under the exception given in IPC 375, sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years, is not rape. The bench is hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/wifes-consent-in-focus-in-marital-rape-hearing/articleshow/89004674.cms||Abhinav Garg

ADR has also requested the CEO to ensure that the Supreme Court is informed about non-compliance by political parties and their candidates. In 2020, the Supreme Court ordered political parties to publish the entire criminal history of their candidates for assembly and Lok Sabha elections, along with the reasons that prompted them to field candidates with criminal records over clean individuals. “I am sure your office is seized of the matter and we are confident that the parties and the candidates will comply with the necessary requirements,” said state coordinator for ADR, Bhasker Assoldekar. The Supreme Court’s directions say that the criminal antecedents of a candidate should be detailed and include the nature of their offences, charges framed against them, the court concerned, case number and status of the case. The apex court has also put the onus on political parties, asking them to explain the “merit” behind the selection of a candidate accused of a crime. TOI had reported a few days earlier that the number of MLAs with serious criminal cases against them more than doubled since 2007. Data released by the ADR shows that 11 of the 40 MLAs elected in 2017 have criminal cases registered against them. Of these, nine MLAs have serious cases registered against them, including crimes against women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/electoral-officer-told-to-publish-aspirants-criminal-records/articleshow/89004681.cms||---

Considering their vulnerability, the health department has issued directions to officials to closely monitor the health of comorbid elders visiting hospitals for treatment. Health experts have advised them to remain at home and maintain social distance with other family members, especially those who go out regularly for work. “The immunity of the elderly is compromised due to diseases such as coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension and other diseases of vital organs. Also, some of them are yet not vaccinated. In such cases, if they suffer bilateral pneumonia or viral pneumonia, it may complicate the case. Not only the elder people, even the young ones should get fully vaccinated. We received a 45-year-old patient with 22 HRCT score. He was vaccinated with only a single dose,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS hospital. Since the onset of the surge in Covid cases, many deaths in the 60+ age group have been witnessed. In the current scenario, not just the elder people, even their family members, should be extra cautious in preventing the spread of the virus. Dr Praveen Kanojiya, senior consultant, Internal Medicine, at a private hospital, said, “The elderly and high-risk population should take the booster dose as. During the second wave, a lot of middle age and the younger generation were also severely affected. Elder people with comorbid conditions and the unvaccinated population are more prone to have a severe form of Covid illness. So they should continue taking their medicines regularly.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/experts-ask-elders-with-comorbidities-to-be-indoors/articleshow/89006060.cms||---

The luxury train had to cancel all its journeys since the pandemic broke out in 2020. Speaking to TOI, state tourism minister Vishvendra Singh said there is no clarity as of now when foreign tourist movement would start. “Nobody knows when foreign tourists will travel for leisure again. Palace On Wheel (POW) depended fully on them. That’s why if we wait for the foreign tourist movement to start, the running of the luxury train will not be possible in foreseeable future. That’s why we are shifting the strategy,” said Singh. The minister said the train should not remain stranded just because the foreign tourists are not coming. “We have to open the train and its royal rides for domestic tourists as well. That’s why the whole strategy has to be recalibrated and only a professional agency can do it effectively and efficiently.” He said foreigners pay in dollars, pound and Euro for journeys in the train but such charges are not affordable for domestic tourists. “We have to reduce the ticket prices so that the POW attracts domestic tourists.” The minister said since the train has remained in disuse for close to two years, it needs a thorough refurbishment. “The look, furniture, inside ambience and several other aspects have to be refurbished,” added Singh. The department is hopeful of running the train for domestic tourists from September onwards. However, the itinerary may change keeping in view the requirements of domestic tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/palace-on-wheels-to-woo-domestic-tourists-says-min/articleshow/89006062.cms||---

But that curtains would fall so abruptly on 30-year-old Tanya, is something that would shake even the staunchest of hearts. Trapped inside the ill-fated bus on Tuesday at Hira Baug in Varachha, the bizarre inferno burned her into ashes, leaving her husband Vishal Navlani (32) with not just physical injuries, but burns that has singed his soul too. According to eyewitnesses and the police, they were the last people trapped inside the burning bus. While Vishal somehow managed to jump out, Tanya was left desperately seeking help for rescue from the windows — all in vain. Even as local people tried to break windows and pull out the woman, they failed to reach Tanya as she was at a height on the upper seat in the heavily burning bus. And all that was left of her within minutes was that of her two hands still seeking help — a scene that will remain to haunt those who witnessed the nightmare on the streets that night. Vishal runs a garment shop in Bhavnagar and after their vacation was returning home. On Tuesday, the couple landed in Surat airport and caught a bus home from Baroda Prestige after having their food in a restaurant in the Vesu area. Inside the bus, along with other passengers, they too felt the heat and were only trying to understand the issue when they saw fire flames at the back of the vehicle. Within minutes, Duo got trapped in the flames, even as around 10 passengers and the driver managed to save themselves. Vishal tried to save Tanya but had to jump out of the window when the flames raged on. People who gathered around tried to break all the window glasses to rescue her, but Tanya could not jump out from the window. Meanwhile, Surat Fire and Emergency Services (SFES) teams reached the spot and controlled the fire. Later, Vishal who was admitted to the local hospital was shifted to Bhavnagar hospital by his family members. “Forensic Science Laboratory collected samples from the bus and its findings will reveal the exact cause of the fire. Highly combustible material like foam was used in the seat and plywood for the partition due to which the fire spread immediately,” said a police officer, adding that a case of accidental death has been registered in Kapodra police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/trapped-in-fire-their-first-anniv-turned-into-her-last/articleshow/89006065.cms||---

---||Surat||Black magician rapes, blackmails married devotee||SURAT: A 42-year-old woman lodged a complaint of rape against a black magician (tantrik) with the Sarthana police station on Tuesday. Police have filed an offence of rape and are investigating the matter. According to the police, the woman who lives in the Sarthana area with her husband and two kids told the police that she came in touch with the self-styled guru Manji alias Mansukh Mandani, a resident of Vishalnagar society in Sarthana and also a distant relative of hers, around five years ago. He started frequenting her place and she began to admire him. Later, in the name of rituals, he called her over to his place and began to have a physical relationship with her. He also clicked their intimate pictures and used these to blackmail her for more sexual assaults. Finally, the woman gathered courage and approached the police to file her complaint. During one of his visits, the accused told the woman that he has some special powers and solves people’s problems. Believing in his talks, the woman whose husband works as a land broker in the city, accepted Mandani as her guru and they developed a good relationship, she said. In 2016, Mandani told them that their house is surrounded by some evil powers which are obstructing their growth, and following his advice, the couple even changed their house. After this episode, the woman started believing in him totally and followed all his advice. In February 2020, Mandani told her that he has to perform some religious ritual for her husband and children, who otherwise will face serious troubles in their lives or may even become mentally ill. Hearing this, the woman gave consent for the ritual and reached Mandani’s house as directed. During the ritual, Mandani started removing her clothes, and when she protested, he threatened to kill her husband and children and then raped her and also clicked obscene pictures. Later, he would use these to blackmail her for rape and she could not confide in any one out of fear for their lives. On Tuesday, she could not bear it anymore and confided about her ordeal to her husband who helped her file a police complaint against him.

The Salabatpura and Puna police stations had started an investigation after receiving several complaints of such cheating by textile traders over the last few months. Puna police arrested Sandip Sharma (35), a resident of Pramukh Aranya apartment in Gadodara and Chandrakant alias Bablu Singh (Raghuvanshi), 42, a resident of Utsav Residency in Dindoli. During primary investigation, police got to know that they run a transport business under the name United Express Pvt. Ltd and Alpi Parcel Agency and Apple Logistics. The accused used to sell the textile goods to some other persons and pocketed the money.  Addressing reporters on Wednesday, police commissioner Ajay Tomar said that during a meeting with members of the city’s textile associations, police were told that businessmen who sent parcels through Care United Express Pvt.

They are either chronic absentees or dropouts. We have now asked the DDPI and DDPU to give details of the students who have got left behind in the vaccination drive. The health department has planned to conduct a drive after tracing these students. They drive is planned for every Saturday,” he said.Videoconferencing with school heads in the district was held on Wednesday afternoon so that they can convince those students who have not taken the first dose to do so, said K Sudhakar, DDPI, DK.CD Jayanna, DDPU of Dakshina Kannada, said: “Whenever the vaccination drive is held, a lot of regular students avoided it, saying that they want to get vaccinated in the presence of their parents. Some are questioning why it is mandatory when getting jabbed is voluntary.”He added that one college with the highest student population has 400 beneficiaries pending vaccination and another college has about 300 students who are unvaccinated. “Overall, 90% of PU students have been vaccinated,” Jayanna said.Apart from school and PU students, a small percentage of UG students below 18 too have been vaccinated in degree colleges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/vax-focus-on-dropouts-absentees-in-schools/articleshow/89006075.cms||---

At a time when kambala, the traditional sport of Tulunadu, was reaching new heights, due to its growing popularity, with several youngsters coming forward to participate, the season has come to an abrupt halt. K Gunapala Kadamba, kambala expert, founder secretary, Dakshina Kannada Kambala Committee, said, “In case there is a fall in Covid cases, we can expect at least two kambalas to be held in March. Post-March, organising Kambalas may be a challenge because of weather conditions.’’ On an average, the District Kambala Committee comprising Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod, conducts about 20 events, that are held during the weekends, between November and March. A majority of the traditional kambalas were already held by the time Covid-19 cases started rising. Kadamba said six kambala events were held this season. As many as 221 pairs of buffaloes participated in Moodbidri, and 172 in Miyar. “We are hoping to host two kambalas in March, but they may be held under a lot of restrictions laid down by the district administration,” he said. “With the kambala season almost coming to a standstill, nearly 5,000 people directly or indirectly involved, are hit. Most of the jockeys are appointed on contract, based on the number of competitions they are likely to participate in. The kambala buffaloes need to be exercised regularly,” he said. Meanwhile, Mangaluru Kambala, that was scheduled to be held at the Rama Lakshmana Jodukere in Gold Finch City on Saturday, has been postponed. Captain Brijesh Chowta, under whose leadership this kambala is held, said, “Though all preparations were made, we decided to postpone the kambala. We are hopeful of conducting it once the Covid situation improves. When kambala is held, the action on and off the racetrack is high, and hence it is difficult to conduct it under several restrictions.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/covid-crisis-puts-temporary-halt-on-kambalas-this-season/articleshow/89006076.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: 74-year-old veteran Ambedkarite files papers for 94th election of his life||AGRA: The upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh will mark 74-year-old Hasanuram Ambedkari's 94th election as a candidate. On Wednesday, he filed his papers at the collectorate to contest elections from Kheragarh seat of Agra district as an independent. Ambedkari was a senior member in the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (Bamcef) founded by Kanshi Ram before the Bahujan Samaj Party came into being. He told TOI that he fought all elections according to the ideology of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar. Ambedkari has been contesting elections since 1985 for various bodies, including the Lok Sabha, state assembly, and panchayat elections from different seats. However, he has never won. In 1988, his nomination for the post of the President of India was rejected. He said, “I contest elections to lose. The winning politicians forget the masses. I want to set a record of losing elections 100 times. I don’t care who my opponents are as I contest elections to give an option to voters who believe in Ambedkar's ideology.” Ambedkari contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri seats but was unable to retain his deposits. The last election he fought was for the post of a district council member in 2021. His best performance was in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections when he secured 36,000 votes from the Firozabad seat. Ambedkari said, “On Wednesday, my nomination to contest the assembly election from my home constituency Kheragarh was accepted. My fellow Ambedkarites want me to also file a nomination from the Agra (rural) seat, which is reserved for scheduled castes. I will do it on Thursday.” He added that he had already started door-to-door campaigning with his wife and supporters. "If people vote for me, I will work according to constitutional principles. My agenda has always been impartial and corruption-free development and welfare of the marginalised in society,” he said. Ambedkari has been active in politics for over 40 years. He served as the district president and state vice-president of Bamcef from 1977 to 1984. He was briefly a member of the BSP as well. “I was a dedicated worker of Bamcef and also worked for the BSP to strengthen its roots in UP. In 1985, when I asked for a ticket, party leaders ridiculed me and told me that not even my wife would vote for me. I was humiliated for being financially weak. I was deeply disheartened by the entire episode and since then have been contesting every election as an independent candidate,” he said. Ambedkari said he works as farm labour and has an MNREGA job card. He added that he has no formal schooling, but can read and write Hindi, Urdu, and English.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/veteran-ambedkarite-files-papers-for-94th-election-of-his-life/articleshow/89001640.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Dehradun||Despite Covid spike, current situation better than second wave, say health officials||Dehradun: Despite the alarming rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state, health officials believe that the current situation is much better than the last year during the second wave. Moreover, mass vaccination and the state's preparedness have also contributed to the fight against the wave, driven by Omicron variant. The second wave in April 2021 had seen multiple deaths in the state every day, acute shortage of oxygen, a failure of health infrastructure, fake rapid antigen tests being conducted in the state among other issues. Currently, the state has 22,962 active cases with over 4000 cases being reported daily. However, the third wave appears to be less severe as the hospitalisation and mortality rate is very low. The health officials feel that the reason for the difference in the two waves is the severity of the variants themselves. “One of the major differing factors is the severity of the variant itself. While previous variants have attacked the lower respiratory system, the current one is affecting the upper system which stays contained till the throat itself manifests in flu-like symptoms. Despite a much higher transmission rate, the virus is mild and has a much lower mortality rate. Earlier the hospitalisation ratio was 90 to 10. It’s the opposite right now, hospitalisation is very less,” said Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent, Doon medical hospital. Experts claim that most of the patients being admitted in hospitals currently are the ones with comorbidities. Officials further contended that vaccination is also playing a major role in easing the situation. Symptoms in fully vaccinated people are even less severe, said experts. Meanwhile, the preparedness of the state machinery after the failures of last time is also a factor in better handling the situation. However, the officials have warned against false-negative results from the rapid coronavirus test that are coming this time. “One major difference between the two waves is the false RTPCRs. The test will show negative despite the patient having all the symptoms. That is why we are encouraging people to isolate themselves as a precaution even if they have only mild symptoms. Another major difference is that symptoms are manifesting in children as well this time around. Minors were not majorly affected last time but that is not the case these days,” said chief medical officer, Dr Manoj Upreti. Uttarakhand currently has 6572 covid dedicated oxygen beds, 1655 covid ICU beds, 1016 ventilators reserved for covid and specifically trained medical personnel for the third wave. Officials believe that despite the rapid transmission rate of the virus, they are ahead of the situation but are still urging the public to stay indoors, take precautions and isolate themselves immediately in case of symptoms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/despite-covid-spike-current-situation-better-than-second-wave-say-health-officials/articleshow/89003393.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Delhi||Tata Power to move CERC over move to exit pact with NTPC||New Delhi: Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd has hinted at moving the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission for ending its May 2008 PPA (power purchase agreement) with state-run generation utility NTPC after the Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed its petition on the matter. “The company (TP-DDL) has been relegated to approach the commission to avail the necessary remedy. From the jurisdiction aspect, all rights and contentions of the parties have been kept open. The court did not pass any order on merits (of the contentions),” a company spokesperson said on Wednesday. In its petition, TPDDL sought a restraining order on NTPC from scheduling any power from Dadri–I station or to raise any bill for the period after November 30, 2020 on the ground that the plant’s 25-year useful life and the validity of the PPA ended on that date. Tata Power, if and when it moves the regulator, will be the second Delhi distribution company after Reliance Infrastructure-promoted BSES to approach CERC on ending a PPA with NTPC using the option to exit pacts with 25-year-old plants. Tata Power had cited this provision in government and regulatory norms in support of its contention and said the same rules allows discoms to renegotiate tariffs of old PPA for continued purchase from a plant that completes 25-year ‘useful life’. NTPC cited the same rules to oppose TP-DDL’s contention, saying the norms clearly said PPA for 25-year-old plants can be scrapped or tariffs renegotiated only if both parties agreed. NTPC also contended that issues regarding tariff, depreciation, operating costs, interest rate on loans and tax recovery are exclusive domains of CERC and cannot be decided by the parties. NTPC also contended that the PPAs are not mere commercial contracts but are entered into on the basis of allocations made by the power ministry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/tata-power-to-move-cerc-over-move-to-exit-pact-with-ntpc/articleshow/89004670.cms||Sanjay Dutta

In fact, Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) was planning to restore the century-old building as a heritage structure. A proposal in this regard was mooted by the then managing director of the MSCL, Mohammed Nazeer, in 2018. The plan was to restore the old building with an area of 6,000 sq ft, into a monument. The MSCL had also invited suggestions from citizens, for the restoration of the building and its premises. However, MSCL recently decided to demolish the building to facilitate the widening of the road. MSCL general manager (technical) Arun Prabha K S told TOI that the building is in such a dilapidated condition, and that it cannot be restored. “The road development work through MSCL is under progress in the Port ward of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC). Accordingly, work on the Kanara Chamber Road, that connects Badriya School junction in the ward, is also progressing. To facilitate the work, the old building needs to be demolished, and a letter in this regard was sent to the MCC in November, seeking permission. The land where the building is located belongs to the MCC. As per MSCL’s plan, it requires 35.6 sq m for the road. The old building is in a dilapidated condition, and it is not being used,” he said. Mayor Premanand Shetty said that the MCC council has approved the proposal to demolish the building, and a resolution has been sent to the Town Planning Standing Committee for final approval. The municipal council of Mangalore was established in 1866, through the Madras Town Improvement Act, 1865. Later, the Mangalore City Corporation came into existence in 1980.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/devpt-work-mlore-municipality-building-to-be-demolished/articleshow/89006077.cms||Vinobha K T

Tourism department deputy director Manikya said work on the ‘Welcome to Dakshina Kannada’QR code is ready, and is expected to be launched within a fortnight. The department is already in touch with the DK Taximen’s and Maxicab Association for the distribution of QR code stickers, that will be put up in every vehicle, for the convenience of tourists. QR code stickers are efficient to use, and cost-effective for the travel industry to implement. It allows the travel industry to lessen touchpoints in providing services to tourists and stakeholders, he said. District tourism consultant Chethan V said that the department has been working on the project for over three months. “In many hotels, menu cards have been replaced with QR codes, and when every sector is going digital, we decided to incorporate technology for the betterment of the tourism industry. A tourist these days does a lot of research over the internet, before visiting a destination. This technology will help tourists to get better details and more access to places around the district,” he said. “The department has with it all data regarding tourist places, as well as the necessary statistics. Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra has been the backbone of this project. When we discussed this idea with software experts in the National Informatics Centre, state unit, they agreed to take this project forward. The QR code is ready, and the stickers have been printed. We are finalising details on the official launch,” Chethan said. Once the tourist scans the QR code, details, including the tourism map of the district, information on each destination like temples, beaches, hill stations, waterfalls, connectivity details, culture, cuisine, flora & fauna and trekking locations will be available. There is scope for more technology-based updates in the future.

The sightings have dropped by almost 50% this year.Birder Arnold M Goveas said the season for migratory birds has been delayed. The poor sighting is happening for the second consecutive year. “It is strange that the waders came in late, and are few in numbers in the places around Mangaluru. We are recording habitat loss everywhere. For instance, on the stretch from Mangaluru to Moodbidri, several undisturbed patches have vanished. Paddy cultivation is also fast disappearing in the district. The grasslands and wetlands too are disappearing, but this does not mean that the winter migratory birds are not coming south towards the coast. Over 500 northern pintail ducks, and a few other species were sighted near Kumta recently. The poor sighting of the winter birds is also an indicator of the destruction of the environment, climate change and increased pollution of our waterbodies,’’ he said.Quoting an example he said, “We used to find several oriental dwarf kingfishers, also known as the black-backed kingfisher or three-toed kingfisher, a pocket-sized bird near Bondel, between October to May. However this year, even their number is reducing, as we have found only three birds so far, and it was spotted about a month later than usual. The two streams here are polluted,” Arnold said.The sightings are poor in terms of species and numbers. For instance, bristled grassbird, common grasshopper warbler, black-winged kites, common kestrel and western marsh harrier that were seen earlier during this season, are either missing from the region, or found in few numbers. However, Udupi is having better sightings compared to Mangaluru, Arnold added.Birder Vivek Nayak from the Coastal Karnataka Birdwatchers Network said, “Last year, the birders of the coast had documented 350 species between November and January, as against 160 species documented this year. We are hoping that the season picks up in the next 15 days. The weather may have played spoilsport. It rained till November, and there is habitat destruction. Among the 160 species recorded so far, are storks, bunting, warblers, ducks and a few owls,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/poor-sighting-of-winter-migratory-birds-worries-enthusiasts/articleshow/89006083.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

This is a political ploy. The Congress and the Left parties are misleading the people by providing wrong information on the issue. It is unfortunate that politics is being played in the name of social reformer Narayana Guru. The Congress and the Left parties have always followed an anti-Hindu policy, and this is also an attempt to divide the Hindus.

However, NMC has withheld its decision as there is no use in using these kits as 30% of the Covid patients are infected with the Omicron variant. Moreover, Omicron infected patients are fast recovering at home.NMC officials said initially they had planned to use S-gene RT-PCR kits to identify the cases infected with the Omicron variant. But the variant has already spread and there is no need of identifying the patients infected with it.“Even though this variant spreads fast, the patients are mostly asymptomatic or has mild symptoms. Around 96% of the total active patients are in home isolation and the hospitalisation rate is low,” said the officials.“Moreover, recovery of the patients has also increased. The Covid patients are recovering in a week. We have also reduced the home isolation period from the previous 10 days to 7, as per the government guidelines,” said the officials.Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav during the recent meeting had directed the health officials concerned to withhold the process of procuring such kits||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-withholds-decision-to-procure-s-gene-rt-pcr-kits/articleshow/89006088.cms||---

Superintendent of police Sachin Patil (Nashik rural) said that the accidents were on the higher side last year due to the strict Covid-19 restrictions in 2020. He said as against the death of 801 people in 746 accidents in 2020, 862 people were killed in 788 accidents in 2021.The police are in the process of revising the list of black spots, which are the spots of frequent accidents so that necessary infrastructure work can be taken up to prevent them. Nonetheless, rash driving and breaking traffic rules were causing most of the accidents, he said.Earlier, there were a total of 98 black spots in the rural district, on which infrastructure work was carried out. However, most of the accidents have been reported on the Mumbai Agra highway in and around Malegaon, Chandwad, Igatpuri and Ghoti. The Sinnar-Ghoti road, Sinnar-Shirdi road also witness a large number of accidents.The police officials of the rural district said wrong-side driving on the highway, three people on bikes, not wearing helmets, sitting on the road dividers of the highway during the night were common, which all lead to road accidents. Meanwhile, the city police have registered 185 death. With this, the total number of deaths in road accidents was 1,047 deaths in Nashik district in 2021. While the police are continuously spreading traffic awareness among people, a section of motorists continues to overlook traffic rules which lead to road accidents. Last year, residents of Malegaon had also agitated demanding improvement of the road condition of the Mumbai Agra highway which was leading to a maximum number of accidents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-rural-862-people-killed-in-accidents-in-2021/articleshow/89006093.cms||---

The plant, owned by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and currently operated by a private firm, is now gearing up to start processing mangoes for export again from April.As per the norms, irradiation of mangoes is mandatory before exporting them to the US. The irradiation process is conducted under the supervision of quarantine inspectors from the US.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) had imposed restrictions on international travel for the past two years. As a result, quarantine inspectors could not visit India, and mango export could not take place.However, USDA recently approved market access for Indian mangoes.Officials from an agency involved in the operation of the irradiation facility at Lasalgaon said, “There were certain restrictions for the past two years, and the mangoes could not be exported to the US after the 2019 season. It will restart after two years.”“We are expecting the quarantine inspectors from the US to reach India by March-end, and the processing of mangoes at the irradiation plant will begin in the first week of April if everything works out as planned,” said the officials at the Lasalgaon plant. “We have set a target of irradiating about 600 tonne of mangoes that will be exported to the US this season,” they added.There are two irradiation centres in Maharashtra — Vashi in Mumbai and Lasalgaon in Nashik district, — where the irradiation process on mangoes is done.While the Vashi plant is owned by the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB), the Lasalgaon plant is owned by BARC. In 2019, the country had exported 1,300 metric tonne of mangoes, which were irradiated at Lasalgaon and Mumbai plants. While Lasalgaon had processed 680 tonne of mangoes, the Vashi plant had processed 620 tonne of mangoes in the 2019 mango season.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/irradiation-of-mangoes-for-us-export-to-restart-at-lasalgaon/articleshow/89006095.cms||---

Hence, such steps need to be taken,” the collector said. Since the number of people have been restricted in social gatherings and other measures have been taken to regulate number of people coming together, people have started visiting open places in rural areas.“All tourism or entertainment spots are open only for people who are fully vaccinated with a cap on number of maximum people — around 50%. Due to this people are now prefering rural areas,” Mandhare said.The places that have been put out of bounds for people are Brahmagiri mountain, Anjineri, Harihar Fort, Salher-Mulher fort, Dugarwadi water falls, dams including Bhavali, Gangapur, Vaitarna, among others. The ban comes into effect immediately. Superintendent of police (Nashik rural) had recommended the restrictions at places that were witnessing higher footfall — mostly during the weekend.

While announcing that NCP and Shiv Sena will contest 10-12 constituencies each in Goa, the two parties left a door open for a post-poll tie-up with Congress, along the lines of the Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra. The two parties said that they attempted to convince Congress to form an alliance, but the talks did not bear any fruit. The Maha Vikas Aghadi — the coalition between the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — currently heads the government in Maharashtra. “NCP and Shiv Sena have decided to contest the elections in Goa,” NCP national general secretary Praful Patel said. “We will not contest all the 40 seats, but our candidates will win the seats where we field them.” Patel said that over the next four days, representatives of the two parties will sit together and decide on seat allocation for the February 14 poll. “Whatever number of seats we fight, we will win and a government will not be formed without our support,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said. Patel said that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar had attempted to convince Congress of the need to contest the Goa elections as a united front, but Congress refused to play ball. “This proposal of ours was not responded to. We felt that Congress was not giving us the due respect that we deserve,” Patel said. While NCP has seen its candidates taste electoral success in Goa, Shiv Sena has never won any election in the state, whether in municipal bodies or the state assembly. NCP had won the Benaulim seat in the 2017 assembly election, but the lone NCP MLA, Churchill Alemao, recently claimed to have merged the Goa legislative unit of NCP in the Trinamool Congress. “Alemao wanted us to have an alliance with Congress and wanted assurances that the Navelim seat will be given to his daughter, while he was demanding for the Benaulim seat,” Patel said. Patel and Raut said Congress has failed to play a “constructive role” in Goa’s politics and lacked initiative after the 2017 elections, which allowed BJP to form the government. “In 2017, Congress did not take a constructive role and we were forced to fight separately. After the results, Congress got 17 MLAs, we had 1, and with GFP we were ready with letters of support. Our letters were just lying and as a consequence BJP staked a claim and formed the government,” Patel said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/sena-ncp-forge-alliance-to-contest-10-12-seats-each/articleshow/89009488.cms||TNN

Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the NMC medical superintendent, said the civic body’s assessment is the number of active cases (10,169 on Wednesday evening) may rise to 15,000-17,000 within the next 8-10 days. Thereafter, the Covid curve will flatten and, subsequently, dip. It is to be noted that most active patients are in home isolation. Dr Nagargoje said the initial assessment of the civic body — that active cases could touch the 40,000-mark — will not happen. Although people are getting infected, the recovery rate continues to be robust in the city. Over 97% of the eligible beneficiaries are partially vaccinated and about 68% are fully vaccinated in the city. NMC officials said the rate of hospitalization is just about 4%, and over 96% of the active patients in the city are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.

By Tuesday night, the number of active Covid patients increased to 9,458. By Wednesday, the number rose to 10,169. During the second wave of the pandemic last year, the number of active patients had increased from 500 in February to 28,000 by April 23. But the trend reversed and the cases started reducing from May onwards. In December 2021, the city had a daily average of 30 Covid cases. But there has been a spike over the past 19 days.

The development comes after chief medical officer Dr Manoj Upreti's intervention. The issue was brought to CMO's notice by Dehradun-resident Abhinav Thapar, who has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking audit of Covid-19 hospitalisation bills. His petition argues that many people who were admitted to private hospitals for Covid treatment were handed exorbitant bills in absence of a uniform policy. The beneficiaries -- Rajkumari Batra and her daughter-in-law Neha Batra -- have thanked Thapar, CMO Dr Upreti and senior health department officer Nidhi Rawat for their help in securing the refund.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/pvt-hosp-returns-rs-75k-to-patients-who-were-overcharged-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/89003402.cms||Sonali Mishra

---||Dehradun||Has Harak bitten off more than he can chew, fallen between two stools?||Dehradun: Even as Harak Rawat’s re-entry into Congress remains “on hold”, with the chorus of protest from senior Congress leaders against him growing, political analysts say that the wily Thakur leader, who has been adept at changing loyalties in his three decade-long political career, may have bitten off more than he can chew this time. Barely a decade back, in 2012, Harak Rawat was counted among the top leaders who decided party tickets for the Congress. Now, the former Kotdwar MLA finds himself stuck, trying to not only to re-enter Congress but also secure tickets for himself and his daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain. Sensing he would go back to Congress, BJP had expelled him late Sunday night pre-empting any move by the Kotdwar MLA to bargain with Congress. The Congress, on the other hand, is not sure it wants Rawat back, with former CM and veteran leader Harish Rawat saying Harak must apologise for his mistake in 2016 first, as he was among the 10 MLAs who revolted against Harish Rawat in 2016, reducing the then-ruling party to a minority and leading to the imposition of President rule in the state. However, Harak Rawat hasn’t had to think of consequences when he changed parties before, since he almost always got his way. His political career started with the BJP in 1984. He won his first assembly polls in 1991 from Pauri assembly seat (still a part of undivided UP) and at 31 years old, became the youngest minister (in charge of tourism) in UP in the Kalyan Singh government. In 1996, he joined the Janata Dal. A year later, he was in Mayawati-led BSP. After losing as a BSP candidate in 1998, he joined Congress. He stayed in the grand old party for 18 years before exiting in a dramatic fashion in 2016 and subsequently joining the BJP and going on to become a cabinet minister when the party formed the government in 2017. At the cusp of polls this time, Rawat is probably in the most difficult situation he's been in his long political career, feel analysts. His reputation as a party hopper, combined with the threat he poses to leaders within Congress, has left him stranded for now. On being queried about the situation, Harish Rawat told TOI, “The party is like the almighty but not all devotees are good. The deity and devotees must keep each other happy. I will accept whatever the leader of opposition, the state chief and the state in-charge decide about Harak.” Kedarnath Congress MLA Manoj Rawat was more vociferous in his opposition to Harak’s re-entry. “By switching from Lansdowne to Rudraprayag and then to Kotdwar and now asking for a ticket from another seat, what message is he trying to give? He quit the party when it needed him the most and now after spending five years in power, why should he get a re-entry?” According to political analyst Jay Singh Rawat, Harak Rawat may have taken things too far this time. “Till 2016, Harak Rawat was regarded as the man with perfect political acumen, who could tell the way the winds were blowing. However, leaving Congress, which made him a minister and a leader of opposition, dented his image. Still, buoyed by Modi magic, he won the Kotdwar seat in 2017,” he said, adding, “He cried when he left Congress, he was unhappy when contesting from Kotdwar and now he is weeping again. However, this is not going to make much of an impression on either Congress or the people of Uttarakhand. With so many twists and turns in his career, Rawat this time has taken a risk which seems to be more than he can handle.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/has-harak-bitten-off-more-than-he-can-chew-fallen-between-two-stools/articleshow/89003410.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi government signs two pacts to push electric vehicles in city||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Wednesday signed two pacts with a central government subsidiary to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) in the national capital. While one pact will pave the way for installation of more charging and battery swapping stations at Cluster Scheme bus depots, the other will give loan interest relief to those buying electric autorickshaws, e-rickshaws and carts. According to officials, the transport department signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), a subsidiary of state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited, for installing charging and battery swapping stations at 14 selected depots. CESL will “procure, install, operate and maintain charging units and related infrastructure”. The contract has been signed for 10 years and all stations will be ready in the next four months. Each location will have six charging points — three for two- and three-wheelers and three for four-wheelers. The location and real-time availability status will be available on the Delhi government’s One Delhi app. CESL will integrate solar rooftop and battery storage systems with the charging infrastructure to use renewable energy and reduce carbon footprint. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot, who was present at the event, said the AAP government was taking the lead in using land at depots to increase and improve the charging infrastructure and the EV ecosystem in the capital. “We are also exploring various non-polluting means to power these charging stations to effectively decrease the carbon footprint,” he added. Through the other MoU, the government will provide a 5% interest subsidy on buying selected categories of EVs on loan. Officials said Delhi had become the first state to provide easy financing for EVs. “The agreement will help in accelerating the adoption of lithium-ion-based electric rickshaws, carts, autos and light goods vehicles. The relief is in addition to the applicable purchase incentive of Rs 30,000 and scrapping incentives of up to Rs 7,500 under Delhi EV Policy. The buyer will get Rs 25,000 of additional benefit,” said an official. With this MoU, the government has also capped the interest rate on loans charged by the CESL-empanelled financial institutions at 20%. Earlier, some of the FIs were charging 25-30% interest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-govt-signs-two-pacts-to-push-electric-vehicles-in-city/articleshow/89004682.cms||---

---||Nashik||Let us resume physical classes, demand English-medium schools in Nashik city||NASHIK: A section of English-medium schools in the city have demanded resumption of physical classes given the spread of Covid-19 among children was low and they recovered from the infection within a few days. The school administrators and directors claimed children have lost lot of “ground” in studies due to online education during the past two years. Hence, there is a need for serious efforts to help them adapt to the new normal in order to move ahead in the field of education. “The schools have been stressing on the need to start physical classes. Just as we were to begin our schools after Christmas vacation, orders of closure came in. The government should take immediate decision in this regard,” said Himgauri Adke, president of Association of Nashik Schools — an umbrella organisation of the English medium schools in Nashik city. The TOI carried a report on Wednesday explaining how health experts said that children were getting cured at a faster rate and about the manner in which they were infected due to their parents. “When doctors say that rate of recovery among children is fast, we believe the schools for students from Class 5 and above should be allowed as they tend to follow instructions and manage themselves. For children in lower grades the schools can reopen from Feb 15 after the third wave ends,” Adke said. Educationist Ratan Luth questioned why children should be facing restrictions when they are getting infected even when they stya at home. “Schools are closed but you can still see huge number of children getting infected and recovering from Covid. In most cases they are getting infected by their parent. Hence, it is time that they be allowed to go to school,” he said. “The private schools are better equipped to contain the infection by way of prevention. The government should allow the private schools to cnoduct physical classes immediately,” Luth added. It may be noted that till Tuesday 946 children (less than five percent of total infection) were infected and less than 100 cases were still active. Also, only one child has been admitted to a hospital de to Covid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/let-us-resume-physical-classes-demand-english-medium-schools-in-nashik-city/articleshow/89006107.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Allahabad||Severe cold wave forces people to remain indoors in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Denizens of the Sangam City continued to shiver all day through on Wednesday. After witnessing cold conditions on Tuesday—a day when Prayagraj was colder than even Shimla –Wednesday failed to bring any respite as thick cloud cover and cool westerlies continued to force people stay indoors. Apart from the common man and commuters, the main problem was amongst the devotees who have come to Magh Mela. Despite the fact that the authorities have made provision of bonfire for them and facilities like Rainbasera, the cool conditions made people shiver all day through. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was recorded at 8.2 degree Celcius. Although it was over four degrees more than what the city recorded on Tuesday, when the minimum temperature was recorded at four degrees Celsius, but it was the low value of maximum temperature which made things worst. The maximum temperature on Wednesday was 13.4 degree Celcius.  Earlier on February 12 last year, the city had recorded the minimum temperature of 3.7 degrees. Adding to problem was dense fog in the morning. The brief sunshine, that came out in the afternoon, failed to provide any respite. According to head of the department of Geography, Allahabad University, Prof AR Siddiqui, “The cold will remain dominant for now and there is a possibility of thunderstorms by the end of the week. The condition would improve on Thursday and Friday followed by rains or overcast condition on Sunday and the day after”. To beat the cold, common man were seen lighting the bonfires, even during the day time. Although there was some movement in the markets and localities during noon, but in the evening, the situation again reduced to only essential movement as people avoided going out in the open and remained confined to their houses. Situation at the Magh Mela was no different wherein groups of devotees and visitors were seen sitting around bonfire and somehow trying to keep themselves warm. “We are observing Kalpwas and following all the religious practice but because of the intense cold conditions, these are testing times as heaters or fire is not allowed in the tents”, said Ram Narain Mishra, a resident of Raniganj, Pratapgrah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/severe-cold-wave-forces-people-to-remain-indoors/articleshow/89006108.cms||Rajeev Mani

It is little surprise then that, ever since the anganwadi centres re-opened, children have been flocking to them across Dharwad district. Experts in the education sector believe that parents sending their children to anganwadi centres was an encouraging sign.Sources in the woman and child welfare department said that, while 51,878 children had been admitted to the anganwadis across Dharwad in November 2020, the corresponding number for November 2021 was 60,732. Daily attendance at these centres is hovering in the 80 to 90% range, a source said.Deputy director of woman and child welfare department HH Kukanoor told TOI, “In accordance with the directions issued by the state government, all anganwadis have been cleaned, and sanitised. We have ensured that all anganwadi workers across Dharwad are fully vaccinated. We have also stipulated that only those children will be admitted whose parents are fully vaccinated. Anganwadi centres with more than 25 children have been told to conduct classes in batches. Kids displaying symptoms of Covid infection are barred from attending classes. All these measures have rid fear in parents’ mind.”Some parents, however, alleged that personnel at anganwadi centres were not adhering to Covid safety norms, and asked the authorities to ensure the rules were enforced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/attendance-increases-at-anganwadi-centres/articleshow/89006115.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Poll material dumped in stores as demand falls drastically||PRAYAGRAJ: Traders dealing in election materials including flags, badges, caps, masks with political party symbols are finding themselves in a difficult situation. Reason: There were no takers of election materials and all these materials worth crores of rupees have been dumped in stores. The election commission in view of resurge of Covid cases, has banned the election rallies, roadshows and corner meetings in the five poll-bound states till January 22. Now the workers of political parties are refraining to pick up election materials. However, leaders of major political parties including BJP, SP, BSP, Congress and AAP have taken up digital campaigning to woo voters. Rajesh Chaurasia, a trader dealing in election materials told TOI that materials are duped in godowns as there were no takers of it. He, however, said only Samajwadi Party and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers have come forward to take small amount of materials particularly flags, masks and caps while other parties workers are yet to seek them. Chaurasia, however, rued “Traders have been facing the worst scenario in terms of sale of election materials as they did brisk business in 2017 assembly and 2019 parliamentary polls”. These are being supplied to neighbouring districts of Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Amethi, Jaunpur, Bhadohi from Prayagraj but the sale of election materials was in worst state. Another trader Mohd Kadir said, “Gone are the days when political parties used to book bulk orders for flags, posters, banners, hand bills, badges whenever the polls are to be held but, scenario has completely changed in 2022. There are a handful of political party workers who sought mask with political party sympol, cap or muffler.” “The demand for political parties flags was sought in rural belt of the district only. When majority of workers of all political parties have smartphones and subsequently installed apps, they don’t need any political materials in hands and sending messages to voters through social media and popular messaging app. he added. Traders, however, claimed “We could hope for better days when restriction on road shows and rallies will be lifted and political party workers will seek election materials for their leaders’ rallies and road shows.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/poll-material-dumped-in-stores-as-demand-falls-drastically/articleshow/89006116.cms||Kapil Dixit

Additional sessions judge (ASJ), who passed the order of conviction, will pronounce the sentence to the accused on January 25.The ASJ convicted them on the basis of facts and evidence available against the accused persons. It is alleged that these accused persons, while taking advantage of the poverty and other compulsions of girl children, used to entice them away from their native places. Thereafter, they used to sell them in the red light area of Meerganj, where they were ultimately forced to join the flesh trade. Some social organizations and activists had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the high court, which directed the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps to remove the illegal flesh trade and human trafficking going on in the heart of the city. Acting on the direction of the high court, the police launched a massive ‘operation freedom’ on Labour Day on May 1, 2016 to cleanse the Meerganj area. As a result, several girls, many of whom were minors, were rescued from the brothel.During the operation, as many as 48 persons were arrested and a criminal case was registered against them. After the trial, the court in its decision dated January 18 convicted as many as 41 accused persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/court-convicts-41-persons-in-meerganj-flesh-trade-case/articleshow/89006120.cms||---

The literary event which saw seven editions could not be held in 2020 and 2021. The Dharwad Sahitya Sambhrama Trust has been holding the three-day event every year since 2013 and the fest has attracted large number of literature and art lovers from not only Karnataka but also from other states. The ‘Sambhrama’ was inspired by Jaipur Literary Festival but is not a replica. It has evolved its own way of conducting the event. The event included sessions on various relevant topics followed by lively and sometimes heated debates. The fest had provided an opportunity to literature and art lovers to see their favourite and top litterateurs and artists and interact with them. The Sahitya Sambhrama Organising Committee was finding it difficult to raise funds for the event and the uncertainty in the government releasing the promised fund had cast a shadow on the festival. The demand for funds in the state government’s annual budget has remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the literary world has lost eminent litterateurs like UR Ananthmurthy, KS Nissar Ahmed, professor S Shettar, Siddalingaiah, GS Amur, MM Kalburgi, Giraddi Govidraj and Chandrashekhar Patil, who were the centre of attraction at the festival. During the Congress-JD(S) rule when HD Kumarswamy was the chief minister. then minister for Kannada and culture DK Shivakumar had decided to stop grants to organizations conducting literary and cultural events sponsored by his department. His argument was that many unscrupulous organizations were siphoning off the funds. As a result, there was no budgetary allocation to the department to fund these events. Dharwad Sahitya Sambhrama’s estimated budget is Rs 30 lakh and out of that Rs 15 lakh was coming from the department. The grant for the 2019 edition had not been released till December 2019.No fundsThe trustees and leading writers including poet Channaveera Kanavi had approached the then Kannada and culture minister CT Ravi, district minister Jagadish Shettar, MLA Arvind Bellad and secretary to the department of Kannada and culture seeking their help in getting grants for the festival. “They have assured they will try to get the funds, but nothing officially had been done in that direction,” said a trustee. “Our efforts are on to convince the people in power about the need to support the event. If the government releases the grant and Covid-19 restrictions are eased, we can hold the festival next year,”said another trustee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/covid-fund-crunch-put-brakes-ondharwad-sahitya-sambhrama-again/articleshow/89006121.cms||---

According to complainants, pig carcasses are dumped at open sites and inside private properties in the twin city limits.After receiving several similar complaints, HDMC has now asked citizens to alert its control room if and when a carcass is spotted so that the staff can come and pick them up for disposal.The HDMC authorities suspect rivalry among pig owners to be the reason behind the menace. A physician in Gandhinagar area confirmed to TOI that unidentified men dumped pig carcass in his compound multiple times. “We raised complaints with the control room and the HDMC personnel picked up the carcass within an hour. As the menace continued, we told our ward corporator and the issue was settled after his intervention,” he stated.Sunanda SM. a home maker in Lingaraj Nagar, said pig’s carcass was thrown behind her house on Sunday. “As it’s empty site with compound wall, someone had thrown it. We complained to HDMC control room and personnel lifted it within a hour. But we did not get answer on as to who dumped the it there. If it continues, how can we keep watch miscreants 24x7,” she apprehended. She also said she has to pay Rs 50 or 100 as tips to HDMC personnel who come to pick the body.Some HDMC civic workers said the rivalry among pig owners may be reason for such incidents. “One owner warns his competitor by killing and dumping the body at his area. This has been happening since years. If we try to prevent them, they threaten us. If citizens warn them against leaving pigs in the open, they throw the carcass,” they added.Dr Ravi Saligoudar, veterinary officer, HDMC said that it’s a sensitive issue. “Our personnel lift the bodies after receiving complaints. But we can’t keep watch on those who dump animals’ bodies. Hence we suggest citizens to register a complaint with the police to avert such incident,s” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/dead-pigs-being-dumped-in-residential-premises-in-city/articleshow/89006125.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The seer was arrested on Saturday (January 15) evening for making objectionable remarks on women and alleged hate speeches at the Dharam Sansad conclave and sent to 14-day judicial custody. On Sunday, fresh charges were pressed against the seer for abusing a journalist and cameraman. He has been booked under sections 295 (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feeling), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (insult intended to provoke breach of peace) and 153A ((promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) of the Indian Penal Code. According to his counsel, Uttam Singh Chauhan, the maximum punishment for offences under these charges is not more than seven years. He added that none of his offences are non-bailable. Earlier, Adheer Kaushik, who runs Akhand Parashuram Akhada and is pursuing the case, had told TOI that a fresh bail petition would be filed in the high court if the CJM court turns down Yati's bail application. Prior to this, Haridwar's CJM Mukesh Chandra Arya had also scrapped the bail plea of Jitendra Narayan Tyagi (alias Waseem Rizvi), the former chairman of Shia Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh. Tyagi is also an accused in the Dharam Sansad hate speech case and was booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups and acts prejudicial to harmony) and 298 (deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person) of the IPC. Notably, the Dharam Sansad conclave was held in Haridwar from December 17 to 19. During the course of the event, several seers made provocative statements against minorities. Besides Yati and Rizvi, seers Dharamdas, Sadhvi Annapurna, and Sindhu Sagar are also among those booked for delivering "hate speeches" at the conclave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dharam-sansad-hate-speech-case-haridwar-cjm-court-rejects-narasinghanands-bail-plea/articleshow/89003415.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Delhi||PMLA: ED rapped over ‘casual approach’||New Delhi: A Delhi court has pulled up Enforcement Directorate for a “casual and cavalier” approach in its investigation in a Prevention of Money Laundering Act case, saying that the accused’s arrest had “preceded” the grounds of his arrest. Liberty is a sacrosanct constitutional value and the courts of this country are duty bound to act as sentinel to protect citizens’ liberty against the wrath of State sceptre, the court said. As per the prosecution, accused Jatinder Pal Singh allegedly forged bills of Astonishing Sales Private Limited to show bogus purchase of fabrics from it and prepared fake/bogus bills to show sale of fabrics, which actually never took place from his company M/s Nau Nidh Overseas Private Limited to M/s Shree Shyam Dhani Trading Co and six other suspected shell entities to illegally earn proceeds of crime. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana noted that the accused was arrested by ED on December 31, 2021 and the permission of arrest was granted on December 30, 2021, but the investigating officer (IO) came to know about the ‘proceeds of crime’ on January 12, 2022, only, when he examined Sanjay Kumar (proprietor of M/s Shree Shyam Dhani). The court said in the absence of ‘proceeds of crime’, arrest sanctioning authority would have no reasons to believe that accused has been guilty of an offence punishable under PMLA, leave aside the communication of the grounds of arrest to the accused. “The conduct of ED in the instant matter is highly disappointing, if not deplorable as suggested by the defence. In its zeal to ensure the sustained detention of the applicant/accused, ED seems to have thrown out the baby with the water,” the judge said in the order. The court further said that ED made a conscious choice to arrest the accused without doing proper preliminary inquiry. ED seems to have acted in haste and the focus of the investigation seems to be the accused and not the crime or the actual criminals, it stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pmla-ed-rapped-over-casual-approach/articleshow/89004693.cms||Usha Das

The NCPCR also shared that as per the reply of the education department of the state all conversations of the mentors and mentees will be recorded for safety and kept by the education department. No mentor can meet the mentee offline. Any violation of the norms will invite immediate de-registration of the mentor. A complaint was received by the NCPCR regarding the Desh Ke Mentor programme introduced by the government where it was alleged that as per the scheme children and unknown people are brought together for the purpose of education and career guidance. This may expose children to probable safety and security risks. Taking cognisance of the matter, NCPCR wrote to Delhi government’s chief secretary seeking information on safety measures that are followed. However, the commission did not find the explanation of the department of education regarding the safety measures in place satisfactory. The commission sought immediate suspension of the initiative till the time when all the loopholes pertaining to the safety of children are overhauled. According to NCPCR, in a letter received on January 18, the directorate of education has said that new features have been added to ensure safety and security of children. These include “necessary police verification of the mentor.” As per the circular, “In case of any adverse report from the police, the mentor would be de-registered immediately. This exercise would be done in respect of all mentors already registered under the programme.” The contact number of the mentees will be masked and shall not be made available to the mentor or any other person. “There is no in-person interaction intended among the mentor and mentees and since every phone call will be recorded by the government, there is no scope left for child abuse by any mentor,” it is stated. In another circular issued on January 17, DoE has said that all the parents of the students have been advised to ensure the presence of any adult member of the family during the conversation between the mentor and the mentees through the app.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/police-verification-added-to-mentorship-programme/articleshow/89004700.cms||---

Khan, a controversial cleric who was earlier booked for making derogatory comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told TOI on Wednesday, "After Congress won in 2009 with our support, I had said that 'Muslims have not forgiven them for the Batla House incident'. They had promised to probe the encounter, but didn't fulfil it. I have always opposed the Congress, but after meeting Priyanka Gandhi Vadra recently, I found that Priyanka and Rahul are true seculars and can bring the country back on the right track." Khan further said, “We will campaign for Congress in five (poll-bound) states and ensure they get every possible support from our followers. However, we may also oppose the party if they go wrong in future.” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra condemned Khan's remarks on the Batla incident, calling it "highly deplorable". The Batla House encounter by Delhi Police on September 19, 2008, took place when terrorists who belonged to the group Indian Mujahideen were reported to be hiding in a flat in Jamia Nagar.

---||Chandigarh||Road recarpeting to begin in March||Chandigarh: The pending work in the road projects of the current financial year — around 10% to 15% — will start in March. The construction work had to be stopped in November due to the onset of winter and coldwave. Since the Chandigarh administration had given the dedicated amount of the money for the current financial year for the road re-carpeting works, the authority did not face financial crunch. The road re-carpeting was done under the supervision of the senior engineering officers and the roads — both residential and commercial — were identified in all the areas.According to information, the Rs 38 crore work was allotted in March last year. Besides that, some previous pending works of the road re-carpeting were also there, those were also completed before the monsoon period. The contractors were facing major issue of labourers earlier and thus the pace of the work was slow. Since there are three divisions in the building and road (B&R) wing of the MC’s engineering department, the civic body has prepared the estimates division wise, so that all the required roads of re-carpeting can be covered properly.The ongoing and previous road re-carpeting works are under the deposit work, as the municipal corporation, Chandigarh has received approximately Rs 70 crore from the Chandigarh administration in 2019. Besides that, UT also released money for more works in 2019, which include enhancement of the water storage tank at Sector 39 water works, installation of lights at dark spots across the city and development of the nine villages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/road-recarpeting-to-begin-in-march/articleshow/89006139.cms||---
---||Rajkot||5 women in Rajkot faced violence daily in 2021||RAJKOT: Roughly five women in Rajkot city were allegedly subjected to domestic violence every day in 2021 and they approached the police with applications for complaints as the last resort. This has been revealed in the first of its kind analysis of domestic violence applications done by the city police. The Mahila police station, which handles these cases, received as many as 1,723 applications in the 11 months of 2021 with women complaining about harassment and disputes with husbands and in-laws. Analysis shows that the majority of the alleged victims were women between the age of 26-30 years. Police officials said that the maximum disputes were found to have happened after six to 11 years of marriage as maximum applications - 439 (or 29% of the total) - were submitted by women who were married for six to 26 years. Among these too, a majority of the applications were by women married for six to 10 years. Across Gujarat, there had been a spike in cases of domestic violence during the Covid-19 induced lockdown first imposed in March 2019. In a majority of the cases, police found that the reason for the souring of relationship between husband and wife was the interference of in-laws in their married lives. Out of 1,723 applications, police registered offences against the husband or in-laws in 126 while the remaining were disposed of after counselling by the cops. The applications were sent to the city police commissioner office, concerned police stations and even the Prime Minister Office (PMO), which were all forwarded to the Mahila police station for further inquiry. Deputy commissioner of police, zone-2, Manoharsinh Jadeja said, “Almost 90% of total applications are related to domestic violence. In just about 3-4% cases, offences were registered while in the remaining, issues were sorted out between the couples or they eventually got separated. In some cases, couples even asked for more time to bury the hatchet.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/5-women-in-rajkot-faced-violence-daily-in-2021/articleshow/89006140.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
