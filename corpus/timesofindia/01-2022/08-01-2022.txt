After Mir’s death, only one other terrorist from Srinagar is left in JeM, Kashmir range IGP Vijay Kumar said on Friday. He said 11 terrorists, including six of foreigners, were killed in encounters since January 1 this year in J&K. Mir was said to be active since December 2020. He was wanted in the killing of police inspector Parvaiz Ahmad in June last year and a grenade attack on a CRPF bunker near Aali Masjid Chowk at Eidgah, Srinagar, in which a civilian and a policeman were wounded. He was also known for brainwashing central Kashmiri youths to join JeM, police said. IGP Kumar said three AK-56 assault rifles were seized from the terrorists at Zolwa village of Chadoora after they were shot dead by a team of J&K police CRPF and Army personnel during a cordon and search in the area. The terrorists fired indiscriminately and gave away their position when the security team approached the hideout. They were gunned down in retaliatory action. An Army officer suffered a “minor” splinter wound. Civilians were evacuated to avoid collateral damage in the darkness.

---||Goa||Covid-19 scare keeps FC Goa indoors ahead of Chennaiyin clash||Panaji: FC Goa have played Chennaiyin FC 19 times, more than any other opposition. The clashes between the teams have produced some spectacular results -- a 5-4 win at Fatorda, a stunning 4-1 win for the hosts in the 2020 first leg semifinal clash at Chennai – and, not to forget, the comeback in the 2015 final when Chennaiyin scored two goals in the last three minutes to break Goan hearts. With 73 goals in 19 games, no other ISL fixture has seen more goals than this one. But Goa’s preparations for the clash against Chennaiyin has been far from satisfactory, after the team was forced to remain indoors for four days and trained only on Friday, the eve of the all-important match. According to sources, there was a Covid-19 scare within Goa’s bio-secure bubble and everyone was asked to stay inside their rooms. A couple of players will continue to isolate as a precautionary measure, but mercifully coach Derrick Pereira could conduct a full training session at the Sesa ground in Sirsaim on Friday. “It has not been an ideal preparation for the match, but these type of hurdles and circumstances keep coming our way,” Pereira told TOI during the pre-match media interaction. “Our focus should be on the game. We have to plan this well and put our best foot forward. We have to focus more on our game and improve from the last match.” Despite being handicapped by the absence of key players – including two foreigners – and 0-2 down inside the first 20 minutes, Goa did well to snatch a point against Kerala Blasters in the previous match. Given their dominance in the second half, it could have been three. Goa are six points behind fourth-placed ATK Mohun Bagan and Pereira feels the team should start accumulating wins, if they are to eventually make it to the playoffs. “From now on, it’s do or die for us. We have to go for three points and plan in such a way that we go for the maximum. I was happy to hear from other coaches that FC Goa is a very good team. We are playing good football and should continue doing that. We have to believe in ourselves. “For the last three or four games, we have played with the same squad. Our key players are back. We need to build an understanding, create opportunities to score, and if we get one good win, we will get that confidence and motivation to do well in the remaining matches,” said Pereira. Chennaiyin were quickly building a reputation of being strong at the back, but conceded seven goals in two losses against Kerala and Bengaluru. The solitary goal win against Jamshedpur should do their confidence a world of good. “The players showed good character and ability to change things even after two defeats and that’s important for me,” said coach Bozidar Bandovic. “Even some of the stronger teams don’t make a comeback after conceding losses. I want my team to be stable.” Chennaiyin have struggled in front of goal, scoring just nine, the least among all teams. The former champions will now be bolstered with the return of Nerijus Valskis from Jamshedpur. The Lithuanian striker donned Chennaiyin colours in his first season here and won the Golden Boot with 15 goals as they rose from the bottom of the table to make it to the final in 2020. “Goa are very dangerous when they have the ball. We need to be very tight defensively and put pressure on them,” said Bandovic. The pressure is already on Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/covid-19-scare-keeps-fc-goa-indoors-ahead-of-chennaiyin-clash/articleshow/88764190.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Need to back FC Goa players, believe in them: Derrick Pereira||Panaji: FC Goa coach Derrick Pereira will keep the faith in players that he has at the moment and will not seek any reinforcements during the January transfer window. Goa started with three consecutive losses at the start and have generally struggled in this season’s Indian Super League (ISL). They are placed ninth with nine points from as many matches and will have to turn around their fortunes in the second phase. While many believed Pereira would seek new players, the coach said he is happy with his team. “We have a good side and if all our players get 100 percent fit, I don’t think we should go for any reinforcement,” Pereira told TOI during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. “We need to back our players. We need to believe in them. We have enough depth in our squad to go through the second phase as well.” Except for injured midfielder Brandon Fernandes, Derrick is expected to have a full-strength squad at his disposal for the clash against Chennaiyin FC on Saturday. Spanish striker Airam Cabrera and midfielder Alberto Noguera have both recovered from their injuries and are available for the match. Injuries and suspensions to key players have meant Goa have not been at full-strength yet this season. Jorge Ortiz missed a significant part of pre-season after he was injured during the Durand Cup. Muhammed Nemil missed the beginning of the season with injury, while Brandon is yet to make an appearance in ISL. “Injuries and suspensions, especially to players playing up front, have been tough on us and a big reason why we have only scored 13 goals in our nine matches,” said Pereira.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/need-to-back-fc-goa-players-believe-in-them-derrick-pereira/articleshow/88764218.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars scramble to change wedding plans, cut down on guest list after new COVID curbs||In the last quarter of 2021, when the COVID pandemic showed signs of receding, the great Indian wedding business almost bounced back with elaborate shaadis taking place in the city. However, families are in a fix with fresh curbs in Maharashtra capping attendance at weddings or other events at 50, regardless of whether it’s held in a closed or open space. They are wondering whether to postpone the wedding or drastically cut down on the guest list. ‘This cap in the guest list is costing us dearly’Vidhi Aggarwal, 28, a Parel resident, planned her January wedding for many months. She says, “We booked a venue last year for around 200 people and even paid 50% of the amount. We were told that we would get a refund if there were a lockdown. Now that there is a cap on our guest list, we are in a dilemma. We won’t get a refund if we cancel the venue since there is no lockdown. But this large venue is such a waste of money if only 50 people are allowed.” Cutting down on guests has become a mammoth task for families. Nidhi Jeswani and her fiancé Akshay Tejwani both come from large joint families, and they had narrowed down their guest list to 180. “Now, with a 50-only list, we both can each invite only 25 people! That’ll mean we will have to leave out half of our close family members,” she says. Twice bitten! It’s extremely disheartening to do this over and over againFor many couples, the whole process of planning their wedding, which is otherwise quite romantic and fun, has become very tedious, given the uncertainty. Natasha, a brand manager, and Arjun, a financial consultant, had originally planned their wedding in May 2021, but had to postpone it. They had a court marriage and decided to keep the celebrations for later, but they are stuck again. “Things were opening up, so we decided to have a proper wedding on January 8. Now, we don’t know what to do. We had made all the payments, but with cases rapidly increasing again, we decided to postpone the celebrations. It’s extremely disheartening to do this over and over again,” says Natasha. Nidhi Jeswani and Akshay Tejwani ‘We will not get a refund’It’s been quite a financial drain for many, especially those who planned lavish weddings. Says Mrinal Gagnani, who had planned a wedding party, but has postponed it for now, “We had to pay everyone in advance, right from the venue, décor to the photographers and make-up artists. And now we are not getting any refund. Some vendors are understanding and are offering us credit notes, but now we don’t know when we will plan our party again.” A challenging time for wedding plannersMeanwhile, it is a challenging period for wedding planners, too. Says Priyal Mehta Bharatiya, who owns an event management company, “We have had cancellations as well as people postponing their wedding dates in Mumbai. We are handling situations depending on each family’s perspective. For some, it’s the reception, while others consider the marriage more important, regardless of the gathering. So, we guide them through the process of whatever is convenient and best for them.” She adds, “There are also couples who only want a destination wedding or a grand wedding here in Mumbai and so they are willing to wait until the situation improves.” On the other hand, there are those who, given the current scenario, want to cut down on the grandeur and just stick to the basics. Like Nidhi, a stylist, who planned to have her wedding in Igatpuri. She now says, “We have put all plans on hold and are rethinking things. It makes no sense to hold an expensive wedding at a far-off venue with so many restrictions. We might as well just get married at a Gurdwara in Mumbai!” Rise in positive cases amongst invitees is also cause for concernWith the numbers shooting up every day in Mumbai, there is worry about the people attending the wedding, too, and whether any of them could be positive. Says Mehul P, whose daughter’s wedding has been postponed, “Even if it is just 50 people, what if one of them is positive and isn’t aware of it. Also, there will be people handling the catering, decor and other things. It’s tough to monitor, and this time around, the virus is spreading so fast.” Risha Jain, a lawyer, who had invited around 150 people for her wedding reception, faced another problem. “We could have reduced our guest list down from 150 to 50 and gone ahead with our celebrations by following all protocols. But, the sad thing is that a close family member has tested positive this week. Symptoms are mild, she is fully vaccinated and is already getting better, but this incident has made us put everything on hold,” she says.

---||Delhi||COVID forces artistes to call off live gigs, again||Almost just as soon as they’d returned to the stage, live concerts and gigs are having to retreat to the wings once again, across the country and abroad, due to the rising number of COVID cases, and guidelines imposed by governments. The live entertainment industry had only just gotten its groove back following the second wave, but now artistes are having to cancel or postpone their private gigs, concerts and tours once more. Last month even saw Brown Munde fame singer AP Dhillon’s concert in the city cancelled by authorities, citing violation of Department Of Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) COVID guidelines, while singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad cancelled his December 29 performance in the capital, owing to 'the guidelines and the sentiment around omicron’. Musicians share how another phase of cancellations will impact those who depend entirely on the live entertainment business. Rahul Vaidya says it is difficult for musicians and people involved in the businessAbout 80% of the events have been postponed; it’s difficult for musicians and people involved in the business: Rahul Vaidya“About 80% of the events have been postponed. It is extremely saddening for the people who work in the live entertainment industry, especially those who survive on daily wages. It’s also very difficult for musicians. I have already started getting messages from people who are worried about what’s going to happen, but I am positive that this won’t last for very long,” says Rahul Vaidya. Shilpa Rao says she has cancelled all her shows for this monthHave cancelled all my shows for this month; we have to look at the larger picture: Shilpa RaoShilpa Rao says, “I think we need to look at the larger picture, and we need to be very cautious in the coming few weeks. We need to follow the advice that of our health experts and understand the fact that we are in a really unusual situation. More than anything, I believe that we can revive our economy, but not human lives.” Jubin Nautiyal cancelled his UK tour recently Was important to cancel our UK tour for the safety of our fans: Jubin NautiyalJubin Nautiyal, who cancelled his December 2021 UK tour, shares, “It’s just unfortunate that we are once again facing this situation, but postponing the concerts was a conscious decision taken for the safety of my fans. A couple of shows in India have been cancelled too.” Jubin adds that it is important to follow the guidelines that are being issued. “One thing we have learnt recently is to work from anywhere. Last time we were not as prepared, but now, with many of us fully vaccinated, we all have to be responsible and follow whatever guidelines are being issued by our government and health experts. That is the only way to keep moving ahead,” he says. Akriti Kakar says three of her gigs have been cancelled in January itselfIf this phase lasts for too long, it will severely impact those who depend entirely on live gigs: Akriti KakarAkriti Kakar says three of her gigs have been cancelled in January itself. “Just when we felt that things were getting better, with artistes travelling extensively, and weddings and concerts returning, this new variant came in to walk all over us again. I hope this phase passes soon and we can resume our work again. If it does not, then it will severely impact those who depend solely on live gigs, just like in the first and second wave,” she shares. Composer duo Sachin-Jigar shares that they have cancelled many of their gigs keeping the current situation in mindWe are hoping the covid situation improves by April-May: Sachin-JigarComposer duo Sachin-Jigar shares that they have cancelled many of their gigs keeping the current situation in mind. “The whole live entertainment industry will take a hit because of this situation. January to March was slated to be the peak shaadi season, but we are hoping the situation improves by April-May. The last two years have been terrible. We know a lot of musicians who left Mumbai and went back to their hometowns for alternative means of income.” Due to a surge in omicron cases, events across Delhi cancelled or postponed Delhi’s events calendar is also feeling the COVID impact with multiple events cancelled, rescheduled or postponed in the last two weeks. Apart from AP Dhillon’s Delhi concert and Prateek Kuhad’s show at CyberHub, the much-anticipated New Delhi World Book Fair, which was scheduled from January 8-15, has been postponed. India Art Fair - has been deferred too. It is now set to take place from April 28 to May 1. In the meantime, online sessions are being organised for art connoisseurs.

The FIR was registered at 7.40am on January 6 against unidentified people. There is no mention of the PM getting caught in the blockade and the case was registered under Section 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) of the IPC that stipulates a fine of Rs 200 for the guilty as punishment. The case was filed on police officer Birbal Singh’s complaint, who the FIR said reached the flyover at 2.30pm on January 5 — one-and-a-half hours after the PM got stuck, turned back to the airfield in Bathinda and returned from the poll-bound state without attending any event. Read AlsoClaims of PM Modi's security breach to deflect attention from Punjab issues, says Navjot Singh SidhuPunjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu has termed the reported claims of breach in security of Prime Minister Narendra Modi near Ferozepur on Wednesday as an effort to deflect attention from real issues of Punjab.The FIR said the inspector proceeded to the spot after being informed that unidentified people were holding a protest on the Moga-Ferpozepur road and, hence, the route for those on the way to a BJP rally was blocked. That included VIPs. Kulgari police station SHO Birbal Singh completed his duty, went to the police station and registered the case. Punjab BJP secretary Sukhpal Singh Sra said: “It is highly strange that the PM of the country gets stuck at 1.05pm and Ferozepur police got to know about the blockade only at 2.30pm. Then they took such a long time in registering the FIR.” The Punjab government sent a report on Friday to the MHA on the security breach, stating that state police have registered an FIR and a two-member committee was constituted to probe the case.

MHA deputy secretary Archana Varma issued a showcause notice to Bathinda SSP Ajay Maluja, asking him to reply by Saturday evening why action should not be initiated under All India Services (Discipline and Appeal), Rules, 1969, over the security lapse during the PM’s visit. Route clearance was given without adequately attending to security concerns pointed out at the meetings on January 1 and 2, the notice mentioned. As per the rule book and established procedures, the SP was mandated to make adequate arrangements for security and logistics during VVIP visits and build contingency plans by deploying an adequate number of security forces. The contingency rehearsal for the road journey from Air Force Station Bathinda to Ferozepur was carried out on January 4. Adequate security deployment was not made for the VVIP cavalcade’s movement the next day as the road was blocked with tractors and trolleys about 30km from the National Martyrs’ Memorial in Hussaniwala, the notice said. SSP Maluja said the role of Bathinda police was up to Jeeda village and that it was peaceful on that day. A three-member MHA team started its investigation in Punjab on Friday.

Meanwhile, Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said the incident happened due to the lack of coordination between the Punjab and central government agencies, “but the Sikhs are being targeted”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bid-to-malign-farmers-sikhs-farmer-organisations/articleshow/88765303.cms||Neel Kamal
---||India||Supreme Court asks Punjab and Haryana high court to seize records of PM Modi's Punjab trip security||NEW DELHI: In order to prevent tampering of official records, the Supreme Court on Friday ordered the registrar general of the Punjab and Haryana high court, assisted by the Chandigarh DGP and a senior NIA official, to immediately "seize, secure and preserve" all documents with the Punjab government and the central agencies relating to the security lapses leading to the PM's motorcade getting stuck over a flyover while ordering that the Centre and Punjab should cease their inquiries into the unprecedented episode. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli posted the PIL filed by advocates' body Lawyers Voice for further hearing on Monday, when it is likely to decide the nature of inquiry to be instituted and the composition of the panel to undertake the task. Accepting arguments of petitioners’ counsel and senior advocate Maninder Singh, who pointed out the political slugfest and blame game over the security lapse and requested for immediate judicial safe-keep of the relevant records and communications relating to the incident, the bench said, "Taking into consideration the arguments advanced by the parties with respect to the issues relating to the security of the PM and other related issues raised by them, we deem it appropriate for the time being to direct the registrar general, Punjab and Haryana high court, to secure and preserve the records relating to the PM’s tour of Punjab on January 5." The bench directed the Chandigarh DGP and an officer of the National Investigation Agency not below the rank of inspector general to be nominated by the chief of the anti-terror agency to assist the registrar general to "forthwith secure and seize the records from the state police as well as central agencies". Significantly, the court asked for the enlistment of the NIA after solicitor general Tushar Mehta raised the issue of possible implications of the inexplicable lapse for national security. Mehta said an unforeseen unfortunate fallout of the serious security lapse was providentially averted as the PM's motorcade got stuck on the flyover because of the road blockade in connivance of Punjab Police and traffic from the reverse side was allowed to approach the PM's vehicle. He drew the court's attention to the statement given by the head of banned terror organisation Sikhs For Justice ahead of the PM's Punjab visit and requested the court to treat it as a case of possible cross-border terrorism. Mehta said while the registrar general could be assigned the task of safe-keep of the official records of the Punjab government relating to the PM's visit, he needed to be assisted by the NIA for identifying the various sources in the Punjab government and police for collecting the official records as each and every relevant official was informed about the route to be taken by the PM's motorcade. "The incident had grave national security implications and a potential international embarrassment for India. A signal must go from the Supreme Court that such lapses cannot be condoned and accountability as well as responsibility would be fixed," he said. Punjab advocate general D S Patwalia said the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government too feels that it is a serious security lapse and that whosoever responsible for this should be identified and punished. He said the state was open to any independent investigation into the entire incident. The CJI-led bench ordered the Punjab government, including its police, the Special Protection Group (SPG) and other relevant central and state agencies to cooperate and provide the necessary assistance in securing and seizing of the relevant records. It directed the registrar general "to keep the records in his safe custody for the time being". Maninder Singh drew the court's attention to Section 14 of the SPG Act and said that all governments and their agencies are mandated to provide all assistance to the SPG in securing the life of the protectees and cited the SC's judgment upholding inviolability of the provisions of the SPG Act when it ordered a special court to be located in high-security Vigyan Bhavan for the trial of SPG protectee and former PM P V Narasimha Rao in the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case, in which self-proclaimed godman Chandraswami was the main accused. He also targeted the Justice Mehtab Singh Gill Committee appointed by the Channi government to probe the incident. Singh said Justice Gill was severely strictured by the SC in 2011 for attempting to target police in probing the recruitment scam in Punjab. He said the other member of the committee is the principal home secretary, who himself is in the dock for the lapses. The SG supported Singh and said the Punjab government should not have constituted the committee when it is an issue having implications on national security. Patwalia said that even the central inquiry committee had the SPG inspector general as a member who would also be in the dock for the lapse. "Let there be an independent and impartial probe into the incident. The Punjab government has nothing to hide and is not attempting to brush the serious issue under the carpet. We want the incident to be thoroughly investigated," the Punjab AG said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-asks-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-seize-records-of-pm-modis-punjab-trip-security/articleshow/88765400.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

However, economists warned of a possible adverse impact of the third wave of Covid-19 in the months ahead. This would be the fastest expansion since 1988-89, when the economy had expanded by 9.6% and comes on the back of a 7.3% contraction during the last financial year when growth had collapsed due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This would also be the fastest growth under the new methodology, data for which is available for 17 years. The data showed that nearly all sectors barring ‘trade, hotels, transport,communication and services related to broadcasting’ reached the pre-pandemic level. This projected growth rate would also help India retain its fastest-growing major economy tag. The economy has recovered after the bruising impact of the strict nationwide lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus led to a record 24.4% contraction during April-June 2020. The nominal GDP growth, including inflation, is estimated at 17.6%, according to the advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday. According to SBI research this is the second highest nominal growth since 19.9% nominal growth in 2010-11 and 17.1% in 2006-07. The size of the economy based on current prices in dollar terms is estimated to be $3.1 trillion. The NSO's GDP estimates are marginally lower than the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) projection. The central bank had estimated the economy to grow by 9.5% and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expects it to expand on similar lines. The government had budgeted for a double-digit growth during the current financial year. But the third wave led by the Omicron variant has cast a shadow on growth and the strength of the recovery. Several economists have trimmed their growth estimates for the full year and expect the curbs being imposed by states to impact businesses and overall growth. The NSO also cautioned that the 9.2% GDP growth estimate in the first advance estimates does not take into account a number of factors and impact of government measures could lead to revisions. "However, these are early projections for 2021-22. Actual performance of various indicators, actual tax collections and expenditure incurred on subsidies in the following months, fresh relief measures for the vulnerable sections (such as providing free food grains which has now been extended till March 2022) and other measures, if any, taken by the government to contain the spread of Covid-19 would have a breaking on subsequent revisions of these estimates," the NSO said. The Indian economy has staged a sharp recovery after the second wave and several indicators had reached their pre-pandemic level aided by measures taken by the government and the RBI.

Gurgaon has a total of 1,51,000 igible population for Covid vaccination in the age group. The district wants to give the first dose to all in this group by January 10.MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “We are working closely with all schools in the district. These students are being asked to come to the session sites by their respective schools. Also, because of the increase in Covid cases, the vaccination drive for children is witnessing some challenges as parents are reluctant to send their kids outside.”Virender Yadav, CMO Gurgaon claimed, “As schools are not functioning now, we are facing issues in calling children for the drive. We are vaccinating everyone who is coming to session sites.”Meanwhile, the health department is also preparing for a booster dose for health care, frontline workers and senior citizens. “We are preparing our teams for the booster dose vaccination drive. In all government health care centres across Gurgaon, there will be three session sites. One will be for 15-17 age group, second will be for 18 and above where people can get first and second doses of Covid vaccination and third will be for people who are eligible for booster,” said Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/city-needs-to-give-1l-jabs-to-meet-target-by-jan-10/articleshow/88765514.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Govt to roll out 550 buses this month to take girls to college||Gurgaon: The state education department and Haryana Roadways, jointly, will roll out nearly 550 buses this month in the first phase of a government project, aiming to provide free-of-cost transportation facilities to girls going to college.Last year, the state government had announced free-of-cost bus facilities for girl students in rural areas. The scheme will be launched in two phases, with the second phase focused on the extension of services to girls studying in schools, industrial training institutes and polytechnic colleges. “The chief minister had announced that the government would provide free bus services to all college-going women. In Phase 1, we connect all rural colleges with bus routes. Over 550 routes have got identified, and the roadways department will provide the buses required for this scheme,” said Anand Mohan Sharan, principal secretary, state higher education department. “In Phase 2, we wish to extend the service to girl students of schools, ITIs, and polytechnic institutes. Our vision is no girl student faces a commuting problem so that it does not become a hindrance in the continuance of higher studies,” he added.According to the roadmap prepared for the project, the roadways department of every district will hold a meet with institute heads to finalise the bus routes. Also, general managers of roadways will organise a monthly review meets in every district to track the work progress and take action to expand the scope of coverage.In December last year, the education department and the roadways consulted and gathered data on the number of girl students in the rural government colleges. After talks between the college heads and the roadways officials, over 550 routes got finalised based on this data. While the transport department has agreed to provide buses from its existing fleet, it, currently, is reviewing the proposal. “We are ready to lend our support to the government for this scheme. We have received the proposal, and currently, district depots are reviewing the availability of the buses and also the feasibility of routes,” said a roadways official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/govt-to-roll-out-550-buses-this-month-to-take-girls-to-college/articleshow/88765515.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Restaurateurs ask for relief on rentals||Gurgaon: Their business once again curtailed by restrictions, hoteliers and restaurateurs have sought relief on rentals and common area maintenance (CAM) charges from landlords and mall owners.Citing deep financial losses, the food and beverages industry has sought “a considerate resolution” to their problems. The industry has borne the brunt of the Covid-induced lockdowns. Since the new year, coinciding with the pandemic rearing its head again, restaurants and café owners have cited a drastic dip of 70% to 80% in their business in the past week to ask for relief. Several of them said the weekend lockdown in Delhi would affect their business further since weekends draw the highest footfalls and many of their patrons are Delhi residents. With malls in the city now closing at 6pm, outlets located within malls have to also close early.“The food and beverages industry has had a massive setback due to the pandemic. Just as things were shaping up in our interest, the new variant (Omicron) has dealt another blow. For the businesses to survive, all stakeholders have to come together. They have supported us in the past and we expect the same,” said Vishal Anand, founder of Moonshine Food Ventures in Sector 65 on Golf Course Extension Road.The National Restaurant Association of India, an umbrella body of several food and beverages businesses, in its letter to landlords and mall owners, has suggested a deliberation on the possibility of doing away with fixed rentals and adopting a revenue-share model for the period when restricted operations are imposed.“While the first two waves of pandemic crippled us badly and resource crunch forced many restaurants to shut down, we see a larger concern with this third wave as it may actually hurt consumer sentiment in the near term, which is already visible. With high fixed overheads, expected restrictions on operating hours, revised social distancing norms and reduced capacity utilisation, any drop in consumer sentiments can be catastrophic for the sector,” said NRAI president Kabir Suri.“It’s a sectoral problem and when the business has collapsed, we are facing challenges in meeting the fixed expenditures. It’ll be in the interest of everybody that we shift to a revenue-share model. Many have done so, but some are unwilling and we urge them to be considerate as we are all facing a crisis,” said Rahul Singh of the Beer Café.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/restaurateurs-ask-for-relief-on-rentals/articleshow/88765516.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||More ground coverage likely to be allowed in plots to curb violations||Gurgaon: In a major relief for plot owners and home developers, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) is likely to increase the ground coverage for plots measuring up to 250 sqm (300 sq yards) from 66 to 75%. Similarly, larger plots measuring up to 1,000 sqm may be allowed to have 66% ground coverage from the earlier 60%.With the increase in ground coverage, plot owners will be able to construct lifts, staircases and cutouts without compromising the floor area ratio (FAR), which in turn, officials believe, will help bring down violations and unauthorised construction in plotted areas. FAR is the ratio of a building’s gross floor area to the size of the piece of land on which it’s built. The DTCP, officials said, has already issued a public notice about bringing amendments to the Haryana Building Code 2017 and invited suggestions or objections from all the stakeholders within 30 days. Director of DTCP, KM Pandurang said the department has proposed amendments to the Haryana Building Code 2017, “and it will bring relief to the plot owners and home developers”. “If the property owners and builders still violate the norms and carry out unauthorised construction, the enforcement team will take strict action, including sealing and filing of FIRs against the offenders,” he said.Former president of the Gurgaon Home Developers and Plot Owners Association (GHDPOA), Ramesh Singla said, “The plot owners have long been demanding exclusion of staircases and lifts from FAR calculation, and it was a key reason for violation in plotted houses. Due to the stairs and lifts, which are common areas but included in the FAR, builders get less space to construct flats.”Of 264 FAR, Singla said, 24 gets utilized in stairs and lifts and builders get only 240 to construct flats. “We have had several meetings with the director of the town and country planning department in the past and we also wrote to the chief minister, and finally the demand has been accepted. This will bring the much needed relief to all the stakeholders,” he added. When asked about the benefits of increased ground coverage, a city-based real estate expert also said that the move will be of great help as lifts and staircases can be constructed without compromising on FAR. “The move will also help check violations and unauthorised construction by property owners to some extent,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/more-ground-coverage-likely-to-be-allowed-in-plots-to-curb-violations/articleshow/88765518.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

At five other designated sites, Friday prayers were offered peacefully.After weeks of protest over Friday prayers in the open by some outfits, the number of designated sites for namaz were reduced to just six. The Leisure Valley ground is one of them.The request to offer prayers indoors was made by Taukir Ahmad, the imam who has been organising the namaz at Leisure Valley. “This for the safety of everyone,” he said, and urged everyone to follow the guidelines issued by the government.Ahmad said namaz would not be organised in Sector 29 till further orders. “We will take a decision as and when the situation improves,” he added. Till now, neither police nor the administration has issued any directive regarding Friday prayers at the designated sites amid rising Covid cases.Salman Ali, who had come to offer namaz in Udyog Vihar, said there was no disruption. “Our imam has not given any directions so far for Friday prayers at this site till now,” said Ali.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/offer-namaz-indoors-in-covid-times-imam-to-group-at-sec-29/articleshow/88765520.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||GMDA to use jet patcher tech to repair roads||Gurgaon: With pollution wreaking havoc every winter and affecting several development and construction activities, including patchwork on roads, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is now working towards adopting ‘jet patcher technology’ for repairing potholes on its road network across the city. At present, the GMDA uses batch mix machines for this work. According to officials, a proposal to this effect was tabled in the meeting of the Core Planning Cell (CPC) of the GMDA earlier this week, where it was approved, with the GMDA deciding to adopt this technology for patchwork on all its roads in sectors 1 to 57 in the first phase of the project."At present, this technology is being used by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), but we are introducing it for the first time in the GMDA. The advantage of jet patcher technology is that it is a single unit that has all the facilities inbuilt. In normal patchwork, you need a roller, a paver, a compressor, but in this technique all of these are built in the same machine," said a senior GMDA official, adding that the fact that the technique does not require any wide machinery or equipment means that roads also do not need to be closed or traffic stopped to utilize it."This is an all-in-one unit which does not produce any dust and does not require a lot of manpower. Unlike the batch mix machines that we currently use, which cannot be operated during the construction ban because the plants that produce bituminous material get closed, this jet patcher technology can continue to be used even during this period because its operation is completely independent," said the official.Apart from the fact that it remains unaffected by the pollution ban, officials said the technology also has the advantage that it can be used in all weather conditions, unlike conventional methods of patchwork that can only be done in hot, dry weather, consequently becoming difficult to undertake during the monsoons and the winter season.These points were also highlighted when the matter was discussed during the CPC meeting earlier this week, where officials stated that this technology will enable the GMDA to undertake patchwork in any season, and will also allow for better compaction.Noting these advantages, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GMDA, Sudhir Rajpal, had directed officials to expedite the process of adopting this technology for meeting patchwork requirements, pointing out that it will ensure efficiency in repair of potholes and patches."The proposal to adopt this technology has been approved in the CPC meeting. It will be adopted in sectors 1 to 57 in phase 1. We will be inviting bids wherein we will give these sectors completely to the agency to maintain these roads, and they will undertake this task throughout the year," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gmda-to-use-jet-patcher-tech-to-repair-roads/articleshow/88765522.cms||Sakshi Dayal

He said as soon as demolition started, locals gathered at the site and tried to disrupt the drive. However, the police team present at the spot controlled and dispersed them. Batth further said the department has already written to local police to register FIR against a few builders, while the investigation is going on against others and recommendations will be made against them within a week. During the drive, the enforcement team also warned the locals not to make investments in such colonies as they might lose their hard-earned money. On Thursday, DTCP had written to Gurgaon police for registration of FIRs against 58 offenders who allegedly carved out nine illegal colonies on 32.5 acres of land in and around the city in the last six months. Out of nine complaints, three were in Sector 10A, five in Farrukhnagar and one in Rajendra Park. These illegal colonies, ranging from two to eight acres, have come up at Sultanpur, Gadoli Kalan, Farrukhnagar, Garhi Harsaru and Kherki Mazra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/eight-illegal-colonies-razed-in-farrukhnagar/articleshow/88765523.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

This, they say, has been causing difficulty in coordinating with those residents who are in need of essential services and monitoring Covid-19 protocol for those who are in home isolation. The RWAs have pointed out that in the previous two waves of Covid-19, the local administration was in constant touch with the RWAs but now no support has been provided despite the spike in cases."During the previous two Covid-19 waves, we were being informed about the Covid positive cases every evening. This would help our team of volunteers, who used to call the patients to know their well-being, help them with essential services such as food, medicines and other necessities. However, this time, the administration is not informing the RWAs at all. This becomes another reason for the spread as the patient’s family has to move out to meet their needs,” says Chaitali Mandhotra, member, Ardee City RWA.The RWAs said they were concerned because rarely do people who test positive volunteer that information and they often mix Covid waste with regular garbage which also increases chances of the infection spreading.Kusum Sharma, chairperson of all development committees, Suncity RWA, said, "Even the civic body has not started picking up biomedical waste and as a result of that, people mix it with regular garbage, which exposes waste collectors and residents to infection. They have notified containment zones but what is the use when there is no monitoring to ensure proper guidelines are being followed by those under home isolation."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/rwas-say-not-getting-info-on-covid-patients/articleshow/88765525.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Between January 1 and 7, the city added 6,254 cases, while from June to December 2021, it recorded 2,935 cases. The city had added the maximum number of cases (59,921) in April last year, followed by 57,012 in May, during the second wave. Before this, it added most cases in November 2020 (19,665) during the first wave. The city, meanwhile, crossed the 5,000 active cases mark on Friday, adding 1,879 new Covid cases. This is the highest spike since May 14 last year, when 2,144 people tested positive for the virus. The number of active cases now is 5,356, of which 36 patients are in hospitals. The current Covid hospitalisation rate is 1.9%. The daily positivity rate, which was at 5% on January 1, has risen to 17%. Gurgaon carried out 11,008 tests on Friday. To manage the fast-multiplying number of home isolation patients, the health department has segmented the city into nine units, based on its primary health centres, and put a health unit in charge of each, so that it becomes easier for doctors to monitor infected people recovering at home. Each unit has eight members, including medical officers, pharmacists, and auxiliary nursing midwives. “The units are visiting the patients on every alternate day. They are checking the temperature and oxygen saturation levels and giving them Ayush medicines and isolation pamphlets,” chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said. A dedicated team is also calling each patient in home isolation to monitor their health. On Friday, Haryana reported 3,748 new cases. It has so far reported 123 Omicron cases, nine of those on Friday. Out of the 123 cases, 31 are active while 92 have been discharged after recovery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/covid-cases-in-7-days-of-jan-more-than-double-last-7-months-count/articleshow/88765526.cms||Ipsita Pati

Officials said some 741 untraceable contacts were reported in a single day on January 5 and 281 on January 6.“We start the contact tracing a day after the cases are reported. Now that the cases are increasing and we have to call all the positive patients, we call at least two times.

With high fixed overheads, expected restrictions on operating hours, revised social distancing norms and reduced capacity utilisation, any drop in consumer sentiments can be catastrophic for the sector,” said NRAI president Kabir Suri.“It’s a sectoral problem and when the business has collapsed, we are facing challenges in meeting the fixed expenditures. It’ll be in the interest of everybody that we shift to a revenue-share model. Many have done so, but some are unwilling and we urge them to be considerate as we are all facing a crisis,” said Rahul Singh of the Beer Café.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/restaurateurs-seek-for-relief-on-rentals/articleshow/88765531.cms||---

Villagers from Karauli Bangar, who have been opposing the acquisition of their abadi and agricultural land, demonstrated with banners at the camp that was organised at the local intercollege. The villagers have also been demanding that the government revise its rehabilitation and resettlement policy. “In case, the terms and conditions of the policy are revised to offer a fair deal to the villagers, we can reconsider our decision. But the existing compensation being offered and the rehabilitation policy is just not acceptable,” said Dharmendra Siwach of Nagla Hukum Singh village. He is a member of the appraisal committee constituted by the state government.The farmers have also submitted a letter with the tehsildar of Jewar sub-division, laying down 12 demands. A total of 475 people from Nagla Hukum Singh village have opposed the land acquisition in writing, while only eight to 10 persons have given their consent. A similar response was seen at the second camp at Mundhera village, where 80% of the population were against the acquisition. In Mundhera, only 120 to 125 land chunks that are predominantly agricultural are required for the project while in Karauli Bangar, more than 2,000 land parcels have to be taken over. But the consent of 70% villagers will have to be taken for the acquisition to begin.Additional district magistrate (land acquisition) Balram Singh said that on Saturday and Monday, camps would be organised at the remaining four villages.“The officials from Jewar tehsil will compile their report on Friday’s camp. We will go through the overall report that will be prepared only after all the six villages have been covered by January 10. We will decide our next course of action based on that,” said Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-airport-villagers-stage-protest-at-camp/articleshow/88765537.cms||---

---||Noida||Week on, no trace of car that chased lawyer’s family||Noida: A week after a few miscreants chased a lawyer, his wife and two kids and hurled liquor bottles at their Audi, police are yet to trace the car of the accused or make any arrests. On New Year’s-eve, Shonak Sharma, a resident of Sector 51, was out with his wife and children, aged 4 and 9, for dinner when a Verna coming from the wrong side came dangerously close to hitting his parents’ car. Moments after Sharma had objected to the rash driving, the accused had chased him a white Verna, hurling liquor bottles at his Audi. One of the bottles had smashed the rear windshield of Sharma’s car. “The lawyer could not note down the car’s number. We scanned CCTV footage of nearby areas to identify the car. We have got a glimpse of the car in a couple of videos but the number is not clear in them. Several teams are working to identify the car and nab the miscreants,” said Anjani Kumar Singh, the SHO of Sector 49 police station. Sharma expressed concern that the accused could not be nabbed even after a week. “They haven’t even identified the car till now. When will they arrest the accused? No one from the police station has shown me the CCTV clips nor has anyone came to check my car. For the first 3-4 days, I didn’t get the windshield repaired, but when no one showed up, I got a new rear glass,” he added. Sharma said his kids were still scared to go out. “My kids had been traumatised after the incident. The very next day, I had sent my children and wife to my in-laws’ house so that they could forget the episode. They are back now, but still scared to step out of the house,” he said. Sharma’s Audi was chased between 9.15pm and 9.45pm, when the police had claimed to have made adequate security arrangements for New Year’s-eve. Sources in the police said at least 10 cameras had been placed by each police station for better policing. The traffic police, they added, have their own set of cameras. However, the stretch where the Audi was chased does not have any. Residents highlighted several loopholes in the system. “Noida is considered a hi-tech city, but even then, police have failed to either trace the car or nab the accused after a week. Every time, projects worth several crores are announced, but nothing is done on the ground. Even the commissionerate system was brought in to curb street crime. Tall claims about smart policing were made, but nothing has been done so far,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary of the Sector 51 RWA. He said it was a cause for concern that there was no camera on the stretch between Sector 51 and Iskcon temple, where the accused gave up the chase. “Chasing a car and throwing seven to eight liquor bottles at it when the police claimed to have made adequate security arrangements is a shame. We want the administration, government and the police to install more cameras and make the general public feel safer,” he added. Last year in January, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had inaugurated the “Safe City” project, under which the district was supposed to get 1,600 cameras — 250 of them in the first phase — for monitoring of public spaces.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/week-on-no-trace-of-car-that-chased-lawyers-family/articleshow/88765542.cms||Advitya Bahl

The Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), which has 80 apartments as its members, has arranged for vaccinations from January 8 to 16 at seven apartment complexes — Omaxe Twin Towers Sector 50, Macon Apartment Sector 62, Purvanchal Royal Park Sector 137, Ajnara Grand Heritage Sector 74, Aditya Celebrity Homes Sector 76, Exotica Fresco Sector 137 and Antriksh Greens Sector 50.The Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association (FONRWA), which has around 180 member RWAs, has written to Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Suneel Kumar Sharma, asking for vaccination camps in residential sectors, particularly for senior citizens, domestic staffers and others engaged in various services who are waiting for their second doses. The RWA association has also demanded the suspension of weekly markets, citing the crowds they draw. One of the markets mentioned in the communication to district magistrate Suhas LY is the one in Sector 34. “We have written to Dr Sharma, requesting him to make necessary arrangements for vaccination of domestic staff such as drivers, guards, dhobis, maids and others as well as senior residents who have not been able to get the second dose. Since the number of Covid patients is increasing every day, people are hesitant to visit a hospital or a clinic for fear of catching the infection,” said KK Jain, secretary of the FONRWA. “We also requested that the Covid helpline should function smoothly so that necessary information can be given to patients,” said Jain.The DM told TOI the administration’s focus is on monitoring daily spikes in cases, hospitalisation numbers and oxygen support. “We have issued an advisory for Covid-appropriate behaviour. Apart from that, we are monitoring hospital admissions. Currently, the numbers are low and hardly any patient requires ICU care due to recent infections. However, we will take necessary steps as and when required. For the time being, we are following the state guidelines of closure of gyms, swimming pools and water parks while restaurants and cinema halls are to operate at 50% capacity,” said Suhas LY.As of now, there are no orders on common areas of societies and no restrictions on entry of domestic staff. Several RWAs have issued their own advisories to residents to inform them about any Covid case in the sector or complex.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/rwas-want-vax-camps-a-stop-to-weekly-markets/articleshow/88765543.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Mumbai||NEET counselling for PG candidates begins this wk||Mumbai: With Supreme Court clearing the decks for medical counselling, the health ministry has drawn up the admission counselling schedule for postgraduate candidates which is slated to begin from the coming week.This year, for the first time, counselling for DNB seats will also be simultaneously carried out along with PG admissions by the Medical Counselling Committee. A senior official from the health ministry confirmed that four rounds of the all-India quota will be conducted.Based on the affidavit filed by the ministry of health and family welfare,SC has directed the MCC of the Directorate General of Health Services to conduct admissions to 50% postgraduate seats under the all-India quota (AIQ) in four rounds. This will mean that in addition to the first two all-India rounds, mop-up and stray vacancy rounds will also be conducted for 2021-22 admissions. Earlier, only the all-India rounds were conducted by MCC and the vacant seats were returned to the state. That will not be the case and all seats under the AIQ will be filled by the MCC.After the AIQ rounds, states will conduct their admission process and the entire counselling schedule should take about two months. Candidates who were to start their class in May 2021, will only do so by March 2022. The SC on Friday cleared the decks for PG medical counselling and admissions, and included the 27% OBC and 10% EWS reservations in the all-India quota for the current academic year. “It has been a delay of over 10 months. An entire year went by, following which the SC ruled that admissions for this year would continue with the OBC and EWS quota. It has left us parents and students feeling that this is justice delayed and justice denied,” said Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative. Ten petitioners from Maharashtra, who had moved SC, are planning to file a review petition.'“The all-India quota was carved out to have seats that are domicile free and only based on merit. Now, the entire purpose of having an AIQ is defeated with these reservations,” said Dr Uday Dhople, one of the petitioners. India has about 20,000 PG medical seats and 10,000 go to the AIQ. With the OBC (2,500) and EWS (1,000) reservation, 3,500 seats will be out of the general category pool.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/neet-counselling-for-pg-candidates-begins-this-wk/articleshow/88765545.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Sharing statistics with the media, the officials said that there were very few power theft cases during the previous lockdowns in 2020 and early 2021 as there was no vigilance staff to visit the sites and most of them were contamination zones. After the second wave last year, the MSEDCL vigilance team conducted various surprise checks in Mulund, Bhandup, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pen-Panvel and nabbed offenders for power thefts to the tune of total Rs 19 crore. Chief engineer Suresh Ganeshkar said, “We cracked some good cases over the past nine months. We also checked for all meter readings which were in the range of 0-30 to ensure that there was no tampering.” The MSEDCL flying squad has detected a massive power theft by a plastic granule and powder making unit in Vavanje, near Taloja MIDC, which has been stealing power for over 29 months Another key power theft case detected by the vigilance squad was when it booked a businessman in two offences in Panvel in less than a week in December.

TDR is a form of currency created by the BMC that allows the developer to use the FSI granted by the BMC on another plot.Advocate Godfrey Pimenta criticised the decision to build the PAPs on BMC land pointing out that the BMC as custodian of public property cannot simply give it away to developers. “There are PAP tenements available in slum redevelopment schemes. BMC must avail of them or purchase them from the market. Land is a very valuable commodity and the BMC already admits it does not have the financial werewithal to purchase land,” he said.Meanwhile in another development, in order to increase the number of transit tenements for Slum Rehabilitation Schemes, the state urban development department has decided to calculate FSI on the gross plot area instead of the net plot area. The government will now not provide compensation for the setback area which is to be compulsorily given for road widening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-to-construct-700-tenements-for-paps/articleshow/88765552.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Jailed goon demands 1cr from bizman||MUMBAI: Incarcerated gangster Uday Pathak continues to terrorise businessmen and shopowners in the western suburbs despite being behind bars for a decade. On Thursday, a businessman was stunned to receive a letter at his Malad East store demanding a sum of Rs 1 crore, else pay with his life. He rushed to the Kurar police station where a case of extortion was registered. No arrests have been made as yet. "The complainant runs an imitation jewellery business. The letter was sent to him on Pathak's behalf and came via post. The businessman had previously been threatened by Pathak in 2020, again via a letter demanding money. We had made some arrests back then. This is the second time he is being threatened with dire consequences," a police official said, adding that Pathak clearly had men operating on his instructions outside prison. Pathak, originally from Uttar Pradesh, was arrested in connection with the quadruple murders in Kurar village, Malad East, in 2011. The four victims, who had a fight with Pathak over a minor issue, were tortured, their throats slit, and bodies burnt and dumped atop a hill in Kurar. The case had sent shock waves across the city for its brutality. Pathak has been booked in a dozen other major offences.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/jailed-goon-demands-1cr-from-bizman/articleshow/88765553.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ISIS case: 8 years in jail for duo who pleaded guilty||MUMBAI: Two men, who had allegedly instigated youths from Malwani to join the terror group ISIS, have been sentenced to 8 years in prison. They had recently pleaded guilty before the special NIA court conducting the trial, and the court on Wednesday accepted them as guilty. The special Judge AT Wankhede had on Wednesday accepted the guilty plea and posted the case for their sentencing on Friday. The court heard their counsel, AR Bukhari, on the quan-tum of sentence as well as special public prosecutor (SPP), Prakash Shetty, before fixing the sentence to 8 years’ rigorous im-prisonment. Bukhari argued that the mitigating circumstance far outweigh the aggravating circumstances and hence sought leniency in sentencing, saying their age and acceptance of guilts should be considered in their favour while deciding the quantum of pun-ishment. The SPP Shetty argued that though they accepted their guilt, since the offence under section 20 of the anti-terror law UAPA itself is a serious one, punishment should be proportionate. The section 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, says any person as a member of a terrorist gang or organisation, which is involved in terrorist acts, shall be punishable with im-prisonment for a term which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. Charges were framed against the duo accused Rizwan Ahmed (25) and Mohsin Sayyed (32) in 2018. When pleading guilty after spending almost six years in jail, the two men accused of instigation, said they were “remorseful’’ and wanted to return to mainstream society and rehabilitate themselves. Their advocate had submitted that the duo was “merely involved in propagation of the banned terrorist organi-sation and never involved in any kind of violence or killings’’. The advocate said they deserve a chance to reform as they were then immature and influenced by ISIS propaganda videos online and sought leniency from the court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/isis-case-8-yrs-in-jail-for-duo-who-pleaded-guilty/articleshow/88765554.cms||Swati Deshpande

The complainant, Rahul Agarwal (22) has stated in his police complaint that he had a suspicion as the caller did not sound like his relative, but the caller claimed that his voice had gone hoarse due to the cold he contracted as he was infected with Covid. The police said that Agarwal, a student of a drama school, has claimed that he did not have the brother-in-law’s cellphone number. Also, the ‘Covid’ theory convinced him and he transferred the money. When TOI called up the student, the call got disconnected. Officials of Powai police station said that this is a new category of ‘Covid fraud’ through which people are being duped. A case has been registered based on on Agarwal’scomplaint filed on Thursday. Agarwal, a resident of Delhi, has been staying as a paying guest for the past month. The police said they have sought call data records from the cellphone service provider company and details of the bank account to which the money was sent on January 2. In his complaint, Agarwal has said that the caller identified himself as his brother-in-law Harsh and even gave out information of his other family members.” A police officer said that the caller told Agarwal that he was needed the money due to some problem in his account. “He said he was awaiting funds from a client and would return the amount the same evening. As Agarwal failed to get the money until later that evening, he called up the brother-in-law in Delhi and found out that he had never called to ask for any money,” said the officer. A case has been registered against the unidentified caller.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-hit-kin-dupes-drama-student-of-45k/articleshow/88765555.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra GR: Report Pocso cases to welfare panel or court in 24 hrs||MUMBAI: A month after the Bombay high court pulled up the police for a 45-day delay in an underage rape survivor getting a procedure done under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, the state issued a government resolution (GR) on January 3 on steps and procedures to be followed by the police in all such cases of crimes against women and children and handle such cases with sensitivity. The state on Tuesday informed the HC that according to the GR, all cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act are to be reported to the Child Welfare Committee or a special juvenile court within 24 hours. The state further said it has sent police officers for special training to increase sensitivity of the force towards rape survivors. The GR also mandated that if the rape survivor is a minor, the complaint must be made in his or her own language, in his or her own words, in front of the survivor and his /her relatives, and a female sub-inspector of police and the medical examination must be done swiftly. Each police station should have an independent child welfare police officer, it added. As the minor rape survivor was not produced by the police for 45 days, during which her pregnancy advanced from almost 24 weeks to over 30 weeks, the HC had, in its December 8 order, said, “This is unacceptable from any perspective. The action of police needs an explanation.” On Tuesday, the HC was informed that the newborn’s condition was stable and was shifted to an adoptive agency, Children of the World, at Nerul, on December 29. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, for the state, informed a bench of Justices G S Patel and Madhav Jamdar that the district legal services authority has paid interim compensation to the girl on December 22. The HC said the rape survivor’s lawyer Ashley Cusher can reconfirm this and directed that the process for full and final compensation be expedited. According to the GR, the state must train all investigating officers to provide financial and rehabilitation benefits to rape survivors, including children, and the proposals from those eligible for financial assistance under the Manodhairya Yojana must be submitted to the district legal services authority within the time frame specified. The GR also stated that basic training to police, including new recruits, must have a special module under the Pocso Act, 2012, and Child Justice, and workshops be held to increase sensitivity of the force towards survivors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-gr-report-pocso-cases-to-welfare-panel-or-court-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88765556.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man dials cops, threatens to blow up 2 railway stations||MUMBAI: Security agencies went into a tizzy after an anonymous caller dialled the Mumbai Police’s control room on Thursday evening and said he was going to explode a “nuclear bomb”. The caller also said that his targets were two railway stations, an actor’s home and a religious institution. Bomb disposal squads and canine squads were pressed into action but nothing was found amiss. It turned out that the caller was a 40-year-old man from Madhya Pradesh who was disturbed over family issues. He had allegedly made another hoax call to the Madhya Pradesh police the same day. No formal charges have been pressed against him in Mumbai so far. Around 6.20 pm on Thursday, the south control room of the Mumbai Police received the call. The caller spoke in Hindi and claimed he was an “army man”. He said that a nuclear bomb was set to go off at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Kurla railway station, a Bollywood actor’s home at Bandra and a gurdwara at Kharghar. The information was immediately passed on to the Anti-Terrorism Squad, the railway police, Intelligence Bureau, Railway Protection Force, Navi Mumbai police and state intelligence department. “We carried out thorough checks at CSMT and Kurla station. Canine squads were brought inside long-distance trains for checks besides scanning platforms,” said an officer. Meanwhile, the railway police started tracking the caller’s location. The calls were traced to Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. Investigators then went through records of previous calls made by the man. Some of the phone numbers were of police stations in Madhya Pradesh. “We dialled the police stations in MP. The officers gave us the identity of the caller and said he would keep harassing them with hoax calls from time to time. Preventive action had been taken against him by the MP police in the past. He was not very regular at his job at a private company, we learnt,” an officer said. A tweet by Mumbai Government Railway Police commissioner Quaiser Khalid about the hoax call mentioned that they carried out checks but nothing suspicious was found. The tweet said they located the caller at Jabalpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/man-dials-cops-threatens-to-blow-up-2-railway-stns/articleshow/88765558.cms||Nitasha Natu

In a tweet BJP MLA Ashish Shelar who has been alleging corruption in the payments for the coastal road, has warned against devastating the lives of the fishermen. Referring to the online meeting called by environment minister and Worli assembly constituency MLA Aditya Thackeray, Shelar said it was an eyewash as the Thackeray government would ultimately go ahead with what has already been planned. He warned the government to be prepared to face dire consequences if it destroys the Koli community.“Mumbai has around 35 koliwadas and nearly 80 gaothans on its 110-km coastline. Some Koliwadas like Dharavi and Sion have already lost their identity due to reclamation. The fisherfolk who are staying here for centuries are deprived of all the benefits which otherwise Mumbaikars even those who have migrated to the city from other parts of the country enjoy. Rules like Coastal Regulation Zone and the lack of provisions in the development control regulations (DCR) make it difficult for them to construct better houses whereas people from other parts of the country are allowed to stay in pre-2000 slums," he said. He alleged that the community has not received financial aid though it was badly hit by the Tauktae cyclone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-backs-worli-fishermen-against-state-govts-coastal-road-project/articleshow/88765559.cms||---

He was granted medical bail last February for six months and time was then extended several times to surrender as he applied for extension of bail, citing poor health. On Friday, the HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar orally said, “You know that the third wave, experts say, may survive for 50-60 days. Frontline workers and police personnel are testing positive for Covid-19. The figures were not the same as the first or second wave. Is it possible that in such a wave he [Rao] should be sent to jail? We will hear you on merits. Give us some breathing space.” Rao (82) was allowed on the last date to surrender by January 7. On Friday, the matter was listed. At the hearing, the counsel for National Investigation Agency (NIA) initially sought deferring the hearing to next week. NIA counsel Sandesh Patil said that as the plea was served only on Thursday, additional solicitor general Anil Singh could not be briefed for the NIA and sought a short adjournment. Justice Shinde said, “This is high time. Take full care. The [Covid] spread is rapid and fast. We are seriously concerned about all stakeholders in the system including staff, advocates. Fortunately, in Maharashtra and Mumbai, the Centre, state and BMC and other local bodies are doing a wonderful job... We have to respect their work.” On December 17 last year, Nanavati Hospital had submitted a written clinical summary on Rao’s health, stating that his neurological condition was normal and that “he is able to perform activities of daily living”. Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for Rao, sought that the earlier interim order allowing more time to return to jail be extended at least till further hearing, which the court accepted and posted hearing to February 4. Grover said when granting Rao bail earlier this year, another division bench of the HC had analysed Nanavati Hospital’s report which too at the time had said he was fit for discharge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-gives-varavara-until-feb-5-to-surrender/articleshow/88765561.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 96% of patients on oxygen beds haven’t taken even 1 jab, says BMC commissioner||MUMBAI: BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal on Friday said that vaccination works and civic data shows that 96% of the 1,900-odd patients currently on oxygen beds in Mumbai have not taken even a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, the BMC has decided that unlike the first and second waves where positivity was the benchmark to impose a lockdown or restrictions, in the third wave further curbs would be imposed only if there is a burden of a high hospitalisation rate and a steep rise in oxygen usage. “Ninety-six per cent of the patients who are admitted on oxygen beds in 186 hospitals of Mumbai are unvaccinated. Otherwise, we have seen so far that vaccinated people are not reaching ICUs. We have 21 lakh vaccine stocks available with us. The current hurdle in ensuring the entire adult population is vaccinated is the 84-day gap required between the two doses. Today, too, our vaccination percentage is the best in India,” Chahal said in a TV interview. He said people should not think of the Omicron variant as a flu, adding if unvaccinated it definitely can take an infected person to the ICU. The BMC has administered both the doses to more than one crore people in Mumbai while close to 90 lakh have received one vaccine shot.  Chahal also reiterated further restrictions would be imposed in the third wave only if there is a burden of hospitalisation and oxygen use increases steeply. On Covid-related deaths, Chahal said they were in control with 19 deaths in the past 16 days. “Even though Mumbai has one lakh active cases as on date, only 10 tonne of oxygen is being used. During the second wave, oxygen manufacturing by the BMC was zero but this time we have 400 tonne of oxygen storage and 200 tonne of our own manufacturing, of which only 10 tonne is being used. Only if there is pressure (on healthcare), restrictions will be considered. But today 84% of hospital beds are vacant and of the 20,000 cases reported in Mumbai yesterday (January 6), only 102 persons were put on oxygen beds as a matter of precaution.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/chahal-96-of-patients-on-o2-beds-havent-taken-even-1-jab/articleshow/88765565.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RT-PCR tests jump 3-4 fold, results taking up to 72 hrs||MUMBAI: The BMC might have set a 24-hour deadline for RT-PCR test reports after sample collection, but patients queuing up at laboratories say the turnaround time has gone up to 48-72 hours. Laboratories blamed the delay on an exponential rise in sample load within days and several of their staffers getting Covid themselves. “The diagnostics centre in Shivaji Park, Dadar, that I went to on Friday morning for RT-PCR tests told me I will get a report only on Monday,” said Rosaline Sequeira (name changed on request). “They told me other testing centres too wouldn’t be able to issue a report within 24 hours due to the huge sample load,” she said. It is in contravention of the January 1 order in which the municipal commissioner made it clear RT-PCR turnaround time should not exceed 24 hours (from the time a swab sample is collected by a lab to result declaration to the BMC). A senior doctor from KEM Hospital quipped that given the nature of Omicron, many may become symptom-free by the time test reports arrive in 3-4 days. A civic official overseeing testing data said barring 4-5 laboratories, most are able to deliver reports in 24 hours. “We try to monitor but there are over 120 labs in the city doing Covid tests,” said the official. A positive report is communicated to the BMC first and subsequently to the individual, which takes up another few hours. The city is carrying out more than 60,000 to 70,000 tests now, including 16,000 antigen tests. Kannan Alangadan, COO of Metropolis Healthcare, said the lab was handling volumes close to the peak of the Delta wave. “Tests have gone up three-fold compared to three weeks ago,” he said, adding they have set up a dedicated Covid-19 team to ensure reports are sent within the 24-hour timeline. The lab has seen an over 40% day-on-day jump in sample collection in the past six days. From 3,608 on Tuesday, samples rose to 5,153 on Wednesday and 7,186 on Thursday. Many labs are facing shortage of manpower as some of their technicians, collection agents are isolating after testing positive. Anand K, CEO of SRL Diagnostics, said they are currently coping with the load but a further rise will put their systems under strain. “We are doing everything in our capacity to deliver reports on time despite seeing a four-fold increase in the number of tests when compared to three weeks ago,” he told TOI. The lab is testing 30,000 samples daily across 23 of its facilities across India. Sales of home testing kits have gone up multifold in the city. The civic official said nearly 3,000 reports are communicated to them everyday but the actual number of tests done is much higher. “The onus is on people to report to us,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rt-pcr-tests-jump-3-4-fold-results-taking-up-to-72-hrs/articleshow/88765566.cms||Manju V
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3rd wave may see large-scale undercounting of cases in children||MUMBAI: There could be significant undercounting of Covid-19 cases among children due to very limited testing in this age group, more so in the third wave where so far symptoms have appeared to be less severe or absent in a majority.  Barely 2,620 infections have been reported in children in the 1-10 age bracket in the state between December 20 and January 6. Incidentally, in this limited span of 18 days, more than 1.4 lakh new Covid-19 cases were reported in Maharashtra and evidently younger children accounted for less than 2% of the detections. Another 8,935 cases were reported in the 11-20 age group, according to an analysis of age-wise classification of positive cases routinely done by the medical education department.  The numbers, though, don’t corroborate with the situation on the ground, where doctors are treating dozens of kids in their outpatient departments or through online consultation. Several child specialists admitted they don’t write tests for younger children unless the symptoms are severe or persistent, and as long as adults at home test positive.  Dr Bakul Parekh, a member of the paediatric task force, said he was seeing a huge number of children with fever, cough, cold and chills at his Ghatkopar clinic. From 12-20-odd before the start of the third wave with flu-like symptoms, the daily count of children at his clinic has touched nearly 60 in the past 7-10 days. About 80% complain of fever and turn up a positive result when checked for Covid. “If parents or other adults in the family are positive, I don’t test kids. It unnecessarily creates panic.”  Dr Tanu Singhal, a paediatric infectious expert at Kokilaben Hospital, is treating several children with symptoms, particularly fever that lasts for a day or two. She also doesn’t test if there is an infected adult in the house or asks for an antigen in cases where no other adult is infected in the house. But she says a fever that persists beyond three to four days must be evaluated. “We had a case where the child was repeatedly tested for Covid because his fever wouldn’t subside. It turned out to be typhoid fever,” Dr Singhal said. The severity of symptoms in children has remained unchanged since the Delta wave, when children mostly saw mild infections unlike adults.  Hospitalisations too are insignificant. Paediatrician Dr Bijal Srivastava said she has not admitted a single child out of more than 200 she must have consulted in the fortnight. “We only tell parents to remain watchful of high fever, rashes and breathlessness, which would be signs of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (a rare complication that appears 2-5 weeks after Covid infection),” she said. Dr Parekh said only two needed admission for observation since one was obese and another diabetic. In the total infections of 66.7 lakh since the start of the pandemic, children aged 1-10 have accounted for 3.19% cases and 11-20 for 7.5%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3rd-wave-may-see-large-scale-undercounting-of-cases-in-children/articleshow/88765567.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Non-essential activities should be stopped,” said Tope. However, CM Uddhav Thackeray had to give his approval to the proposal, he said. On malls, hotels and restaurants, he said, “There may be no immediate decision. But night activities will need to be looked at.” Meanwhile, the state government is considering shutting all tourist destinations in the city, said Mumbai island city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh. These include Gateway of India, Hanging Gardens, museums, the aquarium, and boat rides to Elephanta island. “These places attract tourists by the busloads, and many of them are school and college students. We do not want infection rates to go up,” he told TOI. Tope said police had been told to take action against crowds. “The police should impose fines if there is crowding. They have been instructed to take action in case of crowding. There are curbs but they need to be implemented,” said Tope. He also said crowding at places of worship and political, social and religious events had to be avoided. On rise in infection among healthcare workers, Tope said they had been given staggered duties to prevent infection. He reiterated there was no need for a lockdown at this stage. “Only if demand for oxygen crosses 700 metric tonnes and over 40% beds are occupied, in auto mode we will head for a lockdown. But the usage of hospital beds is within 15% of capacity and oxygen demand is low,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/health-dept-proposes-night-curfew-cm-yet-to-give-nod/articleshow/88765568.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

There are now 111 Covid positive cases of which 30 have been discharged in the past couple of days and 81 are undergoing treatment, an official said. On Friday, surgeon Dr Bomi Pardiwalla, who took the AC electric bus on the Grant Road ring route, complained about the driver not wearing a mask. “It is not just flouting rules by not wearing a mask, but the driver also told me that he was not fully vaccinated. On one hand, the BEST is checking for double-vaccine certificates of commuters and on the other, its own staff is not fully vaccinated,” he pointed out.

---||Mumbai||As attendance must, unvaxxed teachers a concern for schools||MUMBAI: Even as parents are being persuaded to get their children inoculated against Covid, schools are struggling with unvaccinated teachers. The state government has allowed only fully vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff to report to physical campuses. Class 10 and 12 teachers are working offline to complete practical and practice tests before the boards begin in March-April. Most schools have a few teachers who are refusing to get vaccinated despite not having any medical reasons. Though unvaccinated teachers have been told to attend campuses with a negative RT-PCR report, it is becoming difficult to get tested every week. “Two of my teachers, who teach key subjects, refuse to get vaccinated. They report being sick when they have to make it to school and it becomes difficult to find a replacement,” said the principal of a Mahim school. Some schools have written to the government seeking clarification on teachers who are not vaccinated without any medical history. A few schools have even asked such teachers to resign. “It is difficult to get a substitute teacher. Our science and mathematics teachers are not vaccinated. They are attending school with negative RT-PCR reports,” said the principal of a Vile Parle school. As the rule for 100% physical attendance of teachers on campus remains, schools want the state to switch to 50% attendance so that unvaccinated teachers can login from home. Shivnath Darade, secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Samiti, has written to the government to shut down schools where teaching and non-teaching staff have tested positive. Many schools are urging the government to move class 10 and 12 students online till they are fully inoculated. “Vaccinated degree students are at home and unvaccinated children are attending school. The risk is high,” said a Bandra school principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/as-attendance-must-unvaxxed-teachers-a-concern-for-schools/articleshow/88765572.cms||Sandhya Nair

The requirement is for 1,610 posts that include 10 MD doctors (medicine), 5 microbiologists, 10 intensivists and 473 staff nurses, among others. The monthly remuneration honorarium ranges from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh. So far, NMMC has a staff strength of 1,911 in the civic health department which is inadequate given the increase in fresh Covid cases daily. Over 6,000 new cases have been detected in the last one week.As the number of Covid-19 patients continues to rise in the city, the NMMC, which is short staffed now, has restructured its recruitment plan of doctors and paramedical staff to strengthen the health department. According to NMMC sources, the remuneration has been quite handsome as compared to earlier offers for last year’s recruitment. And the administration is hoping for a good turnout of aspirants to serve the people at the time of need. “We have already started the interview process and it will complete in the next few days,” said Dr Pramod Patil, medical officer of health (MOH), NMMC.With the testing of Covid samples expedited, NMMC wants to recruit 7 lab technicians and an equal number of junior lab technicians. The minimum contractual tenure will be for a period of 6 months which can be extended as per Covid-19 situation, said NMMC officials. “Looking at the ground reality, we have chalked out plans to recruit a good number of doctors and paramedical staff to square up the deficit of manpower. We have intensified our containment strategy while carrying out more RT-PCR and antigen tests for which more manpower is needed,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/nmmc-to-now-recruit-more-docs-paramedics-to-fight-covid-crisis/articleshow/88765580.cms||---

The company’s power usage led to suspicion and probe. A total of over Rs 1.02 crore penalty has been levied against the owners, beside a police complaint. The accused company was illegally bypassing the electric supply from its registered power metre in order to doctor monthly bills and reduce the total amount paid to MSEDCL.The company, Jupiter Enterprises, was given connection for a 170KW demand but its monthly electricity billing and power usage raised suspicion, and so the flying squad of MSEDCL Vashi circle made a surprise visit to the company premises at Taloja.“The power consumption pattern of the company, owned by Jameel Siddiqui and Javed Siddiqui, raised our doubt. Its consumption was only 2 units in December and 10 in November last year, which is unusually less,” said Shashank Pantaone, additional executive engineer, flying squad.“Upon further inquiry, we found that the company has been functioning at full capacity by bypassing the meter connection since 2019. They drew power using metre between 1st and 5th of every month when MSEDCL team normally went for metre reading,” added Pantaone.The company has collectively stolen 7,35,102 units of power worth over Rs 1.02 crore as per the FIR filed. A complaint has been filed against the two owners under Electricity Act section 135 for stealing power which may lead to imprisonment of not less than 6 months and can exceed to 5 years. Javed Siddiqui did not respond to queries till the time of the paper going to press.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/taloja-midc-co-steals-power-worth-1-02cr-over-two-years/articleshow/88765582.cms||Umesh K Parida

The police said that the accused used to order high-end electronic items from popular e-tailer websites using different SIM cards. "The accused would then hand over cash of lesser denominations so it would take the delivery boy more time to count. While he was busy counting the notes, one of them would take out the gadget and replace it with soap bars and seal it again. They would then make the claim for the products they had ordered,” said a police officer.Police found that they were arrested for similar offences in the past as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/three-held-for-conning-delivery-boys-by-replacing-gadgets-with-soap-bars/articleshow/88765590.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Bengaluru||Scientists find peculiar star with ‘Heartbeat’ but devoid of pulsation||Bengaluru: A group of Indian and international scientists has spotted what they’ve termed a “peculiar binary star that shows heartbeat but no pulsations” contrary to the norm of binary stars sporting both heartbeats as well as pulsations. This star — called HD73619 — is located in a cluster in the Cancer constellation, one of the closest open star clusters to Earth. A team of 33 scientists, led by Santosh Joshi from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), an autonomous institution under the Department of Science & Technology (DST) carried out observations of HD73619 using eight ground-based telescopes located in different parts of the globe.According to DST, a total of about 180 ‘heartbeat’ stars are known to date. The name ‘Heartbeat’ stems from the resemblance of the path of the star to an electrocardiogram of the human heart. These are binary star systems where each star travels in a highly elliptical orbit around the common centre of mass, and the distance between the two stars varies drastically as they orbit each other.“When the stars are at closest passage of binary systems, a sudden increase in integrated brightness with amplitude of the order of several parts-per-thousand (ppt) is observed. As the components move apart, the light variation falls and finally becomes flat, indicating that combined flux is reduced, resulting in alternating peaks and troughs in their light curves. The pulsational activity of such stars is due to the oscillations in the component stars when they are at their closest approach,” the scientists said.The scientists have found that the HD73619 is the first member of heartbeat systems in binary chemically peculiar stars that does not show any pulsational/vibrational activity at their closest approach. “Chemically peculiar stars are those stars which have an unusual abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium on the surface. Data also revealed that the newly discovered heartbeat star exhibits either very weak or no magnetic field. Absence of weak magnetic field means that any dark spots on the HD73619 may have different and hitherto unknown origin as compared to sunspots which are created by strong magnetic field,” the scientists added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/scientists-find-peculiar-star-with-heartbeat-but-devoid-of-pulsation/articleshow/88765591.cms||---

Analysts estimate the contract, spread over nine-and-a-half years, is worth nearly $1 billion. They said the contract allows for another two-year extension. TCS had won the first passport seva contract in 2008. It was worth Rs 1,000 crore.In the second leg, TCS said it will refresh existing facilities and systems, and develop innovative new solutions to enable the issuance of e-passports. It will also further enhance the citizen experience using technologies such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics, chatbots, auto-response, natural language processing, and cloud.Tej Bhatla, business unit head of public sector in TCS, said the company’s partnership with the MEA over the last decade has become a benchmark in public-private partnership for citizen services. “We are pleased to be selected for the next phase of the Passport Seva Programme and look forward to driving further innovations and improving citizen experiences using our contextual knowledge and digital technologies,” he said. The 2008 project saw TCS transforming the delivery of passport-related services, digitising the processes, allowing for online filing of applications, and setting global benchmarks in timeliness, transparency, and reliability. The experience delivered at the TCS-run Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) across the country made the service popular. Accessibility was further enhanced by extending the service through designated post offices and through Indian missions and posts across the world.Since it went live in 2010, the platform has serviced more than 130,000 citizens daily. TCS had set up 77 PSKs and deployed over 2,500 staff across India to manage the day-to-day operations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tcs-bags-govts-passport-project-pegged-at-1bn/articleshow/88765595.cms||---

If the chargesheet is filed by a person who is not the authorised person to file a final report as is contemplated under section 173 of CrPC, then the entire proceedings would stand vitiated,” the judge has said in his order.“It is pertinent to note that the state, in a similar situation, has notified CCB as a police station. Therefore, nothing prevented the state from issuing a similar notification in respect of the CID,” Justice Shrishananda has said.Both appellants had challenged the March 31, 2016 order passed by a special court in allowing the discharge application filed by the pontiff and acquitting him of the charges. The woman, in her plea, had said the trial judge had conducted a virtual mini-trial referring to the statements made by the witnesses, while passing a 117-page order discharging the pontiff and that the sexual act between the accused and the complainant “did not amount to rape at all, but ill-intimacy”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-seers-discharge-acquittal/articleshow/88765596.cms||---

But BJP is not in power in TN. They should instead hold talks with DMK and ensure they don’t object in the larger interest of both the states,” said Kumaraswamy, while dubbing the padayatra led by state Congress chief DK Shivakumar a political stunt. “Will a padayatra force PM Modi to approve the project? The matter is before the Supreme Court. No government can solve it but only the SC and tribunals. The padayatra will not solve the problem but only aggravate it,” he said. If the padayatra can solve the Mekedatu problem, he said he will join Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. He said Congress was putting ordinary people’s lives in danger by taking out the padayatra since the government has imposed Covid curbs, including ban on political events. BJP govts will file cases against me: DKSDK Shivakumar alleged he has information that the BJP governments at the Centre and state will try to keep him occupied by filing cases and charges against him. He claimed he can be targeted by any government at any time, but has the capability to fight back.

Regarding the allegations about excess election expenditure made by the returned candidate and misuse of official machinery, the judge said no specific material particulars have been provided by the petitioner.“Ordinarily in the general elections, rural masses throng polling stations at the fag end. The Election Commission of India since long has issued several orders regulating such a scenario. However, such incidents per se do not raise any suspicion. After all it is said ‘the sea of suspicion has no shore’,” the judge held.“The allegation of tampering of EVMs can’t be lavishly made, especially in terms of decision of the Supreme Court in Dr Subramanian Swamy vs Election Commission of India case. The ECI has adopted VVPAT and thereby rendered EVMs nearly tamperproof..,” justice Dixit pointed out. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/plea-against-khandres-election-dismissed/articleshow/88765599.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Immediate relief for 11,000 of 78,000 property tax defaulters||BENGALURU: The cabinet’s decision on Thursday to provide respite to 78,000 BBMP property tax defaulters on account of “mistakes from both sides” over wrong zonal classification leading to under-assessment since 2016-17 will give immediate relief to no less than 11,000 property owners who have already paid the penalty along with pending dues. For, according to BBMP, a majority of the 11,000 owners have paid excess tax when compared to the state government’s decision to add simple interest of 12% per annum to their pending tax. BBMP joint commissioner (revenue) Venkatachalapathy said the 11,000 taxpayers have already deposited a sum of Rs 20 crore and that the difference amount paid by them will be adjusted towards taxes of the next few fiscals, depending on the quantum of excess payment. “The government decision, as we understand from the statements in the media, will help both BBMP and the taxpayers. While the payment amount will be reduced, BBMP will get an interest of 12% on the pending amount,” said the official. He said BBMP will modify a software for calculation of back payments of the 11,000 people who have already paid their tax and also for the remaining 67,000 property owners to make the necessary payment towards their pending property tax. BBMP awaiting govt orderHowever, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the final decision will have to be understood by the Palike as the government order is yet to reach it. “The case related to the defaulters’ payment issue is pending for 4-5 years. If the government has decided to waive the penalty entirely, there will be certain financial repercussions. If it is just a portion of the penalty and levies a certain amount of interest, then it will have another monetary fallout. We need to understand what exactly will be the model that has been agreed upon by the government,” he said. The senior IAS officer said BBMP did not have any idea of the problem until it conducted a physical survey in 2021.“We do not know what exactly happened in 2016-17, whether there was an inadvertent error or officials then didn’t communicate decisions properly or whether the people themselves committed a mistake. It will require a detailed understanding,” he said. The civic body is expecting the order early next week, after which it will issue a circular to all its zones and begin the software modification.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/immediate-relief-for-11k-of-78k-property-tax-defaulters/articleshow/88765600.cms||---

BMRCL disclosed the skywalk plan on its website on Friday. Banashankari Metro Station on the Green Line has been operational since June 2017. The foot-over-bridge (FoB) was delayed due to poor coordination between civic agencies. TOI had carried an article titled — Banashankari to get FoB linking Metro, bus stations in 6 months — on November 9, 2019. Tejasvi Surya, MP, who pushed for a mobility hub, had stated that it will be completed in six months. “The proposed Banashankari skywalk project will ensure smooth vehicular flow, designated bus stops, safe access for pedestrians and space for street vendors. Directly connecting the Metro station and bus stand to pedestrians from the other side of the street, the skywalk will provide a safe access to commuters from the TTMC and Metro station,” reads a document released by BMRCL. The release pointed out that the Banashankari junction is a heavy-traffic and busy intersection housing both bus and Metro stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/banashankari-may-get-skywalk-linking-stations/articleshow/88765601.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Lakshmisha, 28, a software engineer, and his friend Raghavendra, 30, a lab technician, died after their bike crashed into the median on Outer Ring Road near PES College, Banashankari. According to police, the incident took place around 10.15am, when the duo was returning home. They and two other friends, Gautham and Rakshit, had a party at a restaurant in Nagarbhavi till 9.45pm and were returning on two bikes. Lakshmisha was riding his bike and Raghavendra was on the pillion. Both were allegedly drunk and not wearing helmets. Lakshmisha was riding in a rash manner and hit the median. Both men fell on the road and sustained severe head injuries, losing consciousness on the spot. Their friends and passersby rushed them to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Lakshmisha brought dead. Raghavendra died on the way to Nimhans. Police have seized the bike and registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as Lakshmisha was riding under the influence of alcohol.In the second incident, a 38-year-old software engineer with a private firm in Banashankari was killed as his bike crashed into the median near Nagarbhavi Circle. Bhaskar G, a resident of Basaveshwara Nagar, was returning home from work around 10.30pm when the accident took place. Police said Bhaskar lost control of the bike as he was speeding.

---||Bengaluru||Supreme Court order sets the stage to fill up 4,950 PG seats in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The Supreme Court’s approval for NEET-PG counselling has come as a relief for aspirants of both postgraduate and undergraduate medical programmes. “There will be no delay in counselling from our end. As soon as the Directorate General of Health Services finishes the first round of counselling, we will begin ours. The calendar of events has to come from them. We are waiting. The seat matrix will be ready in the next couple of days,” said PG Girish, director of medical education. There are approximately 4,950 PG seats available for counselling. Of these, 2,687 are government quota seats in government and private medical colleges. “We are really happy. Covid-19 cases are rising day by day and we need more hands in hospitals. We request the government to complete counselling as soon as possible. One batch will be going for exams in a couple of months. It will be very helpful if another batch joins and helps us. And it is a big relief for NEET aspirants also as they’ve been waiting for two years now,” said Tejas J, in-charge president, Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors. However, NEET-UG students will have to wait for some more time. According to sources in the Directorate of Medical Education, counselling for NEET-UG is likely to happen only after that for NEET-PG. While the counselling for PG students is likely to take two months, UG counselling may be expected around February-end or March. Seats are still being added as the government has appealed for two medical colleges that were initially not approved. Two private colleges are also being added to the seat pool. Students had written NEET-UG in September and the results were out by November. For the past four months, they have been home waiting for counselling to begin. Many are trying to catch up on everything they missed out in the past two years while they were focused on entrance coaching. “I help my mother in giving tuitions to her students. She has around 25 students in classes 6-12. I join her in explaining subjects and correcting notes. Apart from this, I have started reading some MBBS books,” said Jashan Chabbra from Mangaluru (all-India rank 5). Meghan K from Mysuru, also ranked fifth, said he is in touch with seniors at AIIMS where he hopes to get a seat. “We never have got such a long holiday, so we don’t know how to manage it! I binge watch, play cricket, read fiction, yet I don’t know what to do for the rest of the day,” he said. For many others, it has been a chance to catch up on their passions and learn new things. “I joined an online keyboard class. I play some sport. I don’t know when we will get such a long break again. But now that it’s 2022, I have decided to get back to reading,” said Sonit Sai Reddy, another student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sc-order-sets-the-stage-to-fill-up-4950-pg-seats-in-ktaka/articleshow/88765603.cms||---

The paper, which used to also have issue-based topics in the past, had none this year and abstract, philosophical topics took their place, stumping several candidates. As part of the UPSC Mains, candidates must write seven papers between January 7 and 16. A 28-year-old candidate from the city told TOI he had expected topic-based questions on current affairs and was shocked by the philosophy-heavy paper. “Though we knew there would be these questions, I expected at least one or two on issue-based topics. It felt a little tougher than expected,” he said. When UPSC aspirants are trying to think out of the box, but the box is outside the universe. #UPSC Mains Essay pa… https://t.co/TwXWTD12UG— अपराजिता (@Aparajita_2018) 1641561451000Candidates also took to social media to express their views and soon enough, memes and jokes flooded the platforms. Aparajita, a Twitter user, wrote: “When UPSC aspirants are trying to think out of the box, but the box is outside the universe.” Another user, Gauri Rai, tweeted: “UPSC essay paper is a blind date with random quotes.” #UPSC CSE Mains Essay Paper!This will sound very philosophical. Indeed it is and now it's all about the real test… https://t.co/tD71t4RQli— Shubham Singh (@Shubhamin94) 1641558477000However, the paper also garnered appreciation from a section of netizens. Shubbham Singh, a research analyst, tweeted: “This will sound very philosophical... now it’s all about the real test of the personality of aspirants. UPSC is on track to change things drastically. No bookish knowledge will work. One needs to be authentic.” A good trend, say expertsVinay Kumar GB, founder and director, Insights IAS, Bengaluru, said the paper was set by UPSC to weed out herd mentality and discourage candidates from rote learning of probable questions. Explaining that the trend of the paper leaning towards philosophical topics began three years ago, he said it had no questions this year on general studies topics such as cybersecurity, democracy, agriculture or any issue-based topic. Kumar added that mastering this change will not happen overnight and candidates need to have reading habit and writing practice. He predicted essay scores would come down by at least 10 marks this year from the last. “The highest marks will likely be between 135 and 140, or less,” he said. Sajal Singh, founder of Civilsdaily, called the paper effervescent and said UPSC tries to check the depth of one’s ability to think through a broad spectrum of subjects. “One must identify the theme of the essay, link it with general studies papers, go for the broadest interpretation possible and enrich it with quotes, stories and anecdotes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/philosophical-upsc-essay-paper-baffles-many/articleshow/88765604.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Only 1 of every 8 cybercrime cases in city cracked in 2021||Bengaluru: Senior citizen Vijay Kumar from Yelahanka received a call on his mobile phone in October 2021 saying his bank account needed to be updated. Believing it was from the bank, Kumar, who is retired, shared the details, including the OTP he received on his phone. Soon, miscreants siphoned off Rs 20,000 from his account.Four months on, Kumar is still running from pillar to post to get back his money. Yelahanka CEN police said his money was diverted to another account and withdrawn from an ATM kiosk in Kolkata. They said it was difficult to trace the miscreants as they had used forged documents to open the bank account.Kumar’s case is not unique. Only one of every eight cybercrimes reported in the city in 2021 has been solved. According to police records, 6,423 cybercrime cases were reported last year and only 787 (12%) have been solved. Police said 5,479 or 85% of the cases are still under investigation or undetected as of now.Police commissioner Kamal Pant said many cybercrime culprits live in far off places like Jamtara in Jharkhand and some parts of Rajasthan, West Bengal, Assam and Uttar Pradesh, making it difficult to trace their location. “Laying hands on these miscreants is difficult since they keep changing locations regularly. They will be working from remote places and villages and by the time our police teams reach there, they would have vanished. Despite these challenges, we have solved some of the cases and arrested the suspects,” he said.Pant said this was the reason they introduced the Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) system. “If the victim calls 112 and registers the complaint within 90 minutes, best efforts can be made to freeze the money in the bank accounts of the suspects. In 2021, we got over Rs 88 crore belonging to 8,400 victims. In all, we received 8,407 CIRs last year — 7,838 were disposed of and 569 are pending. These CIRs will be turned into FIRs later so that victims can get back their money. We returned around Rs 1 crore to cybercrime victims in 2021,” he said.In 2020, the city had witnessed 8,892 cybercrime cases, of which 29% or 2,574 were detected, whereas 4,016 were under investigation. In 2019 too, 2,213 or 21% of 10,553 cases reported had remained unsolved.Though the numbers make it look like cybercrime cases fell in 2021, police officers said that’s not true and cybercrimes are now being registered as CIRs also. “There are also some CIRs that have been converted into FIRs and some victims have lodged both CIRs and FIRs. So there is some overlapping as well,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/only-1-of-every-8-cybercrime-cases-in-city-cracked-in-2021/articleshow/88765605.cms||---

The woman, a resident of Magadi Road, got back in touch with her former class 10 mate in 2017 after he contacted her on Facebook. They began communicating over social media and phone. Eventually, the man allegedly began misbehaving. “From 2020, his attitude changed. He started saying he liked me from the beginning and did so to this day. He urged me to leave my husband and children and live with him,” the woman stated in her complaint. She blocked the accused on social media and phone, but he continued to harass her by calling from different mobile numbers. “He stalked me when I went out of the house. On January 6, he blocked my way near a temple in Seshadripuram and tried to grab hold of me. When I resisted, he hurled abuses and bit my left hand,” she said. The accused has been booked under various sections of IPC, including 354 (assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty), 354B (assault or use of criminal force with intent to disrobe), and 354D (stalking).

Obviously, there is no assurance of cash distribution to rice-card holders during Pongal. The previous AIADMK government had distributed 2,500 per rice-card-holding family during Pongal last year, earmarking 5,604.8 crore for the purpose. There are nearly 2 crore rice-card-holding families in Tamil Nadu and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami have been demanding distribution of cash assistance to people during this Pongal too.The DMK government has also earmarked 132.6 crore for distribution of grocery kits to rice-card holders as relief during the pandemic. The announcements came in the supplementary estimates for the current fiscal, presented in the assembly on Friday for 3,719.6 crore.“The supplementary estimates are being presented mainly to obtain the approval of the legislature for expenditure on ‘New Service’ and ‘New Instrument of Service’ items which were sanctioned since the presentation of revised budget estimates and to enable recoupment for advances made from the contingency fund,” the minister said. He has sanctioned 1,000 crore to Chennai Metro Rail to meet immediate commitments relating to the phase II work. Government departments received Rs 300 crore from the State Disaster Response Fund for relief and restoration exercise carried out during the heavy rains in October and November.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/888-cr-sanctioned-for-pongal-gift-hampers/articleshow/88765612.cms||---

Nearly two lakh members elected to 18,805 societies in 2018 amid allegations of irregularities by the ruling AIADMK, will cease to hold the office when the Act comes into force. On Friday, the AIADMK walked out in protest against the Bill.In the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, Periyasamy said there were several complaints received from the public and members of cooperative societies alleging financial irregularities and frauds in cooperative societies. A review of the functioning of the societies revealed large-scale misappropriation of funds, issue of loans on fake jewels and issue of bogus loans of several crores of rupees. “The government, therefore, with a view to protect the interest of the cooperative societies, to streamline their administration, ensure proper governance and to increase the efficacy of the functioning of societies, decided to reduce the term of office of board of directors,” the minister said. The AIADMK opposed the Bill at the introductory stage. “We walk out in protest,” opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami said, soon after the cooperative minister introduced the Bill. With the Supreme Court striking down provisions of 97th Amendment to the Constitution relating to cooperative societies, the government sought to make several amendments to the Act, including powers to the Registrar to supersede the board for two consecutive years, and audit the accounts of every society once in a year.

It would benefit 51,017 farmers and make them eligible for availing fresh loans.Making a suo motu statement in the assembly, the minister said that an on-the-spot assessment found that farmers of both the districts had taken high-value loans, citing turmeric and plantain cultivation, by submitting sworn affidavits instead of presenting chitta and adangal (revenue) documents, even as maize and tapioca were predominantly cultivated in the districts. The farmers had also shown additional acreage of cultivation, which was totally in variance from revenue records. Although such violations have taken place in other districts, 97% of these 2 violations - 501.7 crore out of 516.9 crore of total violations - took place in Salem and Namakkal districts, he said.In January 2021, crop loan waivers were announced and 1.11 lakh farmers in Salem and Namakkal were given waivers and 51,017 were left out owing to the above two irregularities. This resulted in a slump in agriculture activities in the two districts since farmers were unable to get fresh loans and cooperatives were not able to reach the target set for disbursement of crop loans. Following representations from the farmers of both the districts to waive loans for the left out farmers and extend fresh loans, the CM considered it as a special case and ordered fresh loans, ensuring that action would be taken to avoid such irregularities in future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-waives-501-crore-crop-loans-in-salem-namakkal/articleshow/88765616.cms||---

The civic body is carrying out road relaying projects worth 213 crore on 1,656 roads (312km long) across the city; 59 bus route roads are being repaired under Singara Chennai 2.0; 22 roads are being fixed under TURIP scheme. In addition, 622 interior roads and 307 concrete roads are being repaired under Singara Chennai, while 646 interior roads are repaired with disaster relief funds. “We do not want to waste time. This is the best time to re-lay the roads as movement of people will be lesser,” Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi told TOI. The corporation has told its deputy commissioner (works) and its regional deputy commissioners to monitor the works at night for any irregularities. Officials said when chief minister MK Stalin inspected Ripon Building’s control room during the December rains last year, he instructed the civic body to fast-track road relaying and senior IAS officials to monitor the quality of the roads. The commissioner himself inspected one such road in Anna Nagar on Thursday midnight.

During a meeting held at Ripon Building on Friday, Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi briefed the officials of their responsibilities, which include monitoring home-isolated patients and ensuring that patients get their medical kits on a timely basis. The officials will directly report to the commissioner daily.  “I have told them to attend gate meeting in the mornings and give a pep talk to volunteers to boost their morale,” the commissioner told TOI. The officials have also been advised to visit random houses with quarantined patients and check if yellow garbage bags have been distributed to them and if the patients are adhering to quarantine rules. “They have also been asked to monitor home-triaging and coordinate with doctors if the patient is symptomatic and paramedics if they are asymptomatic. They must ask the patients whether they get calls from tele-counselling centres,” said Bedi He added that random inspections would be made at the counselling centres in the city to ensure that the staff call patients at least twice a day. The IAS officials would also ensure that all corporation ambulances are put to use to ferry patients. “We don’t want patients to use their private vehicles. These IAS officials must coordinate with 1913 and ensure that ambulances reach the house in time if a patient is positive,” added Bedi.

---||Chennai||More asymptomatic people getting tested at private labs in Chennai||Chennai: As the new variant continues to spread, more asymptomatic people from Chennai are getting tested at private labs. Due to an all-pervasive concern, people with no symptoms are rushing to get themselves tested if a neighbour, a colleague or a relative tests positive. Even when they test negative, people with common flu fearing a false negative go for a second test, said owners of private labs in Chennai. “On an average, we were collecting 100 to 200 samples per day. In the last one week, this has increased to 300 to 400 tests per day,” said Dr Prasannaa Vignesh, radiologist and director of a private lab in Chennai. Almost 50 % to 60% undergo tests because of peer pressure, contact exposure (based on doctors' advice) and after or before travelling, he said. As per the revised Covid-19 protocol, a few Indian states and foreign countries insist on a negative certificate before departure at local airports and inter-state borders. "There is nothing wrong with getting tested as it is better to be 100 percent sure, particularly with elders in our homes," said Mohammed, who was waiting outside a lab in Nungambakkam for his turn. This increased workload on private labs has, however, delayed the time taken to release the results. The above mentioned lab, which use to deliver test results within four to five hours, now takes one day. Employees here said that each technician collects 20 samples a day, as against eight samples last week. A senior official from Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health said, "People were queuing up in front of private labs unnecessarily because of panic and anxiety. Since cases are expected to rise in the coming days, the tests should be reserved for those who actually need it.” Since the treatment and discharge policy remains the same for new variants, it is more than enough if we continue to test those with Influenza like Illness (ILI) symptoms, which includes cold, fever or cough, the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/more-asymptomatic-people-getting-tested-at-private-labs/articleshow/88765622.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Chennai||Chennai: Covid clusters among doctors swamp hospitals||CHENNAI: Just when the Covid-19 third wave has begun, an increasing number of healthcare workers in three out of four tertiary hospitals in Chennai are testing positive. This has brought to the fore concerns on stress and fatigue among resident doctors, in-house surgeons, general physicians and nursing students who have tested positive. Following a cluster of 27 students at the Stanley GH’s students men’s and women’s hostel on Thursday, another 15 positive cases were reported at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Friday, as per the cluster-list shared by the city corporation with TOI. In KMCH, 25 doctors have tested positive since January. Doctors, who are in isolation, at the RGGGH told TOI that about 50 people are under institutional quarantine in the hospital’s tower 3. These include in-house surgeons and medical students. “It is stressful... after we test negative, following a brief period of home-isolation, we may have to return to duty immediately. By mid-January, cases could rise here,” said a doctor in isolation at tower 3, who did not want to be named. Currently, as per the discharge policy for institutional quarantine, following an RTPCR positive status, if fever is not observed for three consecutive days, the patient is discharged. They are sent for further home-isolation for seven days. All these doctors are mostly asymptomatic and are recovering well. Almost all of them are double-vaccinated too, a doctor said. Dean of KMCH Dr R Shanthimalar said 14 doctors have been discharged while 11 are under institutional quarantine. “Seventy-five percent of the cases had an S-gene drop, while all are stable and asymptomatic,” she said. While doctors dismissed concerns on manpower shortage, they did not rule out its possibility if cases continue to skyrocket. “Lately, seven student nurses have tested positive. We are taking all measures on isolation and testing, to ensure the clusters stop and there’s no manpower shortage,” RGGGH Dean Dr E Theranirajan said. At the Stanley GH, dean of the hospital Dr P Balaji said there was no manpower shortage as of now, and all the patients are asymptomatic, and are recovering faster. “Many have got better and we have sent some of them to home quarantine. We have also disinfected their hostel completely,” he said. While non-O2 bed occupancy is seeing a big rise, ICU bed occupancy still remains very low, indicating that the severity of cases is less. From 200 non-O2 beds occupied on December 20, the occupancy rose to close to 1,000, while O2 bed occupancy shot up from 200 to 1,000, but saw a dip after January 5. Meanwhile, less than ten percent of ICU beds are occupied in city hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/clusters-among-doctors-swamp-hospitals/articleshow/88765624.cms||Omjasvin M D

In addition, several labs are also offering these services to patients and corporate clients.But if a person turns positive, the state directorate of public health does not add these cases into the state registry. “We don’t use rapid antigen tests. We use the gold standard RTPCR tests,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam. “But these tests are approved by the central drug authority and hence it is not illegal to sell or use them. The situation is hence tricky,” he said.The state covid control room adds data of more than 1 lakh RTPCR tests collated from 321 labs – private and public – from across the state. Now, the directorate is looking at options to quickly bring patients with RAT positive into the radar.The Indian Council of Medical Research permits antigen tests; the turnaround time is quicker compared to the four hours it takes for the real-time polymerase chain reaction(RTPCR) and costs less than a third. But the Tamil Nadu government says RTPCR is a more sensitive test that detects genetic material from the coronavirus.But doctors are now saying that the state can’t continue to ignore antigen results as this could lead to gross underreporting of fresh Covid-19 cases, particularly at a time when the virus is peaking. They say it is important to count self-testing antigen positive for two problems. “First, it helps the patient seek timely medical attention. This reduces risk of severe disease and death,” said a senior government doctor. “In addition, such patients will follow isolation protocols stringently when they get help from local bodies. This will cut down transmission rate,” he added.Experts including those in the state advisory panel have been pushing the state to use antigen kits. “They may not be accurate but sensitivity of this test is much better now and is being used in several counties ahead of mass or close door events. It’s also useful to isolate people in hotspots,” said WHO chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan, who is a part of TN expert medical committee.While state health authorities say they have discouraged labs from doing the test, labs claim it is not “illegal” for them to use antigen testing kits as they are approved by the union health ministry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cant-ignore-antigen-test-results-when-virus-is-peaking-docs/articleshow/88765626.cms||---

Uttar Pradesh assembly, however, has life till May 14, 2022, it said, pointing to the 51-day gap between Uttar Pradesh and the other four states.AIBA chairman and senior advocate Adish C Aggarwala, in his representation to the election commission, said that under the circumstances it would not be fair to notify Uttar Pradesh assembly polls with these states. He said the rising third wave of Covid-19 cases, besides the prolonged existence of model code of conduct, will adversely affect people and the state.In this regard, he said the devastation caused by the second wave of Covid-19 was due to public negligence during the process of assembly elections to four states Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal besides the Union territory of Poducherry.The second wave of Covid-19 during March to May, 2021 was the Independent India’s worst human and sociological tragedy, which was worse than the Partition itself, as it resulted in the death of 4.83 lakh people, Aggarwala said.“Despite cautions, warnings and ominous signs of the devastation that the next wave of Covid-19 could unleash, the Election Commission of India went ahead with election to these four states and one UT, thereby undermining health and safety of the people of India. The disease spread, death and despair caused by the second wave of Covid-19 was largely due to this poll process,” he said.A prolonged model code of conduct will have chilling effect on the governance, as the elected popular government will not be in a position to announce or implement any ongoing schemes and welfare measures, said Aggarwala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/delink-up-poll-process-from-other-states-bar-assn-to-ec/articleshow/88765632.cms||A Subramani

The counselling for the medical seats under the state quota is likely to begin in two weeks, according to officials from the directorate of medical education. The order brings the anxious wait of more than 40,000 medical aspirants for the last two months to an end. "After the publication of first-round counselling results for All India Quota (AIQ) seats by the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), we will start MBBS/BDS counselling in Tamil Nadu. It will take 12 to 15 days. We will start our counselling tentatively at the end of the third week or beginning of the fourth week of January," said P Vasanthamani, secretary of the Selection Committee, Directorate of Medical Education. Citing the pending case regarding EWS quota in PG medical admissions in the apex court, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) of Directorate General of Health Services postponed MBBS counselling for AIQ seats as well. As per the usual practice, TN has been conducting medical admission after the first round of counselling for seats under AIQ is over. "It will give toppers an opportunity to choose seats from AIQ. So, it will give more seats to Tamil Nadu students," officials said. As many as 40,288 students have applied to the counselling for MBBS/BDS admissions which is 1000 more compared to the previous year. The last date for submitting online applications ended on January 7. "While 25,511 students applied for government quota seats, 14,777 students have applied for seats under management quota this year," Vasanthamani added. Last year, 39,223 applications were received for government and management quota seats. This year, 11 new government medical colleges will add 1,450 seats while Government Coimbatore Medical College got permission to add 50 additional seats. Thirty-seven government medical colleges will offer 5,125 seats. There will be 4,356 seats available for state quota counselling after allocating 15% of seats for AIQ. Meanwhile, the apex court, while passing the judgment, stated that the validity of the criteria determined by the committee would prospectively be subject to its final order. The court said it will hear the matter in detail in the third week of March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/medical-counselling-in-state-likely-to-begin-in-two-weeks/articleshow/88765644.cms||---

The company is looking to add immunity infused products across its range like Sampann Haldi Doodh, Copper Plus Water or herbal ingredient infused Tata Tea Gold Care. Alongside, it also plans to grow its ready to heat/ready to eat segment and will add capacity and increase footprint. With around Rs 2,600- Rs 2,700 crore cash on its books, the company is also looking to expand several of these portfolios with products and capacity.“We are moving beyond the staples to premiumisation and value-add,” said D’Souza. “While our base business of tea and salt still has some runway for growth — with unbranded marketshare of 40%-50% — we are also focussing on health and immunity to adapt to changes in consumer behaviour due to the pandemic.” To that end the company has launched Tata Soulfull for millet-based cereal and snacks and acquired Tata SmartFoodz for the ready to eat category.“We are not shifting entirely from tea, coffee, salt and spices but we are adding an immunity value-add wherever possible,” he said. For example, the positioning of Tata Salt Lite and Tata Salt Super Lite with 15% and 30% less sodium than regular iodized salt is targeted at consumers with hypertension. For the company, this focus on value-add or “innovation” segment has started to bear fruit. “Innovation segment contributed 1.7% to our sales in March 2020,” he added. As for capex spends, the company is conducting a volume capacity study but has already taken a call to pitch funds in certain segments.The company’s routine capex is in the range of Rs 200-300 crore per annum.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tata-consumer-products-to-focus-on-value-add-product-extensions-ceo/articleshow/88765648.cms||---

Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, however, also cautioned the MP to be cautious in his words against political rivals, adding that in these days of ‘Bulli Bai apps’, where spreading hatred has taken the centre stage, there was a need for everyone to exercise restraint.The judge was hearing a petition filed by the BJP MP who questioned the FIR against him and urged the court to quash it. The BJP MP was booked by Banjara Hills police following a complaint over his Facebook post against the CM on the state’s decision to allow liquor sales in restaurants and pubs till 1am on the eve of New Year. The MP had also added a caricature of the CM to the post. Appearing for the MP, senior counsel N Ramachandra Rao said that the police added IPC section 153-A that speaks about creating disharmony and promoting enmity between various communities on grounds of religion when the current case had no such elements. Public Prosecutor C Pratap Reddy said that the MP had made derogatory comments against politicians and police officers, and wanted the court to restrain him. The judge said that he had seen the social media post and the caricature posted by the MP. “It is not in good taste. But the contents of the FIR look exaggerated,” the judge said. “Arvind should refrain from posting offensive social media posts that cause disharmony in the society,” the judge said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-stays-arvinds-arrest-tells-bjp-mp-to-soften-jabs-at-rivals/articleshow/88765652.cms||---

It has started debating the tactical line it has to take by uniting like-minded parties at the national level to defeat right-wing forces led by RSS-BJP not only politically but also ideologically and culturally.Though a section of leaders were firmly against going in for a truck with Congress, a few others were of the opinion that political alignments should be seen in a larger scope and electoral alliances should be made with the main priority of stopping BJP from storming back to power in 2024. This meant that a tie-up with Congress is not ruled out if it zeroes down to defeating the saffron forces.At the state level, top leaders of CPM debated whether it should extend issue-based support to parties such as TRS or other parties in Telangana or YSRCP in Andhra if they stand firmly against BJP, sources said.As far as an electoral alliance is concerned, it was felt CPM should take a call at the time of election as regional parties like TRS and YSRCP have been extending issue-based support to BJP.Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who of late has been attacking the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, may get issue-based support but an electoral alliance will depend whether TRS will oppose BJP at the time of going to elections.The three-day central committee meeting was attended by top guns of CPM. The meeting saw debate on the strategy to counter BJP.Sources said the meeting was of the view that despite some drawbacks to BJP in the form of farmers agitations forcing it to repeal the three farm laws and losing elections in some states, the BJP has been surging ahead and is successfully penetrating its Hindutva agenda and its influence is growing in constitutional bodies like CBI, ECI, CAG and judiciary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cpm-debates-support-to-parties-opposing-bjp/articleshow/88765653.cms||Roushan Ali

CIDCO was a special purpose vehicle, which was floated by businessman Indu Syam Prasad Reddy to misuse the housing board land.  CBI counsel K Surender said this before Justice Ujjal Bhuyan while arguing against providing relief to V Krishna Prasad, one of the accused in the Indu-housing board chargesheet, filed by the CBI as part of its investigation in the quid pro quo case. Krishna Prasad’s Vasantha Projects was a partner in the alleged development plan. Both Krishna Prasad and Subba Reddy transferred villas built on a four-acre housing board land at Gachibowli to their associates, the CBI counsel said “Vasantha Projects chartered accountant himself said this before the CBI as a witness,” Surender said. Syam Prasad, the main accused in the case, was the prime beneficiary as he got nearly 100 acres of housing board land in Bandlaguda, Gachibowli and Kukatpally. He also got 250 acres of land at Shamshabad in the Indu Tech Zone case and 9,000 acres in Anantapur in the Lepakshi Knowledge Hub case.

Police arrested Raghavendra Rao at Dammapeta in Kothagudem district on Friday night. The special teams of Kothagudem police intercepted Raghavendra (58), at Dammapeta on Friday night. "We intercepted him while he was traveling in a car. He is being brought to Paloncha," Bhadradri Kothagudem SP Sunil Dutt said. While Ramakrishna mentioned the names of his mother Suryavati, sister K Lova Madhavi and Raghavendra in the suicide note which was found by cops after the incident on Monday morning, vocal protests from the opposition parties for the MLA son’s immediate arrest were triggered by the selfie video on Thursday wherein Ramakrishna alleged that Raghavendra had asked him to send his wife to Hyderabad for a personal meeting to favourably settle the property disputes of the family. Pressure mounted on Kothagudem police teams after the video came out and special teams started scouring various places in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to locate Raghavendra. Police tracked his movements to Andhra-Telangana border areas and later to north coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and then to Eluru, before he was finally intercepted at Dammapeta town in Kothagudem district close to West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. Meanwhile, police also issued a notice to Raghavendra on Friday asking him to appear before the investigating officer (IO) in another an abetment to suicide case registered at Paloncha town a few months ago. Manuguru assistant SP P Shabarish, who was the IO of the abetment to suicide case of M Venkateswara Rao (40), registered on July 30, 2021, at Paloncha town police station, issued a notice to Raghavendra, asking him to appear for questioning in connection with the case on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/suicide-pact-case-mlas-son-nabbed-at-dammapet/articleshow/88765664.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Not just those who live in the town but those from surrounding villages also make use of the library that is open round-the-clock. Nagula was in the US for a few years before he returned home to India and has been working in Hyderabad. Nagula, who hails from Sircilla, did his schooling and Intermediate in the textile town before coming to Hyderabad to pursue his education. “My main concern was for students and I wondered who would guide them on how their career choices as not everyone would have the chance of coming to Hyderabad,” Nagula explained. The idea sprouted and it was in 2014 that he took a place for rent and placed a large number of books on different subjects. Those who used the library got into government jobs, police department or got recruited as teachers or got into other jobs.

The bench reviewed the situation after going through the latest status report furnished by the state public health director. The Bench found that currently the state is doing less tests and directed the state to ramp up testing particularly at railway stations, bus stations and airport and at state border. “Unless you scale up testing you cannot gauge the spread of Omicron,” the bench said, addressing advocate General BS Prasad, who furnished to the court the status report and briefed it about the efforts of authorities to face new challenges.“If by testing you came to a conclusion that certain areas are more infected then you can declare such areas as Covid-19 prone and convert them into containment zones,” the Bench said. “Give maximum publicity to the vaccination programmes for children and vaccinate all children,” it added. It also asked that latest guidelines sent by the Centre be followed and any deviation would be viewed seriously. “No public gatherings should be allowed. Both religious and political meetings should be thoroughly discouraged,” the Bench said.

Despite massive enforcement drives to contain such violations of the Motor Vehicles Act and booking cases against pillion riders besides the bike riders for not wearing helmet, the Cyberabad and Rachakonda police continue to see a large number of violations with regard to wearing helmet. In Rachakonda commissionerate, 15.33 lakh cases were registered for helmetless riding. The Cyberabad police in a recent analysis found that 356 persons who had died in road accidents in their commissionerate were not wearing helmet. Another common offence was wrong-side driving. Nearly four lakh cases were registered in all the three commissionerates for wrong-side driving. The city police is planning to focus on intensifying the enforcement drive against wrong-side driving, triple riding, speeding and others. As there has been a change of guard in the city police traffic wing due to the recent IPS transfers, officials are reviewing the scenario and the changes that need to be made to curb traffic violations. “Besides helmetless riding, we are planning to focus on other traffic violations,” a senior traffic police officer said. In Hyderabad, police registered 70 lakh cases against motorists for different violations in the year 2021 as against the 58.58 lakh cases in the year 2020. In 2021, police booked 25,453 motorists for driving under the influence of alcohol.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bikers-ignore-helmet-rule-53l-cases-booked-last-yr/articleshow/88765685.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Teen stabs man for chatting with mom||HYDERABAD: A former GHMC worker was assaulted and stabbed by a 19-year-old from Jagadgirigutta on Thursday.  Based on the complaint of the victim, Police registered an attempt to murder case against the accused who is on the run. The victim, Ch Anil Kumar, 28, was earlier working as a contract labourer with GHMC’s Gajularamaram Circle. About two years ago, he stopped working for GHMC and was currently doing some private work. “While working for GHMC, Anil Kumar became close to a 38-year-old co-worker who was a widow. Anil used to talk to her everyday and despite quitting his job, he continued his friendship with her. However, the widow’s 19-year-old son, Sri Ram, did not like his mother talking to Anil and he recently confronted her, asking her to stop talking to Anil,” Jagadgirigutta police said. As his mother continued to talk to Anil over the phone despite his objections, the 19-year-old private worker decided to assault Anil to make him stop talking to her. On Thursday evening, the teenager called Anil and asked him to meet him near MKR function hall in Jagadgirigutta. “When Anil reached the spot, three persons who were already present there suddenly began to assault him. While they were punching and kicking him, Sri Ram stabbed him with a knife on his right hand and back,” Jagadgirigutta inspector P Saidulu said. Anil managed to run from the spot and with the help of a relative who was passing by on a bike, rushed to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. Based on a complaint lodged by Anil, an attempt to murder case was registered against Sri Ram.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/teen-stabs-man-forchatting-with-mom/articleshow/88765686.cms||---

The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing the money laundering angle, approached the apex court seeking cancellation of anticipatory bail to Mohan. Based on the complaints filed by IFCI which alleged cheating in respect of loans sanctioned to VNR Infrastructures and Sri Krishna Stockists, CBI Bengaluru had registered two FIRs. Mohan was not made an accused in the complaints, but in the chargesheets filed in both the cases, he was named. He was arrested and released on bail in 2017. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office had issued the notice and Mohan appeared before it. In 2020, the SFIO again issued summons to Mohan directing him to appear before it but he obtained an anticipatory bail. Under the provisions of the PMLA, it issued summons in May, 2021. The Telangana high court granted anticipatory bail to Mohan, following which the Enforcement Directorate approached the Supreme Court. CBI’s bank security and fraud cell, Bengaluru, in April 2019 had booked a case against VNR Infrastructures for defrauding Bank of Baroda to the tune of 62 crore. The CBI initiated the investigation against the real estate company based on a complaint by BoB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sc-cancels-bail-of-accused-in-vnr-infra-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/88765687.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Locals: Graveyards charging 1-2L for advance booking||Hyderabad: Burials have become a grave matter for many, especially the poor, in several Old City localities. Dearth of space in many graveyards has resulted in families being forced to dish out money to give a decent final farewell to their loved ones. While the rich are able to cough up the amount asked by graveyard committees and even book space in advance, the poor have been mostly left high and dry. “Huge amount is being asked as a bribe to bury at Dargah Shah Raju Qattal situated at Misri Gunj. We want to know if the Waqf Board has fixed any such burial amount? The Waqf Board officials were informed, but nothing has been done,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, a TDP leader, who has sent a legal notice to the authorities.Families said that the graveyard committees were asking anywhere from Rs 1-2 lakh to book the place in advance. Even paying respects to the dear departed has become a problem in a few graveyards. “My father passed away in 2005 and was buried in a graveyard in Rein Bazaar. But it is always locked and we can’t visit the grave. If we ask the committee, we face harassment. The Waqf Board should take action against these rowdies,’’ Mohammed Aleemuddin from Khilwat told TOI. When TOI contacted Waqf Board chairman Mohammed Saleem, he said, “Nobody has the authority to seek money for burial place. If we receive any complaint about any graveyard, strict legal action will be taken.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/locals-graveyards-charging-1-2l-for-advance-booking/articleshow/88765693.cms||---

Disposing of a petition supported by a section of doctors urging scrapping of the Gangasagar Mela at a time the country was experiencing a third wave of Covid, the division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Kesang Doma Bhutia constituted a three-member committee comprising the leader of the Opposition, state human rights commission chairperson and a state representative to keep vigil on compliance of the court order as well as the measures declared by the state in its affidavit submitted before the HC. The panel has been empowered to recommend a ban on entry of visitors to Sagar Island if it notices any shortcoming in compliance. The HC also ordered the state to declare Sagar Island a ‘notified area’ as per the Gangasagar Mela Act, 1976, within 24 hours to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pilgrims. It further directed the home secretary to issue advertisements to make people aware of the risks of visiting Gangasagar between January 8 and 16 and appeal to them to stay away to remain safe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hc-allows-gangasagar-but-sets-strict-riders-for-state/articleshow/88765698.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mamata raises guv issue at cancer hospital virtual meet||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday told PM Narendra Modi how Raj Bhavan was questioning the state’s decision to recruit IAS/IPS officers from outside to meet its shortfall, being done following central guidelines. Speaking at the virtual inauguration of the second campus of the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Banerjee also sought more medical seats in Bengal and underlined the need for more vaccines to fully inoculate 40% of its eligible population.Modi didn’t speak on the specific issues raised by the CM, but laid out details of the country’s vaccination drive, which crossed the 1.5-billion mark on Friday. “We have crossed an important milestone today. We started the year vaccinating 15-18-year-olds, and today, in the first week of the first month, we have achieved the historic feat of 150 crore — 1.5 billion — doses. And all these 150 crore doses were given in less than a year. Statistically, this is a very tall feat,” Modi said.On a personal note, Banerjee said she was attending the programme because of the PM’s personal interest in this hospital. “The Union health minister has spoken to me twice on it. We inaugurated this last year and it has been functioning as a Covid unit. We have given 25% of the hospital cost in addition to providing 11 acres of land for free. The Centre and the state need to come together for public good. We have signed an MoU with Tata Memorial Hospital for setting up (cancer) hospitals — one at Kolkata and another at Siliguri,” she said.Modi said Bengal had been provided 11 crore vaccines free, more than 1,500 ventilators, more than 9,000 oxygen cylinders and 49 PSA oxygen plants have already started functioning in the state. Banerjee also raised with the PM the issue of dearth of 40% second doses. “And then when booster dose will start, we have to get it,” she said.Seeking the PM’s help, Banerjee said, “But there is scarcity of doctors. Due to Covid, all doctors in many hospitals are affected. How to run them then? So, I urge (you) to increase medical seats. Even, there is scarcity of IAS and IPS officers. Following your advice, we were inducting officers from outside. But the governor is questioning this process. I am simply following the Centre’s guidelines.”The governor reacted by saying that the CM’s statement against him was “factually wrong and usual act of impropriety by the CM”.Modi also detailed how Ayushman Bharat had benefited 2.6 crore people in the country who would have been forced to spend Rs 50-60,000 crore on expensive treatments. Bengal and the Centre are at loggerheads over this scheme. The state has a universal health scheme, Swasthya Sathi. “Each family is entitled to get Rs 5 lakh health coverage and thus treatment is free,” the CM told the PM.The PM told said the Ayushman Bharat Infrastructure Mission will see the Centre spend around Rs 2,500 crore in the next five years, which will see health infra upgrade from the block to the district levels. Modi said by controlling prices of more than 500 drugs, the Centre had saved close to Rs 3,000 crore per year. He added that the national dialysis programme had helped over 12 lakh poor people and saved Rs 520 crore of their money.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-raises-guv-issue-at-cancer-hospital-virtual-meet/articleshow/88765699.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||PIL seeks to defer civic elections, HC seeks SEC reply||Kolkata: Calcutta High Court on Friday asked the State Election Commission to respond on January 11 to a plea seeking to postpone the January 22 civic polls due to Covid case surge. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Kesang Doma Bhutia asked the SEC to submit an affidavit on January 11 and inform the court whether elections to four municipal bodies could be held on January 22 keeping the pandemic situation in view.Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandernagore will go to polls that day. Advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that 20 areas in Bidhannagar had been identified as micro-containment zones. He demanded that municipal polls be deferred. SEC counsel Jayanta Mitra said the state government would ensure that all Covid-19 norms put in place by the commission were enforced.Outside the HC, BJP on Friday demanded that municipal polls be deferred by a month, prompting some sharp reactions from Trinamool Congress. “The political situation and ambience of the election are not going to change in a month. We know what happens during polls in West Bengal. But, right at this moment, lives of people are more important. We are appealing to voters to consider the situation too,” Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.BJP spokesperson Jayprakash Majumdar said: “The state government had two years ago cited the pandemic as the reason for not being able to hold an election. The same government is arguing in favour of holding election during the pandemic when more people are affected with Covid-19.” On Thursday, the Left Front had submitted a memorandum to SEC asking for the rationale behind holding an election during pandemic. Trinamool, however, entrusted the decision to SEC, saying this was its prerogative. “Election Commission is a constitutional body and the state government has submitted its opinion to them. They will take the decision. We will abide by their decision and do not have anything to add to that,” party MP Saugata Roy said. “BJP, however, should not be silent about the poll in Uttar Pradesh amid the pandemic. It is the most populated state. I think state BJP leaders should be vocal about it,” Roy added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pil-seeks-to-defer-civic-elections-hc-seeks-sec-reply/articleshow/88765700.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Trio from Bengal pedals 450km through Kashmir snow to promote winter cycling||KOLKATA: A three-member team of cyclists from Bengal has finished their winter expedition to Kashmir, pedalling their way through snow-covered roads, valleys and passes. In 12 days, they covered 450km and gained an altitude of 10,000ft. The feat, they believe, will encourage cyclists to get into winter cycling, which has not been very popular in India so far. Cycling in extreme weather is different from the traditional method. The biggest challenge lies in preparing the cycle for the journey. The grip of the tyres on ice is crucial in determining the stability of the cycle. On gritted roads, studs on the cycle’s tyres offer less control than plain tyres. Some cyclists prefer to deflate their tyres a little to get more area of contact. “When you are cycling on ice, you have to constantly be careful that the cycle is not going on a hard ice surface. Hard ice could be deadly as the rider will lose control. It has to be a soft, lighter ice surface,” said Chandan Biswas, a youth from Hridaypur near Barasat. The team included Biswas, Avik Mandal and Rahul Haldar, both from Sonarpur. They started from Srinagar on December 7. The first stop was Kupwara, followed by Lolab Valley in the north-western part of Srinagar. “It started snowing when we reached Bangus Valley. Going uphill on a cycle is the biggest challenge in the mountains. At a steep angle, you have to push the pedal harder and feel breathless sooner,” Biswas said. The cyclists carried at least two days’ ration apart from tents and other essentials, and tried to set up a camp where they could not find a hotel. “Don’t expect a mechanic when you have a flat tire or a damaged spoke. A cyclist has to carry the entire toolkit,” said Haldar. The team reached 10,000ft altitude when they reached the Sangla Pass area. “The difficulty level went up when we began to climb down at Pahalgam. Roads were covered with snow and we could spot vehicles which had met with accidents,” Biswas said. The team completed the journey on Sunday and will head to the Wagah border before catching a train to Kolkata.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/trio-from-bengal-pedals-450km-through-kashmir-snow-to-promote-winter-cycling/articleshow/88765702.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New CNCI facility adds 460 beds to Kolkata cancer treatment infra||KOLKATA: Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute’s 460-bed new campus was officially launched on Friday.  A collaborative project between the central and state governments, this public sector cancer specialty hospital in Bengal has the latest equipment and state-of-the-art facilities to offer advanced care for cancer patients. Apart from patients in Bengal, this hospital is expected to cater to those from neighbouring states as well. It was inaugurated virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee while Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya was present in person on the Rajarhat campus on Friday. Built over 10 acres in Rajarhat, this new campus will have advanced diagnostic services and the latest equipment, including those for imaging, apart from a nuclear medicine facility, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, preventive oncology, and palliative care. The pandemic had derailed the opening of this new campus, but OPD services were made partly functional in August 2020. In fact, a tower on the hospital campus is still being used as a Covid facility by the Ben-gal government. An amount of about Rs 530 crore has been pumped into this hospital — the Centre has provided Rs 400 crore while the remaining Rs 130 crore has been given by the state in a 75:25 ratio. Although Kolkata now has some cancer specialty hospitals, which include Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital, Tata Medical Centre and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Hospital, so far, CNCI is the only government-run cancer hospital in Bengal. An autonomous body under the central government, with a stake from the state government, CNCI started its first campus in Hazra in 1950. The 200-bed hospital has been under tremendous patient load. An expansion plan in 2005 for a new campus in Tollygunge had to be aborted as the land available was not sufficient. The proposal for the Rajarhat unit was made in 2008, where the state government provided 7.5 acres free of cost. The remaining 2.5 acres were purchased by CNCI with funds provided by the government of India. Apart from cancer treatment, the second campus will have an advanced research unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/new-cnci-facility-adds-460-beds-to-kol-cancer-treatment-infra/articleshow/88765704.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Monitoring Kolkata's air quality gets better with 17 AQI stations||KOLKATA: The city can now get a robust picture of its ambient air quality with 10 new sensor-based continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) providing real-time air quality data along the length and breadth of Kolkata, apart from the seven existing CAAQMS. Moreover, 10 more sensor-based stations are coming up at identified pollution hot spots across the city by March this year. Among the new spots, Leather Complex (Bantala), Barrackpore police commissioner’s office, Sector V and Vivekananda Women’s College (Behala Chowrasta) recorded poor air quality on Friday while the rest recorded moderate air quality. According to WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra, “The sensors are periodically calibrated against the reference-grade monitors and are being used for air quality management for the city and the rest of the state. The data represents broad trends of air pollution in the locality.” Apart from its existing seven CAAQMS — at Ballygunge, Jadavpur, Rabindra Sarobar, Victoria Memorial, Fort William, Rabindra Bharati University campus (B T Road) and Salt Lake — the 10 new stations cover some critical areas where pollution is perceived to be higher than in the rest of the city. “We are now analysing data to identify the sources of air pollution to adopt appropriate remedial measures,” a senior PCB scientist said. The data from 17 stations provides a clearer picture of the ambient air quality of the city. “For instance, Sector V, the city’s IT hub, is often found to have ‘poor’ air quality despite there being a lake nearby. However, we are trying to analyze the vehicular density of the area, which is much higher throughout the day. Behala Chowrasta is another polluted zone because of vehicular density and construction of the Metro corridor. The air quality at Leather Complex, for instance, remains poor most of the time. The dhapa dumping ground may be one reason. “But, we may need to investigate whether pollution control devices at the leather units are functioning properly,” said a source. Since all these CAAQMS are set up following the mandate of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the next 10 sensor-based CAAQMS will come up at pollution hot spots, like sites of landfills, mega real-estate projects, under-construction Metro corridors, hospitals and sensitive zones. “We have spoken to KMC, which will provide us with the appropriate sites for setting up the monitoring stations. Unlike conventional CAAQMS, these sensor-based stations are cost efficient and require less space,” said a WBPCB official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/monitoring-city-air-quality-gets-better-with-17-aqi-stns/articleshow/88765705.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Chingrighata traffic trial pushed back||Kolkata: The trial for new traffic flow at Chingrighata Crossing before the Metro pillar construction work has been delayed further after Beliaghata traffic guard raised objection to a 40-metre-long road expansion carried on the Garia-bound carriageway. The trial was scheduled to start on Friday. Cops claimed that the “reverse slope” which has been created due to “faulty road engineering” might lead to accidents. After the KMDA officials were informed about the matter, they inspected jointly with cops the Salt Lake-bound stretch of the crossing and found that an immediate rectification is needed before the trial run. With the delay stretching into its third week, all the agencies concerned are drawing up a new timeline to complete the trials. Earlier, cops had wanted to wait till December 31 due to the rush for New Year celebrations. By the third week of December, the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited had razed the pavement on the eastern flank of the road to make way for traffic movement. A 12-metre-long area in the middle of the road is set to be cordoned off for the construction of a Metro pillar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/chingrighata-traffic-trial-pushed-back/articleshow/88765706.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

However, their journey will begin against the Kiwis in a five-match ODI series just ahead of the mega event. “We will get a great opportunity to acclimatize to the conditions in New Zealand. Playing against the Kiwis will help us rectify our errors and also test our bench strength ahead of the World Cup,” said Jhulan during a virtual interaction after she was named the ambassador of the Legends League Cricket.“In the recent past we have not played much at international level. The series will be a good chance for us to get familiar with the pitches and the weather. I think it will definitely boost our confidence going into the World Cup,” said the leading wicket-taker in ODIs.The India women will open their World Cup campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan on March 6, but for Jhulan the pressure will be the same as in any other matches. “It’s the World Cup, so every team is important. Our objective first is to reach the top four and the focus will be to perform consistently in all the matches. We have to treat all the teams equally,” said the former India captain.Many are contemplating that the pacer from Chakda might hang her boots just after the World Cup, but Jhulan remained tight-lipped about her future plans.“The World Cup is the priority at the moment. We have been preparing for this for the past five years since the global pandemic forced its postponement. It’s not easy for any athlete when an event like World Cup is pushed back for a year. “With cases rising again, we players are anxious but at the same time we are continuing our individual training so that we are best prepared for the prestigious event. I am not thinking beyond that. We have to play good cricket and will think about the rest after the World Cup,” concluded Jhulan.The 18-member India squad is expected to depart for New Zealand at the end of this month with the One-Day series kicking off on February 11.Legends League Cricket will be live on Sony Ten1 & Sony Ten3||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/nz-series-ahead-of-wc-will-be-helpful/articleshow/88765707.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal's Covid cases race to 82,427 in a fortnight but fatality rate at 0.2%||KOLKATA: Covid fatality rate (CFR) in Bengal during the last fortnight between December 25 and January 7 — the period which saw an Omicron triggered wave of transmission sweeping across the country including the state — has been just 0.2%, which, experts believe, points at the fact that though the new variant has been affecting thousands everyday, it remains far less virulent than its predecessors. Bengal’s overall CFR remains around 1.1%. In this 14-day phase, Kolkata reported 37,961 fresh Covid cases, and Bengal reported 82,427 Covid cases. Covid deaths in Kolkata in this period was 48, in Bengal it was 157. Among these 157 deaths in Bengal, at least 41 persons had no diagnosed co-morbidities, indicating over two-third Covid deaths in this period had underlying co-morbidities. Another fact which emerges is that a larger proportion of the deaths in this 14-day period had been in the 75-plus age-group. CM Mamata Banerjee has indicated that the state will investigate these deaths to find out the reasons. The hospital admission figures also indicate that far lesser people had required hospitalisation in this phase. In this 14-day period, hospitalisations increased by 1,797 but home isolations shot up by 42,138. While the Delta variant could spread from one to around 3-4 people, the infectivity potential of Omicron is around 2.5 times of that, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “It means an Omicron-infected person can infect at least around 9 people. So, we have had an explosion of cases which may continue for at least a fortnight more. But it has been far less virulent which is proved by the low death-rate. In any pandemic, this is the general pattern. The virus gets more transmissible but loses its sting with every wave,” said Dhar. The spike in cases has been frightening since it has been happening in geometric progression each day during the current wave, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “It has struck suddenly, and numbers have been racing. But hospitalization has been low in proportion to the number of people affected which means the disease has been less severe, which is reflected in the low death-rate. While this points at a weaker virus, the vaccination, too, has acted as a shield,” said Jain. Dhar said at the peak of the second wave, death rate had been around 8% in the country. “It could be less than 3% this time,” he said. The current predominant variant, Omicron, is mainly affecting the upper airway and lung affection is much lower, said Woodlands Hospital CEO Rupali Basu. “That’s why oxygen requirement is almost nil. Hence case fatality is minimal.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-cases-race-to-82427-in-a-fortnight-but-fatality-rate-at-0-2/articleshow/88765709.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Kolkata||Third-time Covid-unlucky, doctors sound caution||KOLKATA: In July last year, a 61-year-old doctor in Delhi was the first in the country to be struck by the novel coronavirus twice, caused by the Alpha and Delta variants, 22 days apart. This time in Kolkata, as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps across a large number of households every day, the number of reinfections threatens to break all records. A substantial number of individuals have tested positive not once or twice, but thrice, including many in a span of merely 16 months. All of them were already vaccinated twice before contracting the virus for the third time. Fashion designer and Asansol MLA Agnimitra Paul was diagnosed with Covid for the third time earlier this week. Paul herself tweeted about it on January 5. “I have tested Covid Positive. Third time. But don’t worry. I am fine. I will follow Covid guidelines & will join work soon. Covid is spreading fast, so wear a mask, use sanitizer, maintain distance...,” she posted on Twitter. She first came down with Covid for the first time in September, 2020. The second infection was detected on May 7, 2021 and the third in the first week of January, 2022, her aides stated. Paul was vaccinated in April, last year. A study suggested that the average reinfection risk rose from about 5% four months after initial infection to 50% by 17 months. The efficacy of vaccines waned in six-eight months and reinfection was inevitable as the virus kept mutating, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Vaccines can’t act as a shield in this wave, especially for those who got the shot early. So, we have seen a large number of vaccinated people test positive. Many of these had tested positive during the first two waves as well, when they were unvaccinated,” said Sarkar. “Everyone needs to follow Covid-safety norms. The unvaccinaed need to be as cautious as the rest.” Trinamool functionary, singer and ex-Asansol MP Babul Supriyo, too, has tested positive for the third time. “Me, my wife, dad, multiple staff, have all tested positive... And, this is my 3rd time. First in November 2020, when I lost my Maa and somehow saved my Dad. Then again on April 21 and now... not really worried about the positiveness but the sheer number of individuals who got contracted and no way to find out who gave it to whom. Very few are wearing masks,” he posted online. CPM leader Kaustav Chatterjee has been affected third time as well. “Third time affected by Covid virus although after completing 2nd dose of vaccine. 3rd time affected within... 16 months,” he tweeted. Not only politicians but also a joint commissioner of Kolkata police, heading a key unit, had to be hospitalized at a private hospital in south Kolkata towards the end of last year after contracting the novel coronavirus for the third time. A man who is known for his love for exercise and one who maintains all Covid-safety norms all the time, his reinfection has shocked his colleagues. ICMR chief Balram Bhargava recently pointed out that there was still no data to find out after how many days a person, who had already had Covid, could again be susceptible to the novel coronavirus. “A person, who contracts the virus and is cured, develops antibodies which help him/her fight the virus. But the duration of these antibodies is believed to be short-lived,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/third-time-cov-unlucky-doctors-sound-caution/articleshow/88765710.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to Co-Win, 10.3 lakh children in this age-group have been vaccinated in the state till Friday. Among the 8.5 lakh vaccine doses administered on Friday, 2.9 lakh were given to this age-group. There are around 48 lakh vaccine-eligible children in this group. In Kolkata, over 28,000 children have been inoculated, and across India, over two crore children in this age-group have already been vaccinated. A senior state official said, “At this pace, we can complete the vaccination process for this age-group by the month-end.” La Martiniere secretary Supriyo Dhar said, “Nearly 200 students have been vaccinated in three days. The numbers are increasing with each passing day.” Like KMC has tied up with schools in Kolkata, NKDA along with DPS Newtown organized its vaccination drive on Friday in which 300 students were vaccinated. Sonali Sen, principal, DPS Newtown, said “We are thankful to NKDA for leading our young ones towards a Covid-free life. We have planned another camp next week for the rest of the kids in this age-group.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/10l-kids-jabbed-in-5-days/articleshow/88765711.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals draw up lists ahead of third jab drive from Monday||KOLKATA: Hospitals across the city have started listing the names of their healthcare workers ahead of the rollout of the precautionary dose of Covid vaccine on Monday. The all-India drive for precautionary dose will start with healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens. The state on Friday also received a directive from the Union health ministry on the third dose rollout. “We have got the directive on the precautionary dose roll from the Union health ministry and it is being shared will all stakeholders for their reference. Anyone from the three categories of priority group—healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens—wants free vaccine, will get it from government vaccination centres,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. Around 5 lakh healthcare workers, 7 lakh frontline workers and 1.1 crore senior citizens are expected to take the third dose in Bengal. “We were waiting for the guideline for some clarity. Now that it has come and we will start inoculating our own hospital staff from Monday,” said a source at AMRI group of Hospitals. “We will hold a camp on January 10, 11, 12 for the vaccination for our healthcare workers and for senior citizens at the hospital vaccination site. Covishield will be administered. From the next day, we will conduct the drive from the vaccination centre at La Martiniere School with both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon. The hospital has about 2,000 healthcare workers. According to the protocol, a nine-month gap is required between the second dose and the precautionary shot. All healthcare workers cutting across private and public sector had received their first and second doses free of cost. But this time, no dose will be supplied free to private hospitals. The private facilities will buy the precautionary doses of the vaccine for it healthcare workers. “We have started shortlisting healthcare workers who received their second dose nine month ago or before. About 90% of our 6,500 workforce across three Hospitals—RN Tagore, Narayana Howrah and the Barasat unit—will fall into this category. We have also identified separate space from where the third dose will be rolled out. We wish to cover this booster drive for our healthcare workers within a week,” said R Venkatseh, regional director (East) Narayana Health. “We have about 1,700 healthcare workers, from doctors to housekeeping staff, ambulance drivers and electricians. We will try to vaccinate all in the shortest time,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. At Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital, queries have been pouring in not only from healthcare and frontlin workers, but also from senior citizens who wants to be sure of getting the shot before visiting the hospital vaccination centre on Monday. “People have been calling up, asking about the requirements, such as the mandatory gap between the second and this dose, if they need to carry their second dose vaccination certificate and whether on-spot registration would be available,” said community medicine specialist Baisakhi Maji, nodal person for vaccination at ID&BG.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hosps-draw-up-lists-ahead-of-third-jab-drive-from-mon/articleshow/88765712.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

To start off, Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MCHK) and Calcutta National Medical College, where large number of healthcare workers are infected, will be conducting only few elective surgeries till the manpower crunch issues are solved. In MCKH, more than 300 healthcare workers including 160 senior and junior doctors are currently infected. Sources hinted at limiting OPD services too if the workforce gets reduced further. At CNMC the number of infected healthcare workers have gone up to 200 plus. The hospital too will restrict its patient service for now. Several departments including the surgery, gastroenterology and neurology at IPGMER currently is facing manpower shortage. These departments have also decided to conduct only select procedures for the time being.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/med-colleges-put-planned-ops-on-hold/articleshow/88765713.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Quarantine confusion for Cov patients in hosps||Kolkata: The home isolation period has been reduced to seven days, much to the relief of Covid-affected patients, but there’s confusion over the quarantine period for those in hospital. The question is whether it would be longer for those admitted and if it would begin from the day of discharge. Thousands have already completed their home isolation and more are set to finish next week. But a large number might have to serve a longer quarantine as they spent the first two-three days in hospital, which many health facilities felt, might not be considered as isolation.A private firm employee who lives in a south Kolkata rented flat, got hospitalized last Friday after he developed symptoms. “Since I live alone, I got an RT-PCR done at a private hospital and took admission after testing positive. I was released on the third day as I had mild symptoms, but it has been mentioned in my discharge certificate that the isolation period ends this Sunday. That means, it stretches to nine days instead of seven,” said the 32-year-old.Hospitals have been hit hard by the rule as scores of healthcare workers, including doctors, are serving the mandatory week-long home isolation. Many, who had got admitted, might face a delayed return. “Several of our employees had got admitted since they didn’t have isolation facilities or had elders in the family and stayed away. Even though they have recovered and have been at home for 3-4 days without fever, their quarantine period will be counted from the day of discharge,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) zonal head R Venkatesh. Around 150 healthcare workers, including 25 doctors of RTIICS are in isolation. “We expect 50% of them to return next week. Some will not be able to join as they were in hospital the first few days,” added Venkatesh. Peerless Hospital has 35 healthcare workers in isolation, including 2-3 in hospital. “Ideally, the isolation period should begin from the day of testing positive. If one has completed the period and has been without fever for last three days, he or she should be able come out of quarantine. But there is a confusion and we are trying to seek clarification,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.At Ruby, 25 healthworkers, including five doctors are in isolation. “Many of our nurses and other staff got admitted. They would have returned to work in seven days, but now it will take longer,” said GM operations Subhashish Datta. Medica has included hospitalisation period in the seven-day isolation time. “A few employees were in hospital but joined after 5 days at home,” said chairperson Alok Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/quarantine-confusion-for-cov-patients-in-hosps/articleshow/88765714.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Random tests, checkpoints at Posta to stop coronavirus transmission||KOLKATA: The administration has put in place several measures in Posta, Koley Market and other crowded markets in the central business hub to break the virus transmission chain and safeguard local residents, traders and customers. The administration has set up rapid testing centres inside the markets, started random testing for Covid-19 among truck drivers and their helpers, banning repeat trips for unvaccinated drivers and arranging for vaccination for traders, labourers and drivers. On Thursday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, while addressing her officials, had instructed to keep a close watch on Posta and other crowded markets and check if truck drivers and their helpers are vaccinated. The cops, too, have set up guardrails in the markets and put up checkpoints so that people practice social distancing and vehicles are parked at a distance from each other. “We have been distributing masks and sanitisers every day and telling drivers, helpers and labourers to not crowd but space out their seating arrangements. The cops, too, are announcing about the safety guidelines. All the traders in Posta have been fully vaccinated,” said Chandan Chakraborty, president of the traders’ association in Posta. Kiosks have been set up in the market for rapid testing of those coming from outside. “If somebody is found positive, we are advising them to isolate themselves and consult doctors at local health centres,” said Vivek Gupta, MLA of Jorasanko where Posta is located. Several thousand trucks arrive at Posta and Koley Market everyday, most of which are from neighbouring states. Despite restrictions by the government, the crowds have only swelled in wholesale and community markets with many flouting the safety guidelines. “We are checking the vaccination status of the drivers and their helpers. Those who disagree to get vaccinated are not being allowed repeat trips by the market committees,” said an officer of the central division of Kolkata Police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/random-tests-check-points-at-posta-to-stop-virus-transmission/articleshow/88765715.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Among the many suggestions that were discussed was the option of shutting down alternate shops each day (not grocery or essential services shops) at bigger markets. Deploying cops at market gates and making timely announcements on compulsorily wearing masks were also discussed. The civic officials said that police have suggested that shops around containment zones are asked to follow all Covid norms seriously. An officer from a south Kolkata police station stated they had been asked to “ensure that no one was loitering uselessly” in the market. “We asked people not to stay at the market once they have bought their essentials,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kp-kmc-lens-on-mkts-to-enforce-covid-rules/articleshow/88765716.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The police headquarters refused to clarify if this order is for a short period or whether the matter will be reviewed only after a significant drop in numbers. The breathalyzer test, reintroduced after a 16-month Covid break on November 8 last year, had helped cops in the winter season to put a leash on drink-driving. "An order was passed on to us on Thursday night. Till Friday evening, the order had not been reviewed.

---||Kolkata||‘Not sharing home test result a worry’||Kolkata: Home rapid antigen test kits are running out of shelves in medical stores across the city with people with Covid symptoms using them to check if it is the virus or common flu. Healthcare experts said that while it is good for people to have easy access to Covid-19 tests, what is worrying is the absence of stringent norms to upload the test result. This is leading to under-reporting of cases that can hamper public healthcare strategy, they fear.The demand for the easy-to-use home test kits started rising about a week ago as cluster infections began getting reported from various parts of the city. Many are now conducting the tests at home using kits purchased online or from local medical stores. Though there is a provision to upload the home kit test result in the ICMR portal, in the absence of stringent norms to do so, hardly any result gets reported unlike the mandatory requirement of labs.“When data is not shared, it results in under-reporting of positive cases. Since such rapid test kits have low sensitivity, chances of throwing up false negative result is also high. In such a case, the person will get a false sense of security and violate isolation norms,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri.While a positive report by such kits is considered true positive, negative results, especially by those who have symptoms, are always advised to undergo an RT-PCR confirmatory test.“It is good that people are showing interest in knowing their Covid-19 status using these easily accessible kits. But if the data is not captured correctly, then this will have some sort of impact in organising public health strategy,” said Diptendra Sarkar, professor of surgery at IPGMER.According to ICMR guideline, the user must download the home test mobile app that guides on how to use the kit. Once the test is over, the user is required to take a photograph of the test strip with the same cellphone that was used to download the app and register. The data in the app of this mobile phone is then centrally captured in a secured server which is connected to the ICMR Covid-19 testing portal.But as the testing kits contain the user manual, most user do not even bother to download the app.“While people should be responsible to ensure that they share their Covid status data, we could also have some system to track people who are self- testing at home. Under-reporting of cases will affect in containing and care measures,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/not-sharing-home-test-result-a-worry/articleshow/88765719.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Rising Cov cases, worker shortage blamed for fewer buses on road||Kolkata: Normal bus services have taken a hit after several bus workers, mostly from the neighbouring districts, refused to join work citing two reasons — the rising number of Covid infections in the city and the non-availability of trains to return home at night from the garage. With Covid cases rising, these workers are refusing to sleep inside the buses. According to Tapan Banerjee of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate, a few infections have already been reported from routes originating from around EM Bypass. Swapan Ghosh from the Minibus Operators Coordination Committee said a few workers on at least two routes — Sakherbazar -Howrah and Tangra-Howrah — are presently Covid-positive.But it is not just the bus workers alone who are to be blamed for erratic services this week. “The rapid surge in Covid cases has led to a sudden drop in passengers. Offices are open with minimum attendance. Beyond the morning and evening office hours, we are not getting passengers. With diesel prices still at Rs 90, we are barely able to provide skeletal services. Thus, at least five important routes — KB-15, 007, 17, 235 and 85 — operated three to four buses on Friday. Most have over 20 buses,” said Banerjee.Ghosh said he himself was earning anything between Rs 70-Rs 125 daily after paying the bus workers and for fuel. “Around 25% of the fleet, operational even last week, are presently off the road. A full lockdown is actually better for us than to operate under such a challenging situation,” claimed Ghosh. “I availed a jam-packed bus after waiting for over one-and-a-half-hours at Esplanade. I risked my life by boarding the packed bus amid the pandemic situation as I had no other option,” said Geeta Majumdar, a passenger headed for Raspunja besides Thakurpukur. Bus unions have demanded booster doses for all bus workers. “Calling them frontline warriors will be not wrong at all. Unless they feel protected, how will people reach their destinations?” asked Ghosh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rising-cov-cases-worker-shortage-blamed-for-fewer-buses-on-road/articleshow/88765720.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Bhopal||Covid-19: Madhya Pradesh tops in 15-18 vaccination, 19.55 lakh kids inoculated||BHOPAL: With more than 19.55 lakh children aged between 15 and 17 years administered with the first dose of vaccine, Madhya Pradesh is on top in the country as far as number of vaccinating kids is concerned. However, due to issues related to unavailability of the vaccines owing to ‘high vaccination’ in initial days, vaccination of this age group was slower in last two days compared to the rate at which kids in this age group were vaccinated in the first two days. Officials however claim that there is no shortage of vaccine. Mission director, NHM Madhya Pradesh, Priyanka Das said, “There is no shortage of vaccine, infact seeing our performance in vaccination of the 15 to 17 target age group, Government of India has preponed our vaccine availability schedule, that means that the vaccines that we were supposed to receive over a longer period of time will be made available before the initial schedule. Now within a few days we have vaccinated more than 50% of the estimated population in the 15 to 17 target group.” Sources from the health department said that there was some crunch as it was not expected that this much vaccination of this target age group will take place in state. It is for this crunch and also due to universal vaccination that vaccination in the age group of 15 and 17 years was less on Friday. Districts that had left over stock of Covaxin carried out the vaccination in this age bracket, others carried out universal and routine Covid-19 vaccination.

The bench comprising Justice S Nageshwar Rao and Justice D R Gawai advised the petitioner, who had moved the court for restoration of his petition which the court had dismissed after the MP government decided to hold a direct election of majors in urban civil bodies and not indirect election by elected corporators as the previous Kamal Nath government had decided, but later a notification to this effect was not issued. While asking the petitioner to withdraw the restoration petition, the court said that if notification for a direct election of mayors has not been issued, he should file a fresh petition in the MP high court. Nagrik Upbhokta Margdarshak Manch had filed a petition in the MP high court challenging the decision of the erstwhile Kamal Nath government to hold an indirect election of mayors by voting of the elected corporators in place of direct election as had been the practice till then. The court had, however, dismissed the petition. A revision petition filed in the high court was also dismissed. Following this, the petitioner organisation moved a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court on the issue. In the meanwhile, the new Shivraj Singh Chouhan government announced its decision to stick to direct election of mayors by the people, following which the supreme court dismissed the petition. The petitioner organisation later filed a restoration petition praying the court to recall its earlier order on the ground that the notification providing for direct election of mayors has not been issued by the state government. After examining the issue, the court advised the petitioner to withdraw its restoration petition and file a fresh petition in the MP high court, if the state government had not issued a notification as per its avowed intent to hold a direct election to the post of mayors in the urban local; bodies.Following this, the petitioner organisation withdrew its restoration petition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/file-fresh-plea-in-mphc-on-mayoral-poll-notification/articleshow/88765751.cms||---

Moreover, four cabinet berths are also vacant. After adjusting supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia and party loyalists, BJP would go for another round of exercise to adjust its MLAs and leaders who are not so happy, said sources. There is a long list of takers, including former ministers, MLAs, former members of boards and corporations and senior party leaders who are anxiosly waiting to get a ministerial berth or atleast ministerial rank by getting a place in boards and corporations, if not in the cabinet. The rumours of cabinet expansion started soon after Sulochana Rawat got elected as BJP legislator from Jobat assembly constituency. She quit Congress to join BJP in October last year before bypolls, after being reportedly promised a ministerial berth. Apart from Rawat, there is a long list of BJP MLAs and former ministers waiting to be ministers. Rajendra Shukla, Ramesh Mendola, Sanjay Pathak, Ajay Vishnoi, are a few of them. There are 30 ministers in the cabinet and four more can be accommodated. If the party prefers to keep ministerial berths vacant till 2023 assembly polls to keep everyone waiting, it may not go down well with senior leaders who have a strong base in their areas. Similarly, posts in number of boards and corporations in the state are still vacant. There is no chairman or vice chairman in development authorities including Bhopal, Jabalpur, Gwalior, Ujjain, Dewas, Ratlam, Katni and Amarkantak. Bundelkhand, Vindhya and Mahakaushal development authorities are also waiting for political appointments. The political appointments in Kol, Bharia and Baiga development authorities are also being awaited. BJP leaders said, requesting anonymity that the cabinet expansion or appointment in boards and corporations is the prerogative of the government and it will be done as and when it is felt necessary. But after the political appointments ten days back, many feel that another round of such exercise is not too far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/20-boards-corporations-still-await-political-appointees/articleshow/88765752.cms||Ankur Sirothia

On Thursday, the mining was restarted after the department issued a transit pass to the contractor of the works Larson and Toubro Limited following an order issued by the High Court.The mining and geology department had issued a show cause notice to the construction as well as National Highway Authority officials concerned and stopped the mining works after a local resident, who claimed to share the border of his property with the government puramboke land where excavation is carried out, raised objection.The state High Court issued the order on December 31 after considering a petition filed by Larson and Toubro Limited. The legal counsel argued that the works of the national highway, which is of strategic importance, has been held up owing to the non-issuance of the transit pass needed for the excavation of earth. The counsel also submitted that no mining activities will be carried out on the buffer zone, which includes the portion of land in dispute. The justice approved this plea and directed the district geologist, mining and geology department to issue a transit pass.Speaking to TOI, NHAI officials said that they were worried that the issue would affect the progress of the works. They were trying to complete the work of the road by March, 2022, and failure to carry out excavations when favourable weather conditions existed would lead to further delay. The mining and geology department had sanctioned permit to the construction firm Larson and Toubro Limited, which is carrying out the road works on December 10 to extract and remove 60,891 metric tonnes of ordinary earth from puramboke land spread over 85.9 acres in Parasuvakkal village under Neyyattinkara taluk. But on December 24, the firm was served a notice directing them to stop the mining.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/nh-work-ordinary-earth-mining-resumes/articleshow/88765763.cms||---

The government’s concern over this has been conveyed to the Attukal Temple Trust.The government has also urged the temple trust to avoid all the cultural programmes organised as part of the pongala festival. Since the government has banned the gathering of people, no such cultural programmes can be allowed at the present situation, said the minister.He said by allowing all the rituals at the temple as part of the pongala festival, it would be better if people perform the pongala at their respective households. This would prevent the people gathering at one place which is dangerous in the present situation, said the minister.The government has conveyed all the decisions to the trust authorities in the review meeting held on Thursday and urged them to take an appropriate decision based on that. A final decision on this can be expected in a week, said Sivankutty.``The situation prevailing after a week will be assessed before taking the final decision. The priority is being given to avoid the gathering of the people and also not to disturb the rituals of the temple done as part of the annual festival,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/attukal-pongala-to-be-conducted-sans-crowd/articleshow/88765766.cms||---

However, with the rapid surge in Covid cases, she has decided to put off her visit to Ahmedabad. With surging cases of Covid and concerns over the Omicron variant, passenger footfalls at the city airport are down by at least 30% over the past fortnight. Sources at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport said that against some 24,000 passengers a day at the city airport just ahead of Christmas, barely 16,000 passengers are travelling now. Passenger footfalls at the city airport peaked in November with at least 25,400 passengers travelling on a given day, according to estimates based on data compiled by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). Singh said, “I was planning to visit Ahmedabad on January 8 for business-related work. But with cases of coronavirus infections going up both in Mumbai and Ahmedabad, I decided not to venture out and I am very much holed up within the house.” Ekta Khetan, a city-based blogger, said, “I was planning to take a trip to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in February. But with the sudden spike in cases, I am unsure of travelling and will be cancelling my bookings. It is important to stay indoors and safe at this point.” The effect was seen more drastically soon after the cancellation of Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) 2022 was announced on Thursday. “The cancellation of VGGS was quite an indicator that the Covid-19 situation is not good. That played a dampener and travel has clearly been affected. People who were planning to visit for business purposes, or even casual visits have now begun deferring and cancelling their travel plans,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/covid-fears-ground-fliers-30-decrease-in-fortnight/articleshow/88765775.cms||Niyati Parikh

This is apparent from the figures of the liquor seizure in Gujarat. On an average, 11 bottles of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) were seized in 2021. According to the figures of Gujarat police, the cops seized liquor worth Rs 115 crore in 2020 which rose to Rs 124 crore in 2021. The seizure include both the country liquor and the IMFL. In the category of IMFL, 45.15 lakh liquor bottles worth Rs 114 crore were seized in 2020 which rose to 57.12 lakh liquor bottles worth Rs 122 crore in 2021, said sources in police. The state police seized 11.59 lakh litre liquor worth Rs 1.95 crore in 2020 and 17.54 lakh litre liquor worth Rs 2.30 crore in 2021. “In 2020, Gujarat police filed 1.53 lakh cases under the prohibition act for liquor seizures across the state which increased to 1.69 lakh cases in 2021,” said an officer of Gujarat police. The officer said that around 1.64 lakh accused were caught under bootlegging charges in 2020 and 1.67 lakh in 2021. The officer added that the liquor seizures, their cases and accused were less in 2020 due to the lockdown of around three months. Even though curbs were there in 2021 due to increased Covid cases, there was no restrictions on transport so the liquor continued to flow into the dry state. According to the figures, there are still 21,583 accused absconding in the cases of liquor seizures. In 2019, Gujarat police had seized IMFL and country liquor worth Rs 215 crore. In that year, around 68 lakh bottles of IMFL were seized. Gujarat DGP Ashish Bhatia said that the liquor seizure cases have increased because of police alertness. On a query about smuggling of liquor into Gujarat, Bhatia said, “It is humanly impossible to check each and every truck coming to the state. But we remain alert and with the help of human intelligence and inputs keep a tab on liquor mafias.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/11-liquor-bottles-seized-in-dry-gujarat-every-minute-last-year/articleshow/88765787.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The HC has sought a report from the Ahmedabad MEGA Clean Association, a consortium of companies that runs six CETPs in industrial clusters, on January 21, stating clearly the number of illegal domestic connections linked to the pipeline. It will also state the possibility of accommodating nine textile units from Naroda, a textile unit in Dudheshwar and Ashima Ltd and whether it can carry the treated trade effluents from these units to the Sabarmati. The industries have expressed helplessness in discharging their wastewater into the mega pipeline; recently, Ashima Ltd was also refused a connection. The judges told the lawyer representing the association, “If you can extend your helping hand, it can be appreciated. The ball is in your court now.” The high court ordered the association to strictly deal with the illegal connections and block all of them because their sewage remains untreated and is discharged directly into the river. “The sewage gets some treatment at STPs. This is more hazardous,” the HC said and requested the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to take notice of this problem and help to solve it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/snap-illegal-drainage-connections-hc/articleshow/88765790.cms||---

She was treated at the same hospital. The Ahmedabad District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the hospital and its insurer to pay Rs 1.98 lakh with 8% interest.According to case details, Bhartiben Modi, 71, and her husband had gone to visit a patient at CIMS Hospital on January 4, 2015. The couple paid Rs 60 for gate passes. The husband was allowed to enter the hospital while Bhartiben waited in the lounge where the floor was being cleaned. Bhartiben lost her balance, fell and got injured. She was hospitalised, treated and operated upon in the same hospital and incurred a medical bill of Rs 2.78 lakh.Bhartiben had an insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh and she paid the remaining amount from her pocket. Later, she sued the hospital and its insurance company, the Oriental Insurance Co Ltd. Through her advocate Hardik B Shah, she demanded Rs 5.12 lakh compensation, stating that there was no sign warning visitors that the floor was being cleaned.The hospital management refuted her allegations of negligence and argued that Bhartiben already had alignment problem with her legs and fell due to her own negligence. It claimed that there was no fault on part of either hospital management or its staff. The hospital’s insurer claimed that it was not liable to pay Bhartiben as she was not the hospital’s consumer.After hearing the case, the consumer court refused to accept the hospital’s claim that there was a sign in place, warning the visitors about the slippery floor. It said that it was the hospital’s duty to instruct its security to warn people. The court also said that the hospital had obtained public liability non-industrial policy from the insurance company and thus both are liable to pay.The consumer court refused to grant reimbursement to Bhartiben for nursing charges and airfare of her four daughters, who had flown down from the US to visit her due to the accident. The court said that she was entitled to the medical bill, which she had paid to the same hospital. After deducting her Mediclaim amount, the consumer court ordered the hospital and its insurer Rs 1.98 lakh with 8% interest. They have also been asked to pay Rs 15,000 more towards compensation for harassment and legal expenditure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/lost-footing-cims-told-to-foot-bill/articleshow/88765792.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat Pollution Control Board gets blistering rebuke from HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday came down heavily on the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for granting Ashima Ltd permission to discharge its treated trade effluent in the sewer, and asked for immediate suspension of the officer who gave his consent to the industrial unit. The high court has ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the GPCB to sever all drainage connections of industrial units found discharging their effluents into sewerage networks. Till date, 393 such drainage connections have been snapped to curb mixing of trade effluents with sewage wastewater so as to improve the functioning of Sewage Treatment Plants. With effluents being discharged by the industries, improperly treated wastewater is released directly into the Sabarmati, further polluting it. During a hearing on this issue, the textile unit, whose drains have been disconnected, submitted that its three old Effluent Treatment Plants have been closed and a new ETP has been set up. Its lawyer informed the court that the GPCB on January 5, 2022 consented to the industrial unit discharging its treated effluent in the sewage line. He also submitted that the GPCB granted permission after having fresh samples tested. This infuriated the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati, who asked GPCB, “How could you have said so? How can we trust GPCB? Is it not a mockery you have made Mr Vyas (GPCB’s counsel)?” The court asked who had signed GBCP’s consent report for Ashima, and upon being informed that a senior environment engineer did it, the judges said, “Then he is in contempt (of court). He does not deserve to remain in office. He should be suspended with immediate effect. Are we fools that we have invested so many hours to resolve the problem and finally to read this consent order? Such things have shaken our confidence.” HC expressed its appreciation to Arvind Ltd’s proposal to set up mechanism to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), but it ordered AMC, GPCB and the joint task force together to inspect ETPs all 11 industrial units situated in the city and submit a report on their condition by January 21.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gpcb-gets-blistering-rebuke-from-court/articleshow/88765793.cms||---

The exams were held earlier this year in two engineering colleges of Panchmahal district. Of the 233 students who were called before a committee set up by GTU to look into the matter, 18 were absolved of any wrongdoing as their involvement in copying during the exam could not be established, GTU said in a statement. “In all, 213 students have been given level-3 punishment, which means they cannot appear for any examination for the next one year. A student has been sentenced to level-4 punishment; the candidate cannot appear for exams for the next three years,” according to the statement. Another candidate has been given level-2 punishment which means all examinations s/he appeared for during the current semester remains cancelled. A total of 71 students from Om College were summoned by the committee. Of these, 54 candidates were found involved in mass copying during the third semester degree engineering exam held recently and 17 candidates during the fifth semester exams, said sources. The other candidates were third semester engineering students from E C Tuwa, also in Panchmahal district. GTU has also decided to take action against colleges found to have played a role in encouraging mass copying. It has imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on such colleges and cancelled their centre for the next two examinations, the statement said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gtu-mass-copying-213-of-215-students-to-lose-one-year/articleshow/88765795.cms||---

It will sell two city gas distribution areas in Bhatinda and Amritsar in Punjab to its sister company, Gujarat Gas.“The deal size is valued at about Rs 160 crore and it was recently executed. GSPL got the rights for developing these two geographical areas before Gujarat Gas was acquired from BG Group by GSPC and merged with GSPC Gas,” said a senior government official aware of the developments. “Now that Gujarat Gas is one of the country’s largest CGD (city gas distribution) companies, it makes business sense to hand over our gas retail business to them.”The state government run GSPC is the parent company of GSPL.After getting the nod from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), GSPL executed a Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) with Gujarat Gas recently and the two city gas areas were sold through a slump sale, said sources. GSPL operates a 2,700-km statewide gas grid in Gujarat.GSPL won the 2,648 sq km area in Amritsar in 2015 by participating in the fourth CGD bidding round in 2015. A year later it received the authorization for 3,357 sq km in Bhatinda.In 2018, GSPL signed a joint venture agreement with Gujarat Gas to develop both areas on its behalf.Recently, the company got major relief after the farmers protesting at the borders of the national capital called off their year-long movement against the farm laws proposed by the Centre. The protesting farmers had blocked a part of GSPL’s ambitious cross-country gas pipeline project linking Mehsana in Gujarat to Bhatinda in Punjab.A major part of the incomplete pipeline project, spanning about 45km, passes through Punjab where fresh rounds of discussions have started with the farmers over the past few days, said sources.“GAIL has recently offered higher compensation amount for their project in the area,” said an official aware of the matter. “We are also going to sweeten the offer and talks are at an advanced stage with the farmers near Bhatinda.”The pipeline project is a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan for the National Gas Grid. The pipeline will supply gas to fertilizer companies, refineries, and city gas distributors along the route, who have already signed up gas offtake pacts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gspl-to-exit-city-retail-biz-sell-punjab-cgd-areas-to-guj-gas/articleshow/88765796.cms||---

The boys had also attacked her husband. According to an FIR filed with Ahmedabad railway police, Poonam Prajapati, a 28-year-old resident of Vakeel Chawl in Asarwa, used to pass through the parking area of Asarwa railway station to buy household items from Amdupura. She told police that some boys, who played cricket in the parking lot, used to warn her against using that path as it disturbed their game. “I told my husband Shreeram about the issue and he spoke to the boys against harassing me,” she said. Around 4.30pm on Thursday, Poonam along with her husband and kid were passing through the parking lot. “Seeing us, the boys — who seem to be in their teens — approached us and began a fight for disturbing their game.  They caught hold of my husband and began thrashing him. When I tried to rescue him, they hit me with their cricket bats. Seeing this, my son Navdeep tried to cover me. The boys did not spare him either. They hit him on the head with the bat. Navdeep suffered severe injury and fainted,” she said. The boys allegedly threatened her again before fleeing the place. Shreeram called an ambulance. Navdeep and Poonam were admitted to Civil hospital in Asarwa. Railway police registered a complaint of causing grievous hurt, criminal intimidation and abetment against unknown persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/game-disturbed-5-boys-hit-woman-kid-with-cricket-bat/articleshow/88765798.cms||---

Form filling for Gujarat has already been completed and the merit list will be announced this month,” said a source. Medical admissions under NEET-PG (postgraduate) came to a halt for four months after a group of candidates challenged the new quotas in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court on Friday allowed 27 per cent reservation for OBC (Other Backward Classes) and 10 per cent quota for students from poor families. The order clears the path for the large number of aspiring doctors who had cleared the NEET-PG exam held in September, but could not join colleges due to counselling being delayed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ug-pg-medical-intake-to-resume-in-last-week-of-jan/articleshow/88765801.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Parasite the culprit in death of 80 pelicans||VISAKHAPATNAM: Over 80 pelicans have been found dead at the Telineelapuram Bird Nesting Area under Tekkali mandal in Srikakulam district. A laboratory report has confirmed that the deaths are from a parasitic infection, and not flu or poisoning.  Forest officials said migratory birds such as painted storks and pelicans travel more than 6,000 km from Siberia, Germany, Australia and Hungary to make their way to sanctuaries in Srikakulam. The migration period usually starts in October. The winged visitors make the sanctuary their home for six to seven months during which they lay and hatch eggs. They leave the sanctuary between March and May along with their newborns. Speaking to TOI, forest range officer, Tekkali, P V Sastry said some pelicans were found lifeless at Telineelapuram. “We requested the assistant director of Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL), Srikakulam to conduct an autopsy to ascertain the reasons for the deaths and suggest ways to avert such deaths in future.” In the postmortem report, assistant director Dr P Mohinikumari stated a large number of contracaecum worms in the birds’ gizzards was detected. Based on the findings, the deaths might be attributed to a Pasteurella infection. The laboratory reports negated rumours that the deaths were caused by influenza. Sastry clarified that the birds feed on fish found in water bodies on an extent of 500 acres in the region. “We found the worms in the fish and the same worms were found in the dead pelicans. We will ask the fisheries department and authorities of Indira Gandhi Zoological Park, Vizag to find out how the worms got in the fish,” he said. Stating that there is an urgent need to take steps to save migratory birds with the coordination of various departments, forest department officials said deworming birds is not a solution as some birds may be laying eggs and others hatching.  It may be recalled that some species of migratory birds, including Asian open bill storks, were found dead at Chellamnaiduvalasa under Seethanagaram mandal in Vizianagaram district in 2020. It was suspected that pesticide poisoning was behind the deaths. Residents of the village launched a campaign to mitigate the use of pesticides on farms fields to protect migratory birds and the village as a sanctuary for the winged visitors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/parasite-the-culprit-in-death-of-80-pelicans/articleshow/88765805.cms||Nalla.Babu

In a letter to all the deputy commissioners, health secretary Arun Kumar Singh directed that all patients in home isolation be surveyed through the state-run helpline 104 at least three times. The DCs were also directed to ensure that Covid-19 kits are available to every patient in home isolation. The department also mandated that every Covid-19 patient will have to mandatorily register themselves with the Centre’s home isolation portal Swaraksha.nic.in and apply for home isolation. “Based on the credentials submitted by the patient, the district administration will decide,” the letter stated. “From the date of being tested, a patient may be kept in home isolation for at least seven days or up to three days till the patient’s fever subsides. Thereafter, the patient will be required to monitor his health for another week,” the letter read. 'Close to 5,000 home isolation kits distributed'However, doctors in the district remained skeptical about the efficacy of the guidelines. "With such overwhelming number of active cases, it will not be possible to routinely follow up patients in home isolation through the state-run call centre. That apart, many patients will not register themselves in the portal and evade the surveillance net," a city-based doctor said. Ranchi civil surgeon's office has claimed that it has distributed close to 5,000 home-isolation kits among the positive patients so far. That apart, Ranchi Sadar Hospital on Friday made public a call centre for providing telephonic consultations to home-isolation patients. "The number (0651 2220040) will also cater to patients with enquiries related to beds available in the hospital," the Ranchi Sadar Hospital management said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-govt-releases-new-sop-for-home-isolation/articleshow/88765808.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Workers at HEC had been on an indefinite strike since December 2, 2021, to demand payment of wages that have gone unpaid since the past six months."The strike at HEC ended on Friday afternoon. HEC director (marketing and production) and I had an interaction with the workers at all the three HEC plants. We gave them a patient hearing and assured them that all their grievances would be redressed. An appeal, signed by three HEC directors, spelling out details of payment of pending wages to workmen has also been issued, after which workers agreed to call off their strike," M.K Saxena, HEC director (personnel), told TOI.However, a section of HEC workers still continue to protest, stressing that their 37-day old strike would continue till a formal agreement was signed by HEC with trade union representatives. The HEC appeal, signed by all the three HEC directors –– M K Saxena (personnel), Rana S Chakravarty (marketing and production) and Arundati Panda (finance) –– while conceding that HEC suffered financial losses as a result of the strike since December 2, 2021, assured that one month's back wages would be paid to all workers and contract workers on January 10 whilst efforts would be made to pay 15 days’ wages by the end of January. The same formula would be followed from February onwards till all back wages are cleared in full, the HEC appeal stressed."However, payment of wages would depend on the cooperation of all workers concerned and the level of production achieved," the HEC appeal clarified. "We appeal to all workers to return to their work places and ensure that maximum output is achieved," it added. "Production has commenced from 02.17 pm Friday and there is complete normalcy at our plant," P K Behera, general manager, Heavy Machine Tools Plant, told TOI.A section of HEC workers seemed unhappy with the offer. "Only an appeal was issued today, though it was signed by all the three HEC directors. An appeal is not of any use as it cannot be enforced unless a formal agreement is signed by HEC directors and trade union representatives. The strike would continue as usual," Harendra Yadav, general secretary, HEC Hatia Mazdoor Sangh, affiliated to CITU, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/hec-strike-ends-after-37-days-section-of-workers-threatens-to-continue-stir/articleshow/88765810.cms||Tapas Biswas

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand unlikely to achieve 100% vaccination target by Jan 15||RANCHI: After missing the December 25 deadline for 100% vaccination against Covid-19, Jharkhand is likely to miss the second deadline of January 15 as well. The apprehension comes up from not only the slow pace of vaccination drive but also from the fact that fresh infection is spreading at a fast pace. The new infection, supposedly caused by a new and more infectious strain of the virus, has taken a large chunk of health workers into its grip and rendering eligible population temporarily unfit to take the jab. Earlier this week, the coverage of first dose of vaccine stood at 77% of eligible population when the target was set at 2.41 crore people but as the Centre allowed vaccination for children in the age group 15-18 years the target population for inoculation in the state increased to 2.65 crore, thereby reducing the achievement of first dose to 71%. The achievement for second dose of vaccine, which was estimated at 47% before the launch of vaccination drive for adolescents came down to 44% by Thursday. Under revised targets the state machinery has to inoculate remaining 29% of the eligible population – corresponding to 70,90,600 persons (approximately) with the first dose and 56% of the remaining eligible population, corresponding to 1,48,50,814 persons (approx.) with the second dose in the next eight days. Simple calculations indicate that to achieve this mammoth target around 27 lakh doses have to be administered daily. Apart from the mammoth target, new infection is yet another challenge facing the state health machinery. Doctors advise that in case of Covid infection, people should not take vaccination, unless they recover. The ideal gap after recovery is around a week. State president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Arun Kumar Singh, said that whoever is infected with present strain of the virus, even if asymptomatic, should wait for RTPCR negative report before they go for the jab. “This applies for the first as well as the second dose of the vaccine,” he said. As of Thursday night, 10,990 active cases are there in the state making them unfit for the vaccine doses. Head preventive social medicine at Rims, Dr Devesh Kumar said that not all freshly infected people are essentially unvaccinated. “But those who are due to take their first or second dose should wait for recovery and get their jabs after a gap of around a week,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-unlikely-to-achieve-100-vax-target-by-jan-15/articleshow/88765813.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The court in a verbal observation said that the state-run hospital and the government will only wake up from their slumber when the people of the state reach the cremation ground. The high court made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation that was filed after the court took suo motu cognisance over the lack of proper equipment in Rims. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan, was informed while hearing the petition that the machine has still not been purchased by the hospital. The bench observed that if the machine will be purchased after Omicron has spread across the state. It further observed that why is it that the court has to prod the government to realize its responsibilities towards its own citizens. A genome sequencing machine is supposed to help medical experts gauge the genetic strain of the pathogen, particularly identify the variant of Sars Cov-2 virus that is afflicting the people at the moment. The machine will also aid in the swift diagnosis of the patients’ ailment. The court has ordered the government and the hospital to file their affidavits to apprise it of the status of their purchase of the machine. The PIL was initiated by the high court 2020 when the country was hit with the first wave of the pandemic. The court had ordered Rims to gear up and procure necessary machines and equipment for treating patients amid the pandemic. The court also expressed its annoyance over the fact that medicine stores in the hospital have not yet been made operational for the common people and patients are forced to buy medicines from outside.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/high-court-pulls-up-rims-govt-over-failure-to-procure-med-equipment/articleshow/88765815.cms||---

Appearing before a division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad, the CBI counsel informed that the agency has quizzed as many as 200 people in the past couple of months to unearth the conspirators responsible for judge Uttam Anand’s death. The CBI sprung up with the new information after the division bench expressed its dissatisfaction with the tardy pace of the investigation. The high court has on several dates earlier expressed its displeasure in the manner of investigation done by the premier investigating agency. The high court has posted the matter for hearing again on January 14, directing the agency to furnish an affidavit on the new developments as informed to the judges. Judge Uttam Anand, an additional district judge-rank judicial officer, was run down by a moving autorickshaw early in the morning of July 28 last year. Anand was on his usual morning walk when the auto hit him and knocked him down. The entire incident was captured live on the CCTV camera installed by the Dhanbad district administration at Randheer Chowk where the incident occurred. The news had rocked the judiciary across the country as no sitting judge was ever removed by planned murder. The high court has been monitoring the case since the beginning and has kept a close tab on the investigation done by the CBI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cbi-seeks-more-time-to-unearth-new-facts-in-dhanbad-judge-death-case/articleshow/88765816.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: With business in free fall, coaching, hostel owners cry foul over govt’s closure move||RANCHI: Coaching institutions and hostel owners have expressed dissatisfaction over the state government’s decision to close all educational institutions saying it would hit their business, which was already on the downslide over the past two years. Joint secretary of Jharkhand Coaching Institutions, SD Mishra, pointed out that the government had allowed offline classes in coaching institutions barely two months back and they were shut down again. He opined that while government has allowed malls, hotels and bars to operate, it has taken a step-motherly attitude towards coaching institutions. Pointing out that vaccination of youths above 15 years has started, he said a mechanism to continue offline studies while ensuring safety of students should be found. “Though several institutions are running online classes, it is not an alternative to offline classes. Several students particularly of the rural areas drop out because of poor connectivity during the online classes,” he said. State secretary of the Coaching Federation of India, Ritesh Singh, said a number of coaching institutions of Ranchi have closed down due to financial constraints affecting the livelihood of around 1.5 lakh teachers and staff engaged in various coaching institutions. He demanded that coaching institutions be allowed to function at 50% capacity. He said a letter in this regard would be handed over to elected representatives in the district. Meanwhile, president of the Jharkhand Hostel Owners Association, Hemant Das, stated that hostel business has also taken a hit during the ongoing Covid pandemic. He said with the government’s decision to close down schools, colleges and coaching institutions, students have left for their native places. “With diminishing income, the hostel owners would face difficulties in meeting the fixed cost, including salary of staff and electricity bills. Several of them have given their premises on rent for other purposes.” Another hostel owner said as soon as the closure was announced by the government, students started leaving the hostels in large numbers and in many cases the parents are arriving to take their children back.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/with-business-in-free-fall-coaching-hostel-owners-cry-foul-over-govts-closure-move/articleshow/88765819.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The daily Rt value trends of Indore showed that it rose from 1.20 on December 20 last year to 2.77 on Thursday. It was 2.71 on January 5, which was more than the national average. Rt value is a way to measure any disease’s ability to spread. It helps in knowing the number of persons will get Covid-19 disease from one infected person. Former statistical officer, NCDC Aditya Athotra said, “The Rt value of 2.77 shows that the district will witness an exponential rise in Covid-19 infection in the next couple of weeks.” “This value is already 100% more than the 1.7 recorded during peak of delta variant in the district last year”, said Athora.  Athora further added, “This value implies that the virus or pandemic is in a rising phase. This value will further stabilise with a rise in Covid-19 infection.” The value witnessed a sharp rise in the period as the daily infections in the district rose from just three cases on December 20 to 584 on Thursday. Rt value is among the three major parameters to know about disease including severity and number of cases. Crisis Management Committee member Dr Nishant Khare, said, “The pace of virus spread suggests that about 60,70% Covid-19 cases are of Omicron variant. The areas like slums, households in villages are going to be very important for isolating people this time.” On expected daily infection Dr Khare said, “In countries like USA, Europe that has very less population than India has reported 10 lakh cases in a day. So, the cases are expected to rise beyond expectations.” “Indore reported a maximum of 1800 daily Covid-19 infections in a day during the peak of Covid-19 last year. This time it could however go up to over 5000 in a day”, added Dr Khare.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/transmissibility-rate-doubles-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/88765825.cms||Antriksh Singh

Road transport had picked up after months of poor business since the beginning of the festival season in October, but rise in fresh cases and drop in advance orders may hit load volume, claimed traders and transporters. Rakesh Tiwari, president, Association of Parcel Transport and Fleet Owners said, “Things are under control as of now because orders are in transit but business may take a hit as order book for advance months has recorded a decline across many sectors and this will hit transport load by atleast 25-30 per cent.” Indore, is a major trade centre of the state with an estimated to and fro movement of over 5,000 vehicles per day, according to the associations for truckers. Transporters said garments, kirana, agriculture, industries and hardware are major contributors to road transport volume from Indore. Garment traders have claimed a sharp decline in business due to decline in orders from traditional southern markets amid rise in Covid-19 cases, prompting several readymade manufacturers to cut down on production. Indore Readymade Textile Dealers Association president Ashish Nigam said, “Orders booked in past months are in transit but fresh orders are negligible for advance months. As we do not have many advance bookings, there is not much to transport for the peak season.” Apart from garments, electronics and agricultural supplies to outstation markets have alsotaken a hit due to poor demand, claimed traders. Vijay Kalra, vice president, All India Motor Transport Congress (West Zone), said, “Supply of goods in transit is smooth and business so far is much better than the previous months but going forward, the situation is uncertain and goods movement may get impacted if industries and trade record a sharp drop in business.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/covid-restrictions-to-dent-transport-load-by-20-in-indore-district/articleshow/88765831.cms||---

The additional funds would help the MCC in funding development work.The 50,000 unauthorised properties are scattered across 61 revenue layouts.Though the city civic body has been ensuring all basic facilities including streetlights, roads, UGD, water and other facilities to these residents, the MCC is not able to collect maintenance, water cess, development fees from these residents as the properties were built on revenue layouts. The MCC has been collecting property and other taxes only from owners having all documents issued by competent authorities of the governments.The BBMP has brought about more than 5 lakh similar properties developed on revenue land under the tax net to mop up its resources by issuing B Khatas and maintaining a separate B Registrar. The MCC has followed in the BBMP’s footsteps.The khata is a property ownership document, based on which taxes are computed. It includes location, size of the property, owner’s name, built-up area and details.With the expansion of the city, illegal construction has to be brought under the jurisdiction of the civic body. Hence, a separate register will be maintained to collect taxes from such properties and these will come under the B Khata properties.B Khata property owners cannot obtain bank loans, said the sources. Issuing B Khatas not only helps the MCC increase its financial resources, but it also helps revenue layouts to ensure all facilities for development, said former mayor and corporator Arif Hussein.Speaking to TOI, MCC Commissioner Laxmikanth Reddy said that a delegation of officials and a few corporators, led by deputy mayor Anwar Baig, visited BBMP to study its B Khata system.As the MCC has decided to bring all revenue property holders under tax net, an approval will be taken at the next council meeting for issuing the B Khatas to such properties after a discussion with all elected members.Once approval come, the MCC will prepare the list of all property holders and will start the process of issuing the B Khatas, Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mcc-to-start-b-khatas-for-illegal-bldgs/articleshow/88765833.cms||---
---||Mysuru||MCC collects record ₹133 cr in property tax||Mysuru: Despite Covid restrictions, MCC has reported a record property tax collection of Rs 133 crore in the last nine months of FY 2021-22, the highest in recent years. In the last three years, the civic body had collected property tax of Rs 114 on an average every year.There are over 1.83 lakh properties in the city. With one quarter still to go, the civic body hopes to add another Rs 50 crore in property taxes, registering an all-time high. Of the 1,83,949 properties in MCC limits, 1,58,593 are general properties and 25,379 are revenue properties categorised as commercial and super commercial. Of the general properties, 13,972 are sites, 1,34,871 are houses and 1,34,871 commercial establishments.As property tax is the single largest source of revenue for the civic body, the MCC had projected to generate Rs 180 crore from all its properties with a 15% hike in property tax after the revision from this year. The hike also covered all residential and commercial buildings, vacant sites, industries, trusts, cinema and marriage halls, commercial complexes, community halls, malls, countries, hotels, schools, charitable trusts and colleges. With the revision, the cash-strapped MCC had expected to increase its revenue, but was not able to implement it this year following stiff resistance from corporators, elected members, trade and commerce bodies. Despite this, the MCC collected the highest property tax this FY. The main reason for record of property tax collection for this year is collection of arrears from property tax payers, said the MCC revenue officials. “As many people were affected due to the pandemic last year, MCC did not force anyone to pay pending dues. However, MCC focused on collecting arrears from theatres, marriage halls, hospitals, schools and government buildings and it helped the civic body,” said MCC commissioner Laxmikanth Reddy. Other than these measures, extension of 5% of rebate for taxpayers for few more months without any penalty, intensification of tax collection drive in all nine zonal offices, mobile tax collection drive, door to door tax collection drive by revenue inspectors, tough action against defaulters, both online and offline payment of tax mode initiated by MCC also helped record tax collection, he said.“MCC could have generated more revenue if it focused on collecting taxes from revenue layouts as more than 50,000 properties were left out of the tax net,” said former mayor Arif Hussein. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mcc-collects-record-133-cr-in-property-tax/articleshow/88765834.cms||---

Speaking to the media on Friday, Halumatha Mahasabha state unit chief and Other Backward Classes 2A Committee president Rudranna Gulaguli said that the committee will oppose the inclusion of the forward Panchamasalis under 2A category, as this move of the government will ring a death knell for the 102 Other Backward Classes included in the 2A category.“Various commissions that investigated and studied the educational and social backwardness of various communities in the state, have not mentioned that the Panchamasalis are backward. The government should withdraw its decision to conduct a fresh survey of Panchamsalis, to fulfil their demand of inclusion under 2A category of backward classes,” he said.“As more than 15 MLAs belonging to the Panchamasali community are elected to the state assembly, of whom four are ministers, the government should not consider them backward, and include them under 2A category of backward classes, as it will be unfair to all other 102 other backward classes. The move will deprive genuine beneficiaries reservation and job opportunities,” he said.He said that a statewide agitation will be launched against the government, if it sticks to its stand of including Panchamasalis under the 2A category of backward classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/inclusion-of-panchamasalis-under-2a-category-opposed/articleshow/88765839.cms||---

We are probing all angles,” he said. “It is essential to check if the video was doctored. Police will take appropriate action as the nature of content is provocative and sensitive,” he added.According to police, it appears that the video surfaced after a brawl in the area during New Year celebration.

The couple is among three persons killed by Maoists in the district, Bastar range IG P Sundarraj said. “Local police are getting information through various sources about the alleged killing of three persons by Maoists in the interiors of Gangaloor region. It appears Maoists have killed two of their own cadres on January 6,” Sundarraj said, identifying the duo as Kamlu Punem, who was a militia platoon commander, and Mangi, a militia member. Police have inputs that Kamlu and Mangi had left the Maoists’ camp so that they could get married, the IG said. Their colleagues traced the couple and brutally killed them after holding a ‘jan adalat’ in Indinaar village. Kamlu had 11 criminal cases and Mangi was wanted in three cases at various police stations in Bijapur. They were active members of the Maoist Gangaloor Area Committee, which is notorious for killing even their own, including a Maoist area commander, say police. “Right now, we don’t have any details about the third person. Bijapur police are trying to gather information,” Sundarraj said. The Maoists have suffered a series of setbacks in the last couple of years and have become highly frustrated and directionless, said the IG. “They are killing their own cadres on mere suspicion and out of intolerance. Such incidents are on the rise particularly in West Bastar Division. Gangaloor area commander Modiyam Vijja was murdered by his own squad in October 2020,” he said, adding: “All these developments indicate that the CPI Maoist formations are in self-destructive mode.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/maoist-lovers-who-broke-ranks-to-marry-murdered-by-comrades/articleshow/88765844.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Political alliance can’t be a ‘one-sided love affair’, says N Chandrababu Naidu||VIJAYAWADA: TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday dropped hints about a possible political alliance with the Jana Sena, but went on to add that a “political alliance cannot be a one-sided love affair”. The former chief minister, who inaugurated a new oxygen plant at the Kuppam government area hospital set up at a cost of 50 lakh by the NTR trust, said the TDP forged alliances with various political outfits only to safeguard the interests of Andhra Pradesh. While asserting that alliance does not determine the victory of any party in elections, he also did not rule out an alliance with the Jana Sena and BJP for the 2024 general elections. “It is very crucial for all political parties to come on a common platform to save Andhra Pradesh from the autocratic and destructive rule of this government,” Naidu said, without elaborating. Sources say the BJP top leadership is not interested in having a tie-up with the TDP after the bitter experience with Naidu ahead of the 2019 elections. However, BJP MPs Y S Chowdary and C M Ramesh, who are close to Naidu, are said to be working hard for a patch up between the two parties. Senior Jana Sena leader Nadendla Manohar, while stating that their alliance with BJP will continue, added that an alliance with the TDP is not an issue now. “The elections are two years away. It is too early to comment on any alliance beyond the Jana Sena-BJP tie-up,” he said. Reacting to Naidu’s “love can’t be one-sided in politics” comment, BJP state president Somu Veerraju said Naidu can love anyone for his own benefit. “He is an expert in loving anyone to forge alliances as political gain is the only motive behind his decisions,” fumed Veerraju. He, however, added the BJP central leadership will take the final decision with regard to alliances.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/political-alliance-cant-be-a-one-sided-love-affair-naidu/articleshow/88765847.cms||---

He said, children from the age of five are being vaccinated in many countries.

He directed that those who have been deprived of vaccination till now get their vaccines to achieve the target of 100%. He said that from the members of the council of ministers to the panchayat level, all the public representatives, officers-employees and voluntary organisations should motivate people for vaccination and make people aware of following the Covid protocol.

In a meeting with bankers, discom and energy department officials, an escrow account mechanism was agreed upon. Additional chief secretary Subodh Agarwal said that since power plant is bought by discoms through a Power Purchase Agreement, the farmers would get a regular payment for 25 years. “The banks showed agreed to the idea of an escrow account where the money against the loan will be deposited. The rest money will be transferred to the account of the farmer.” He said the banks also agreed that with this mechanism, they would not demand for any collateral security from the farmer for the loan. In the past, banks have been reluctant to finance these solar projects without the absence of collaterals. Under the PM-Kusum scheme, Rajasthan Renewable Corporation (RRECL) has already received 623 proposals from farmers having 722 MW capacity but only 11 projects have been commissioned. As per the scheme, farmers can set up projects having 0.5 to 2 MW capacity within the 5km radius of a substation in barren and semi barren land. Rajasthan Electricity Regulator has approved a rate of Rs 3.14 per unit which the discoms will pay to the farmers. Under the scheme, private developers are allowed to enter into contracts with farmers who have such land but not capital to invest. The farmer is entitled to get an annual lease money for the land from the developers. But private developers said that the rate of Rs 3.14 a unit not viable because these are small projects and do not provide the comfort of economy of scale. They said that banks are reluctant because they cannot recover their loans from the farmers through harsh measures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/escrow-a/c-mechanism-to-fund-solar-plants-of-farmers/articleshow/88765856.cms||---

Considering the above-mentioned points, EAC approved procurement of 266MW RTC power from April 1, 2022 on long-term basis through competitive bidding. Commission said that the original bidding documents from which the petitioner is seeking deviation are the Standard Bidding Documents issued by the Union ministry of power for procurement of power.

In the last 17 days, the Yatra has covered 13 districts to learn that people are waiting for the bill to become a law for years. "The places where the Yatra travelled saw that people struggling for receiving benefits under government schemes and policies. The reason is the absence of any law holding the officials accountable for the delivery of the services and timely redressal of complaints. The bill proposed by MKSS has all the required provisions which can ensure timely delivery of services," said Dey.He reminded CM Ashok Gehlot that his party has included RTSAB in the election manifesto in 2018 and repeated the commitment in the budget of 2019. "Thereafter a committee under the then IAS Ram Lubhaya was constituted which had framed the rules in 2019. It is unfortunate that the bill has never been tabled in the assembly," said Dey. Sources said that some of the provisions which allow the prosecution of officials have been objected to by a section of bureaucrats saying that it can be misused. The Yatra, which covered 13 districts before it was postponed due to surge in Covid-19 cases, received 2,300 complaints including 588 for the labour department followed by rural and panchayati raj department. The yatra will resume once the rules allow gathering of people. "Of total 2,300 complaints, we have registered 1,900 on the Rajasthan Sampark Portal hoping they will be resolved soon," Mukesh Goswami of MKSS said.

Verma applied for the documents in 2013 and in 2017 he learnt through RTI that they were issued in 2015. For six consecutive days, he attended Prashasan Shehron Ke Sang camp in his area pleading for his documents but received just assurances. "The land of about 190 square yards is under the possession of my family for the past 40 years. The documents have been issued in 2015 but they have not been handed over to us for no reason till date. I have a copy of RTI which states there is no problem in the land deed document," said Verma. He termed the Prashasan Shehron Ke Sang programme of the consecutive state governments high on rhetoric but low on results. "As a ritual, I and my father have been visiting the camps every year along with several rounds to the JMC zone office at Ambabari but to no avail," said Verma. The Verma family has suffered due to delays. They have taken a loan from the moneylender instead of the bank due to lack of proper documents. "Our land is vulnerable to the land mafia in the city until we possess our land papers," said Verma. Parsa Devi of Beawar who lost her husband two years ago due to silicosis is still struggling to receive benefits under the relevant provisions. After the death of her husband, she had applied for the silicosis certificate with the local administration. "By their own mistake, they issued two certificates, the other being duplicate one which was never applied by me. The, I applied for both the certificates which went against me. The officials told me to withdraw the duplicate certificate for receiving benefits. Since then, I have been running from Ajmer collectorate office to the hospital but got no help," said Devi. She had reported the matter on Rajasthan Sampark Portal hoping that it will be resolved soon. "Unfortunately, after some time the matter was declared closed on the portal stating that the complainant was contacted several times but was not available," said Mukesh Goswami of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/man-struggling-since-six-years-to-get-land-deed/articleshow/88765866.cms||---

Hundreds of drivers, conductors and other workers in the private bus industry in Dakshina Kannada, say that they have already gone through a hard phase of life due to the lockdowns clamped earlier, due to which their earning was hit.Meanwhile, Karavali Textile, Readymade and Footwear Dealers Association too has condemned the decision to impose weekend curfew, as it will have a direct impact on families of thousands of salesmen and other employees, who depend on shops. “We have already suffered losses due to lockdowns imposed the past. While many of us are just recovering from the financial crisis, some have already closed down their shops, due to incurring losses. In such a circumstance, clamping weekend curfew again will be like rubbing salt on our wounds. Our business has reduced by 50% from the very next day when the government decided to impose night curfew. Most of the shops are forced to close down early, as people go home early due to night curfew,” said Santhosh Kamath, president of the association. Rani Abbakka Bus Owners Association zonal president Althaf Usman said private bus drivers and conductors have no social security and job security. “The weekend curfew will force families of bus drivers and conductors to go hungry again. The government had not distributed compensation for loss in earnings due to lockdowns, to private bus drivers and conductors. The government should withdraw the weekend curfew,” he urged. Dakshina Kannada District Bus Owners Association president Jayasheela Adyanthaya said that the Dakshina Kannada district administration has allowed bus owners to ply buses in the district, based on the requirement, during weekend curfew. “When shops and business establishments are closed during weekend curfew, we will have to ply buses with a minimum number of passengers. It will be a severe blow for bus owners, as we provide services on all routes, after paying taxes in advance,” he said. DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla said that weekend curfew will affect daily wage workers, and those working in the unorganised sector. “A large number of workers in the unorganised sector will suffer due to the weekend curfew. Imposing weekend curfew with no scientific logic will affect the working class,” he added. Fish merchants at the Old Port in Mangaluru said the weekend curfew will affect the wholesale and retail markets adversely.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/retailers-pvt-bus-employees-brace-for-difficult-times-ahead/articleshow/88765890.cms||Vinobha K T

According to sources from the department of public instruction, it is estimated to cost Rs 1 crore, for the construction of the office. The 156-year-old Nellikatte Government School in Puttur was razed in the second week of December. Dakshina Kannada (DK) DDPI Sudhakar K said that there was a proposal from the government to renovate the Mangaluru South BEO at a cost of Rs 40 lakh, and to construct a new Puttur BEO office at an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore. “The proposal was sent to the department on December 12, 2021. However, I am not aware where it will come up in the Puttur BEO limits,” he added. Zilla panchayat CEO Kumar added that there is a proposal for a new BEO office in Puttur, but that he has no information on where it will be constructed. Sources added that two days ago, a spot inspection was carried out at the place where the old school was demolished. When TOI contacted Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor, he maintained that the land which is available after demolishing the old school, will be added to the school ground. “A new BEO will come up adjacent to the demolished site. The urban PHC which is in the school compound will be shifted to a different location,” he said.The Nellikatte Government School in Puttur was in a dilapidated state for many years. The demolition of the building had irked villagers and lovers of Kannada writer, social activist, environmentalist, Yakshagana artiste, filmmaker and thinker Kota Shivaram Karanth.

Samiti president Mariamma Thomas told the media here on Friday, that the government has made a notification to acquire land in Sanoor, Beluvai, Padumarnad, Tenka Mijar, Badaga Edapadavu, Badaga Ulipady, Mooduperar, Kandavara, Muloor, Tiruvail and Kudupu villages, for widening the national highway. “As the authorities have fixed a low value for agricultural land, which will be acquired, over 230 landowners have brought a stay against the acquisition process from the high court. However, officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) are yet to file objections for the stay order in the court,” she said. “The officials have failed to fix the market value for the land to be acquired. The alignment for the road work was changed for the benefit of influential persons. Landowners are not against the road widening. We are also going through difficulties due to the traffic congestion on the said road. We want the stretch to be developed, but we need fair compensation for the land that we lose,” she said. She said that officials are still clueless on the extent of land that will be acquired for the purpose. Further, she explained about the lack of clarity regarding the collection of GST in the land acquisition. “Due to lack of understanding, 12% GST is collected from landowners during the distribution of compensation. What is the logic of collecting GST, when landowners lose their land for development?” she asked. Referring to a statement purportedly made by Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, that over 65% of the land has been acquired for the project, samiti member Brijesh Shetty said it was far from the truth, as more than 230 people who lost land have brought a stay against the land acquisition. “Only 15% of the converted land has been acquired so far,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/nh-169-widening-landowners-demand-fair-compensation/articleshow/88765894.cms||---

About 22 government schools have below 10 students admitted, followed by unaided, aided and a school belonging to the tribal welfare department. A total 16 schools have zero admissions for class I.According to data available with TOI, in 2021-22, Sullia BEO limits has the highest number of schools, with eight schools registering below 10 admissions.

At least five schools have no students admitted to class I. Two special unaided schools have just one and three admissions in total. Bantwal has five schools with below 10 admissions. Mangaluru North BEO limits has just two schools with less than 10 admissions. A majority of the government schools with poor admissions are lower primary schools.However, the department of public instruction has stressed that the schools with less than 10 students admitted will not be merged with nearby schools. “We will maintain the status quo. However, the additional teachers from these schools have been deputed to other institutions,” said a senior official.Explaining why such schools have low admissions, an official said parents prefer to admit children to higher primary schools, and there is an inclination towards English medium schools. “Some schools have been receiving poor admissions from several years, and parents do not prefer these schools as they feel that they lack the right environment for their child,” the official said.In 2018, Dakshina Kannada district had 35 schools that recorded below 10 admissions, and the number increased to 42 in 2019, and last year 33 schools recorded poor admissions. “The below 10% admission in a school is also a sign that the school is almost on the verge of closure. The administration will come up with plans to save them, and attempt to increase the number of students admitted in them,” said Sudhakar K, DDPI, Dakshina Kannada.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/33-schools-in-dk-record-less-than-10-admissions/articleshow/88765898.cms||---

On the other hand, in Nashik city, around 17% (97,000) have the first jab. Health department officials said one of the reasons that rural Nashik is having better coverage as the number of vaccination centres (47) is more than in Nashik city (6). However, authorities maintained that the pace of vaccination among children will gain pace in days to come.The vaccination drive is being carried out at primary health centres (PHC) along with sub-district and rural hospitals. Besides, every school has been linked to a particular PHC where medical officers are carrying out school-wise vaccination programme to avoid any slips and confusion.“Since the authorities have been entrusted with the responsibility, the vaccination programme is being carried out expeditiously,” Dr Kailas Bhoye, vaccination in-charge for rural areas of Nashik and coordinating officer for the entire district, said.In case of Nashik city, the corporation has just six centres where vaccination for children has been started. A civic official said they also had introduced vaccination centres at schools and college-level as well and hence vaccination figures are increasing.

On day 1 of this new initiative, the civic body vaccinated over 6,600 children in 30 educational institutes.

The NMC has already written to all the schools and junior colleges asking them to mobilise the beneficiaries so that the vaccination programme can be carried out at these institutes. Moreover, the NMC health department has also appointed a nodal officer for each of the six divisions to coordinate with the schools for the vaccination of the children.NMC’s medical superintendent, Bapusaheb Nagargoje said that they have already opened six vaccination centres to administer vaccines to the children. But our focus is to conduct a drive at schools and colleges to vaccinate them at the earliest.We have also appointed six nodal officers for six divisions to plan vaccination at the school and colleges, he said. V Pawaskar, the NMC’s nodal officer for Nashik east division, said that they are targeting at least five schools and colleges per day for the vaccination drive.Lata Patil, a principal of a city-based English medium school said that it is a great initiative taken by the NMC to vaccinate the students at schools and colleges. “The vaccination drive for the children continued at our school for almost two days, and 650 students have received the first shot.

Many people are involved in ensuring this status and, hence, we appreciate the measures taken by the revenue, rural and forest departments,” said Rajendra Singh, who was on a one-day tour to Nashik and visited the government officials at the collectorate.Stressing on the need to conserve the greenery of Brahmagiri and ensure the perineal flow of the Godavari river, Singh added that the administration has focused on the same through the proposal for the eco-sensitive zone. The forest department has proposed including all the areas around Brahmagiri, except the Trimbakeshwar municipal council area, under the eco-sensitive zone. This also includes the Talegaon area, where land levelling was being carried out on a large scale for some construction activity.Singh further said, “The forest and revenue officials have told me that this area has also been included under the eco-sensitive zone, and there is no adverse construction going on now, which is a good sign."Singh also promised to organize a national convention on ecological conservation in Nashik after the government declares Brahmagiri as the eco-sensitive zone.He said, “It is learnt that there is a proposal of ropeway in the area for promoting tourism. However, this could hamper the flora and fauna exclusive to the region. Since the proposal is in the discussion stage we will ensure that our members, as well as the forest department, write down the ‘observations’ when the proposal is tabled. If the government still decides to go ahead with tourism, we will take steps accordingly,” Rajendra Singh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/brahmagiri-must-be-declared-as-eco-sensitive-zone-rajendra-singh/articleshow/88765906.cms||---

The farmer, who is also a tractor operator, had approached the court of Judicial Magistrate of the First Class (JMFC) alleging that the officers had duped him and other tractor owners of Rs 3.17 crore by withdrawing money in their names to use their tractors for various infrastructure works in Peth taluka but did not pay them.On the order of the court, the Peth police on January 5 booked the officers on the charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust by public servant and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. Assistant police inspector Sandeep Vasave of the Peth police station told TOI that the case has been transferred to the economic offences wing of the rural police. “As per the complainant, agricultural officers who were posted in Peth taluka from 2011 to 2016 were part of a fraud which is into crores of rupees,” said Vasave.As per the complaint registered, the officers invited bids to carry out works of various government development works, got the tender forms filled by tractor owners, took signatures of the tractor owners on blank receipts and cheques. Then they withdrew the money of the tractor owners, which was of Rs 3.17 crore. The complainant said the agriculture officers have also used a huge amount of government funds meant for implementing government schemes.District agriculture officer Vivek Sonawane said, “On our part, the issue has been resolved.

---||Business||Tata Consumer Products to focus on value-add product extensions: CEO||Chennai: Tata Consumer Products is going beyond its commodity driven focus on tea, coffee, salt and spices to look at “value-added premiumisation,” said MD & CEO Sunil D’Souza. The company is looking to add immunity infused products across its range like Sampann Haldi Doodh, Copper Plus Water or herbal ingredient infused Tata Tea Gold Care. Alongside, it also plans to grow its ready to heat/ready to eat segment and will add capacity and increase footprint. With around Rs 2,600- Rs 2,700 crore cash on its books, the company is also looking to expand several of these portfolios with products and capacity. “We are moving beyond the staples to premiumisation and value-add,” said D’Souza. “While our base business of tea and salt still has some runway for growth — with unbranded marketshare of 40%-50% — we are also focussing on health and immunity to adapt to changes in consumer behaviour due to the pandemic.” To that end the company has launched Tata Soulfull for millet-based cereal and snacks and acquired Tata SmartFoodz for the ready to eat category. “We are not shifting entirely from tea, coffee, salt and spices but we are adding an immunity value-add wherever possible,” he said. For example, the positioning of Tata Salt Lite and Tata Salt Super Lite with 15% and 30% less sodium than regular iodized salt is targeted at consumers with hypertension. For the company, this focus on value-add or “innovation” segment has started to bear fruit. “Innovation segment contributed 1.7% to our sales in March 2020,” he added. “Last year that percentile went up to 2.5% and our run rate this year is 3.5%.” Part of this increase will come from health and immunity value adds, he said. As for capex spends, the company is conducting a volume capacity study but has already taken a call to pitch funds in certain segments. “We acquired Tata SmartFoodz (for Rs 395 crore) and we will expand that portfolio,” said D’ Souza. “We are adding capacity at the Mithapur salt factory and are increasing Soulfull (it’s other acquisition in 2021) outlets from 15,000 to 80,000-90,000.” The company’s routine capex is in the range of Rs 200-300 crore per annum.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-consumer-products-to-focus-on-value-add-product-extensions-ceo/articleshow/88764071.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The plant has remained closed since December 18. In his address in the state assembly on Friday, Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said that Foxconn is set to resume its production activities on that date with around 500 workers present in two hostels. The government has held talks with the management of Foxconn and they have promised to take care of employees by providing all facilities to them, he added, without going into further detail . “Our government will always be supportive to industries aiding the growth of the state’s economy and will also protect the legal rights of the workers,” Stalin added. The CM was responding to queries raised earlier in the assembly by Congress leader K Selvaperunthagai on how the issues of Foxconn workers are being handled by the state government. TOI’s queries to Foxconn about resuming production and improving living facilities for the employees at the facility remain unanswered till the time of going to the press. Stalin said the company, in partnership with SIPCOT, will also work to build hostels at a cost of Rs 570 crore at Vallam Vadakkal to accommodate about 18,750 employees. Earlier, Foxconn admitted in a statement that some of its offsite dormitory facilities in the Sriperumbudur facility do not meet required standards and said it is investigating the recent issues of improper working conditions. The closure of Foxconn’s facility in Sriperumbudur, which makes iPhone 12 smartphones, has forced Apple to put the factory on probation and led to a halt in the production of Apple smartphones in Chennai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cm-mk-stalin-foxconn-set-to-resume-ops-next-week/articleshow/88764020.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||TCS to take up its 4th share buyback proposal on Jan 12||Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s second-largest listed company, said on Friday that it plans to repurchase its stock. Its board, led by chairman N Chandrasekaran, will meet on January 12 to consider the share buyback proposal. If approved, it will be the fourth such capital action move by India’s largest software services company in five years since getting listed in 2004. It had paid Rs 48,000 crore through three share buybacks. The company had said earlier that it plans to return at least 80% of its free reserves to shareholders. The stock repurchase move will make Tata Sons the biggest beneficiary of the gains as it is the IT major’s largest shareholder. Tata Sons holds 72% in the IT giant. TCS ended 1.3% up at Rs 3,855 apiece by close of Friday’s trade on the BSE . The development comes at a time when Tata Sons is completing purchase formalities of Air India. The long-stop date to complete the Air India deal with the government is January 23. Tata Sons had offered Rs 18,000 crore for Air India — it will take over the Rs 15,300-crore debt of the national carrier and pay Rs 2,700 crore in cash to the government. Going by TCS’s past share buyback spends (see graphic), if it repurchases Rs 16,000 crore of its stock this time too, Tata Sons would fetch Rs 11,000 crore from participating in the programme. The money will give Chandrasekaran, also Tata Sons chairman, additional resources to strengthen the balance sheet and to make growth investments. He also said last month that Tata Sons’s growth strategy will be to play on fourth themes — digital, new energy, supply chain and health. He had called the winning bid for Air India the “most important” milestone for the Tata Group. TCS is sitting on a cash pile of about Rs 52,000 crore. Apart from the stock buyback proposal, the software major’s board will consider a dividend payout to its shareholders on January 12. The company paid a dividend of Rs 10,150 crore to Tata Sons in fiscal 2021. Income from TCS, which includes dividends and gains made from participating in share buybacks, has helped the Tata Sons chairman cover liabilities from failed ventures, including mobile telecom, and pay for M&As. Tata Group watchers said that the conglomerate’s strategy to consider a share buyback was better than a share-sale in TCS as it will improve earnings per share and other ratios like return on capital employed. “A stock repurchase lifts the scarcity value of shares and the price gets impacted positively,” said an analyst. Share repurchases also present a tax-efficient way to plough money back into the parent company. TCS has benefited significantly from the Covid pandemic as its customers accelerated IT spending. It will announce its third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings also on January 12. Brokerage firm ICICI Direct expects TCS to post a profit of Rs 9,941 crore — up 14% year-on-year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-to-take-up-its-4th-share-buyback-proposal-on-jan-12/articleshow/88764262.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Interestingly, in end of August last year corona warriors in the hospital had broken into a festive mood after the hospital did not have a single Covid-19 patient. After 17 long months, the battle-fatigued warriors including senior doctors, resident doctors, interns as well as nursing staff jigged away merrily to garba tunes rejoicing the fact that the government hospital was finally Covid free after the first and second wave of Covid-19. However, the break ended 10 days ago when the hospital started seeing arrival of fresh patients infected with Covid -19. “Ten days ago, we had zero cases. Now, we have three. The patients are on room air,” said Dr Ranjan Aiyer, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital, adding that all the patients are fortunately showing mild symptoms. Two of them required oxygen support but they too are on room air now, he added. From March 2019 when it handled the first Covid-19 case of NRI businessman from Spain till August last year, the public hospital had lost three nurses and one physiotherapy doctor, but handled over 800 patients during the peak. Like in the past, hospital staff too are testing positive of Covid-19 again. At least six doctors including three resident doctors — two from orthopaedic department and one from microbiology — apart from medico legal officer of SSG had already tested positive on Friday. “But we are fully geared-up. We already have Samras hostel ready with us apart from 40 ICUs on the first floor. If need arises, we can evacuate other medical wards too,” Aiyer said. Like the SSG, GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri – another major Covid-19 designated public hospital in Vadodara too – had zero cases a week ago. “Parallel to the SSG, we did not have Covid-19 patient for almost three months,” said Dr Chirag Rathod, nodal officer for COVID-19 at the hospital. “Now, we have three patients. Fortunately, all of them are stable with minimal oxygen requirement,” he said. While government hospitals are seeing admissions in single digits, admissions in private hospitals have started touching double digits. “Many private hospitals are seeing more patients out of panic based on blood reports and CT-scans. Fortunately, we are not witnessing any rapid worsening/ deterioration in their health,” said Dr Hiten Kareliya, infectious disease specialist. Meanwhile, the number of patients admitted in Vadodara city and district reached 116 on Friday of which 46 were being treated with oxygen support, 56 without oxygen support, three under ventilator while 11 were in ICU but without ventilator requirement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/break-ends-covid-beds-in-ssg-start-getting-occupied/articleshow/88764223.cms||Prashant Rupera

Booster vaccination doses, a five-day work week and limited attendance in Covid-hit districts are some of the suggestions made by them. In a letter to the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) in Maharashtra, the United Forum of Bank Unions has said that bankers — being in close contact with the public — are not only more prone in general to the infection but, given the non-symptomatic nature of the Omicron variant, they might be unaware of being infectious. The forum has asked banks to consider a 50% workforce in branches and restricted business hours until 2 pm to reduce customer interaction. They have also requested booster doses of the vaccine. The All India Bank Officers’ Confederation has also written to the SLBC, pointing out that the highest number of Omicron cases have been detected in Maharashtra followed by Delhi and Karnataka. The officers have echoed the staff call for curtailed working hours, five-day week and booster doses. In the first phase of the pandemic, when the entire country was under lockdown, banks continued to operate with fewer staff and reduced business hours. Private banks have decided to adopt work from home, wherever possible, for staff in administrative offices. For branches, all banks are awaiting directions from the SLBC, which is expected to coordinate with the administration at district and state levels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-unions-seek-booster-shorter-hours/articleshow/88764198.cms||---

Karnataka officials are strictly enforcing the order issued by their government making negative RT-PCR certificates valid for 72 hours mandatory. Double vaccinated certificate is not a criteria for entry into Karnataka. Locals told TOI that it is frustrating to see the Karnataka registered vehicles being allowed into the state without a check, while the Goa-registered vehicles are stopped for verification. Since Thursday, all vehicles from Goa, including Kadamba buses, were stopped from entering Karnataka without a negative RT-PCR report. “A minimum of eight hours is required to get the RT-PCR report and this can be done only in Margao,” said a driver of a rented car. Several people, particularly the locals close to the border, are the most affected ones as they need to visit their near and dear ones who are admitted in hospitals at Karwar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/karnataka-officials-ask-for-negative-rt-pcr-report-at-border/articleshow/88765046.cms||TNN
---||Lucknow||Owaisi: BJP, past govts in UP didn’t work for Muslims||Lucknow: Hyderabad MP and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday held the successive governments of BSP, SP and BJP in UP responsible for the “poor state” of Muslims here. He produced empirical data to establish that all the hype around ‘appeasement of Muslims’ by various governments in the state was a baseless claim. “The fact is that none of the governments did anything for Muslims and such claims of appeasement are being made merely to serve political interests,” Owaisi said. Citing findings of a comprehensive study on the condition of UP Muslims on social and development indicators, Owaisi said the community lags in jobs, land holdings and other important social parameters. The study was conducted by a group of leading scholars, academicians and experts from well-known institutes in India and abroad. “According to Census 2011, Muslims comprise 19.3% of the total population of UP though at the national level, the corresponding figures stand at 14%. Still, 71% Muslims above 15 years in UP were illiterate or educated below primary level as compared to the national average of 58%. Only 17% of Muslims have education above middle level in UP as compared to 26% of the total population,” he said, speaking at a conference in Lucknow on Friday. Amir Ullah Khan, a former advisor to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and research director at Centre for Development Policy and Practice, presented the findings of the study. It states that a larger proportion of Muslims in UP is engaged in less regular and low-income occupations as compared to India. According to NSS 2009-10, the monthly per capita consumer expenditure among Muslim households was lower in UP as compared to India as a whole. Poverty ratio is higher for Muslims than for all social groups, the study said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/owaisi-bjp-past-govts-in-up-didnt-work-for-muslims/articleshow/88765020.cms||---

The hospital has also decided to shut its specialty clinic in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases and demand for hospitalisation for patients affected by the viral illness. An order issued by the premier medical institute, which sees a footfall of nearly 8,000 patients daily, says OPD services will continue to function with restricted registrations limited to only prior appointments (new and follow-up). Officials said suspension of routine services was required to minimise the possibility of disease spread among patients and also to optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources for the treatment of suspected/confirmed patients of Covid-19. Sources said more than 100 healthcare workers of the institute were affected by Covid-19. Most of them are under isolation at home, while a few others are hospitalised. On Thursday, union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya visited AIIMS to meet some of the staff members hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19. Recently, the institute ordered faculty members to cut short their winter vacations in view of the increase in Covid-19 cases. Also, AIIMS has started shifting trauma patients to the main building and reconverting its Trauma Centre into a Covid facility despite opposition from many senior faculty members and the hospital’s Resident Doctors’ Association. In March last year, JPNAT was converted into a full-fledged Covid-19 centre and normal trauma services were recently restored there. Recently, in a meeting chaired by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, it was again decided to utilise the ICU and ward at the centre to manage Covid-19 cases in anticipation of the expected rise in cases. “The trauma centre emergency is to be shifted to the main building area at the earliest. The T2ICU (one of the ICUs at the trauma centre) is to be converted into Covid ICU immediately, in addition to the first, sixth and seventh floors. Subsequently, other wards of the trauma centre are to be converted to Covid-19 care facility by the next week,” the minutes of the meeting chaired by Dr Guleria on December 31 stated. It also talks about utilising wards in the burns and plastic centre, NCI Jhajjar and other areas for Covid care if need arises. It is likely that Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia hospitals may also curtail routine services to divert the available manpower for managing the Covid-19 crisis caused by the massive third wave, which has affected thousands already.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aiims-suspends-routine-surgeries-and-admissions/articleshow/88764536.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The accused included Ashishkumar Dudhnath Gupta (41), a director of Sangam Enviro Pvt. Ltd. in Vadodara, who was one of the main architects in the entire early morning catastrophe. According to the police, Ashish collected the industrial chemical — sodium hydro-sulphite — on January 5 from ‘Hikal’ a chemical company in Taloja of Maharashtra to dispose of the toxic waste illegally in Surat. “Ashish was paid Rs 14 per litre to dispose of the chemical waste and the tanker was carrying around 25,000 litres,” said the police. The teams of detection of crime branch (DCB), and city police also nabbed Premsagar Omprakash Gupta (33) a resident of Shiv nagar society in Sachin Pardiin outskirts of city, Jaypratap Ramkishaor Tomar (24) a resident of Aalishan City in Ankleshwar and Vishal alias Chotu Anilkumar Yadav (21) a resident of Navsarjan society in Ankleshwar. Primary investigation revealed that Ashish contacted Yadav and Tomar to dispose of the waste chemical and also provided them with the chemical. Yadav and Tomar in turn involved Premsagar who escorted the tanker to the spot of incident in Sachin GIDC. “The racket was well organized and there are possibilities of involvement of other accused too. During initial interrogation of the accused police also came to know that Ashish collected the chemical from a chemical company Hikal in Taloja in Maharashtra. At the time of collection of the chemical waste, Ashish told the company that they would sell it to cement manufacturing companies,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. In the tragic incident, 6 died instantly from inhaling the poisonous gas generated during dumping of the chemical waste from the tanker near the dyeing mill, while 23 more workers took ill and are fighting for their lives in the hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/four-accused-in-gas-leak-case-held/articleshow/88764459.cms||---

His 22-year-old brother Suresh on Thursday evening saved the child by pulling his head from inside a tiger's mouth where the big cat had pounced on the boy in a cane field near the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Lakhimpur Kheri district. Both brothers use their first names only. The sub-adult tiger was hiding as Rajkumar played nearby. His elder brother and a few others were busy working in the field when the animal suddenly attacked. For a moment, Suresh was paralysed with horror to see a part of his brother's head inside the tiger's jaws. But he soon steadied his nerves and gathered courage to fight back with a sickle. Rajkumar sustained injuries to his skull and was rushed to a government hospital nearby. He was later referred to King George's Medical University (KGMC), Lucknow, where he is currently being treated. His life is still in danger. The two brothers are residents of Madhwapur village in Bahraich district. Their father, Balram, is a labourer. Suresh, whose clothes were stained with his brother’s blood, said, “The tiger had my brother's head in its mouth and it was dragging him. I didn’t even have a moment to react but I somehow gathered the courage to go after the animal to save my brother.” The emergency medical officer who treated Rajkumar at the district hospital in Bahraich told TOI, “His condition was extremely critical. He had multiple deep injuries in his skull and neck. He was referred to Lucknow after blood transfusion and initial treatment.” Field director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, Sanjay Pathak, said, “The pug marks were distorted because of rain but our officials have confirmed the presence of a tiger in that area. We have deployed two teams that are combing the area and ensuring that similar incidents are not repeated. Our officials are trying to ensure that the boy gets proper treatment. The family will be eligible for compensation according to guidelines.” Watch Uttar Pradesh: Man saves 10-year-old brother from tiger's jaws||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/man-rescues-brother-10-from-tigers-jaws/articleshow/88763290.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

While the Bhusawal – Devlali passenger will start from its origin at 5.15 pm to reach Nashik at 10.10 pm. On the next day it would start at 5.05 am from Nashik Road to reach Bhusawal at 10.05 am. The new service will ensure two rakes start from both ends. The 11120 express starts from Bhusawal at 7 am to reach Nashik Road at 1.17 pm and reach Igatpuri at 3.10 pm. Similarly, the 11119 starts from Igatpuri at 9.55 am, will reach Nashik at 10.51 am and Bhusawal at 5.10 pm. This is going to be a big relief for the people from the rural areas of Nashik and also for those in the rural areas of Jalgaon district to travel to Bhusawal or Nashik. “With the strike of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, there are few or no buses for us to travel. At times people who come to Nashik have to extend their stay here for transportation. The starting of the train will help us reach our destinations,” said Rajesh Bhangale,a resident of Nashik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/local-trains-to-resume-on-bhusawal-igatpuri-route/articleshow/88765911.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The credit for such smooth allotment process goes to district magistrate (Magh Mela) Shesh Mani Pandey and his entire team that has worked tirelessly to allot lands among around 3000 organisations despite the fact that mela administration faced the soil erosion problem several times.Interestingly, the district magistrate (Magh Mela) soon after taking charge, had done all the homework and coordinated with prominent seers, saints associated with Akharas, Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Swami Parishad, Dandi Bara, Acharya Bada and Khak Chowk before the land allotment exercise which has finally yielded positive results.Mela authorities, however, appreciated the positive approach of seers and saints for their cooperation.“Land allotment has always been a hectic exercise during the annual religious fair as thousands of religious, social and spiritual organisations ask for land for setting up their camps. This year, the officials went through proper records, bridging the communication gap and coordination with prominent seers and saints before the land allotment exercise,” said a senior official associated with mela for past two decades. “Since many years, many organisations who were not satisfied with land allotment, had not only held series of dharnas and demonstrations on mela campus but sometimes even boycotted the mela citing irregularities in land allotment. However, this year, no such activity has been witnessed till now,” the official added.Mela campus saw many ups and downs during land allotment disputes between 2000 and 2018 and the organisations participating in mela continued to raise their demands for land to set up their tents.It was 1996-97 when there was no agitation/dharna or protest over land allotment issues and the mela was conducted peacefully under the regime of the mela officer. However, after 1996, the tussle over land allotment had started taking place and year 2003 witnessed the worst phase. DM (Magh Mela) Shesh Mani Pandey said, “The land allotment exercise was carried out successfully and now organisations are setting up their tents.” The land allotment work was started on December 22. He, however, said we held several rounds of meetings with prominent saints and seers at different levels to make the exercise easy. Now, we are focusing to provide better basic amenities like potable water, toilets, power, roads, bathing ghats etc to the camps and shivirs arriving at the Magh Mela.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/mela-campus-sees-no-tussle-protest-over-land-allotment/articleshow/88765914.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Despite rain, seers continue preparations at Magh Mela site||Prayagraj: With scattered rains continuing to play the spoilsport, saints, seers, devotees and officials are facing acute hardship to complete Magh Mela projects. Over the past 48 hours, the city has received over 29 mm rainfall, but it failed to dampen the spirits of the seers, saints and visitors who continued to flock on mela campus. The light and scattered rains started on Thursday morning continued till Friday evening. The rains have worst affected the commuting, after majority of chequered plates have turned slippery and muddy. The weather also brought miseries for seers and saints who have kept their firewood stock in open. The situation in and around their tents and connecting roads was pathetic due to slippery and muddy condition, and basic commute was a struggle. With barely a week left for the beginning of Magh mela, and both seers and mela officials are busy in completing the preparations. “ Rains have undoubtedly left us puzzled at a time when seers and saints are busy in erecting their tents and are to start their activities before the beginning of the Magh mela,” said national president of Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Sanyasi Parishad Peethadhishwar Swami Brahmashram Maharaj, adding, “camps have also turned muddy and slippery due to rains” he added. He claimed that the conditions are, to say the least, inhospitable for those who were making efforts to erect their tents on mela campus. “We arrived here from Harayana to erect our tent at sector four, but rains have disturbed our plans. We are, however, making our best efforts to come over the problem,” said Swami Prem Das. Seers and saints, however, claimed that sandy area of Sangam has soaked up rainwater, but soil area has turned into slippery and muddy. However, despite adverse conditions, seers, saints and visitors continued to flock to the camp and willstay whatever the weather condition may be. They believe that things will be better once the rains were over. “We have appealed the mela administration to maintain the routes so that visitors should not face any hardship to reach their destinations,” they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/despite-rain-seers-continue-preparations-at-magh-mela-site/articleshow/88765915.cms||---

The weekend curfew began on Friday from 10pm and will be in force till Monday 5am.With some ministers expressing reservation about imposing weekend curfew in all the districts without considering the actual positivity rate in the respective district, the focus of the administration is more on people exercising self-restraint than strict enforcement.This is evident from the fact that several activities are allowed during the weekend curfew with a rider that Covid appropriate behaviour should be followed.Barring essential services, all other kinds of business activities will remain closed during Saturday and Sunday. To contain the unnecessary movement of people all the shops have been allowed to provide home delivery service. Even hotels are allowed to remain open but can only offer parcel service.No restrictions have been imposed on the people travelling by bus, train or flight. People can produce their ticket at the checkposts and travel. Taxi services are also allowed during the curfew.

On Thursday, there were 48 new cases taking the total active cases to 171. Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil chaired a meeting of private and government doctors on Thursday asking them to reserve beds for the infected. He said the infection is spreading at a faster rate and the health department and medical staff should be prepared to handle the situation. Apart from reserving beds, separate teams of government doctors have been formed for the treatment of the patients who require hospitalisation. The administration has already procured several ICU and HDU (high dependency unit) beds available in the district and 30% of them should be reserved for Covid-19 patients. After January 10, 50% of ICU and HDU will be reserved for the infected, he said. Special teams from the health department have been formed to monitor the situation and they will guide private hospitals, he said. During the first and second wave, private hospitals in the district have co-operated and have facilitated the patients get good treatment. The administration expects the same commitment from doctors now, he added. Patil said the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at the state level has observed that positive cases was doubling every 10 days in the second wave but it has jumped to two days in the third wave. As the infection is found in some children and schools becoming Covid-19 clusters, parents must ensure children wear face masks compulsorily and use sanitiser.

Among the 70 BJP functionaries were the newly-elected members of the Gadag-Betageri City Municipal Council (CMC). Although BJP could get a simple majority in the CMC elections, winning 18 of the 35 seats in the urban local body, the party functionaries in the district are reportedly afraid of the councillors being poached by the Congress, which was a close runner-up in the election, winning 15 seats.People of Gadag are understandably upset with the trip ofthe newly elected councillors, which they said constituted a mockery of democracy.A senior BJP functionary in Gadag admitted to TOI that the Congress was trying to poach their members, since it had fallen short of a simple majority by only three seats. “We learnt the Congress was trying to lure our councillors with the promise of plum posts, and to prevent this, our workers and councillors left for Assam,” the functionary said.Among those who have left for Assam include CMC members Chandru Tadasad, Vinayak Manvi, Shweta Dandin, Gulappa Mushigeri, Anil Abbigeri, Prakash Angadi, Madhusa Bakale, and other prominent functionaries such as MS Karigouda, Prashant Naikar, Mahesh Dasar and Vijayalakshmi. They reportedly took a bus to Bengaluru, where they boarded a flight to Guwahati on Friday afternoon. In fact, some of the BJP members who left for Guwahati shared photographs of their expedition on social media.The Election Commission is expected to issue a notification on the polls to the posts of president and vice-president of the Gadag-Betageri CMC either on Saturday or Monday.General secretary of social organisation Jaya Karnataka, Chandrakant Chavan sought to remind the political class that the Gadag-Betageri CMC election had been deferred for three years. “In the absence of local administrators, work on many development projects has stalled. People had been hoping for the newly-elected council members to remedy this situation. But they have left for Assam while citizens grapple with poor roads, clogged rains and piling garbage,” Chavan said.President of Gadag Jilla Vikas Vedike Vishwanath Khanapur said, “Many members of the BJP who have left for Assam are our friends, but this is not the time for a tour. Their top priority must have been to address the problems afflicting the people. The government has imposed a lot of curbs, including weekend curfew, and their tour at this juncture is a violation of Covid protocol.”BJP Gadag district unit president Mohan Malashetti, while defending his party colleagues, said, “It is not a jolly trip. They have gone to Assam to visit the Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. This trip was planned well in advance, and much before the new curbs were announced.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/activists-cry-foul-as-gadag-bjp-councillors-embark-on-assam-tour/articleshow/88765932.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The rates and number of beds have to be prominently displayed by private centres. Officials have been given the responsibility to monitor availability of oxygen and management of mini Covid care centres. If need arises, the department would fix quota for medical oxygen of each private hospital on the lines of quota fixed during the second wave. “During the second wave, in some urgent matters, the files kept on moving downward/upward. Though all officers concerned were sitting in the same complex, the file for emergency procurement moved with less than normal speed and sometimes it took two-three days to reach the adjoining chamber,” Garg said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/covid-cases-may-swell-more-than-2nd-wave-health-dept/articleshow/88765943.cms||Shimona Kanwar

There is no such institute in the region providing specialised services and training for highly infectious and communicable diseases. The centre shall be set up on 1.6 acre land adjacent to GMCH, Sector 32. This area was previously identified for a sports injuries centre. UT adviser Dharam Pal recently reviewed the matter and it was observed that as respiratory infections like viral infections, tuberculosis, bacterial and fungal pneumonia are highly prevalent, such a centre is necessary. “Newly emerged infections like H1N1, Covid are going to stay and may become endemic. Mutations in these viral strains may lead to future surge of these infections. There is a possibility for emergence of new viral respiratory infections for which we need to be prepared,” said the adviser.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-nod-to-centre-for-infectious-diseases/articleshow/88765949.cms||---

The HC has also issued a notice to the private school, Doon Public School, Panchkula and officials of the state education department, seeking their reply on the issue by April 6. Justice Sudhir Mittal of the HC passed these orders while hearing her plea alleging that her online classes were arbitrarily and illegally discontinued by the school from November 10, 2021, thereby infringing upon her legal and fundamental right to education and obstructing her studies. The petition was filed by the minor girl through her father. The counsel for the petitioner, advocate Amar Vivek argued that the petitioner’s classes were discontinued as her parents had allegedly not paid a component of “other charges,” even though full tuition fee etc had been paid on monthly basis. The HC was informed the petitioner had made complaints to the state authorities and administration but they failed to take any action.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/online-classes-hc-comes-to-students-aid/articleshow/88765950.cms||---

This is the highest single day surge since the last six months. A total of 134 Covid patients are admitted in city hospitals. Four of them are on ventilators while the rest are on oxygen support. In Panchkula, 32 patients are hospitalised. “The surge will continue as the peak is yet to come. Active cases in the country are increasing at a rapid rate of 24%. We will cross a million active cases in about a week from now,” said Dr Rijo M John, a Kerala-based health economist and former consultant with the World Health Organisation (WHO). Chandigarh reported 390 cases, 319 cases were reported from Mohali and 313 from Panchkula. On Friday, positivity rate in Mohali was 11.63%, 11.7% in Panchkula and 10.77% in Chandigarh. However, no Covid deaths were reported in the Tricity. Public health experts feel that following Covid appropriate behaviour is the only protection as infections are recurring even after vaccination. They advised people to wear triple-layered disposable masks instead of cloth masks to prevent transmission of the virus. “Cloth masks hardly work now. A tightly worn N95 or triple layered mask should be worn in a public area,” said a public health expert. There are 1,323 active cases in Chandigarh, 775 in Panchkula and 1,274 in Mohali. Recovery rates have also reduced. The recovery in Chandigarh is 96.4%, 96.66% in Mohali and 96.36% in Panchkula. There are 67,214 confirmed Covid cases, including 1,080 deaths in Chandigarh. On Friday, 46 patients were discharged. There are 42,031 confirmed cases in Panchkula, including 382 deaths. Till date, 30,676 patients have been discharged.

---||Rajkot||Kodinar woman kickboxes her way to WC||Rajkot: Cricket, kho kho, kabaddi and judo; like any other kid, Manisha Wala played all these sports while growing up. While graduating from Baroda’s MS University she also participated in university cricket. It was much later that she found her true calling — kickboxing. Since then the 28-year-old from Kodinar town in Gir Somnath district hasn’t looked back. Wala is now preparing for the Irish Open — the official World Cup of World Association of Kickboxing Organizations (WAKO). Wala will be participating in the 60kg weight category of the event scheduled to be held at Dublin, Ireland, from March 5-7. Talking to TOI Wala thanked her family for supporting her. “My father loves sports and he always encouraged me to pursue my dream. My parents did not differentiate between a boy and a girl. It is because of the support of my parents that I have reached this level,” Wala said. Her father Jagdish Wala is a lab technician in a cement company and her mother Prachi is a housewife.With kickboxing a relatively unknown sport in Saurashtra, Wala faced quite a few difficulties during her initial days. “Finding a good coach in Saurashtra wasn’t easy, so I shifted my base to Vadodara,” Wala said. In Vadodara she found the right coach in Siddharth Bhalegar. Her performance at the senior national kickboxing championship in Goa last August helped her make the cut for the World Cup. Apart from excelling in sports Wala also did well in academics. She did her graduation in industrial psychology from MS University. Later, she completed her masters in mental health from Mumbai’s Tata Institute Mumbai. “The young generation is now more open to different sport disciplines. Success stories of players from Gujarat are inspiring them,” Wala added.In the past the Gir Somnath district has produced many notable athletes like judokas Ankita Naghera, Alpa Wader, Archna Naghera and Rohit Majgul. Kinjal Wala, Chetna Wala made name in the field volleyball while Ruchit Mori, Muskan Chotiyar and Dhruvi Parmar went on to win medals in national athletic events.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/kodinar-woman-kickboxes-her-way-to-wc/articleshow/88765960.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

BJP leaders said that kind of glaring and shocking lapse that occurred during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Punjab visit is highly shocking and deplorable. They said that country has never faced such an situation, neither during the worst of terrorism days nor in terror-affected areas. BJP state general secretary Trilok Kapoor said that day will be remembered in India’s history as a black day when the “bloody designs” of the Congress party failed in the holy land of Punjab. He said that leaders of the Congress party, who hate Narendra Modi, were instrumental in making a mockery of the Prime Minister’s security and tried to fail Prime Minister’s safety and security. He said that never ever in the history of India any state police force was instructed to derail the security arrangements of the Prime Minister and no state government had ever conspired to cause hurt to the Prime Minister of the country. He said that BJP has been repeatedly saying that the Congress party and its leaders hate Narendra Modi , but they have no right to hate and demean the Prime Minister who belongs to the entire country. He said that there is a set protocol for the security of the Prime Minister, but a a mockery has been made in the Congress- ruled Punjab with the security protocols of the Prime Minister. He added that what is more shocking and highly condemnable is the fact that senior Congress party leaders have expressed their happiness over the glaring lapse in the security of Prime Minister Modi.“What are the Congress party leaders celebrating? That their incompetent and highly irresponsible government took the Prime Minister of the country towards death?” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/breach-highly-shocking-deplorable/articleshow/88765964.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bogus Contracts Scam: Contractor paid corporator Rs15L, NMC official Rs10L to bury scam||Nagpur: Main accused in Bogus Contracts Scam — contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode — allegedly told one of the top officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) that he gave Rs15 lakh to a corporator and Rs10 lakh to a NMC official, for not exposing the irregularities. This came to fore from audio recordings submitted by the NMC official, who retired a week ago, to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is investigating the case. BJP city president and MLC Pravin Datke had in the general body meeting on December 31 informed about the audio recordings available with the official. He also said some public representatives were also named in the audio. A couple of days ago, Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe alleged links between BJP leaders and Sakode. Refuting the allegations, Datke said Gudadhe should investigate and come up with proof to lodge complaint with EOW. A NMC official told TOI, “After learning about the scam, the official had asked Sakode and two NMC staffers to come and discuss the case. He recorded the conversation and also informed other NMC officials. EOW has seized the mobile handset of the official, and is likely to investigate all audio recordings.” NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi denied being aware of any such audio recording. “We investigated the case initially and took action against contractors and staffers. But no one informed us about any such allegations of Sakode or audio recording,” he said. The nexus between Sakode and staffers of five NMC departments — general administration, health (medical), health (solid waste management), projects, and accounts and finance — has already come to fore. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had started departmental enquiry (DE) against six staffers, of which four were suspended. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar had lodged complaint against five firms related to Sakode and his family members with Sadar police station. After preliminary inquiry, civic body had blacklisted eight firms related to Sakode and his family members. This is the first time involvement of a corporator has come to fore. Former NCP corporator Vedprakash Arya alleged this system of contractors giving money to corporators and NMC office bearers is going on for last 15 years. “Some of the corporators raise issue, after which contractors and NMC staffer meet them and bury the case. It is nice that it has come out now. A contractor will not dare to prepare bogus contracts, forge signatures of officials and loot NMC without strong backing. EOW should investigate based on audio recordings and book all involved. I think this case is bigger than Sports Materials Procurement Scam, where 109 corporators were booked following report of Nandlal Committee,” he said. Congress city president Vikas Thakre had raised the issue in state legislature’s winter session and submitted memorandum to Urban development minister Eknath Shinde demanding inquiry into the case by the government citing siphoning of funds for pandemic under the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). ------------------------------------------------ TIMELINE OF Bogus Contracts Scam * Dec 13: NMC lodges complaint with Sadar police station against five firms related to Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode and his family.

Madurai district president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, S P Elangovan, said that now they had to register online and take the certificate to the village administrative officer who had to verify and certify it before they go to the centres. This process would take about three days, provided the server functions, the VAO is present in his office on the date, and the person at the procurement centre is also on time. ``But that is rare as even if we register, getting the VAO’s certification and then finding the employees at the procurement centre in their seats is a difficult task,’’ he said.Farmers say they incur huge expenses in the procurement process. They handover paddy in bags of 40 kg each, known as `sippam’. As the gunny bag itself weighs about 200 grams, they have to give the centre 40.20 kg per sippam, but the employees at the centres weigh it for 41.20 kg citing wastage. They also remove a bucketful of paddy or a sippam for every 100 sippams supplied to the centres. ja, a farmer, says that at last week’s grievance meet, they had told district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar about the Rs 60 per bag being demanded from them. The collector said it would not be collected, ``but, they demand it when we go there,’’ he said.Madurai district alone has about 27 direct paddy procurement centres run by Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation and about 23 under the cooperative societies. The process in the cooperative societies is even more difficult, because society staff have to take the paddy for quality certification from the joint director of cooperative societies, before it is procured. Similarly, in cooperative societies the money is handed over to them, who in turn give it to the farmers. It takes about a month for the money to reach the farmers. S Chidambaran of Alanganallur says it would be better if all the procurement centres are brought under TNCSC. The farmers are responsible for the paddy even if it is brought to the procurement centre, till it is procured. When the process gets delayed, the paddy starts sprouting. They have to pay Rs 1,500 for transport of the paddy bags to the procurement centre and about Rs 600 to loadsman to load and download the bags.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/online-regn-for-procurement-of-paddy-not-helpful-say-farmers/articleshow/88765967.cms||---

The paintings are in black and white colour.Assistant professor of history at the Cardamom planters’ association, Bodinayakanur, in Theni district, C Manickaraj, and A Karuppiah, from the Nellur Government Higher Secondary School in Battalagundu, went to inspect the cave in Vandiyur village near Andipatti. They were accompanied by rock art expert Bala Bharathi.The cave is called, ‘Pakkupudavu’ by the locals. Bharathi said that the figure of the deer had been drawn with a thick line using a finger or stick and could be distinguished well. One of the drawings is of a man pointing his arrow at two deer, said Manickraj.In another depiction, human is dancing, maybe to rejoice a successful hunt. Many of the paintings in the background have been destroyed due to weathering. Another animal figure seems to depict a tiger because the nails of the animal have been drawn in detail. With both the ears erect, it looks like the animal is ready to attack, they said.In another art, there is a circle with a human figure within it which usually depicts a person being carried in a palanquin, according to Bala Bharathi. The head of the figure is bird-like but it may be due to distortion while being drawn, he added.This cave has many paintings including three circles with different markings inside them. The markings may refer to some sort of rituals, worship or communication. Similar symbols have been seen in the Indus valley civilization. There is also a drawing of a human in a bent position, like he is picking up something, they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/ancient-rock-art-found-in-cave-near-andipatti-in-theni-district/articleshow/88765968.cms||---

He also added that if people were given cash gifts they would have benefited more.In a statement on Friday, Panneerselvam said that the AIADMK government had distributed Pongal gifts including cash to the tune of ₹2,363 crore including ₹1,000 cash to each ration cardholder in 2020. The next year it was enhanced to ₹5,604 crore, with cash gifts of ₹2,500. The DMK had then demanded that ₹5,000 should be given, but now it had left the people empty-handed by not giving them cash.“There are many complaints that the quality of goods being distributed through the ration shops as Pongal gifts are of substandard quality. People complain that the jaggery is very soft and five to six items in the gift hamper are missing. The government has said that people who have goods missing or do not get them by Pongal can avail them till the end of January, but that will not serve the purpose,” he said.If the DMK government had given them cash, those who had borrowed money to celebrate the festival would have returned the loaned money. The grocery items would also be of no use to many if they don’t received them before the festival, the former CM said.So, chief minister M K Stalin should put in his efforts and give special focus to ensure that the people get the gifts before Pongal, Panneerselvam added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/distribute-pongal-gift-hampers-before-fest-panneerselvam/articleshow/88765969.cms||---

The Congress, PMK and left parties too claimed credit for the decision and recalled their campaigns in this regard.Stalin said the order was a result of the DMK’s legal and political battles over the years despite efforts by the Union government and oppressive forces to continue fighting against it. He said DMK fought for it in Parliament, before the people’s court and before the high court and Supreme Court where it impleaded in the case.“It is worrying that the Union government failed to realise the justice in our demand. They argued against the reservation before Madras high court and refused to implement the HC’s direction even after it was confirmed by the Supreme Court,” he said, adding that DMK then moved a contempt of court plea against the Union government’s inaction. Stalin said that medical colleges have been opened across states, making it possible for students of those states to pursue MBBS and specialised postgraduate courses there. The state will continue its battle to put an end to All India Quota to enable 100% filling up of seats by the respective states.Welcoming the verdict, TNCC president K S Alagiri recalled the role of the Congress in implementing 27% reservation for OBC category in central government institutions in 2006 during the UPA-I government. Former Union health minister and PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss in a statement claimed that the verdict was a victory of his party and other organisations and recalled his role in initiating the case. CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan said the party takes pride in being a part of the battle that brought victory before the SC and appreciated the DMK and others which played their role before the apex court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/victory-for-dmks-struggle-for-social-justice-stalin/articleshow/88765973.cms||---

He also sought withdrawal of the circular threatening punitive action against students for airing their grievances in public in this regard.The MP said that Hindi medium candidates had the option to write answers to questions in Sections B, C and D in physical answer sheet, whereas non-Hindi medium students had to type out the answers, making it more time consuming for English medium students. He had taken it up with the ICAI authorities before the examination was held, but to no avail. Though ICAI president Raju Iyer replied that both Hindi and non-Hindi medium students have options of both writing and typing answers, physical answer sheets were not provided to non-Hindi medium students at the examinations,” Venkatesan said.“In the meantime, ICAI has warned students that they would be debarred for five years if they take the issue of discrimination to public domain through social media. It is condemnable and undemocratic,” he added in his letter to Sitharaman. He pressed for making the writing option for non-Hindi medium candidates as well and initiating action against officials who went against what the ICAI president clarified.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mp-seeks-action-against-icai-over-bias-in-exam/articleshow/88765974.cms||---

The new twist was given on Thursday, when state RJD chief Jagadanand Singh, speaking “on behalf of” party leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, made an “open offer” of his party’s support to the Nitish government with a rider that he should snap his ties with the BJP and walk out of the NDA on the twin issues of caste census and special category status to Bihar. In the absence of the JD(U)’s categorical ‘no’ to Jagadanand’s offer, the mercury has been rising. RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said on Friday that Nitish should take the decision on it, as he and the RJD have been committed to the twin issues for long. To add to the suspense and make the BJP jittery, JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha has thanked the RJD for making the offer. “The BJP has not said ‘no’ to the caste census. It had supported it. Nitish has gone on record saying that the all-party meeting will be held on it, but he has been waiting for the reply from the BJP,” Kushwaha said soon after Jagadanand made the offer. Curiously, on both the issues, the BJP has been non-committal, and in fact, the party will require its central unit’s nod on the matter before extending support to Nitish. The RJD’s offer, meanwhile, elicited a sharp response from state BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal on Friday. He, without taking the name of the RJD or any of its leaders, called them “samajwadi parveevi (socialist parasites) group” and also a “jonk (leach)” that survives by “sucking human blood”. BJP minister Neeraj Kumar Babloo and party functionaries like Nikhil Anand and Rajiv Ranjan said RJD was daydreaming as far as returning to power in the state was concerned. “Jagadanand is trying to create an opportunity for the RJD to grab power, but it will remain just a daydream,” Dr Jaiswal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/political-atmosphere-hots-up-in-state-as-rjdoffers-support-to-cm/articleshow/88765978.cms||Abhay Singh

The memorandum, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, mentions that the negligence of the PM’s security was of serious nature which jeopardised his life and appears to be a part of conspiracy. The dismissal of the Punjab government will be a reminder that such negligence about the PM’s security should not be repeated in the future, it said, adding that democratic practice should be restored in Punjab, which is situated along the Indo-Pakistan border. Even as the route of the PM was changed, it was for the first time that it had been leaked, as a result of which suspicious elements created obstacles.

The sites include Sadaquat Ashram and Bans Ghat in Patna as well as Dr Prasad’s dilapidated native house at Ziradei village in Siwan.A division bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar, during the virtual hearing of a PIL filed by advocate Vikas Kumar, expressed its dismay after going through the said inspection report which was submitted earlier this week. The report spoke in clear terms about the negligence on part of the authorities, which are entrusted for the upkeep and conservation of those memorials. The reports have mentioned about broken and unhinged doors, windowpanes, damped walls and broken roofs of hutment portion of the native house of Dr Prasad at Ziradei village. Similar negligence and ill-maintenance have been reported about the memorials at Sadaquat Ashram and Bans Ghat at Patna, where the dearth of public toilet and cleanliness on the premises were prominent lacunae. The court asked the ASI, which has been entrusted for preservation and maintenance of these memorial sites, as well as the state government to ensure filing of their respective responses to the reports submitted by the committee, which should also contain their remedial action plans which can be accomplished expeditiously.

Get tested for Covid||Patna: With the state witnessing cold wave like conditions for the past few days, more people are catching cold and also being infected with flu. However, they apprehend if they have been infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19. As there is great similarity in symptoms of both Omicron and cold, it is really very difficult for the people to differentiate between the two. According to the health experts, typical Covid-19 symptoms include a continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste and smell. However, Omicron has not shown any loss of taste or smell as any of its symptoms. Omicron symptoms are predominantly cold symptoms, runny nose, headache, sore throat and sneezing, they say. Nalanda Medical College Hospital’s (NMCH) deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar observed that Omicron-infected people have milder symptoms as compared to those of general Covid-19 patients. “In the delta variant of Covid-19, patients faced problems in their respiratory systems and mostly their lungs were affected, but Omicron infections remain confined to the throat or upper respiratory tract,” Kumar said and advised that if a person gets a runny nose and fever along with headache or body ache, he must get tested for Covid-19. He pointed out that in the prevailing cold conditions cough and cold are quite common, but one must not ignore it. “Omicron cases are spreading very fast and at least 200 doctors and medicos of NMCH alone have tested Covid positive in the last two to three days,” he said. A separate flu corner is being set up at NMCH from Wednesday to isolate cold and flu patients from Covid patients. “Barricading of the hospital is also being planned to save medicos and hospital staff along with other attendants from getting infected,” the deputy superintendent added. Gynecologist Dr Punam Raman pointed out that Omicron symptoms are almost similar to the common cold. “If anyone is having cold-like conditions such as sniffles, headaches, and tiredness, he/she is likely to be positive for Covid. You must go in for the RT-PCR test,” she said. Pediatrician Dr Vivekanand said that if any member of a family gets infected with Covid-19, all its other members, especially the children, must isolate themselves immediately and get tested for Covid-19. “While the common cold can show fever and headache, the intensity of the same increases if a person is suffering from Omicron,” the doctor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/experiencing-cough-cold-andheadache-get-tested-for-cov/articleshow/88765983.cms||---

---||Nagpur||JeM operative conducted recce to attack RSS Headquarters||Nagpur: Security has been tightened at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters at Mahal, and Hedgewar Smruti Bhavan at Reshimbagh in the city after a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) operative, arrested in Kashmir, revealed a bid to attack these locations. The plan was foiled after intelligence agencies and security forces nabbed the terrorist near Awantipora in Pulwama district of Kashmir, and also recovered a live grenade from his possession. During interrogation, he has revealed the RSS HQ attack plan, sources said. The arrested operative, in the mid-20s, is learnt to be a Std X pass out and had conducted a recce to prepare a blueprint of the attack. It is also learnt he had been recruited for the special mission to target RSS headquarters and Smruti Bhavan. Reaching the city by a flight, the sleeper cell operative had checked into a hotel at Sitabuldi on the first day, and later shifted to another place the next day, say sources. Sources also said that the JeM operative was initially promised a local ‘guide’ and ‘host’, but was “denied” support in the city at the last moment. According sources in the security establishments, the JeM operative was sharing details of the targets with his Pakistani handler while in Nagpur. The Pakistani handler wanted the operative to ‘go closer’ and collect more images of the ‘deep interiors’ of RSS and Smruti Bhavan. The operative could not move closer as tight security cordons around these places had forced him to abort the plan. Sources said the operative had clicked photographs of Smruti Bhavan from the Reshimbagh ground, which left his handler disappointed. CP Amitesh Kumar, who was also in the city as DCP when an attack bid on the RSS HQ was foiled in 2006, said a crime branch team under DCP Chinmay Pandit was sent to Kashmir to interrogate the operative after the city police was alerted by security forces about his mission in Nagpur. “We have registered an offence at Kotwali police station under relevant sections of the Unlawful (Activities) Prevention Act (UAPA), before the investigation was handed over to the crime branch,” he said. The FIR also includes names of several other operatives, JeM leadership, and Pakistani handlers. The police also plan to bring the JeM operative to the city as part of the investigation.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Case against ex-MP handed over to STF||LUCKNOW: After all efforts by the Lucknow police commissionerate to arrest gangster and former MP Dhananjay Singh in the murder of historysheeter Ajit Singh in Lucknow failed in the last one year, the case was handed over to the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP STF), on Friday. A senior police officer at the DGP headquarters said the STF was given the case after Lucknow police could not arrest Dhananjay Singh. The Lucknow police had been looking for Dhananjay ever since his name surfaced in the sensational murder of historysheeter Ajit Singh in Lucknow on January 6 last year. On March 4, the police announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 on Dhananjay’s arrest. The issue hogged fresh limelight when Dhananjay made a public appearance and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted a video on January 5 in which Dhananjay is seen playing a cricket match. Akhilesh captioned the video, ‘In BJP regime, criminals roaming free’. Soon after the tweet, Uttar Pradesh DGP Mukul Goel told mediapersons that the case was being investigated. Dhananjay had made a public appearance in Jaunpur on November 14 where he presented awards to players participating in a cricket match. Earlier, on April 3 last year, teams from Lucknow had gone to Jaunpur to arrest Dhananjay thinking that he would accompany his wife, Srikala Singh, who had to file nominations for the post of district panchayat president. Srikala won the election. Ajit Singh, who had over 40 cases against him, was shot dead near Kathauta crossing in Lucknow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/case-against-ex-mp-handed-over-to-stf/articleshow/88765043.cms||---

The CS said 92 private hospitals were given permission for Covid treatment earlier. “Several private hospitals have submitted applications seeking permission to start Covid treatment. We will scrutinize these applications soon,” Dr Vibha said, adding the total number of Covid patients admitted in private hospitals was 57 on Thursday night. The Paras HMRI Hospital had 19 patients in its 47-bed Covid ward on Thursday. Dr Talat Halim, director, academics and quality, Paras Hospital, said there was nothing to panic as the rush of patients was low this time in comparison to the second wave of the pandemic.

When she could not encash them, she filed cheque bounce cases against us in different states to harass us,” he added.Thereafter, Inderjitpal lodged a complaint with Ludhiana police in November 2020. “When Ludhiana police started inquiring the matter, she got a case of dowry harassment registered against us in Janakpuri, Delhi, on March 23, 2021,” the complainant alleged.ASI Harmesh Singh said the FIR has been filed under sections 380 (theft), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery for valuable security, will etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board (UPPRPB) officials said all the ranks, either in civil police or PAC, have been given timely promotions. A senior official at UPPRPB said applications were invited from PAC head constables to fill 1,588 vacant posts of platoon commanders. Meanwhile, promotion of as many as 1,140 PAC constables to the post of head constables was also approved by UPPRPB on Friday. Those who have qualified for promotion will now be screened. “We will now screen all the selected candidates and those found accused of misconduct or having criminal cases pending against them will be rejected. The promotion of those head constables, against whom any inquiry is pending or some formalities are to be completed, may also be stopped,” the officer said. All the promotees will now be referred to the establishment department of the UP police for final appointment. For the first time in the last one year, the Uttar Pradesh police also created the new record of making 2 lakh recruitments in a year.

The BJP leaders protested for two hours and also handed over a memorandum to deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma. The leaders claimed that the state government failed to protect the PM. BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said, “PM had come to give big projects to the state. The insecurity of Congress has resulted in loss to the state.” The BJP leaders said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and other officials responsible for the incident should resign. They added that the law and order situation in Punjab was not up to the mark and this incident has proved that the Congress government has failed in maintaining it. Meanwhile, cops had a tough time in controlling the situation when one person from among the crowd started shouting against the PM. Some of the activists pounced on him. Timely intervention of police saved him. The BJP leaders also tried to block traffic at the road. The leaders accused cops of not taking action against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/bjp-protests-against-cong-over-pm-visit-security-lapse/articleshow/88766004.cms||---

At present, employees deputed at the entrance of zonal offices are not stopping anybody from going inside, but an advisory has been issued. On Friday, people had gathered in large numbers outside Zone D office to deposit forms for availing a scheme under which the government is giving ownership rights of land to residents living at a particular place from many years. As of now, not many people are visiting the Suvidha Centres for the payment of dues. An employee said, “We are asking people to avoid visiting the offices unless it’s an urgent work. We have kept a drop box outside, but people remain adamant to hand over their letters.” In case there is no urgency, residents can send complaints at these email IDs: additional commissioner (R) additionalcomm.mcl@gmail.com; additional commissioner (A) adcmcl3@gmail.com; joint commissioner (S) jointcommissioner.s@gmail.com; zonal commissioner (zone A) acdmcl1@gmail.com; zonal commissioner (zone B) zonalcomm.zb@gmail.com; zonal commissioner (zone C) zonalcomm.zcmcl@gmail.com; zonal commissioner (zone D) zonalcomm.d@gmail.com.

Stopping the convoy of the country's PM for 15-20 minutes puts a question mark on the working of the security agencies of the state and we should be grateful to God that no untoward incident took place. The incident has proved to be very costly for us because the announcements of Rs 50,000 crore for our state, including a financial package and medical facilities, that were to be made by the PM have now been held up.” Tikka said, “It is unfortunate that the PM was not even able to pay tributes to the martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. This incident seems to be the handiwork of people whose sole objective was to defame Punjab and create hurdles in its progress. A thorough investigation is a must and the onus is on the Punjab government to identify the perpetrators who helped the protesters block the road and they should be booked under sedition laws.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/tikka-demands-inquiry-by-hc-judge/articleshow/88766007.cms||Mohit Behl

In the meeting held at zone A office, near Mata Rani Chowk, on Friday evening, the commissioner asked the property tax branch officials to recover Rs 12 crore in one month, of which Rs 4 crore each will come from zones B and D and Rs 2 crore each from zones A and C.The operation and maintenance cell officials were also told to expedite the recovery of dues. He warned of departmental action against SDO and JEs who fail to achieve the target. This time, it has become a tough task for the MC to meet the recovery targets as the staff is deputed on election duty, too.

---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra to exclude molnupiravir for ‘non-comorbids’ from new guidelines||PUNE: The state health department has decided to issue a fresh set of norms after drawing flak for including the new oral anti-viral pill, molnupiravir, for mildly infected “non-comorbid” Covid patients in the state’s newly revised treatment guidelines released on Thursday. Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, Maharashtra health services, said, “The inclusion of molnupiravir for mildly infected non-comorbid patients in the state’s newly revised treatment guidelines was based on earlier pieces of evidence of the drug’s trial. We shall remove the drug for non-comorbids in the subsequent revision immediately. We shall also sensitise doctors through our workshops so that the drug does not get irrationally used.” Dr Archana Patil, director, health services, could not be contacted for her comment, despite repeated attempts. Globally, including India, molnupiravir is only approved for mild Covid-19 patients with a high risk of progression to severe disease, mainly those with pre-existing (comorbid) conditions. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has excluded it from Covid treatment citing serious safety concerns/side-effects and for the likelihood of the drug being irrationally and rampantly used like steroids. Critical care expert Dr Kapil Zirpe, a member of the Covid task force in Pune, said, "Nowhere in the world is the new and inexpensive drug (molnupiravir) allowed to be used for patients without comorbidities. The state's inclusion of the drug in the revised treatment guidelines is unscientific and shows lack of foresight. Its inclusion for mildly infected patients without underlying medical conditions may lead to its abuse because many general practitioners and physicians follow these guidelines, and mild Covid cases are on the rise." The use of molnupiravir is nuanced. "As yet, there is no evidence of use among mild illness without comorbidity. Even among the unvaccinated with a higher risk of progression, the benefit is only modest - a 30% reduction in hospitalisation," said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force. Besides, molnupiravir can't be used in pregnant women and children. The state's treatment guidelines (released on January 6, 2022) also clearly stated that it should be avoided in pregnancy. Pregnancy should be ruled out before advising the drug and women should practice contraception up to four days after completing the dose. For men who receive molnupiravir, contraception is recommended for three months because of concerns of mutagenicity (capacity to induce mutations) and genotoxicity (cause damage to genetic material within the cell). "The other concerns include unclear efficacy against Delta and Omicron variants and the potential to drive mutations in the virus," Pujari, the task force member, said. Experts said the molnupiravir's use should be decided carefully after weighing the risk-benefit ratios. Even in India, the approval is only for mild illness with risk factors for progression. They have also exhorted the government to regulate the over-the-counter use of the drug. The drug, developed by US-based biotechnology company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in collaboration with US pharma giant Merck, is being made by 13 Indian drug manufacturers. It is commercially available and can be sought against a doctor's prescription. "Since mild Covid cases are on the rise, self-medication with molnupiravir is big concern. People often access drugs included in the treatment guidelines on their own and self-medicate," said Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-to-exclude-molnupiravir-for-non-comorbids-from-new-guidelines/articleshow/88766010.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Scientists uphold genome study for tracking variants||Pune: Scientists involved in genome sequencing have upheld continuous use of the procedure to track other variants, besides Omicron, across the country.“Though the Omicron variant is currently dominating the scene, we need to track co-circulation of other variants like C.36.3.1, which also has Omicron-like characteristics,” a senior scientist from the Union government’s Department of Biotechnology told TOI. The DBT is monitoring the genome sequencing work at 38 labs and research centres in India.The C.36.3.1 variant, earlier reported from some European nations, was identified for the first time in India two weeks ago. The mutations carried by the C.36.3.1 make it a variant that should be followed. It has a total of 36 defining mutations, of which nine are in the Spike (S) gene region as against 32 mutations identified in the S-gene of the Omicron variant, which has a total of 52 mutations.A virologist involved in the genome sequencing work said, “The Omicron strain may itself undergo genetic changes that would be vital to monitoring as the third wave progresses or declines after some time. Hence, states should not lower their guards and keep sending positive samples for genome sequencing to designated research centres.”State health minister Rajesh Tope had recently hinted that genome sequencing had no longer remained a priority in view of the rapid surge in daily caseload in major cities, which is most likely fuelled by the Omicron variant.State health ministry officials have, however, clarified that the MoU between the state and Delhi-based CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) for accelerated genome sequencing is going to remain effective till February 2022.State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “As a research activity, genome sequencing will continue.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/scientists-uphold-genome-study-for-tracking-variants/articleshow/88766011.cms||Umesh Isalkar

A report from the public health services issued on January 5 stated that the Pune district had the highest number of beneficiaries due for the second shot of Covishield across the state. Thane (7 lakh beneficiaries) and Mumbai (6.88 lakh beneficiaries) are after it on the Covishield’s second dose due list of beneficiaries. As many as 17 lakh people are due for the second dose of Covaxin in the state. Buldhana has the highest number of pending beneficiaries for it with 1.49 lakh due for the second jab, followed by Amaravati (97,748 people) and Washim (93,168 people). Pune has around 74,494 people due for the Covaxin second dose. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune circle, said those due for their second dose should get it at the earliest, especially when the Covid cases are rising. “All the vaccination sites across the urban and rural areas have ample stock of vaccines,” he said. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “At least 2 lakh people in the civic limits have not taken the second dose, while at least 1.5 lakh beneficiaries are yet to take their first jab. I would like to appeal to all such beneficiaries to take their jabs within the next 10 days at their nearest vaccination site. The unvaccinated elderly citizens and those having comorbidities can face severe health consequences in the upcoming wave.” On Friday, the district recorded the second-highest vaccination of the month with immunisation of 96,227 beneficiaries across 696 government and private vaccination sites till 7pm. The Pune district has now administered a total of 1.55 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V doses. Of them, 89.78 lakh are first shots and 65.82 lakh are second doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-dist-tops-covishield-2nd-dose-due-list-in-state/articleshow/88766012.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Figures for most of the days in the first week of January indicated a drop of 25-30% in daily passenger traffic from the last week of December, despite the number of flights remaining more or less the same. The airport became operational round-the-clock from December 1. “Drop in the number of passengers is because of surge in cases. We were hoping by this year’s first quarter, the daily passenger traffic would touch the pre-pandemic levels. With the new variant and rising cases, we are not sure now,” an airport official said. At present, there are 135 to 140 daily total flight movements. It was around 18-20% short of total flight movements in 2019, the official said. An airline’s representative at the airport said, “The number of passengers has dropped and we are back to essential travelling. Several states have come up with new regulations, which are also a hindrance for flyers.” Some airlines, in a bid to attract flyers, have come up with some offers such as low fares on certain sectors, free rescheduling, among others. Travel companies said bookings had slowed down. “Most people are either rescheduling or cancelling their trips. Only a few are travelling,” president of Pune Travel Agents Association of Pune, said. “The main issue is the changing travel regulations. Cases are also doubling. So, we have decided to travel to Goa in the summer,” Sumit Deo, a working professional, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/daily-passenger-traffic-at-airport-drops-by-around-30-from-dec-end/articleshow/88766013.cms||Joy Sengupta

As per data, the positivity rate in Pune municipal limits stood at 14.47% as on January 6, followed by rural parts (11.52%) of the district and the Pimpri Chinchwad area (10.32%). “The high positivity rate is not surprising if we look at the crowding events during the week between Christmas and New Year Day in the Camp areas, particularly market thoroughfares like MG Road, East Street and Ambedkar Road,” an official from the Pune cantonment hospital said. Amit Kumar, the PCB’s chief executive officer, said, “We are testing mostly symptomatic individuals. The sudden rise in positive cases could be mainly due to the overall spread of the infection in the district.” Covid positive cases have also come from the military area of the PCB. Pramod Kumar Singh, CEO of the KCB, said, “We have activated 10 beds ICU facility at our general hospital. We are in the process of reopening the dedicated Covid health centre of 100 beds in the KCB area for treatment.” R Haritwal, CEO of the DCB, could not be contacted despite repeated calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/positivity-of-3-cantt-areas-far-higher-than-rest-of-dist/articleshow/88766014.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Quartet ends TN’s medal drought in rowing||Pune: When the quartet of Tamil Selvi, Rose Mastica Meril, Lavanya Nambiyar and Bagavathi R finished third behind Kerala and Orissa in the women’s fours at the National Championships here on Thursday, it broke a lean patch for rowing in Tamil Nadu. Their previous medal, also a bronze, had come way back in 2013 through Tarunika Pratap in single scull at the National Sculling championships in Manchenahalli, near Bangalore.“The girls have done a remarkable job to get the medal inspite of the fact that we don’t have a decent infrastructure back home,” said Balaji Maradappa, the president of the Tamil Nadu Amateur Rowing Association and also a vice-president of the Rowing Federation of India.“Some of these girls come from a very poor background. Three of them are aged between 16 and 18. This is a huge milestone for them,” he added. Maradappa gave credit to coach Bhaskar Reddy, a former national sculling champion with 18 medals overall — seven gold, six silver and seven bronze.“He is very humble. He has brought out the best from the girls with the limited resources we have,” he said. While elaborating on the lack of a proper infrastructure, Maradappa said the state association was indebted to Shri Ramachandra Water Sports Centre (SWSC) in Chennai and its chief Dr. Arumugam for filling in the gap.“It is a 510 metre course provided by the SWSC. The rowers have hostel accommodation, access to physio, rehab, psychology and all the facilities,” he said.“But we need a longer course. What happens is, the athletes row for 485 metres and then stop and turn back to row again. “So, the heart-rate drops midway. To compete in a 2 kilometre race, we need to train on a three or four kilometre course. That is when you can build lung capacity,” he said, pointing out that rowers from Madhya Pradesh and Manipur tended to do well because they had access to longer courses. Maradappa was hopeful that with the Tamil Nadu state government keen to promote sport in a major way, rowing would get its due.“There is a readymade facility in Sholinganallur (outskirts of Chennai) which is 3 kilometres long and 100 metres wide. The association would be more than happy if the government and corporates could support in developing it,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/quartet-ends-tns-medal-drought-in-rowing/articleshow/88766015.cms||---

A vlog by resident Kamakshi Mishra has shown the residents on the road outside the society, empty buckets in hand, shouting slogans against what they deem as bullying by the builder, demanding that their water supply be reinstated. Resident Sanjay Gaikwad said, “The water supply provided by the builder often fluctuates. Sometimes, we get just 10% of the required amount, while other times it is about 60%. However, since January 2 this year, the supply has completely stopped, causing huge inconvenience to all the people living here.” Life Republic, a Kolte-Patil Developers project in Hinjewadi, is a township with 16 sectors, over 900 apartments and over 4,000 residents. Households from the R-7 sector are protesting.Rajiv Mathur, a management committee member here, said, “We have filed a court case against the builder on January 3 and got the order for them to provide us with the necessary water supply on January 6. On Friday (January 7), we submitted the copy of the court order to the builder’s office, after which we were assured that the water supply would be resumed.” When TOI contacted Kolte-Patil Developers, they were unavailable for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hinjewadi-society-residents-protest-against-water-closure/articleshow/88766016.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The Pune Rural police have arrested the 47-year-old man. “The murder took place on Thursday evening when accused Shekhar Borhade used a blunt object to hit his 80-year-old father, Shankar, hard on his head and attempted to behead him,” a police officer said. Shekhar later approached the Khed police on his own and narrated the incident. A police team then reached his house and found Shankar dead, the police officer said. Police said Shekhar’s mother had died 10 years ago and his father was staying with him, his wife and three children. However, he would often feel lonely and spend his time reading the newspaper or watching videos on his cellphone. “Shekhar told police that he had learnt from his wife on Thursday that for the past three months his father had been checking advertisements of different marriage bureaus in the newspapers and had enrolled his name,” an officer from the Khed police said. Around 3.30pm on Thursday, Shekhar went home for lunch and his father was alone. After eating, Shekhar asked his father if he had enrolled with a matrimony agency. “Shekhar told us that initially, his father denied it, but when he checked his father’s cellphone, he found that he had registered and also paid the charges,” the officer said. A furious Shekhar first attempted to slit his father’s throat with a kitchen knife, and then bludgeoned him to death with a stone and later attempted to behead him, the officer added. He then arrived at the police station to inform them and was arrested under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/man-bludgeons-to-death-his-father-for-wanting-to-remarry/articleshow/88766017.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The Madhya Maharashtra region stretches from Nashik in the north to Kolhapur down south with Pune at the centre. The official said, “Parts of Madhya Maharashtra will get scattered rain on Saturday (January 8), while Vidarbha, Marathwada and Madhya Maharashtra will get rain, with possibility of hailstorm in Vidarbha on January 9. Marathwada and Vidarbha will get similar rain on January 10.” Pune city is expected to get light rainfall in the next couple of days, he said. “The western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation lies over south Afghanistan and neighbourhood in lower and middle tropospheric levels with a trough aloft in upper tropospheric levels. The induced cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining south Pakistan at lower tropospheric levels,” the official said. “There is high moisture feeding on the Arabian Sea over northwest and adjoining central India in lower- and middle-tropospheric levels and it is very likely to continue in the next two to three days. There is also a confluence of winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal over central India. Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha, and Marathwada regions are likely to get light rainfall till January 9 because of this,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/scattered-rain-likely-in-parts-of-state-from-jan-8-to-10-imd/articleshow/88766018.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Pune woman held on charge of killing her 2 toddlers||PUNE: The Pune Rural police on Friday arrested a 24-year-old woman on the charge of killing her daughter (3) and son (2) on Wednesday before leaving her home at a construction workers’ colony at Shiravali village in Mulshi taluka. “Puna Solanki, the arrested woman, throttled her daughter Chanda, and son Anand, to death with a rope and abandoned their bodies in the bushes near her house,” an officer from the Paud police said, citing investigation. “The bodies of the children were found on Thursday afternoon. Their mother was taken into custody from her brother’s house in Lonavla. Her husband, Sanjay Solanki, has lodged a complaint,” the officer said. “We are questioning the woman on what prompted her to commit the crime,” police inspector (PI) Ashok Dhumal of the Paud police said. “In his initial statement to the police, her husband said the woman was prone to frequent anger bouts and intemperate behaviour towards their children. We also are examining these aspects in the ongoing questioning,” the officer told TOI. He said Solanki and his family shifted to Pune from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh in November last year. “After working in Alandi for two months, they started working at the construction site in Shiravali since January 3. The family was provided an accommodation at the workers’ colony near the site,” he said. Dhumal said the complainant used to go out for work, while his wife would stay back for their children. “On Thursday, when the complainant reached home for lunch around 1pm, he found that his wife and children were not there. He waited and then started inquiring about them in the colony. He and other workers searched them in and around the colony,” said the PI. According to Dhumal, when he couldn’t find them, he also tried to contact his brother-in-law in Lonavala. “But the latter responded to his call only late in the night,” he said. The officer said on Thursday, too, when the complainant could not find his wife and children, he again contacted his brother-in-law in the afternoon to know if she was there with the two kids. Her brother told the complainant that she came alone at his house and there were no kids. “Solanki told his brother-in-law to ask Puna about the whereabouts of their kids. The woman then told her brother that she had killed and disposed off the bodies of the two kids in the woods behind their house at Shiravali,” the officer added. Dhumal also said that the complainant had once again started searching for his children. “At that time, the complainant’s nephew told him that on Wednesday he had seen his aunt with Chanda and Anand. He also showed the direction and said Chanda was crying, as Puna was dragging her,” Dhumal said. The complainant went there and found his son and daughter lying in the bushes. “They were strangled with a rope,.” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/woman-held-on-charge-of-killing-her-2-toddlers/articleshow/88766019.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Omicron can hobble housing market for short span, say experts||PUNE: Real estate observers have said while Pune witnessed bumper home sales in calendar year 2021 on low interest rates and other sops, the fast-spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19 could wobble the market for a short period, although the momentum in the market may be maintained through 2022. They said a possible hike in key rates by the RBI to check inflation can also hit the market by driving up interest rates for home financing. “Mumbai and Pune drove home sales in 2021, and together formed 42% of the total sales across the main markets in India. We found that affordability in Pune was also among the highest in India, with an average of 28% of the monthly salary going towards the home loan EMI. The market was also helped by sops from the state government like the stamp duty rebate,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist of real estate consultants Knight Frank. “Input cost pressure and supply chain issues may induce a 5-8% rise in property prices. End-users will remain the dominant market force, and peripheral areas of big cities will continue to see both supply and demand traction,” said Anarock chairman Anuj Puri. Realtors’ body Credai Pune Metro said with the implementation of the Unified Development Control (UDC) rules, there should be more supply in the housing market due to the additional floor space index (FSI) and transferable development rights (TDR) now being made available to developers. Realtor Gera Developments , stated that home sales in 2021 nearly touched 2019 levels in the city. “Even if the interest rates rise slightly over 2022, the affordability levels will not be affected much. Of course, people will be cautious due to the Omicron variant, but sales are still expected to be good. Personally, I think that there is no need for the government to step in and intervene,” said Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/omicron-can-hobble-housing-market-for-short-span-experts/articleshow/88766020.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

After receiving a request from citizen Swapnil Gholap and a few others online, a few new patrolling spots were allotted at Rajyog Society DP Road, Nanded, on January 5. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “We use an internal system where specific spots are classified as frequent, priority and regular sites for patrolling across the city. Beat marshals are required to use the app for regular updates about duties by posting selfies at the spots and so on. We found many citizens suggested spots that were already covered by beat marshals, so we provided specific data highlighting the same.

Later, on January 2, online transactions of Rs40,000 were made by cloning his credit card. The techie on Thursday registered a case with the Wakad police. “On December 30, 2021, the techie had posted advertising about the sofa on an e-portal. A person contacted the techie and told him that he would initially transfer Rs2 to the techie for a trial. “The man had sent a QR code of Rs 2 to the complainant. After he scanned it, the amount was credited to the techie’s account,” said the officer. The man told the complainant that he would send a QR code of Rs 15,000. “This time, instead of credit, the money was debited from his account,” added the officer. This went on repeatedly. After losing Rs45,000, the techie became suspicious.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fraudsters-dupe-techie-of-85000/articleshow/88766022.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Heavy security force was deployed to ensure law and order in the district. “They want to kill 20 lakh Muslims. We are ready for it. At least 20,000 Muslims here will surrender before the government and are ready to sacrifice their lives for the country's peace and harmony," said Tauqeer Raza Khan, scholar and founder of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who led the protest. The three-day 'Dharam Sansad', held from December 16 to 19 at Ved Niketan Dham, Bhopatwala in Haridwar, was organized by Yati Narsinghanand, who is associated with the Juna akhara and is a priest of a temple in Dasna, Ghaziabad. Addressing the gathering, Raza said, “We do not want to fight with you since you are our brothers. If your thirst can be quenched by our blood, we are ready to go to the altar of sacrifice. Now you decide who is wrong – those who are ready to lay down their lives for the country or those who disregard women and give a call to kill 200 million people of a community. Can those people be called patriots?” Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “Thousands of people had gathered peacefully and returned home after Tauqeer Raza’s speech was over. We had deployed heavy security at the venue to ensure law and order is not disturbed in the city. We have not registered any case yet. A probe has been ordered to find out if any guidelines were flouted during the protest.” Speaking to TOI later, Raza said, “We want peace, as we love our country. I would request the government to ensure strict action against those who tried to disrupt peace and unity in the country through hate speech at the Dharam Sansad. The right place for those people is jail. I would like to tell our government that there is not a single true Muslim who will say anything against lord Ram. We all believe that lord Ram was ‘Maryada Purshottam (perfect)’. The government should pass a law mandating strict action against anyone trying to insult other faiths.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/muslims-in-thousands-organise-peace-protest-against-haridwar-hate-speech/articleshow/88763355.cms||---

Their crucial exams are scheduled in March and the Covid-19 situation has brought about the current uncertainty The exam schedule was announced about two weeks ago by the state education department for offline mode and students started preparing. Students said that another change in the exam schedule would hamper their performance in a crucial year. The CBSE and ICSE boards had opted for a semester pattern for their students and the first semester was smoothly conducted in the offline mode around November-December, across the country. However, aspirants are worried about the second semester exam due in February-March. Shraddha Soman, whose son is in Std X, said, “There is immense confusion among students about the mode of exam as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. The assessment schedule has been declared for February-March. The prelims are scheduled to start from January 12 and the schools are all geared up to conduct it offline with all the safety measures.” Health experts said the current wave of cases is expected to peak in March. SSC student Nachiket Atre said that his school has rigorously begun the vaccination of all the students in wake of the forthcoming exams and the rising Covid-19 cases. “We do not want online exams or marking based on average marks. We insist on offline exams. It is a tricky situation and as we prepare for the exam that is so near, there is a lot of confusion among students regarding the fate of exams,” he added. CBSE announced the two-exam policy for board classes. The current academic year is divided into two terms and board exams will be conducted at the end of each term. Student Ria Ghosh said that since the first term exam is over there will be some base for evaluation and marking if the situation becomes worse in the coming months. “The second exam is also due, however we are uncertain about it,” she added. The CICSE also conducted the first semester exams that started in November. ISC student Rihan Agarwal said they were preparing for the second term. “The exam schedule has not been announced as yet.

The issue of straightening the nullah is causing unnecessary delay, they claim.The Bombay HC in December ordered a status quo on the PMC’s work to straighten the alignment of Ambil Odha. The next hearing is on January 10. According to PMC officials, the matter is sub-judice because a petition regarding it is pending before the court. “PMC will take action as per the court’s directives,” said Santosh Tandale, a senior official coordinating the Ambil Odha project.Activists Kishor Kamble and Meghraj Nimbalkar have filed the petition contending that the PMC has not followed the provisions of the MRTP Act and the Development Plan Control Rules while going ahead with the plan to straighten the course of Ambil Odha. PMC had not completed the necessary procedures required to initiate the work either, they stated.Sachin Dighe, a transit camp resident, said, “We have given our properties after the government agencies directed us. Now, the delay will cause problems,” PMC officials said 130 slum dwellers were to be shifted as the nullah affected people. Most them have been shifted in the transit camp. “Rehabilitation of the locals should be done at the same location, but straightening should be avoided. It may cause flooding in downstream in areas like Dandekar bridge,” said Sarang Yadvadkar, an environmentalist||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/residents-seek-solution-to-nullah-straightening-issue/articleshow/88766026.cms||---

---||Pune||Elderly man in Pune gets 10 years’ jail for repeated rape||PUNE: A court of special judge (Pocso Act) GP Agrawal here on Friday convicted and sentenced a 63-year-old Chandannagar resident to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for repeatedly raping a minor from Mumbai between August 2014 and January 2016 after luring her with a career in modelling. The survivor was then aged 16-plus years and was studying in Std XI at a city college. The accused was aged 57 years at the time of his arrest on March 11, 2016, and has been in jail since then. The court found him guilty on the count of repeated rape under Section 376 of the IPC and sexual assault under Section 4 of the Pocso Act. The court, however, acquitted him of kidnapping, assault, criminal intimidation charges and under the IT Act provisions, owing to lack of evidence. Special prosecutor Sunil More examined seven witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case. The girl came to Pune for studies and initially lived with a close relative before shifting to a hostel. She met the accused through her relative during a picnic in August 2014. The prosecution’s case was that the accused told her that he was a senior officer with the Pune Municipal Corporation and owned a cloth shop. The two exchanged numbers and were in touch with each other after the picnic. The accused told her that he had contacts and could help her get modelling assignments. On the pretext of making a photo profile, the accused took the girl to a hotel near Sinhagad fort where they had a few drinks following which the girl went off to sleep. He then disrobed her and took her photos. A few days later, he started blackmailing the girl and demanded a physical relationship. Fearing that the accused will make her photos public, she gave in to his demand and the accused started calling her regularly and continued having a physical relationship with her. After a point when it became unbearable for her to continue with the relationship, the girl then walked into the Bund Garden police station on March 10, 2016, and lodged a zero FIR, which was referred to the Warje Malwadi police. The accused had taken a defence of consensual relationship, besides arguing that he had failed potency test. As such the allegation of rape did not survive against him.  The court, however, said a minor’s consent, even if it is assumed as given, was immaterial in a rape case. The court also dismissed the negative potency report argument in the light of the 2013 Criminal Law Amendment relating to the offence of rape and observed that the accused had two children from his wife. As such, the impotency argument cannot survive. The court also found the survivor’s deposition as cogent, reliable and trustworthy. The judge opted for a lenient punishment instead of imposing a life imprisonment. “ .... The accused is aged about 63 years. Striking a balance between the act committed by the accused and status of victim, would be the just punishment. In fact, the accused has two children and wife. Therefore, this court is not inclined to impose extreme sentence of life imprisonment,” the court said.

The doubling time of the Omicron variant is 1.5 to 3 days. “If one person is infected, it can reach up to 70 people at a fast pace. Considering the pace of spread in Coimbatore, possible Omicron cases cannot be ruled out especially when samples are witnessing ‘S’ gene drop,” a senior health official from the public health department said.The vigil has been tightened in the check posts bordering Kerala. A few people who were found to be not fully vaccinated and without RT-PCR test certificates were not allowed to enter the district. District collector G S Sameeran said in a statement that the same will be continued in the coming days.He asked people not to venture out in places of mass gathering unless it is very essential. Over 50% of the children in the age group of 15-18 have been vaccinated so far in the district. He also asked to make use of the mass vaccination drive on Saturday at about 1,000 places in the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/daily-covid-case-count-crosses-400-mark/articleshow/88766036.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Tirukkural couplets carry deep meaning: Guv||Coimbatore: Tirukkural couplets are sharp and carry deep meaning which cannot be understood without spirituality, Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi said here on Friday.“Limiting Tirukkural to a work on ethics and morality is a great injustice to the book,” the governor said after inaugurating the World Tirukkural Conference–2022, organised at Sri Krishna Arts and Science College (SKASC) here, by Kural Malai Sangam, an organization working for the promotion of the Tirukkural.To achieve the status of world classic, Tirukkural should be viewed in totality by including spiritual perspective, the governor said.He said Tirukkural couplets on ethics and morality did not stand independent of their spiritual meaning. The absence of such an understanding or appreciation would not reveal the inner meanings the couplets carry.“Tirukural not only talks about devotion but has couplets on renunciation and the cycle of birth and death,” he said.Since Tiruvalluvar authored Tirukural, several ideologies have come and gone. Political correctness or the present ideology should not limit what the book has to offer. Only then Tirukural’s glory would continue, and no effort was needed to promote it, the governor said.The governor sought more commentaries with a spiritual perspective on Tirukural and not just translations to make it more popular across the world.Speaking at the event, former high court judge Justice N Kirubakaran stressed on the importance of taking Tamil language to the next generation as we are pushed to an extent where we need to offer priority in government jobs to promote the language. He also lamented over some languages not getting due importance in the country unlike a couple of languages.The conference passed resolutions on creation of Tirukkural Malai with the inscription of 1,330 couplets and recognising Tirukkural as a national book of literature. It was also decided to recommend to UNESCO to accord the recognition of the World Book of Literature for Tirukkural.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tirukkural-couplets-carry-deep-meaning-guv/articleshow/88766038.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Bank officer in Kalahandi loses ₹30k to cyber crooks||Bhubaneswar: A bank officer in Kalahandi district has allegedly been duped by scamsters and lost Rs 30,000 last week. The incident has left the banking community red faced as they have been sensitising customers about safe transactions and cautioning them about cyber threats. Rabindra Nanda, who is a manager with Indian Overseas Bank at Bhawanipatna, lodged a complaint with the cyber crime and economic offences (CC&EO) police station in the district a few days ago. Nanda alleged that some miscreants fraudulently withdrew Rs 30,023 in three transactions — Rs 10,000 each in two phases and Rs 10,023 in the last phase — from his account on December 31, 2021. Immediately after receiving the transaction alerts through SMS on his phone about suspicious withdrawals, Nanda blocked his debit card. Nanda told the police that he verified the transactions and came to know that the miscreants fraudulently withdrew the money from an ATM in Kolkata. “The banker claimed that he was in possession of his debit card and did not share his PIN or other details with anyone. We are investigating the case,” an officer of the CC&EO police station said.Nanda denied having clicked any phishing mail or link. “I did not receive any suspicious mail or link. Nor did I ever share my card related details with anyone. I strongly suspect cyber crooks might have cloned my debit card and gained access to my PIN. Using the cloned card in an ATM in Kolkata, they stole cash from my account,” Nanda said. Last month, unidentified cyber criminals fraudulently withdrew Rs 10.10 lakh from the account of the wife of a senior IPS officer.It must be noted that ATM related frauds, especially fraudulent withdrawal of cash, have been rising in the state. As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 204 such cases were reported in the state in 2018, the number going up to 331 and 362 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Debit and credit card related cheatings, too, have increased alarmingly during the period. As many as 13, 50 and 132 such frauds were reported in 2018, 2019 and 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bank-officer-in-kalahandi-loses-30k-to-cyber-crooks/articleshow/88766040.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The accused was identified as Madan Kumar Jayapura (45), a resident of Deogarh district.The crackdown came a day after the STF seized two leopard skins from another man in Mayurbhanj district on Thursday. “We acted on a fresh input and raided a place near Telibani on National Highway no. 49 and arrested the accused with the leopard skin, elephant tusk and pangolin scales. Local forest officials assisted us during the raid. The accused appears to be a middleman. We will try to trace the poacher and find out the person, who supplied the wildlife body parts to Jayapura,” an STF officer said.The STF found a bullet wound on the leopard skin, raising suspicion that the leopard might have been gunned down by a poacher. The STF will send the seized wildlife exhibits to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, for chemical examination. Though the STF’s main mandate is to curb organized crimes and drug trafficking in the state, protection of the endangered wildlife species and crackdown on wildlife smugglers has also remained its focus area. The STF has seized 25 leopard skins, 13 elephant tusks, seven deer skins, rescued nine pangolins and seized 16 kg pangolin scales since 2020 till now. Altogether 55 people were arrested during the period for their alleged involvement in the wildlife crimes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/leopard-skin-tusk-pangolin-scales-seized-in-deogarh/articleshow/88766041.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Plea seeking audit of Covid hospitalisation bills: States fail to submit responses in time, SC defers hearing to Jan 10||Nainital: The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday defered the hearing of the petition claiming overcharging by private hospitals during the second wave of the Covid pandemic to January 10 after finding out that several states are yet to submit their responses to the PIL. The court order to this effect came out on Friday. In the last hearing of the PIL in November, the SC had said that the petition merits "serious attention" and ordered the central government, all states and union territories to file their responses within four weeks. However, only a few states have filed their responses so far. The petition, filed by Dehradun-resident Abhinav Thapar, claims that private hospitals charged exorbitant amounts during the second wave of Covid-19 in the absence of a clear policy and the excess amount should be refunded to affected families. The petitioner further says that health insurance companies, too, did not have any guidelines regarding reimbursement, forcing patients to exhaust their health insurance limit. This plunged several families into poverty, he adds. Thapar had in October started a campaign to collect copies of hospital bills from families who had been charged excessively. "Many families exhausted almost all their financial resources to settle their bills. Our battle is to ensure that they get refunded," says Thapar. Notably, the central government, taking cognisance of overcharging by private hospitals, had set a cap on charges for different medical facilities. For instance, the per day charge for an oxygen bed was fixed at Rs 10,000. Similarly, the charges for ICU and ventilator beds were capped at Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000 per day respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/plea-seeking-audit-of-covid-hospitalisation-bills-states-fail-to-submit-responses-in-time-sc-defers-hearing-to-jan-10/articleshow/88763373.cms||Sonali Mishra

These institutions (leprosy homes and orphanages) have more than 900 inmates. The move follows the Centre’s refusal to renew FCRA licence of the Mother Teresa-founded Missionaries of Charity. The Manch led by state secretary (organisation) Tanmay Das alleged that Naveen is using the CMRF fund to get sympathy votes from the minority communities ahead of the forthcoming rural and urban polls in the state. “The BJD should stop this appeasement politics by using the CMRF fund,” Das said.Das said normally the CMRF fund is used to help people affected by natural calamities, those requiring money for treatment and some other situations. He said CMRF is not the personal or party property of the chief minister. The BJD refused to comment on the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/outfit-questions-aid-to-mothers-charity-from-cms-relief-fund/articleshow/88766043.cms||---

Daily rituals, however, will continue to be performed by servitors by adhering to Covid protocols. “Observing the sudden spike in Covid cases across the state, we hurriedly convened a virtual meeting with Chhatisa Nijog of the temple. It was decided to shut the temple from Monday till January 31. A decision on reopening of the temple will be taken after thorough assessment of the Covid situation in February,” Puri collector Samarth Verma said. It must be noted a number of servitors, their family members and several employees, including senior officials of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration have been infected in the last one week. “We are closely observing the health conditions of the servitors. Some of them were infected with mild symptoms. Utmost care is being taken to ensure their well-being,” a temple official said. In the wake of the first wave, the temple was shut for devotees since March 20, 2020, and reopened on December 23 of that year with only families of servitors being allowed a darshan of the deities for two days. Devotees from the Puri municipality area were allowed entry from December 26 to 31, 2020. While the shrine was closed on January 1 and 2 last year, it was thrown open to all devotees, only those carrying Covid negative certificates, from January 3. The second wave too prompted the administration to close the temple from April 24 last year. The temple opened its doors in a staggered manner to servitors and their immediate families on August 12 and 13. Subsequently, only the residents of Puri urban areas were allowed inside the shrine from August 16 to 20. The temple reopened for all on August 23. The devotees were told to produce their final vaccination certificates or RT-PCR negative reports obtained at least 96 hours before their visit to be allowed entry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/puri-temple-shut-for-devotees-till-jan-31/articleshow/88766045.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Bhubaneswar||High spike proteins making ‘O’ more infectious: Experts||Bhubaneswar: Health experts said the rapid rate of transmission of the Omicron variant is due to its very high number of spike proteins (37) leading to the virus attaching to receptors in the host quicker than its Delta counterpart. They said not properly wearing a mask or with gaps near the nose or wearing a mask but coming in close contact with a person and conversing with him can result in Covid-19 infection. Besides, aerosol can stick to the mask and wrong handling can easily transmit the virus. In case of Omicron, transmission is more pronounced because of high mutations in spike protein. “The Omicron variant with multiple mutations in spike protein is showing hyper transmissibility. The virus multiplies in upper airways quickly and thus gets expelled through nose and mouth. Stringent Covid behaviour is needed to contain the spread,” said Sanghamitra Pati, director, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC). She said an air-tight mask is a must to prevent the entry of the virus. Close gatherings in especially indoor setup should be also avoided. Experts said if one wears mask properly leaving no gaps around the protected area (mouth and nose) and stay away from gatherings, the virus can’t travel and enter a person’s body. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said Omicron itself has two variants BA.1 and BA.2. The BA.2 variant is more transmissible, which means it can enter the host through ACE2 receptor quite easily, he said.Dr Mrinalini Darswal, Odisha cadre IAS officer, who is pursuing doctoral study on public health at Harvard University, quoting a study from South Africa said that Omicron is 36.5% more transmissible than Delta and it erodes immunity obtained from prior Covid infection and inoculation. The household infection caused by Omicron is about 16% compared to around 10% in case of Delta. So there is a higher chance of transmission to family members, she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/high-spike-proteins-making-o-more-infectious-experts/articleshow/88766047.cms||---

The Berhampur Byabasai Mahasangh and Desibehera Banik Sangh have also urged all the shopkeepers to wear masks and to follow Covid-19 guidelines. Some members of the executive committees of the trade bodies on Thursday evening visited different shops in Bada Bazar, the main business hub of Silk City, to educate the shopkeepers about safety measures. “We have also suggested the shopkeepers that people not wearing masks should not be given service at their outlets,” said Rabindra Nath Sahu, secretary, Berhampur Byabasai Mahasangh. “People from across Ganjam and neighbouring districts visit the Bada Bazar for trading purposes. There is a possibility of spread of infection in their congregation. The decision of no mask, no ration would help to protect the shopkeepers, their employees and customers from the deadly virus,” said Sahu. The Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC) has also decided to intensify its drive to enforce Covid guidelines, especially in the market areas. “The enforcement squads of the BeMC have been asked to enforce Covid guidelines and take steps to close any outlet found violating the government and district administration’s initiatives to keep the virus at bay,” said Siddheshwar Baliram Bondar, BeMC commissioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/no-mask-no-ration-declare-silk-city-traders-as-cases-go-up/articleshow/88766048.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Amid rise in Cov infection, people give mask the miss||Bhubaneswar: Despite the surge in cases and increase in enforcement activities, people seem to be nonchalant about the danger Covid still poses. A trip to the main markets like Indradhanu and Unit-I in the state capital show that most people have done away with the mask, either due of carelessness, fatigue, lack of awareness or an illusion that the virus won’t infect them as there are vaccinated. Jagannath Tripathy, who is a regular to the Unit-I market, said at least 75% people and vegetable vendors are not wearing masks. “I have to be doubly careful while buying vegetables and maintain distance, but it’s very difficult. I am planning to buy vegetables from a shop near my home from now on as chances of catching the infection there is less,” Tripathy said. Similar is the situation at Indradhanu market. “People coming to a medicine shop wear the mask out of fear. But outside in the market, most customers do not wear masks, and even if they do, they wear it improperly. It is mostly people above 45 years who stick to the mask rule,” said Binod Kumar Rout, a salesman in a medicine shop.This despite 13 squads of 8 to 9 persons, including Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) staff and a policeman, carry out enforcement activities in the city. The sale of masks hasn’t witnessed much of an increase. Dipankar Patnaik, who runs a medicine shop in Naharkanta Market on the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar highway, is hopeful the situation will change. “From one or two masks per day earlier, I now sell 5 to 7 pieces every day,” said Patnaik, adding that the pandemic situation will improve only when people start wearing masks. Most shopkeepers also said that there has been no increase in the sale of sanitisers. Mask distributor Prasanta Mahapatra of Prasanta Enterprises expects mask sale to rise in the days to come as cases are going up. “Before the pandemic, I used to sell 500 pieces of masks every fortnight. During the pandemic, the number rose to 5,000-10,000. There is demand from medicine stores, hospitals and clinics,” said Mahapatra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/amid-rise-in-cov-infection-people-give-mask-the-miss/articleshow/88766050.cms||Arunika Mohapatra

School authorities denied the allegation and said the exam was conducted as per the Board of Secondary Education (BSE) schedule.The students claimed the duration of Friday’s examination, mentioned in the question paper of Information Technology (IT) and Tourism and Hospitality (TH), was one hour. But the invigilator took away the answer sheets 30 minutes before the scheduled end of the exam. As many as 52 students appeared in the vocational examination in the school. “We did not get time to answer the questions in such a short period. The school should have allowed us one hour to answer the questions,” an examinee said. Pannag Bhushan Majhi, headmaster of the school, said the BSE had fixed 30-minute duration for the 20-mark exam in vocational subjects like IT and HT. “Earlier the board had issued the schedule and had also messaged us a day before the exam that the duration was 30 minutes. By mistake, in the question paper, the duration of the exam was mentioned one hour,” Majhi admitted.

---||Bhubaneswar||High spike proteins make ‘O’ more infectious: Experts||Bhubaneswar: Health experts said the rapid rate of transmission of the Omicron variant is due to its very high number of spike proteins (37) leading to the virus attaching to receptors in the host quicker than its Delta counterpart. They said not properly wearing a mask or with gaps near the nose or wearing a mask but coming in close contact with a person and conversing with him can result in Covid-19 infection. Besides, aerosol can stick to the mask and wrong handling can easily transmit the virus. In case of Omicron, transmission is more pronounced because of high mutations in spike protein. “The Omicron variant with multiple mutations in spike protein is showing hyper transmissibility. The virus multiplies in upper airways quickly and thus gets expelled through nose and mouth. Stringent Covid behaviour is needed to contain the spread,” said Sanghamitra Pati, director, ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC). She said an air-tight mask is a must to prevent the entry of the virus. Close gatherings in especially indoor setup should be also avoided. Experts said if one wears mask properly leaving no gaps around the protected area (mouth and nose) and stay away from gatherings, the virus can’t travel and enter a person’s body. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said Omicron itself has two variants BA.1 and BA.2. The BA.2 variant is more transmissible, which means it can enter the host through ACE2 receptor quite easily, he said.Dr Mrinalini Darswal, Odisha cadre IAS officer, who is pursuing doctoral study on public health at Harvard University, quoting a study from South Africa said that Omicron is 36.5% more transmissible than Delta and it erodes immunity obtained from prior Covid infection and inoculation. The household infection caused by Omicron is about 16% compared to around 10% in case of Delta. So there is a higher chance of transmission to family members, she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/high-spike-proteins-make-o-more-infectious-experts/articleshow/88766061.cms||---

The Berhampur Byabasai Mahasangh and Desibehera Banik Sangh have also urged all the shopkeepers to wear masks and to follow Covid-19 guidelines. Some members of the executive committees of the trade bodies on Thursday evening visited different shops in Bada Bazar, the main business hub of Silk City, to educate the shopkeepers about safety measures. “We have also suggested the shopkeepers that people not wearing masks should not be given service at their outlets,” said Rabindra Nath Sahu, secretary, Berhampur Byabasai Mahasangh. “People from across Ganjam and neighbouring districts visit the Bada Bazar for trading purposes. There is a possibility of spread of infection in their congregation. The decision of no mask, no ration would help to protect the shopkeepers, their employees and customers from the deadly virus,” said Sahu. The Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC) has also decided to intensify its drive to enforce Covid guidelines, especially in the market areas. “The enforcement squads of the BeMC have been asked to enforce Covid guidelines and take steps to close any outlet found violating the government and district administration’s initiatives to keep the virus at bay,” said Siddheshwar Baliram Bondar, BeMC commissioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/no-mask-no-ration-order-silk-city-traders/articleshow/88766063.cms||---
