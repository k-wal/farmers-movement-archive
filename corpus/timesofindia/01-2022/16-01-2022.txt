The meeting assumes significance as clubs are now genuinely worried about the sudden rise in cases almost everywhere. Odisha FC played their match against Kerala Blasters on Wednesday despite discovering three positive cases inside the bio-secure bubble on the day of the match. FC Goa were in an even worse state. The former League champions had eight players missing through Covid-19 positive cases and isolation for those sharing rooms, yet their request for a postponement was turned down. The League, however, postponed ATK Mohun Bagan’s clash against Bengaluru FC on Saturday, after both teams were in isolation and unable to train before the big clash. ATKMB’s clash against Odisha FC was also postponed last week. The Kolkata giants are understood to have the maximum cases with players, officials, staff, medical team and all four drivers testing positive for the virus. “Each match is assessed on a number of factors including the ability of the clubs to field a team; the severity of Covid-19 breakout at the club(s); and the ability of the club personnel to safely prepare for and play the match,” the League said in a statement on Monday. ATKMB have been in isolation since last Saturday (January 8) when positive cases led to their game against Odisha FC being postponed. The second postponement for ATKMB drew a furious reaction from several quarters with Goa captain Edu Bedia calling ISL an “adulterated competition.” “Yesterday, we played the game with nine casualties due to Covid cases. Today, for the second consecutive match another team suspends its game for the same reason. Can someone explain that to me? Adulterated competition,” Bedia said in a social media post on Saturday. The Goa captain, who has been here since 2017 and is the longest-serving foreign player at any ISL club, was among the eight players who missed the 1-1 draw against NorthEast United. After the four-tiered bio-bubble was breached across team hotels here in north and south Goa, there has been uncertainty surrounding games. Sunday’s clash between Kerala Blasters and Mumbai City, for example, hangs in the balance after Kerala, the league leaders, were unable to train for the last three days. The organisers, though, have maintained that there are no plans to postpone the crucial clash. “It’s not easy seeing the circumstances, not just for our club,” Blasters coach Ivan Vukomanovic said during the pre-match media interaction. “I think nine clubs are now in quarantine. Nobody is talking about football, nobody is talking about football games because everyone is concerned.” Blasters are leading the league table with 20 points from 11 matches but will be in poor shape to play Sunday’s match, having not stepped out of their rooms for three days. “As a team, if you don’t train for four days, don’t prepare for the game and then go for the game, we will see bad game, nothing but injuries. We have families, wives, children, pregnant wife. It feels like the virus is passing from one to the other. It’s like a chain process,” said Vukomanovic. The long isolation is also taking a toll on the mental health of the players with many now just waiting for this season’s misery to end. “Players are losing interest and the desire to continue competing,” said Bedia. “They continue to play to collect their contracts without any ambition. This is what has been achieved with this year’s rules. Whether you like it or not, all the people inside the bio-bubble just want March to come and the league to end, whatever the outcome.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/isl-clubs-players-feel-uneasy-with-rising-covid-19-cases-league-to-discuss-urgent-matters-today/articleshow/88923026.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||India||Big share of BJP's 1st UP list of 107 tickets goes to backwards||LUCKNOW: BJP allocated a significant share of tickets for backwards even as it sprung a surprise by fielding chief minister Yogi Adityanath from his home turf, Gorakhpur (Urban) seat, instead of the Hindutva nerve-centre of Ayodhya as speculated, in the first list of 107 candidates for UP that it announced on Saturday. Out of these 107 seats, barring Gorakhpur (Urban) and Sirathu, remaining 105 will go to the polls in the first two phases. As expected, deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya will contest from Sirathu in Kaushambi. While Yogi, who has been a five-time MP from Gorakhpur, will contest an assembly election for the first time, Maurya had won from Sirathu in 2012. Both will replace sitting MLAs -- RMD Agarwal and Sheetla Prasad. The party announced candidates for 57 out of 58 seats going to the polls in the first phase, while 48 names out of 55 constituencies in the second phase were announced. Nominees for eight seats will be announced later, with some of these likely to go to allies Nishad Party and Apna Dal. Of the 105 seats going to the polls in the first two phases, BJP had won 86 in 2017. However, two were lying vacant because of the death of incumbents, while three defected to SP a few days ago. Out of the remaining 81, the party has retained 60 sitting MLAs in the list, which is almost 75%. The retention comes against the backdrop of speculation about the possibility of a large number of sitting MLAs being dropped. Among the runners-up of the 2017 elections, only four have been fielded again while 13 have been replaced. Only 10 out of 107 candidates are women. The party has given 44 seats to OBC candidates. Though commensurate with the make-up of the electorate, the big share is being seen as significant in view of BJP’s attempt to blunt the opposition’s claim about the exit of “backwards” from the saffron fold, with Samajwadi Party managing to poach influential backward leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini. Also,the party, which was at the receiving end of farmers’ agitation in the Jat-dominated pockets of western UP, has kept its faith in the influential community. Sixteen of these tickets have gone to Jat candidates who helped the party sweep the region in the 2017 polls held in the wake of communal riots. Gujars, another important category in the area, have got seven tickets, as against six and five given to Lodhs and Sainis, respectively. OBCs, who form the biggest chunk of voters, are considered crucial for winning elections in UP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-share-of-bjps-1st-up-list-of-107-tickets-goes-to-backwards/articleshow/88923355.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||World||Written off for 2024 election? Kamala Harris fights to stay in fray||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has mistakenly referred to her more than once in recent weeks as "President Harris". Going by political commentariat in the US, vice-president Kamala Harris' political star is fading rapidly, to the extent that she's being written out of the 2024 election, even as a vice-presidential candidate. Some pundits have gone to the extent of suggesting that Democrats should persuade Hillary Clinton to run again, as Biden's running mate if not top of the ticket, in order to galvanise the party. Responding to alarming accounts that her political fortunes are in the decline, Harris is rejigging her team and reorienting her messaging in what one report said was an effort to "boost her public image and reset her political prospects, after a first year in office that even some of her allies say has fallen short of expectations". From hiring a new communications head to making more high profile appearances with the president, Harris is on a mission to resurrect a career that was briefly expected to culminate in the Oval Office but has since faltered. On Thursday, Harris clapped back at reports of her political demise vis-a-vis 2024, characterising them as "high class gossip" and asserting that she was only thinking about the present. "This is part of the punditry and the gossip around places like Washington, DC. Let me just tell you something. We're focused on the things in front of us. We're focused on what we need to do to address issues like affordable childcare," she told NBC channel. Pressed about whether she'd be on the 2024 Democratic ticket, Harris retorted, "American people sent us here to do a job. And right now there's a lot of work to be done. And that's my focus. Sincerely." Suggestions and speculation that Harris could be or should be bumped off the 2024 Democratic ticket has come from across the media spectrum. NYT columnist Thomas Friedman, invoking the unity efforts in Israel, pitched for a Joe Biden-Liz Cheney or Joe Biden-Lisa Murkowski ticket (both Cheney and Murkowski are moderate Republicans leery of Trump), although he also threw in a Kamala Harris- Mitt Romney possibility into the mix. "This is the democratic way of defeating a threat to democracy. Not doing it is how democracies die," he wrote, proffering advice to Democrats on countering the Trump threat. In a Wall Street Journal oped, political consultants Douglas Schoen and Andrew Stein bluntly wrote that both Biden and Harris have become unpopular and it may be time for Democrats to effect drastic changes. "A perfect storm in Democratic Party is making a once-unfathomable scenario plausible: a political comeback for Hillary Clinton in 2024. Several circumstances - Biden's low approval rating, doubts over his capacity to run for re-election at 82, Kamala Harris's unpopularity, and the absence of another strong Democrat to lead the ticket in 2024 - have created a leadership vacuum, which Mrs. Clinton viably could fill," they wrote. Projecting that Democrats will likely lose control of Congress in 2022, they anticipated Clinton will begin shortly after the midterms to position herself as an experienced candidate capable of leading the party on new and more successful path. Not so fast, say Harris defenders, who insist that she has been dealt a raw hand rooted in racism and sexism from a male-dominated establishment unaccustomed to seeing a woman in power. Harris has reportedly told allies privately that she has been set up to fail. Earlier this week, Harris was back centrestage with Biden, canvassing support for voting rights bill. "Years from now, our children and our grandchildren, they will ask us about this moment," she said. Days later, two (white) senators from her own party torpedoed prospects of the legislation - and Harris' political future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/written-off-for-2024-election-kamala-harris-fights-to-stay-in-fray/articleshow/88923430.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta
---||---||Channi, Sidhu in Congress' first Punjab list of 86||CHANDIGARH: Congress announced its first list of 86 candidates for the Punjab assembly elections on Saturday, fielding CM Charanjit Singh Channi and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu from their existing seats, while betting on Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala from Mansa, actor Sonu Sood's sister Malvika Sood from Moga and Sunil Jakhar's nephew Sandeep Jakhar from Abohar. Playing safe in a five-cornered contest, Congress has decided to repeat most of its MLAs, including all 17 Cabinet ministers, except Brahm Mohindra, who has vacated the Patiala (rural) seat for his son Mohit. Channi has been renominated from Chamkaur Sahib constituency, while Navjot Sidhu will again try his luck from Amritsar (East). Punjab goes to polls on February 14 for all 117 assembly constituencies. The party has dropped four sitting MLAs: Harjot Kamal was ignored in favour of Malvika Sood and joined BJP. The party has bet on Rupinder Kaur Ruby, who joined the party after winning the last election on an AAP ticket. She has been fielded from Malout in place of MLA Ajaib Singh Bhatti. Another MLA, Balwinder Singh Laddi, has been dropped from Hargobindpur to make way for Mandeep Singh Ragar Nangal. Laddi had joined BJP briefly only to return to Congress. From Balluana (SC) seat, MLA Nathu Ram has been replaced with Rajinder Kaur. The list, in a way, bore the stamp of Navjot Sidhu. He also had his say in pushing the candidature of Naresh Puri for Sujanpur. Backed by Sidhu, Gurpreet Singh GP, too, will defend his Bassi Pathana seat even though Channi wanted his younger brother, Manohar Singh, to be fielded there. Former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has been named from Lehra though she lost the last election. Contrary to speculation that Channi could also contest from a second seat – Adampur in Doaba — the party has given that ticket to former BSP leader Sukhwinder Singh Kotli. Four of the five ministers in the Amarinder Singh’s cabinet who were dropped last year have been given tickets. They are Balbir Singh Sidhu (Mohali), Sunder Sham Arora (Hoshiarpur), Gurpreet Singh Kangar (Rampura Phul) and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot (Nabha). But the party is yet to field someone from Guru Har Sahai, which was represented by former minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi who joined BJP. The party has also fielded the two deputy CMs — Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni — from Dera Baba Nanak and Amritsar Central, respectively, seats they already represent. “The party has been cautious to avoid any major dissidence as the alliance between BJP and former CM Amarinder Singh’s party is waiting to poach on disgruntled Congress MLAs,” a party leader said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/channi-sidhu-in-congress-first-punjab-list-of-86/articleshow/88923702.cms||Vibhor Mohan

EC, which was briefed on the present status and projected trends of Covid pandemic during separate online meetings on Saturday with the Union health secretary, chief secretaries and chief electoral officers of the poll-bound states, also asked the states concerned, particularly Punjab, Manipur and UP, to improve their vaccination rates further before it reviews the ban on political rallies next week. An EC statement issued after the meeting said physical rallies of political parties or candidates, including the probable ones, or any other group related to election shall not be allowed till January 22. Similarly, the ban on roadshows, padyatras, cycle or bike or vehicle rally stays for another week. However, the Commission, which was recently approached by Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM for a small window of physical campaign for parties with lesser resources and digital presence, has allowed indoor meetings of maximum of 300 persons or 50% of the capacity of the hall or the prescribed limit set by SDMA, whichever is lower. A senior EC functionary told TOI that the logic behind allowing small public gatherings in closed spaces is that access control in indoor venues can be regulated better as compared to open grounds. It will be easier for the organisers to regulate the count of people entering the venue and enforce social distancing etc, unlike meetings in outdoor spaces where people are constantly entering and leaving, the EC felt. EC on Friday asked parties to keep their election activities in line with its Covid norms, model code and extant disaster management guidelines. The poll panel, while reviewing the curbs on physical campaigns on Friday, took into consideration the vaccination status, weekly positivity rate and recovery graph of Covid cases in the poll-bound states. As per figures shared by the ministry of health and relevant state authorities, vaccination coverage has improved to 92% for first dose and to 56.4% for second dose in UP; 98.8% and 82.9% respectively in Uttarakhand; 78.3% and 46.2% in Punjab; 100% and 97.2% in Goa; and 57.4% and 43.4% respectively in Manipur. Also, weekly positivity rate stands at 6.22% in UP, 9.5% in Uttarakhand, 18.6% in Punjab, 39% in Goa and 9% in Manipur. Hospitalisation rates remain low at 1% in UP, 2.6% in Uttarakhand, 2.7% in Punjab and 0.7% in Goa, with EC being informed that most patients are recovering in home isolation with mild symptoms. “The week’s extension of the ban on physical rallies will give more time to the states like Punjab, Manipur and UP to raise their vaccination coverage to 100% or highest possible for Dose 1 and administer Dose 2 to all those eligible. The states have promised to come back with improved figures in a week, and hope to fully meet EC’s vaccination targets by the January-end or latest by February 10. This will allow EC to consider easing the ban on physical rallies since most persons would have been vaccinated and even if infected, have a chance of early recovery with no serious symptoms requiring hospitalisation,” said an EC functionary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-extends-ban-on-roadshows-rallies-till-january-22/articleshow/88923705.cms||Bharti Jain

With close to 80 startups with a valuation of over $1 billion, India is home to the third-largest number of unicorns, with several more set to break into the big league during the coming months as investors chase profitable bets. The government has estimated that annual funding in Indian startups has more than trebled from around $11 billion to $36 billion within a year. "Our startups are changing the rules of the game. That is why I believe startups are going to be the backbone of new India... the golden era of India's startups is starting now," the PM said while addressing the inaugural Startup India Innovation Week. He nudged startups to expand their footprint across the globe, while also asking them to "innovate for India, innovate from India" and listed out areas ranging from urban planning, defence and Gati Shakti as possible areas where they could help contribute to the economy in a major way. He also announced that January 16, when the Startup India Mission was launched in 2016, will henceforth be celebrated as National Startup Day. Apart from promoting entrepreneurship, the government also sees the new companies as major job creators. Modi also interacted with startups, which made a presentation on six themes - Growing from Roots, Nudging the DNA, From Local to Global, Technology of Future, Building Champions in Manufacturing, and Sustainable Development. Modi said the government is focusing on three aspects - liberate entrepreneurship and innovation from the web of government processes, bureaucratic silos; create an institutional mechanism to promote innovation and handhold young innovators and enterprises. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal urged startups to suggest ways to reduce the regulatory burden to further provide a thrust. "I am given to understand that 2021 has also seen over 1,000 deals with a total funding of $23 billion in the first nine months... It shows the strength of our startups," Goyal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-india-rapidly-moving-towards-100-unicorn-mark/articleshow/88923777.cms||---

At least Rs 1.3 crore were recovered along with incriminating documents during the searches till late Saturday evening, officials said. The agency has also arrested five people, including the director of a private firm during raids conducted after registration of FIR in the case, sources said, adding that director (marketing) of GAIL, E S Rangathan, could be arrested any time. On January 14, the agency filed an FIR against Ranganathan for allegedly demanding bribes through middlemen for granting discounts on petrochemical products marketed by GAIL. "CBI registered a case against director (marketing) GAIL and others including private persons, private companies and unknown others on the allegations/ information that the accused was indulging in corrupt and illegal activities in conspiracy with middlemen," CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said. According to CBI's FIR, a middleman, acting on the directions of representatives of a private company, had requested the accused GAIL official to allow discount to buyers of petro chemical products in exchange for illegal gratification. After receiving a complaint, a preliminary inquiry was conducted and an FIR under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act registered. The CBI then laid a trap and apprehended the middleman and a director of a private firm based in Delhi when the alleged bribe of Rs 10 lakh was received (by the middleman) on behalf of Rangathan. Subsequently, searches were conducted at the premises of accused at Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Panchkula and Karnal, which led to recovery of Rs 84 lakh, including Rs 75 lakh from a Gurgaon- based private person.  "Searches are continuing at the premises of Ranganathan. CBI has so far arrested five private persons," the agency spokesperson added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-books-gail-director-in-bribery-case-recovers-rs-1cr/articleshow/88923798.cms||Raj Shekhar

Days later, on January 13, when she learnt that someone had died while crossing the railway tracks, the family approached the GRP.“A woman police personnel showed us the picture of my brother’s body,” said Pooja, Sonu’s younger sister.When the family went to the Civil hospital, they came to know that the body was missing from the morgue. Later, they were told that the hospital staff had handed it over to a family in Madhya Pradesh, which even performed the last rites.“We kept asking for the body, so we could see my brother for one last time but because of the negligence of the hospital staff, the body was handed over to a wrong family in Madhya Pradesh. We are poor people and this is our fate,” Pooja added.However, following the intervention of the Faridabad GRP, the family received the ashes of Sonu. “The matter has been resolved. It was a confusion and it has been cleared,” said a police official.Sonu is survived by his wife and two children, aged 2 and 4 years, apart from his mother and a school-going sister. “He was not somebody who was meant to die. I could not even see him one last time,” said Pooja.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/kin-look-for-body-in-fbd-find-last-rites-done-in-mp/articleshow/88923803.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Fake contracts: ITBP official’s home on NSG campus in Manesar raided||GURUGRAM: The police team probing the Rs 125-crore contract fraud allegedly by a BSF deputy commandant while on deputation on the NSG campus in Manesar last year has recovered gold and silver jewellery believed to be worth Rs 1 crore from the quarters of an ITBP officer in the same compound. Naveen, an assistant commandant in the ITBP whose house was searched on Saturday morning, is on the run. He is the brother-in-law of Praveen Yadav, the BSF officer who had orchestrated the fraud. Naveen’s wife is among the four persons arrested so far. Originally from Firozepur Jhirka, Yadav was posted on deputation in the construction wing on the NSG campus in 2019. There, he was responsible for supervising all the construction work that took place in the compound. His deputation, however, ended in May last year. Neck-deep in debt because of losses in share trading, Praveen hatched a plan of cheating real estate companies with tenders for projects that never really existed. Having worked in the construction wing on the campus, Praveen was familiar with the process of issuing tenders. Dinesh, a property dealer, allegedly helped him identify real estate firms and Praveen got in touch with the owners with construction offers. Since he already had access to the NSG compound, Praveen mostly met his targets on the campus, giving them the impression that he was indeed responsible for all constructions there. Praveen then prepared fake documents and got the contractors and firms to sign on them before taking the advance money. He and his family members came under the police scanner after four companies lodged complaints on January 9 and 10. On Saturday morning, a team led by Pankaj, the station house officer (SHO) of Manesar police station, and Sandeep, who is in charge of the crime unit, led the search at Naveen’s quarters in the presence of NSG commandoes. The entire operation was recorded on camera as the cops pulled out the ornaments and high-end watches from cupboards and shelves. Naveen, the police said, fled home after the four FIRs were registered against Praveen and his family. The cops believe the jewellery had been bought by Praveen — who had adopted a lavish lifestyle with the fraud money — and parked at the ITBP officer’s residence after the complaints were lodged. Apart from the jewellery, the police have already recovered Rs 13 crore in cash and 10 luxury cars belonging to Praveen so far. After coming under the police scanner, Naveen, his wife Rituraj, Praveen and his wife Mamta had fled the city together. They, according to the cops, stayed at different five-star hotels in Delhi-NCR for a few days and then headed towards their hometown in Firozpur Jhirka. Naveen managed to give cops the slip while the other three were arrested. Dinesh, the property dealer who helped Praveen, was also picked up. Senior police officers said they had written to the BSF and ITBP, informing them about the fraud allegedly orchestrated by the two officers. Revenue department officials have also been told about the plush properties that the accused had bought across NCR with the fraud money. Properties worth Rs 12 crore are under the scanner. The police have also questioned one of Praveen’s friends — a woman from Noida who works with a private firm. She was allegedly given a flat by Praveen. “We are trying to get more details from them about the cases,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan, who headed an SIT formed to probe the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/fake-contracts-itbp-officials-home-on-nsg-campus-raided/articleshow/88923804.cms||Bagish Jha

There was, however, a dip of 548 cases or 14% compared to Friday’s 3,897 cases as the city added 3,349 new Covid cases to its tally in the past 24 hours. Thee positivity rate fell to 25.6% on Saturday from 30% on Friday. The number of active cases is now 19,266, up from 17,539 the previous day while the number of patients admitted in hospitals has increased from 138 on Friday to 155 on Saturday. The city, meanwhile, reported one more Covid death — a 75-year-old man who had comorbidities like lung cancer, diabetes and hypertension. Health officials said he was admitted to a private hospital on January 11 due to his comorbidities and tested positive for Covid there.With this, five Covid deaths have been reported in the past five days — one on January 10, another on January 12 and two more on January 14. All had comorbidities, according to officials. A total of 932 people, of whom 616 had comorbidities, have died after testing positive since the beginning of the pandemic. “The current trend that we are seeing in most hospitalisations is that people are admitted to hospitals due to some other health conditions and test positive. We will conduct an audit to arrive at a conclusion,” said Virender Yadav, Gurgaon’s chief medical officer. Most Covid patients coming to hospitals at present have cough and sore throat, doctors said. “Any hospitalised patient in the second wave definitely had early pneumatic patches, which is missing this time. Now, we are mostly seeing patients with symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, like cough and scratchy throat. There are fewer patients in intensive care units and we have not witnessed very sick patients this time, which is a relief. Moreover, patients are also recovering early, getting better in two to three days,” said Dr Arunesh Kumar, head of department and senior consultant (pulmonology) at Paras Hospital.Haryana, meanwhile, reported 9,050 new cases and seven Covid deaths on Saturday. Besides one Covid death in Gurgaon, two were reported in Sonepat and one each in Ambala, Yamunanagar, Bhiwani and Kaithal.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: On way home, 3 brothers on a bike run over||GURUGRAM: Three brothers, who were returning home, after closing their shop near Sector 93, were allegedly hit by a speeding vehicle on Friday and died on the spot. The deceased have been identified as Sunil Pandit (24), Randhir alias Sanjay Pandit (28) and Sudhir Pandit (35). The incident took place near Sector 91, when the brothers were on a motorcycle and were heading home to Tajnagar village in Farrukhnagar. According to the police, the brothers owned two shops – a mobile repair and a utensil shop – in Hayatpur village near Sector 93. On Thursday, after closing the shop, like any other day, they got on a motorcycle to head home. Soon after, they were hit by an unidentified vehicle from behind and they fell on the road. The locals around the incident spot rushed them to a nearby hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival. The brothers hailed from Bihar’s Madhubani district and had settled in Gurgaon several years ago. Their uncle, Ashok Pandit, was the one to first receive the information about their deaths and rushed to the hospital in the night itself to identify their bodies. “I was shocked to hear about the incident and was asked to identify the bodies. Later, I went to the spot where the accident took place. This is a tragic incident. Their bodies have been sent to Bihar,” he said. It was 11 years ago that the brothers shifted to Gurgaon and opened the two shops. Soon after, the rest of their families also settled in the city one by one. The mobile repair shop was run by Sudhir and Randhir, where they provided services like money transfer and netbanking. Sunil sold utensils in the other shop that was a couple of metres away. Randhir had married just six months ago and that was when the brothers pooled in their money and built a new house in the village. “Everything is over now. There is nothing left for the family. They had brought this land six years ago and had built the house six months ago. They wanted to live a happy life in their own house,” said Dayanand Pandit, the deceased’s cousin brother. Sudhir Pandit, who was the eldest of the three brothers, was married and has two children. Sunil Pandit had recently joined the family business and was helping both the brothers. They had no other sibling. The police said that they are checking CCTV cameras to track down the accused. A case has been registered at Sector 93 police station under sections 279 (Rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of IPC. ‘“ll the three brothers died on the spot. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of hit and run. We are investigating the matter,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/on-way-home-3-brothers-on-a-bike-run-over/articleshow/88923807.cms||Sagrika Kissu

In November last year, Poornima Anand, a resident of Sector 53, registered a complaint related to her account on the bank customer care number. On November 12, she received a call from a person who identified as Rahul Sharma from the bank and asked her to download AnyDesk so he could probe the issue. During the call, he applied for a Rs 13.15 lakh loan from her account and transferred the amount to different online wallets. “I was unaware about the transactions and did not receive any notification from the bank,” Anand said. On November 25, she again received a call from a man identifying as Sujith, a bank representative. He also asked Anand to download AnyDesk and log in to her bank account. The fraudster withdrew around Rs 3 lakh from her account. A case has been filed at the cyber police station under IPC Section 420 (cheating) and Section 66D of the IT Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/woman-dials-customer-care-loses-16l/articleshow/88923808.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Couple forges account details for Rs 2.5 crore loan, booked||GURUGRAM: Police have booked a couple for allegedly cheating a private bank by fabricating their account statements with the bank to get a Rs 2.5 crore-home loan. They even did not register the flat for which they took the loan, police said. During an internal investigation, the bank found that it had no record of the transactions shown in the account statement submitted by the couple and that it was fake. After a complaint by the director of serious fraud investigation office (SFIO) under the ministry of corporate affairs, police have now booked Amit Tyagi and his wife Prinyanga Tyagi. According to police, the couple was sanctioned the loan from the Manesar branch of a private bank in April 2019 for purchasing a residential flat. The loan got sanctioned under a surrogate programme based on the average balance maintained by the couple in their account with the bank between April 2018 and March 2019, but the couple allegedly forged that document. In November 2020, the branch manager received an email from another person who said that the account statement submitted by the couple might not be genuine. “During an investigation, we found that the party, with a mala fide intention to gain eligibility for the loan, which got sanctioned under the surrogate programme, had submitted a fake and fabricated account statement, with bogus transactions,” said the bank in its complaint. With the property registration incomplete, the bank, officials said, also could not start taking back the loaned money through monthly instalments. The bank alerted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) about the fraud and a case got registered at the IMT Manesar police station under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forging document), 471 (using forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/couple-forges-a/c-details-for-2-5-crore-loan-booked/articleshow/88923809.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Noida||Balcony accidents in Noida bring railing’s height under safety lens||Noida: The death of a three-year-old boy after falling from a 10th-floor balcony of a flat in a Sector 75 housing society last November and similar fatal accidents that have happened elsewhere have brought the height of balcony railings in highrises under the microscope amid calls to review specifications with the safety of children in mind. On November 26, the three-year-old boy had possibly climbed on to the 2.5ft balcony railing after stepping on a stand for hanging clothes and slipped from there, landing face down on the road 10 floors below. In the society where it happened, a number of residents had questioned the height of the railings. Residents at several highrises have expressed similar concern, not just about the height of railings but also their design.While the National Building Code of 2016 specifies that parapet walls and handrails that are provided on the edge of terraces, balconies, verandas, etc. should not be less than 1 metre (3.28ft) high, the Noida Authority specifies a minimum height of 2.95 feet. Nothing prevents a developer from raising the height but decisions are based on design specifications and aesthetics.Neha Sharma, additional CEO at the Noida Authority, said she would ask for the specifications to be examined. “According to the National Building Code, the height of the parapet wall should be 1 metre. The Noida Authority bylaws state that the height of the balcony railing should at least be 0.9 metres,” she reiterated.Residents called for an immediate revision of the specifications. Yogendra Sharma, president of the Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Associations (FONRWA), said, “The fact that children manage to climb these railings is indeed a cause for concern. The authorities should take a serious look at these factors.”NP Singh, who heads the District Development Residents’ Welfare Association (DDRWA), echoed Sharma’s concern. “Earlier too, we had demanded that the height of balcony railings be raised in highrises. The designs also need a relook,” he said, adding that the gap between iron grilles at the railings should be reduced too.Some insisted that the Noida Authority should issue specifications on the design of railings and stairwells as well. Pushpa Girimaji, a consumer safety advocate and columnist, said, “The use of horizontal rods in railings and glass balconies, for instance, are issues that should be looked into. I think it is necessary to modify the bylaws, particularly in the wake of the accident that happened recently.”Apart from the death of the three-year-old boy, two other recent accidents that have brought the height and designs of railings and stairwells under scrutiny.In August last year, a one-year-old boy fell to his death while playing outside the main door of his flat on the 12th floor of a condominium in Noida Extension. The boy apparently slipped through the gap between two iron grilles of the stairwell. In October, two 13-year-olds — twins — died after falling from the 25th floor of a highrise in Ghaziabad. It was believed that the boys had peered over the balcony to see the moon.Sanjeev Dixit, a former president of the apartment owners’ association at Homes 121, said railings in balconies were designed keeping in mind the beauty of the façade, which often puts safety on the backseat. He said he had allowed his tenant to raise the height of the balcony railing as they had kids at home.“We let them do it. This is because railings are installed mostly for beautification purposes, not keeping in mind the safety of children. Some of the recent accidents are indeed a shock for families. The authorities need to understand that beatification should not take precedence over safety. If people living in a flat are not safe, what will you do with beautiful railings?” he asked.Developers said they were bound by the rules. Manoj Gaur, vice-president of Credai (North), said realtors in the city usually stick to a range of 0.9 to 1.2 metres for balcony railings. “Covering the railing is not allowed in the bylaws for ventilation, etc,” he added.But a section of developers agreed the bylaws needed a relook. “Such accidents are horrifying and the authorities must change the existing standard for balcony railings. The minimum heights of the National Building Code and the Noida Authority had been prescribed when low-rise buildings were usually constructed. This is not suitable for the kind of construction today,” said Deepak Kapoor, the promoter-director of Gulshan Homz.Kapoor also suggested that railings should not have horizontal bars as kids can step on them. “If only vertical bars are used, they are rather safe,” he added.Sewa Ram, an associate professor at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in New Delhi, cited international standards, which specify that the height of railings should be around 3.5-4ft.“The reality is that norms under the National Building Code and other bylaws have not been designed keeping the safety of children in mind. According to international specifications, the gap between grilles in the lower part of a railing should not be much so that small children cannot pass through them. This is generally followed in the US. Such things should also be kept in mind here,” he added.Told that builders often argued that covering a balcony would affect ventilation, Sewa Ram said the developers should then come up with designs that ensure safety.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/balcony-accidents-in-noida-bring-railings-height-under-safety-lens/articleshow/88923811.cms||Shikha Salaria

---||Noida||Noida: Engineering student bleeding from head injury made to write 3-hr test, college booked||NOIDA: A case has been lodged against a private engineering college for allegedly threatening a student to write an exam after he suffered a head injury on the campus, police said. The complaint, submitted by Indirapuram-resident Anurag Gupta, said his nephew Harsh Kumar is a B Tech student at IMS Engineering College and on January 12, he had reached the designated centre, an engineering college in Vijay Nagar, to appear in his seventh-semester exam where he was forced to write the three-hour paper despite requests. “The exam was scheduled at 2 pm. Around 1.45 pm, Harsh had gone to the washroom where a tile fell off the wall and hit his head, leaving him bleeding,” Gupta said. The complainant claimed that the college officials did not provide first-aid to the student. “Instead, the college management just placed a cotton pad on his head and told him to appear for the exam else he’ll fail in the subject. My nephew kept bleeding but was forced to write the exam. After the three hour exam, his friends rushed him to a hospital where he has got four stitches. It’s ruthless on the part of the college management to have done this. When we went to talk to them on the matter later, they behaved rudely with us,” Gupta told TOI. A case under IPC Sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life) has been registered against the engineering college at Vijay Nagar police station on Friday evening, police said, adding that an investigation was underway. While the college’s management did not respond to TOI’s queries, an official from the IMS Engineering College said the management was taking adequate action in the matter. “It is disheartening that the student was made to write the exam despite having a head injury. At present, it seems like he got scared after the management of the test centre told him that he will fail (in the paper) if he didn’t appear for the exam,” the official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/engg-student-bleeding-from-head-injury-made-to-write-3-hr-test-college-booked/articleshow/88923813.cms||Advitya Bahl

Talking to TOI, SP district president Bir Singh Yadav said, “Rajkumar Bhati got the party symbol for fighting polls on Friday evening. Sunil Chaudhary is getting the symbol too.”Bhati has played an active role in several farmer agitations. Chaudhary, meanwhile, had been taken into custody during the recent farmers’ agitation on abadi land outside the Noida Authority. Chaudhary told TOI that his campaign will focus on raising farmers’ issues, resolving the pending registries of homebuyers and improving Ganga water access. Chaudhary said getting Noida “freehold” status for land holdings in Noida, which are leasehold, was another poll plank of the SP. “Projects like the elevated road, metro, underpasses, etc were conceived during the Akhilesh Yadav government. Noida does not need a VVIP MLA, it does not need a “raja” but a “sewak.” If the public gives me a chance, we will try to ensure that the kacchi colonies get regularised,” he said, adding he would also pitch for RWAs being allowed to keep their own security personnel. “There is goondagardi (hooliganism) by some builders in Noida,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sp-finalises-faces-from-noida-and-dadri-list-likely-today/articleshow/88923817.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||India||ED attaches journalist Rajeev Sharma's assets worth Rs 48 lakh in espionage case||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has attached journalist Rajeev Sharma's properties in Delhi worth over Rs 48 lakh in a case related to spying for China and money laundering. It alleged that the amount was "proceeds of crime" received from Chinese intelligence agencies. Sharma was earlier booked by Delhi Police under the Officials Secrets Act. He has been charged by both Delhi Police and the ED. The ED claimed its own investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has revealed that the journalist had been actively working for Chinese spying agencies. "Investigation under PMLA revealed that Sharma had supplied confidential and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers in exchange for remuneration thereby compromising the security and national interests of the country," the ED claimed. The accused received his remuneration through a Delhi-based shell company that was run by Chinese nationals - Zhang Cheng alias Suraj, Zhang Lixia alias Usha and Qing Shi - along with a Nepali national Sher Singh alias Raj Bohara.  "This Chinese company was acting as a conduit for Chinese intelligence agencies to provide remuneration to persons like Sharma indulging in criminal activities. The remuneration was being paid in cash through carriers as well as through cash deposits," the ED said. It is alleged that Sharma used his friend's bank account to receive money in order to conceal his involvement. "Sharma also received remuneration in kind in the form of various paid foreign trips," the ED said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-attaches-journalists-assets-worth-rs-48-lakh-in-espionage-case/articleshow/88923819.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai inoculates only 16% of 15-17 year olds, Maharashtra 41% & Delhi 55%||MUMBAI: The response to Covid-19 vaccination among the city’s 15-17 year olds has been poor, with only 16% of the 9.2 lakh eligible children having taken the shot so far. The reason is reportedly the BMC’s use of only the nine jumbo Covid care hospitals instead of all the 400-odd vaccination centres. Unlike Mumbai, 90% of the 72,823 eligible children within Navi Mumbai municipal limits have taken the shot since the drive began on January 3. In the state, 41% of the 60.6 lakh eligible children had taken the vaccine till Saturday. In national capital Delhi, 5.5 lakh or almost 55% of the 10.1 lakh eligible teenagers have taken their first Covaxin shot. In sheer numbers, Pune (2.3 lakh) and Bengaluru (2.1 lakh) have fared better than Mumbai, which has vaccinated 1.5 lakh kids till Saturday. Teen drive in all BMC vax centres from tomorrowNagpur has vaccinated 1.2 lakh and Kolkata around 1.2 lakh in this age group. When contacted, BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the BMC will start offering vaccines to the paediatric age group in all the vaccination centres next week. "We will offer the vaccine even at small centres at the ward level so that children can go to the centre closest to their home to get the shot," she said. Children will have to take the second shot 28 days apart. Dr Gomare is confident that the coverage will "jump" within the next few days. "We only have to work out the timings," she said. "We may offer Covaxin which can be given to the 15-18 age group in the first half of the day and Covishield in the second half or vice versa," she said. This will be done to ensure that there is no mixup in giving the Covaxin vaccine to the children. A senior civic official said the BMC had followed the advice of the state task force members who had said that children should be given the vaccine in a controlled environment to avoid any untoward incident. "Clearly, the limited access resulted in poor uptake," said the official who didn't want to be identified. "Moreover, the import of someone fainting doesn't reduce whether it happens in a jumbo centre or a sub-centre," the official added. The BMC has also roped in NGOs such as Project Mumbai to carry out special drives in schools and colleges targeting children. The first such drive was held in St John's Universal School in Goregaon (West) on Saturday. The Navi Mumbai experience underlines how creating more centres helped cover the population faster. "We are carrying out the mega campaign in as many as 206 schools, including civic-run schools, across the city. So far, the drive witnessed encouraging response as children with parents queued up at the vaccination centres to be immunised with the first dose of vax," said an official. According to NMMC health department sources, as many as 65,498 youngsters (of 72,823) got themselves vaccinated till date.

Although the Omicron variant doesn't respond to monoclonal antibodies, there have been reports of the shot being prescribed to many Covid patients, especially those who are over 60 years of age and with comorbidities. As the monoclonal antibody shots cost over Rs 60,000, social activists have pointed out that its use for Omicron patients is a waste of financial resources. In this backdrop, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently approved the first screening kit, Omisure, an RT-PCR kit made in India, which can detect all the Omicron sublineages of BA1, BA2 and BA3. RT-PCR tests are considered the gold standard to detect Covid-19. "Such a screening test would enable doctors to make a quick clinical decision on whether the patient has Omicron or not and whether he or she needs monoclonal antibodies,'' said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular diagnostic laboratory of the BMC. “Kits such as Omisure can be the game-changer, allowing for quick and right diagnosis that will assist clinic assessment of the patient," said Dr Shastri. So far, laboratories used the SGTF screening kit to check for S gene deletion. If the S gene isn't found in the sample, the possibility of it being Omicron is high. However, many of the SGTF kits couldn’t detect BA2 and BA3 sublineages, thereby increasing the possibility of a false negative test result. Moreover, most of the SGTF kits were imported and not widely available in India. It is due to limited availability that the BMC, which had started SGTF screening at its laboratories in KEM and Kasturba Hospitals, stopped using it after the initial few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/newer-targeted-kits-could-help-catch-omicron-quicker/articleshow/88923828.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Mumbai Omicron curve similar to South Africa as cases have stabilised faster, unlike Europe, US’||MUMBAI: Given the quick rise and an equally quick “stabilisation” of cases in the ongoing Omicron-Covid wave, experts say the Mumbai curve is similar to the one in South African towns rather than the European and US experiences. “The outbreak in South Africa saw a sharp increase in the number of cases, but very few needed hospitalisation or oxygen support. Also, the drop in cases was sharp,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, state Covid task force member. “This is how the wave has behaved in Mumbai so far,” he said. The third wave was noticeable in Mumbai on December 21-22, 2021, the period when the daily caseload jumped from 312 to 480. The daily tally increased to 1,333 on December 28 and kept doubling every consecutive day, reaching 20,971 on January 7. The numbers have been falling since, fluctuating between 11,000 and 13,000 in the last week (with the exception of January 12 when 16,420 were registered). “The plateau is already noticeable in Mumbai,” said Dr Joshi. Unlike the Omicron peak, which took roughly three weeks, the second Delta wave took almost two months to peak and stabilise. The wave in the UK saw an exponential rise in late November and continues to date. In the US, the Omicron wave not only saw a huge rise in cases, but was accompanied by increased hospitalisation and deaths. “The US has a big anti-vax lobby and data analysis has shown that most of the hospitalised cases and fatalities are unvaccinated people,” said Dr Joshi. The number of children admitted to hospitals also increased sharply in the US in December 2021. There is another reason for Mumbai being different. A doctor from KEM Hospital said, “The US was in the midst of the Delta wave when the Omicron wave began, with the latter soon overtaking the former.’’ However, in Mumbai, the Delta wave had declined completely with the city registering less than 200 cases a day. Dr Joshi added Mumbai had high vaccination rates. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said that although Omicron is the dominant variant in circulation in Mumbai, there are still cases of Delta in the city. “Delta cases may have lung involvement and need medical attention, unlike Omicron.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-omicron-curve-similar-to-s-africa-as-cases-have-stabilised-faster-unlike-europe-us/articleshow/88923830.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Students must shell out up to Rs 65 lakh fees a year for PG medical at deemed universities||MUMBAI: A course in MD radio-diagnosis or dermatology can cost up to Rs 65 lakh annually at deemed universities in Maharashtra this year. For masters in orthopaedics and gynaecology, too, the tuition fee charged ranges from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 60 lakh. Even as the pool of seats in government colleges continues to shrink, private and deemed colleges remain unaffordable for several aspirants in the state, forcing them to take a drop year or to settle for less preferred choices in government colleges. At DY Patil University campus in Navi Mumbai, fees for most three-year MD or MS courses in clinical subjects range from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 65 lakh. At Karad’s Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, the annual fees for MD in radio-diagnosis and dermatology is Rs 38 lakh. Bhartiya Vidyapeeth’s Pune campus charges around Rs 35 lakh per annum for the two courses while most other courses are in the range of Rs 30 lakh. MGM and Pravara, Loni, charge around Rs 25-28 lakh for most clinical subjects (see box). The fees in most deemed colleges remain the highest for radio-diagnosis and dermatology though. “These two courses are sought after,” said Dr Zubin Driver, an aspirant. “But with higher fees in private and deemed colleges and not enough clinical exposure, students strive to secure good merit ranks. But now, even with good ranks they are forced to opt for courses (in government colleges) that are not their top preferences. A student whose rank is within top 75 in state is forced to opt for MD radio in a private Mumbai college,” he said. Even with higher fees, these deemed colleges fill up most of their seats, said a deemed medical college dean. “Seats in clinical subjects rarely go vacant. A few in pre-clinical (such as physiology and anatomy) or paraclinical subjects such as pharmacology and pathology may go vacant, but clinical subjects are all taken,” said the dean, adding some of these deemed colleges boast world-class infrastructure in skills and simulator labs. The fees in pre-clinical and para-clinical subjects are less than Rs 15 lakh in most colleges. Early this year, National Medical Commission (NMC) had issued broad draft guidelines for regulating fees in 50% MBBS and postgraduate seats in private and deemed medical colleges. The draft was issued to seek feedback from stakeholders, though there has been no development ever since. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said there are court cases pending in the matter too. “UGC and NMC both had initiated steps to regulate fees in deemed universities, but there has been no outcome till date. These universities started hiking fees after 2016, when a NEET-based centralised process came into practice. Only the super-rich can afford these fees,” she said, adding with Rs 65 lakh annual fees, total course fees touch Rs 2 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/students-must-shell-out-up-to-65l-fees-a-year-for-pg-medical-at-deemed-univs/articleshow/88923834.cms||Yogita Rao

Of the total 808 affiliated colleges, 81 have a director’s post. From the remaining 727, as many as 178 are operating without principals and for 23, the university does not have any record. Many of the colleges without principals are from the engineering, law and management faculties, according to the RTI report. As per university records obtained on December 28, 2021 by RTI activist Anil Galgali, KJ Somaiya College of Arts and Commerce, Ritambhara College, Vivekanand College of Law, SIES Institute of Technology, Advani College of Law, and Rizvi College are among the institutes which have in-charge principals. Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (Andheri), Burhani College (Byculla), NSS College of Education (Tardeo), N Dalmia Institute of Management Studies (Mira Road), and Dr Ambedkar College of Law (Wadala), are among the colleges to not have a principal. The information was provided by the Teacher Recognition Cell of the university. Galgali said it is the higher and technical education department’s moral responsibility to act against these colleges. He questioned the ministry’s move to approve new courses in colleges which are operating without principals. He demanded an inquiry. A university official said that after a recent government resolution, most colleges have started filling principals’ posts. While aided colleges require a government NOC for the appointment, unaided colleges must get advertisements inviting applications approved from the university. He said the process has started in many colleges and vacancies are likely to get filled soon. An official from the higher education department said the pandemic also delayed the appointment process in a few grant-in aid colleges. But few aided colleges are without principals right now, added the official. A government resolution was issued on November 12 asking all vacant principals' posts to be filled in non-government grant-in aid colleges before the start of the 2022-23 academic session.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/25-mu-affiliated-colleges-operating-without-principal/articleshow/88923836.cms||---

The police have sent a closure report to the court and classified it as ‘C Summary’, saying it found ‘no delay in registering the FIR’. It also said the complaint was due to misunderstanding. Police file a ‘C summary’ report in cases where it does not find criminality or if the allegation is found to be neither true nor false. The police conduct a probe and record statements of all people concerned with a case. Parents of a 13-year-old boy, who was sexually assaulted by a priest at a Catholic church in Shivaji Nagar in 2015, had lodged an FIR. The 56-year-old priest was convicted last month and awarded life sentence.The victim’s father had told a special court during trial that after they learnt of the incident, they had approached bishops and archbishop to take action but got no response and there was delay in filing an FIR. The special court judge asked the police to register an FIR and probe it. A second FIR at the same police station was registered. Four persons, about whom the family said had not taken action, were booked under the Pocso Act. “The victim’s father had filed a complaint against four, saying they did not respond to their complaint. The victim’s family tried to meet a bishop in Dadar and spoke to his secretary on phone. Later, they approached a Chembur priest who told them they would meet the archbishop. The archbishop assured inquiry, delegated an auxiliary bishop to supervise the hearing and left for Rome the same day,” said a police source. “The family came to the police station and an FIR was registered that day. There was a delay of four days from the time the family learnt of the incident.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Youth’s gigolo plan loses steam after Rs 1.5 lakh con||MUMBAI: The Matunga police on Friday arrested a 30-year-old New Delhi resident for allegedly cheating a 23-year-old man of Rs 1.53 lakh by luring him with a gigolo’s job. The accused, Rohitkumar Gowardhan, was nabbed from his New Delhi residence. The complainant, son of a policeman, who spotted an advertisement on the internet for ‘call boy’, found a number listed in the advertisement. He contacted the number and the call receiver briefed him about the job profile, saying he would have to entertain their company’s clients. “The person who answered the call told the cop’s son that the company would keep 20% and he would be given 80% of the fees they would get from their clients. The complainant was also given an identity card of the company through WhatsApp and the number of a female client,” said a police officer. The complainant called up on the number and a woman answered the call. “The woman client said that she would book a hotel room, arrange a special taxi, driver and other stuff required during their meeting. She asked the complainant to deposit Rs 32,000 in an account, saying she would refund it with his fees when they meet. The complainant transferred the money to the account number provided,” said the police officer. Later, when the woman did not respond, he called up the man who said that the deal was cancelled and provided the number of another female client. “The victim contacted the second client who repeated the same conditions and asked him to transfer 1.21 lakh to an account, saying it would be returned to him along with his fees. The complainant took money from his father and sent it to the account. However, after a couple of days there was no response. This is when he realised he had been duped and approached the police,” the officer added. An FIR was registered on December 22 against a man and two women for cheating and sections of IT act were also invoked. A police team led by PSI Rajabhau Garad, collected the bank account details where the complainant had transferred money, SIM card details and nabbed the accused from his residence in New Delhi. He was produced before a court on Saturday and has been remanded in police custody till January 20. The police are now getting information about the women, who spoke to the complainant, posing as clients. “She is married and had earlier worked with Gowardhan in a company. She was part of this crime,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/youths-gigolo-plan-loses-steam-after-1-5-lakh-con/articleshow/88923842.cms||Mateen Hafeez

When Singh was produced in court on Jan 14, cyber police informed the magistrate cops have to access and retrieve more social media accounts from the accused. “The accused have created multiple Twitter accounts with fake identities, out of which they have deactivated some of the accounts. Twitter even suspended the accounts for objectionable content. Bishnoi was in regular touch with the three on social media.

---||Mumbai||BJP accuses Iqbal Chahal & senior civic officials of ‘doing Wazegiri’ in BMC||MUMBAI: The BJP has accused municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, additional municipal commissioner P Velarasu and standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav of “doing Wazegiri”— in a reference to jailed police officer Sachin Waze—in the BMC. Waze had alleged he had been set a target of Rs 100 crore to be collected from bars and restaurants by the then home minister Anil Deshmukh. While both Chahal and Velarasu did not respond to TOI’s queries, Jadhav termed the BJP’s allegations as baseless. Addressing a press conference at the party’s state headquarters on Friday, MLA Ameet Satam, BJP group leader Prabhakhar Shinde in the BMC, councillor Vinod Mishra and spokesperson Bhalchandra Shirsat alleged that in the past 25 years, money to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore has been siphoned off and during the pandemic, there has been corruption in various tenders totalling Rs 3,000 crore. Satam accused Jadhav of laundering Rs 15 crore, a charge which was earlier made by the BJP’s Kirit Somaiya. He complained opposition members in the committee are not allowed to voice their objections or raise questions on a proposal. “Normally, three clear days are required to be given before a proposal is taken up for consideration in the standing committee. This is not being done,” he said. “It does not require intelligence to indulge in corruption but who is the handler needs to be investigated. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must answer the public regarding the BMC’s functioning. Every year, the standing committee approves tenders worth Rs 6,000 crore and in each of them there are irregularities and corruption,” said Satam. Even procurements for schoolchildren have not been spared, he said, adding, “When the budget for tabs is Rs 10 crore, why is the corporation spending Rs 38 crore without any qualitative checks?” Shinde alleged a Rs 3,000 crore scam during the pandemic, from procuring body bags to handing out Covid jumbo centre contracts to family members of corporators. “There is no account of the money spent on the jumbo centres—a case in point being the BKC and Dahisar centres,” he said, adding the file on procurement of monsoon medicines disappeared from mayor Kishori Pednekar’s office. “The BMC’s delay in finalising the proposal resulted in ordinary citizens having to visit private labs for tests,” he said. Shinde also alleged corruption in the desilting of Poisar river, saying the original estimate of Rs 540 crore doubled. Responding to the accusations, Jadhav said, “If the BJP now claims there has been corruption in the BMC for the last 25 years, then questions can be raised about them as well as they were in alliance with us for all these years. The BJP from day one has opposed standing committee meetings via video-conference even when Covid cases were at the peak. When physical meetings started, their members spoke for 1.5 hours of the two hours.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-accuses-chahal-senior-civic-officials-of-doing-wazegiri-in-bmc/articleshow/88923853.cms||---

The HC directed the complainant and one of the accused who wanted to end the matter amicably, to provide “community service in the nature of attending Shantidham Ashram at Gorai Road, Borivli every Sunday 10am to 2pm for two months.’’ They have to attend each consecutive Sunday. The bench of Justices P B Varale and Anil Kilor directed the head of Shantidham Ashram to allocate appropriate work services to the two in their institution, and give a completion certificate once they attend all Sundays and finish the tasks. If they fail to get the certificate, the FIR will stand restored. One man, an Andheri resident, was on his way to Thane on October 21, 2020 when his car hit another. The owner of the second car allegedly “started abusing”. Later, owner of the second car called six-seven persons, said the HC order. A scuffle took place. One of the persons at the scene carrying a helmet hit the owner of the first car with it. The person with the helmet had petitioned HC to quash the case against him. His counsel submitted the police report that refers to the injury that the first car owner suffered as an “abrasion’’. He submitted that “better sense has prevailed over the parties and they arrived at an amicable settlement.’’ The first car owner filed an affidavit in HC, stating he has no objection to the FIR being quashed against the accused. He said, “I do not have any complaints or grievances against the petitioner and other accused any more and the present complaint came to be registered due to miscommunication of information received.’’ He said the dispute is settled. The HC noted that the police was “unable to trace the identity of the other persons and could only trace three”, including the petitioner. HC said, “We find no purpose will be served by keeping the FIR alive, except burdening criminal courts.” It agreed with the petitioner’s counsel Gaurav Parkar and also Aishwarya Pawar, counsel for first car owner, that “continuation of criminal proceedings in the case will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands the dispute is put to an end and peace restored’’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/motorists-in-scuffle-make-peace-hc-asks-them-to-serve-at-ashram/articleshow/88923854.cms||Swati Deshpande

The approval of CMRS is mandatory before commencing commercial run of Metro networks. Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas confirmed, “I have signed then relevant documents that need to submitted before CRMS.” A senior official said, “The system is ready to begin the commercial run. We have completed all the work, barring some minor civil works at few stations.” The first phase spanning 20km is between Dahanukarwadi of Line 2A to Aarey of Line 7 (18 stations). Both these Metro lines are expected to reduce vehicular traffic by 25%. MMRDA had hoped to open these lines by October 2019. Later, this deadline was revised to December 2020. The pandemic in early 2020 led to a lockdown and due to labourers leaving for their native place work had come to a standstill. The commercial operations were later targeted to commence from October 2021 between Kamraj Nagar and Aarey via Dahisar on both the lines. The commissioning deadline for the entire stretch of lines 2A and 7 was earlier set on January 1, 2022. MMRDA plans to run services with 11 rakes at a frequency of 15 to 20 minutes initially. As and when rakes get added, the frequency will increase to five minutes per train.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/metro-2a-7-on-track-for-commercial-run-mmrda/articleshow/88923856.cms||Manthank Mehta

Khan alleged since the NIA has taken over probe into the case, prima facie, it appears to have weakened, hence the Congress had demanded that besides ATS officials, lawyers for the ATS, too, should remain present before the court. “We feel that all-out efforts are being made to tarnish the image of the MVA government as well as the ATS. Several accused have been granted relief but, so far, the NIA has not filed an appeal even in a single case. It was expected that the NIA will move the high court, but nothing is on the cards. We have brought all the key issues to the notice of both Thackeray and Walse Patil,’’ Khan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ats-officials-to-be-in-court-for-08-malegaon-blast-case-home-min/articleshow/88923857.cms||---

This was revealed by Anil Kumar Anand, described as the father of nuclear propulsion in India and ex-BARC, in an online talk show held in Mumbai on Saturday evening with Swapnesh Malhotra, former spokesperson of DAE. The interaction comes at a time when India’s third nuclear-powered submarine was silently launched at Vishakapatnam on November 23, 2021. Anand said the Indian Navy was particular that in the early phase of the design and development, the control of INS Arihant—India’s first nuclear-powered submarine commissioned in August 2016—should be with the Navy. But the DAE wanted it under its purview. “The matter was quickly settled by none other than Vishnu Bhagwat, who was the chief of naval staff and who said it should be under the DAE,’’ he said. Bhagwat headed the Indian Navy between 1996 and 1998.  He said post World War 2, there was a thought among several countries that if a nation possessed a submarine which could stay under water for a long time, it would win World War 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/in-1995-dae-and-navy-had-showdown-on-nuclear-sub/articleshow/88923859.cms||Srinivas Laxman

The civic body will have its own laboratory soon. The laboratory will have a capacity to conduct more than 5,000 RT-PCR tests daily. The municipal corporation has picked up its Koliwada health centre in Old Panvel to develop the laboratory and will spend around Rs 2 crore for the same, according to officials.Sources said that the set-up of the testing laboratory is expected to be be ready in the next eight to 10 days as the work order has been issued on Tuesday. At present, the civic body sends samples for testing to Alibaug and other places. So, the time taken to obtain the report is around five days, leading to a delay in commencing treatment in case a person is found to be infected with Covid. The need to save on time in getting the Covid test report is what has prompted the civic body to create its own laboratory.Amid the concern of the Omicron variant of Covid, the civic body has started preparation and the timely report will help isolate infected persons and prevent the spread of the virus.“We have opened the tenders today and the party which put the lowest bid has been awarded the contract. The agency has been told to get the lab activated at the earliest since the cases are on the rise,” said PCMC deputy municipal commissioner Sachin Pawar.Asked about ICMR approval, Pawar said that PCMC had sought approval from ICMR, which is expected anytime now. At present, the civic body has to wait for four to seven days to get the test report. Once the laboratory starts functioning, we will get the report within 24 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/panvel-civic-body-set-to-get-its-own-testing-lab/articleshow/88923862.cms||---

A total of 2,117 persons were accused/arrested in 2,060 fatal road accidents between 2019 and 2021, and of them 1,238 belonged to the 21-40 age group. Furthermore, youngsters aged between 21 and 30 were more involved compared to those aged between 31 and 40. According to the data, in 2019, as many as 840 persons were arrested or booked for their alleged role in 810 fatal road accidents. Of them, 276 accused drivers/riders were in the 21-30 age group while 210 were aged between 31 and 40. Thus, persons aged between 21 and 40 were accused in 58% of fatal crashes. In 2020, as many as 655 persons were accused of being involved in 632 fatal road accidents in the city. Of them, 219 drivers/riders were in the 21-30 age group, while 172 were aged between 31 and 40.

The prime accused, identified as budding lensman G Rohan, is the son of the engineer’s brother-in-law. Police have recovered 318 grams of gold and Rs 10 lakh cash from him. The remaining accused are M Puneet, a native of Mandya, Balakrishna N of Vidyaranyapura, Pruthvi T of Dasarahalli and Chetan Kumar of Yelahanka. All are in their early 20s. Police are looking for another suspect, who is still at large. Police records show that Pruthvi and Puneet were arrested by Subramanyanagar and Gangammanagudi police last year on the charge of stealing nine two-wheelers. Balakrishna is a rowdy-sheeter with Peenya police station and faces four attempt-to-murder cases as well as two dacoity-attempt cases. Chetan Kumar was arrested by Yelahanka police in a murder case in 2019. On December 31, four miscreants had barged into the residence of Samya Naik in Mahalakshmi Layout. Claiming to be police personnel from Tiptur station, they said they had come to arrest Naik and others in a robbery case. They threatened to shoot Naik and his son Manohar on the legs if they did not return the “stolen money” and unlicensed revolver. Naik was shocked by the false allegations and before he could react, the four men walked into the bedroom, took Rs 19 lakh cash (which was kept for leasing a house) and 500 grams of gold. Bundling Naik and Manohar into the former’s car, they roamed in and around Jalahalli before fleeing with the cash and gold. “We are seizing your cash and gold for the criminal offence,” they had said. Naik filed a police complaint the same night. As the investigation began, cops found that one of the suspects, Puneet, was a colleague-cum-roommate of Rohan. “Rohan, who hails from Chitradurga, came to the city in 2019 and worked as an assistant with a private photo studio in Mahalakshmi Layout. He lived in a small room above the same studio. Puneet joined the studio in 2019 and they became friends. Through Puneet, Rohan met the other accused and all five regularly partied in their room,” an officer said. Financial crisisThe lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 forced Rohan and Puneet into a financial crisis. During one of his regular visits to Naik’s house, Rohan found that Naik had kept Rs 19 lakh cash at home to lease a house. Saying he wanted to open a studio of his own, Rohan asked for a loan of Rs 10 lakh. However, Naik said he needed the money for personal reasons, including his children’s education. Angered by this, Rohan planned the robbery with his friends. All five have been produced before a court and handed over to judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/budding-lensman-others-arrested-for-robbing-duo/articleshow/88923876.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Repeated cases against Azim Premji land duo in jail||BENGALURU: Filing repeated cases over the same cause of action against infotech major Wipro Limited, its founder and chairman Azim Premji, and their group of companies turned out to be costly for two representatives of India Awake for Transparency Ltd, a Chennai-based ‘shell’ company. Karnataka high court has convicted R Subramanian and P Sadanand, holding both guilty under the Contempt of Courts Act. While Subramanian appeared as an advocate in all proceedings, Sadanand described himself as a volunteer of the company. Both are now sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for two months and also pay a fine of Rs 2,000 each. If they default, they have to undergo imprisonment of another month. “It is an undisputed fact that the accused filed repeated writ petitions, writ appeals etc., in the name of a non-existent company, ‘India Awake for Transparency’, without using the words ‘Private Limited’. It is nothing but a brazen suppression of identity and impersonation done only with a view to mislead this court,” a division bench noted in its order. The bench also pointed out that the Madras high court, in a judgment dated September 18, 2015, had specifically found that four shareholder-companies of India Awake for Transparency were established and controlled by Subramanian, who was termed the “directing mind” of the company. Continuous and long-drawn litigation at the instance of the two men invited criminal contempt, the court stated. A direction has now been issued to the registrar (judicial) to prepare a warrant for the duo’s detention. Furthermore, both have been restrained from initiating any legal proceedings against the complainants and their group of companies before any court, tribunal, authority or forum. Hasham Investment and Trading Company Limited, Wipro Limited, and its chairman Azim Premji had filed a petition seeking action under criminal contempt against the Chennai-based company and its representatives. On February 12, 2021, while dismissing a petition filed by India Awake for Transparency, the high court had imposed a hefty cost of Rs 10 lakh, deploring the petitioner’s conduct and likening it to forum shopping. The order was challenged and a division bench, on March 25, not only echoed the previous observations but also added that the company’s conduct amounted to criminal contempt. The crux of the allegations was that a large chunk of assets, belonging to Vidya Investment and Trading Company Pvt Ltd, Regal Investment and Trading Company Pvt Ltd, and Napean Trading and Investment Company Pvt Ltd, were illegally diverted through gifts/transfers to a private trust controlled by the Premji couple after the three companies were wound up. However, the Premji couple and their group of companies argued that the issue was settled by the ministry of corporate affairs and yet the company has been filing petition after petition seeking a multi-disciplinary probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/repeated-cases-against-premji-land-duo-in-jail/articleshow/88923877.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||A year on, Gujarat tops in Covid vaccination among major states, booster jabs||AHMEDABAD: Exactly a year ago on January 15, 12,320 healthcare workers got the first shot of Covid vaccine at 126 sites across Gujarat, starting off the drive to provide cover to nearly 5 crore Gujaratis. After 365 days, Gujarat has covered 97% of its eligible population of 4.93 crore with first and 95% with both doses. The state administered vaccines at an average of 2.6 lakh doses daily or 480 persons per minute (in vaccination hours of 9 am to 5 pm). "Gujarat is the first among states with over 5 crore population in fully vaccinated population. For every 1,000 eligible population, we have 950 persons who are fully vaccinated, which is much higher than the national average," said Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer. "About 60% of the 15-18 years age group is covered with the first dose, and about 50% of the population eligible for the booster dose is given the jab." According to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) figures, Gujarat tops in administering the booster doses among the Indian states. In absolute numbers, Gujarat stands 6th with 9.4 crore total vaccination doses after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar – all the states having more population than Gujarat. State health department officials said that special campaigns were initiated in the districts having less coverage of the vaccination in the past few months. Night camps were organized in some areas, whereas in some districts door-to-door vaccination was carried out, they added. Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist, said that there is a definite difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients. "We have seen less severity and mortality among the patients who have taken the vaccination doses. We see the rise in overall cases in the past few days, but we are getting protection due to high vaccination percentage," he said, adding that all those eligible for booster dose should also go for it. Meanwhile, Gujarat on Saturday recorded 9,177 new positive cases, the lowest in the past three days. On the other hand, the mortality among the active patients shot up with deaths of seven patients – two each in Ahmedabad and Surat cities, and one each in Surat, Navsari and Rajkot districts. The active cases stood at 59,564 out of which 60 were on ventilators. On Friday, the state had crossed 9 lakh total cases - the last 1 lakh recorded in 230 days. It had taken 18 days for the cases to go from 7 lakh to 8 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/a-yr-on-guj-tops-in-vaccination-among-major-states-booster-jabs/articleshow/88923878.cms||Parth Shastri

Spread over 100 acres and 32 guntas, the land is situated at Kurbarahalli village, Kasaba hobli, Mysuru taluk. On May 26, 2015, the deputy commissioner of Mysuru passed an order holding that the lands on which the petitioner was claiming right and interest were originally ‘B-kharab’ (government lands reserved for public purpose). Accordingly, consequential directions were issued to the tahsildar to cancel the kathas i.e., mutation entries standing in the name of the petitioner. Indrakshi Devi challenged the order through her two power of attorney holders, claiming that the land was part of 1,563 acres acquired by the then Maharaja of Mysuru and retained along with other properties, as can be seen on the list of properties filed by the then Maharaja and the Union government and the Government of Mysore in connection with the accession treaty of 1950. The petitioners further claimed they were neither heard nor given an opportunity to present their case — a gross violation of the principles of natural justice. Senior advocate GS Kannur, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, argued that on June 19, 2020, a coordination bench of the high court had already quashed the deputy commissioner’s order in respect to other properties. He added that the state government has been unsuccessful even though the matter was taken to the Supreme Court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/restore-land-entries-in-favour-of-wadiyar-family-member-revenue-officials-told/articleshow/88923880.cms||---

In the past fortnight, there have been 83 deaths. Between January 8 and 14, there were 49 deaths, compared to 27 between January 1 and 7. On Saturday, the state reported seven fatalities. Most of these deaths, 48 (nearly 58%) were from Bengaluru, including two at home. According to health department authorities, most victims either had comorbidities or had serious health issues, and Covid positivity is only incidental in these cases. KV Trilok Chandra, special commissioner, BBMP, said with regard to two men aged 34 and 37 years who died recently in Bengaluru, Covid was incidental. “They both suffered from chronic kidney disease. While one was partially vaccinated, the other was not vaccinated at all,” he said. Besides, some patients with severe diseases have delayed seeking admission. “Though the overall number of such cases has reduced, in some cases, admission data suggests they came late. We need to see the details of each case” he added. One young victim was a 29-year-old woman from Mysuru who died on January 14, after two days of admission to a private hospital. She was suffering from chronic kidney disease and she had also tested positive for Covid, said Dr BH Prasad, district health officer, Mysuru. After Bengaluru, the highest number of cases has been reported from Mysuru, which currently has over 3,000 active cases. On Friday, the state witnessed the death of a 6-year-old girl from Mysuru. She suffered from pyogenic meningitis or brain fever along with Covid pneumonia. She had also suffered from septic shock. Experts said some people are ignoring worsening symptoms. “It’s a misnomer that everyone is infected with Omicron and has mild infections. Dropping oxygen saturation level and breathlessness should not be ignored. Even two years into the pandemic, we’re seeing patients ignoring crucial signs of worsening,” said a member of the Covid technical expert committee. According to Dr Anoop Amarnath, geriatrician, member of Critical Care Support Team for Covid management in the state government, there’s usually a lag between increase in test positivity rate and increase in mortality rate and that seems to be happening now. “The Delta variant has not gone away and its clinical features are still being seen on the ground,” says Dr Amarnath. He added that some patients suffered from a severe cytokine storm or hyperactive immune response. Dr Amarnath said a 90-year-old man who recently succumbed to Covid in Bengaluru, had suffered from a cytokine storm. “The majority of cases continue to improve within the first 4-5 days in keeping with Omicron strain features. However, we should not think that every case is Omicron. Objective assessment rather than presumptive assessment is needed. Fever not reduced with paracetamol, and oxygen saturation level falling below 94% must be seen as warning signs and such patients must seek admission at the earliest,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/83-deaths-over-15-days-in-ktaka/articleshow/88926310.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Mangaluru||Increase in cases, fear prompt Covid-19 patients to seek monoclonal antibodies||BENGALURU: With the third wave of the pandemic triggering fear and uncertainty looming large over the new variant, the rich and affluent in the tech capital are desperately seeking the expensive monoclonal antibodies cocktail, despite it being non-effective against the Omicron variant. The drug which costs Rs 1.2 lakh for two doses, one each to be used on two different patients, has been the most sought-after. Some patients in home isolation too have been accessing the drug, which experts say, is not the best thing to do. A monoclonal antibody cocktail contains two drugs — Casirivimab and Imdevimab. The drug offers hope to comorbid patients who have mild infection but are vulnerable to developing complications. Antibodies are proteins generated by the body’s immune system to fight disease. Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that mimic this response. In the second wave, the cocktail was used for many patients, preventing severe forms of disease among many and reducing hospital stay. According to Dr Ravindra Mehta, chief of pulmonology at Apollo Specialty hospitals, monoclonal antibodies have been in demand among the middle class and upper middle class families. “But in typical Omicron cases, it’s of no use. About 90% of the patients, including some medical professionals themselves, ask us for this. However, we explain to them to wait for three days and see if the symptoms subside,” said Dr Mehta. The symptoms of Omicron have been sore throat, running nose and fever that will settle down in 3-4 days. “The monoclonal antibodies are redundant for Omicron. But it was the single medicine that had the maximum benefit for those infected with Delta variants. The pandemic is very dynamic and what was required yesterday, might become redundant later. But the public is not updated much and asks for monoclonal antibodies out of sheer fear,” he said. Of 90% of the patients who ask for it, 10% would get it. “Even if we don’t give it, patients access it elsewhere and many have been taking it,” said Dr Mehta. In the UK and the US, the usage of monoclonal antibodies for Omicron infections has been stopped, said Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, senior consultant, director in pulmonary diseases, Fortis Hospital. “We use monoclonal antibodies for very selective patients, who are at very high risk and on immunosuppressant medicines. We don’t know whether the cases are Omicron or Delta as the genomic sequencing takes 10 days. The S gene target failure tests are also not yet available to figure out who is suffering from Delta and not Omicron,” said Dr Padegal. At MS Ramaiah hospital, where there are 52 admissions, only one person has been given monoclonal antibodies. “Most of our patients are government-referred cases and there is not much demand for the medicine in our hospital. But it is likely to increase as the cases spike. However, we do not administer the drug, unless it is specifically indicated by the clinicians. It’s suggested for patients who are immunocompromised, unvaccinated and at high risk,” said Dr Gurudev of the hospital. The trend is seen in Chennai too, which has been reporting a high number of Covid cases. Dr V Ramasubramanian, infectious diseases specialist, Apollo Hospital, Chennai, said in one case, the patient’s family bought monoclonal antibodies to be administered. “We need to be watchful of the Covid cases, as the symptoms would reduce in 3-4 days if the infection is caused by the Omicron variant. It can be effective in the case of infection by Delta variant and not Omicron. Clinical decisions must be left to the doctors and the families should not take decisions on their own,” he said. However, Dr Mehta said it has so far been a safe drug and can be used when required, but not for all. Sotromivab against OmicronDoctors said the new drug Sotromivab, developed by Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline, has been found to be effective against Omicron and is being used in the UK and the US. “The drug is said to be effective but is yet to be available in India,” said Dr Padegal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/increase-in-cases-fear-prompt-covid-19-patients-to-seek-monoclonal-antibodies/articleshow/88926298.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Kannada film stars turn polyglots to connect with a wider audience||BENGALURU: Every new movie with a regional star is now a potential pan-India film. Films starring top heroes made in Tamil, Telugu or Kannada are invariably dubbed into the other two languages as well as Malayalam and Hindi. While dubbing has reached a high level of professionalism, Kannada stars and directors are finding it necessary to learn the basics of other languages to promote their movies. Tamil and Telugu are becoming necessary for actors from Sandalwood looking to expand their markets outside Karnataka. Actor Duniya Vijay, who debuted as a director with the recent hit Salaga, left no stone unturned to promote his film to the Tamil audience, interacting with them in Tamil. “The Kannada version did well in Tamil Nadu's border areas with Karnataka. I promoted the film there. Now, I’m doing a film in Telugu with Baalayya (Nandamuri Balakrishna). I have to speak that language; it’s inevitable. It’s like our education system. Earlier, we had various state syllabi in every state. Now, most schools have central syllabus by CBSE and ICSE. We need to move with the times. My future films in Kannada will have to be made keeping in mind audience of all states. The same goes for actors everywhere. They will learn the languages required.” Many Kannada actors draw inspiration from Telugu star Junior NTR, who connects with his Karnataka fans by speaking, singing and even delivering a commentary in Kannada. As Telugu, Tamil and Hindi film-makers arrive in Bengaluru to promote their films, Kannada film-makers too are taking their movies elsewhere. They find it necessary to market their films using the language of audience there. Actor Ninasam Sathish made his Tamil debut with the yet-to-be-released Pagaivanuku Arulvai. He terms this trend a “cultural exchange”. He said: “I’m known in other film industries because of Lucia which transcended regional identity. Now, every film has to be made for a wider and, if possible, universal audience. Learning other languages has become inevitable. I learnt enough Tamil to promote my movie.” Director S Krishna, who made Pailwaan with Sudeep in five languages, feels the effort to speak in other languages is needed. “When you market films outside their native markets, it helps to speak a few lines in those languages. It helps to soften the outsider tag a bit. It should be a dedicated effort. Nobody expects you to speak like a native in press meets, but you need to give the language its due respect.” Director Tharun Sudhir says the need to speak other languages is being felt. “When Yash, gave interviews in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi, it connected with audience there. They said he was making the effort to reach them,” he said. Kannada actors aren't new to the Tamil industry. Over the decades, many made their mark, even lasting, careers there. The list is long — from Rajinikanth, Kokila Mohan in the ’70s and ’80s to Arjun Sarja and Murali in the ’80s and ’90s to Prakash Raj and Kishore, more recently. In Telugu, Sudeep and Upendra are well known. The Telugu film industry picked only female actors from Kannada, including Soundarya, Anushka Shetty and Rashmika Mandanna. Only recently, there is an effort to cast actors like Dhananjaya, Duniya Vijay and others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/kannada-film-stars-turn-polyglotsto-connect-with-a-wider-audience/articleshow/88923884.cms||Shyam Prasad S
---||Bengaluru||Four years on, only 30% of Namma Metro work on Bannerghatta Road over||BENGALURU: It’s been more than four years since Namma Metro work commenced on Bannerghatta Road but residents and regular commuters complain there’s been little progress. STOI found discrepancies in the progress of civil work. BMRCL’s March 2021 newsletter claimed that 37% of civil work was completed on the 7.5km Dairy Circle – Kalena Agrahara section (Pink Line). While it’s November 2021 newsletter stated that 39% of the section was over, the latest (December 2021) now says only 30% work is done. In September 2017, BMRCL awarded a Rs 579-crore contract to Kolkata-based Simplex Infrastructures for the Bannerghatta Road work. However, BMRCL terminated it in January 2021 due to poor progress. In August 2021, BMRCL awarded the pending work contract to Udaipur-based GR Infra Projects Ltd (GRIL) at a cost of Rs 365 crore. Sources said GRIL had no prior experience in Metro projects so there was a delay in mobilising manpower and machinery. Last month, GRIL launched the first precast segment near Arekere. “This corridor is part of Phase 2 project approved in 2014 but tender floated in 2017. Simplex should have completed it by 2019 but failed to deliver. Motorists using this road have been struggling for more than four years,” said Ram Kumar, a commuter. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “There was some delay after many migrant workers returned to their home towns during the festive season but now work has picked up pace. The entire Pink Line will be ready by 2024.” The section has five stations on Bannerghatta Road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/four-years-on-only-30-of-metro-work-on-bannerghatta-road-over/articleshow/88923885.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Only emergency non-Covid treatment procedures will continue and not regular OPDs and elective surgeries. “Those with mild illness which require outpatient or follow-up care should not visit hospitals for the next two weeks or till further orders,” reads the notification.  However, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association president Dr HM Prasanna said: “Non-Covid work has to go on. What is important is maintaining Covid appropriate behaviour.” PHANA will take up this issue with the government. Some questioned the move on social media. Who decides what’s mild, follow-up, sick cases? What’s the scientific base for such decisions?,” wrote Dr Srinivasa Kakkilaya from Mangaluru. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/visit-hospitals-only-for-emergencies/articleshow/88923886.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Traders excited about Commercial Street’s new look||BENGALURU: Having lost several peak business seasons, traders on Commercial Street now see a ray of hope. Reason: The road redevelopment work undertaken by Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BenSCL) is almost over after nearly two years. With the road all set to formally be thrown open in the coming week, business establishments are optimistic of seeing shopper numbers increase in the coming months. “Despite the Smart City project being one of the pet projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, civic authorities took a long time to complete the 550metre stretch, work on which commenced in May 2020 and was supposed to be over within 90 days. But it’s good that it is finally over now,” an apparel store owner on the street told STOI. Mayank R, secretary of Bangalore Commercial Association, said, “We have been struggling for nearly two years, not just with civil work but also the pandemic. Businesses on Commercial Street were affected by a huge margin. We traders are now leaving all that behind us as are hopeful that business will pick up after how the street has turned out. We hope to see the old charm of the street.” ‘Work to be over by tomorrow’On Saturday, Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary, urban development department, and BenSCL MD Rajendra Cholan visited the street to inspect the work. Work like placement of dustbins and sewage connections to the buildings will be completed by Monday, said Cholan. “The weekend curfew will allow us time to clean up the street a little before our shoppers see its revamped version for the first time,” Mayank added. The traders pointed out that they understand the ground-level challenges BenSCL faced during the entire length of this project as the street has always been busy. “Initially, we were told that they will finish the work in 90 days, but only when they dug it up did they understood the issues pertaining to the soil or utilities. So the delay was mostly due to operational or technical challenges; it was never a matter of willingly delaying the project,” said Sanjay Motwani, president, Bangalore Commercial Association. Traders say they can’t wait for citizens to walk into Commercial Street and see how beautiful it looks after the redevelopment. “For a very long time, shoppers have found it difficult to walk on Commercial Street. While the pavement work was being carried out, they had to enters shops through plywood planks. The work completion has not only brought a great sense of relief to traders but also frequent visitors,” said Anand Dadu, a member of Bangalore Commercial Association. BenSCL said it has addressed the issue of stormwater drain, which led to waterlogging in July. Sanjay further said, “Despite the several hurdles the traders and the project have faced, we are delighted with how the street looks. We have LED streetlights on both the sides of the road and broad and even pavements for shoppers. This revamp was something that Commercial Street needed as no civil work has been done here in 75 years or more.” Cholan said, “The contractor will be in-charge of maintenance of the street for the next five years, after which it will be handed over to BBMP for upkeep.” On the delay in completing the project, he said, “There was a delay from the BenSCL end due to several challenges at the ground level. There are close to 750 properties and we had to understand the connection to each. For instance, sewage connections in some places were absent and in some places were behind the building.”  BenSCL is also working on a parking facility behind the Commercial Street police station, which may be able to accommodate 50 to 100 cars. Traffic will be allowed on the street from Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/traders-excited-about-comm-streets-new-look/articleshow/88923887.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||WFH new normal for Karnataka ministers, bureaucrats as they keep wheels of governance rolling||BENGALURU: The otherwise busy Vidhana Soudha and Vikasa Soudha, the corridors of power, wear an almost deserted look these days. Reason: Several ministers and bureaucrats are working from home. They opted for digital conferencing after many of their colleagues were infected with Covid. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai was the first to start work from home after he tested positive on Thursday. Since then, Bommai has held over half-a-dozen meetings at his residence, including a “free-wheeling” discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 situation. “All engagements of the CM are presently from home. Most of his personal staff too have been infected. But still all work is happening with the help of technology and necessary instructions are passed on the phone,” an official said. Till a few weeks ago, the CM used to have hundreds of people visiting his office and home in RT Nagar. “But he has started discouraging people from coming in the last few weeks. Instead, we started collecting their requests first at the gate and then over the phone,” said his personal staffer. Revenue minister R Ashoka, education minister BC Nagesh, law and parliamentary affairs minister J Madhuswamy and energy minister V Sunil Kumar have also tested positive. Most of the ministers have quarantined themselves in their homes as they have come in contact with Bommai and other ministers during the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. P Ravi Kumar, chief secretary and ISN Prasad, additional chief secretary, finance, are among senior officials who have adapted to the work-from-home routine. After the third wave started peaking in the state, most ministries and officials have also started working with reduced staff strength. “Only the additional chief secretary and principal secretaries come to the office for a few hours when the minister arrives to conduct meetings. Otherwise, it is all through audio or video calls,” said a department of personnel and administrative reforms (DPAR). The health department is working almost 24/7. Yet, only about 20% of the staff is still working from their office. Health minister K Sudhakar, who got isolated after Bommai tested positive, is conducting most meetings through video conferences and calling officials over phone to get updates. “We have streamlined our work in such a way that face-to-face interaction is minimal,” said a senior official. Madhuswamy and Nagesh also had virtual meetings with officials from home. Top secretaries said they're meeting only one or two persons at a time and that too, when it cannot be avoided. Officials from the environment and industries departments said they are looking at cases where clearances need to be expedited from home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wfh-new-normal-for-mins-bureaucrats-as-they-keep-wheels-of-governance-rolling/articleshow/88923888.cms||Manu Aiyappa

The two Bengaluru-based referees cleared the written examination for category two upgrade in Gwalior on January 11, 2022, the AIFF said in a letter to the Karnataka State Football Association. “I was surprised when I got the call from our referees committee chairman Bala sir,” an elated Harsha told STOI. An MBA who works for an MNC, the 23-year-old said she would work hard to earn the FIFA colours. “There are only four women in India — two referees and two assistant referees — who have got the FIFA badge. I have to put in my best efforts to get to that level,” said Harsha who has been selected as a liaison officer for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup in Mumbai. A product of New Bishop Cotton Public School, Singasandra, SFS College, Hebbagodi and St Joseph’s Evening College, Harsha also excelled as a player turning out for SFS College and Kickstart FC in the BDFA leagues. Pooja, 24, who is one year senior to Harsha at SFS college, was overjoyed by the news. “I knew I would clear the test. I’m very happy,” the former state player said. A physical education teacher at the Orchid’s International School in Horamavu, Pooja’s family hails from Nepal. “I was born and brought up in Bengaluru and studied at BES school, Hebbagodi. I want to officiate in more matches at the national level but my aim is to secure a FIFA badge.” Into her fifth year as a referee, Pooja is keen to inspire more girls to focus on football. “I’m the first from my family to get into sports and I’m determined to do more.”Among men, Thobias Mervin and Bhagavat Sunder qualified as national referees and Abhilash M Suresh as assistant referee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/2-women-refs-get-natl-badge/articleshow/88923889.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Mekedatu padayatra: Some hits for DK Shivakumar, many misses for Congress||BENGALURU: Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president DK Shivakumar’s dream to script history by walking 168km as part of the 11-day Mekedatu padayatra in the run-up to the 2023 assembly polls abruptly ended on the fifth day under pressure from various quarters. Many political experts, however, feel the four-day event has been a mixed bag for Shivakumar but offered zero political dividend for the Congress. Apart from being a mass contact programme, the curtailed padayatra helped Shivakumar re-establish himself politically and revive his tainted image as he remained in the limelight throughout. On the inaugural day, Shivakumar also impressed the workers with his organisational abilities and planning. The event helped him, to an extent, fix the gaps among the party functionaries who were looking to scuttle his dream of becoming chief minister. Senior functionaries believe Shivakumar scored brownie points tactically, despite the event being cut short. “This strategy will hit two birds with one stone. One, it will help him emerge as Vokkaliga leader and weaken the political base of the JD(S). Secondly, it has strengthened his chances of becoming chief minister if the party returns to power,’’ one of them said. But many within the party and outside believe it may not benefit Congress as expected since the event was conducted with utter disregard to public health. Shivakumar faced a lot of flak on social media for stating that there was no Covid-19 in the state and it was all manipulated by the BJP government even as the world was fighting the third wave of the pandemic. He was also trolled for refusing a Covid test and reprimanding health officials, besides undertaking the walk with total disdain to norms, accompanied by thousands of people. Many of them were not wearing masks or following social distancing. “Ultimately, politics is a game of perception. From having enthused and galvanised the party cadre by giving it hope of, for once, setting the agenda with the padayatra, the Congress did not capitalise on it because of the bad timing of the walk for water and lost its battle of optics,” said political analyst Sandeep Shastri. Some BJP leaders said the padayatra was held to help Shivakumar consolidate his base in Ramanagara. “Since he was raided by the income tax department, he faced several setbacks and his image had hit a low.” Ramanagara district minister CN Ashwath Narayan said the padayatra was nothing more than a political showdown within the Congress ranks to inflate Shivakumar’s political capital and deflate Siddaramaiah’s image ahead of the 2023 polls. However, Shivakumar’s brother and Bengaluru rural MP DK Suresh said the padayatra has helped the party connect with people and expose the BJP’s lack of commitment in ensuring drinking water for people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mekedatu-padayatra-some-hits-for-shivakumar-many-misses-for-cong/articleshow/88923890.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

---||Bengaluru||No clarity yet on bill to free temples from govt control||Bengaluru: The surge in Covid cases may delay the drafting of a proposed bill to free Hindu temples and religious institutions from government control.Though chief minister Basavaraj Bommai recently announced that the bill would be introduced in the next session of the legislature, the muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) department and the law department say they haven’t been consulted yet on this.Muzrai commissioner Rohini Sindhuri Dasari said: “We have not got any directions from the chief minister’s office yet. And there is no clarity on what the plan is.”It is said that muzrai minister Shashikala Jolle had met Bommai soon after he announced the plan, but there hasn’t been any discussion thereafter. “It’s just an idea at this stage and there has been no discussion on the issue,” said law minister JC Madhuswamy.The CM’s announcement at last month’s BJP state executive committee meeting is claimed to be a diversionary tactic since the government was under attack over the bitcoin scam and 40% kickback allegations in awarding tenders.“Whether it was influenced by a section of the leadership or was of his own accord, the statement came out of nowhere. Whether it is possible is something we are yet to understand,” said a BJP functionary.But government sources suggest that any decision to remove state control on the 35,000-odd temples in Karnataka would also mean a loss of Rs 650 crore annually to the state exchequer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-clarity-yet-on-bill-to-free-temples-from-govt-control/articleshow/88923892.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: DKS-Siddaramaiah bonhomie revives hopes of unity in Congress||BENGALURU: The bonhomie between KPCC chief DK Shivakumar and CLP leader Siddaramaiah during the Mekedatu padayatra has apparently boosted the morale of Congress cadre ahead of next year’s assembly polls. However, party seniors are sceptical about how long it will last since the two camps are at loggerheads over the chief ministerial candidate. “A highlight of the padayatra was the picture of unity presented by the two leaders. It sent a positive message amid speculation of a rift. But it should continue even as healthy competition is welcome,” said VR Sudarshan, former chairman of legislative council and co-chairman, KPCC media cell. Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah stood united all four days before the padayatra was suspended. Siddaramaiah even appeared to allow Shivakumar to be at centre stage as the event was the latter’s brainchild. However, fault lines were evident during the march as Siddaramaiah’s supporters raised slogans that he is the chief ministerial candidate in 2023, much to the discomfiture of Shivakumar’s camp members. “The camps should understand that it’s too early to think about a chief ministerial candidate. While it is our party’s policy that no one is named chief ministerial candidate, it is time for us to build on the positive vibes created by the padayatra and win the elections,” said Congress MLC BK Hariprasad. Senior Congress functionaries like BL Shankar are advocating a collective leadership that includes equal representation to all regions and communities. “The party needs social engineering that ensures inclusion of regions and communities. It is better if Mallikarjun Kharge (Kalyana Karnataka, Dalit), BM Patil (Lingayat, Kittur Karnataka), DK Shivakumar (Vokkaliga, south Karnataka), Siddaramaiah (backward classes, Mysuru region) and someone from the coastal region are seen at the forefront,” said Shankar. Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah accept the importance of unity. “I once joined hands with HD Kumaraswamy, who is seen as my arch rival. Siddaramaiah is our party leader and there is no problem for us to be united with him,” said Shivakumar. Siddaramaiah said: “Nobody, including our well-wishers, should create confusion by talking about the chief ministerial candidate. There is no difference of opinion here.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dks-siddaramaiah-bonhomie-revives-hopes-of-unity-in-party/articleshow/88923893.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: AIADMK calls for war on ‘corrupt, dynastic’ DMK rule||CHENNAI: Charging the arch-rival DMK with making false poll promises and indulging in election campaign like “corporate advertising,” the AIADMK leadership on Saturday called upon its cadres to get ready for a war against the “incompetent, corrupt, deceitful and selfish family rule of the DMK government” that came to power by a thin margin of a few lakh votes. On the sidelines of late chief minister M G Ramachandran’s 105th birth anniversary celebrations on Monday, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami, in a statement, said, “Our message and request to the partymen is that Puratchi Thalaivar’s (MGR) birthday is the day we have to take a pledge to bring back the golden rule of Ponmana Chemmal Puratchi Thalaivar and Ithaya Deivam Puratchi Thalaivi Amma”. The leaders said that partymen should act with the courage and wisdom of Jayalalithaa and follow the path shown by MGR. Born in a poor family in Kandy in Sri Lanka in 1917, MGR landed in India as a refugee. The AIADMK leadership hailed the charitable and philanthropic activities of the party founder and said there was none equivalent to him, who had donated a fortune earned through talent and hard work to the poor and differently abled. “He never lived for himself,” the leaders said, also glorifying the party founder’s contributions to cinema, which took him to the pinnacle of fame. MGR Founded AIADMK in 1972, after protesting the “anarchy of the evil forces” and captured power in 1977 and then ruled the state until his death in 1987. MGR worked for the welfare of the poor and introduced the world-renowned nutritious meal scheme. He reformed Tamil scripts, removed caste surnames, abolished British-era feudal administrative set up in rural areas and ensured reservation for the oppressed sections. MGR implemented innovative schemes that would remain alive for several hundred years even though he ruled the state for only a decade, the leaders said. “MGR’s birthday is a golden day in the history of the Tamil community," they said. In a statement, ousted AIADMK leader V K Sasikala said that everyone should understand that merger of the AIADMK was imperative to restore the AIADMK rule in the state.  “The reason for the party’s massive growth is its grassroots cadres, which is why MGR emphasized in the party bylaw that cadres should elect the leader. He said a leadership liked by the cadres alone could steer the party and that the general secretary should be elected by them,” she said, adding that all should take pledge to bring back the golden rule of MGR by coming together with good heart, and without forgetting to show gratitude.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/aiadmk-calls-for-war-on-corrupt-dynastic-dmk-rule/articleshow/88923895.cms||---

I started playing badminton at eight,” the Olympic Champion, three-time World Champion, five-time European Champion, and former world number 1 badminton player told her audience at the virtual spotlight event on January 15, the closing day of IIT Madras’ Shaastra 2022, the engineering institute’s annual tech festival.“You never know the future and whether you are making the right decision. But when I turned 14, I decided to move to Madrid and give badminton my all,” said the current world number 4.Her coach Fernando Rivas, the other speaker at the virtual Q&A session, said that what caught his attention about Marin’s style of playing was her complete control over the tempo of the match, her speed, and her attacking style. “She was just 13 and this was a level of skill I had not seen before at the national level. I knew I could help turn her into a world-class player.”Although badminton was not a popular sport in Spain, Marin’s wins helped turn it into one. “Now, it’s played in parks all over the country. And you have excellent training facilities,” said Rivas.“It was a dream come true for me when my hometown decided to name a stadium after me,” said Marin.Rivas added that technology plays an important part in sport. “We have to analyse data on opponents’ style of playing, as well as our players to make use of anything that can give us an edge on the world arena. We are living in an era of data. Having the technology to gather and interpret data can make all the inference on the playing field.”Shaastra 2022 partnered with The Times of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/olympian-carolina-marin-shares-story-of-her-journey-at-shaastra-annual-festival/articleshow/88923897.cms||---

Job offers have increased from 1,100 last year to 1,700 this year, which is the highest in the past four years. With more demand for software engineers, IT product companies and fintech companies like Wells Fargo, Citi, Walmart labs, Societe Generale have doubled their offers compared to what they offered last year. Virtual hiring also contributed to the number of jobs offered this year as the university was able to schedule multiple interviews with several companies at the same time. "As many as 142 companies have visited the campus this year and made around 1,700 offers so far. With more companies lined up till February, we expect the number of offers to increase further,” said Mala John, director, Centre for University-Industry Collaboration (CUIC), Anna University. The average salary has increased from Rs 6 lakh per annum to Rs 7 lakh. The highest offer received this year is Rs 36 lakh per annum. Around 95% of students from computer science and IT branches have got placements in IT product companies which offer them better pay packages and good career options compared to jobs in IT services companies. "Many top companies have added gamification round to their recruitment process whereby they will test students' aptitude, creative thinking and problem solving capabilities through games," said T Kalaiselvan, additional director of CUIC. Students with coding skills are able to land high paying jobs, he added. University vice-chancellor R Velraj said the positive trend in campus hiring will continue for at least next five to ten years. "Post-pandemic, there is a huge push for digitalisation and automation. It created a huge demand for software engineers, data analysts and cyber security experts," Velraj said. Fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) will continue to grow and manpower demand in these areas will be very high in coming years, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/anna-univ-campus-placement-jumps-by-40-highest-in-4-yrs/articleshow/88923899.cms||A Ragu Raman

A case is pending with the NGT and various agencies filed reports filed in the past two years in this regard, but the violation has not stopped. Last week, residents recorded videos of sewage being discharged by the Pallavaram municipality in Kovilambakkam canal right next to Eechangadu signal along Medavakkam High Road (opposite Rani Mahal). “The sewage pumping station at Keelkatalai lake is defunct with no pumps in working condition. Residents have complained several times. They [officials] are not even bothered about the NGT case that will be heard next week. This is a blatant violation as we are facing this every two months. Whenever we complain, they stop it. They discharge it again after a few months,” said J Shankar, coordinator of Federation of Sunnambu Kolathur Residents’ Welfare Associations. Other residents stated that the issue was not just about illegal discharge. “They require funds to treat sewage, pay contractors, and settle the electricity bill. The water enters the Pallikaranai marshland which is a blatant violation,” said one.

Closure of liquor vends on Saturday and Sunday (Tiruvalluvar Day and complete lockdown) was the reason for spike in sale. On Saturday, however, tipplers near inter-state border areas in Tiruvallur, made a beeline for shops in Andhra Pradesh to buy alcohol. Last year, on Bhogi, Pongal and Kaanum Pongal Tasmac collectively netted a revenue of Rs 590 crore.  On January 14 this year, according to Tasmac sources, Madurai region recorded the highest sale of Rs 68.8 crore, followed by Trichy region with sale of Rs 65.5. While Salem and Coimbatore regions recorded sales of Rs 63.9 crore and Rs 59.6 crore, Chennai region comprising the city and neighbouring three districts clocked sale of Rs 59.2 crore. On January 13, the state-owned corporation sold liquor worth Rs 203 crore in all the five regions with each region accounting for sale from 19% to 21%. Of this, Madurai and Trichy regions topped with Rs 42.7 crore and Rs 40.6 crore.  Ordinary and medium category liquor, with price ranging from Rs 120 to Rs 140 (per 180 ml bottle) was on high demand, while brandy was the most sought after variety followed by whisky. Liquor in 180 ml bottles was the most sought after, though several shops had additional demand for 375ml and 750ml bottles, sources added. Tasmac managing director L Subramanian did not respond to messages and calls on sale details.  On the other hand, tipplers from bordering areas of Tiruvallur district such as RK Pet and Pallipet thronged liquor outlets across the border in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh to buy alcohol on Saturday as Tasmac shops are shut till Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/festival-spirit-675cr-revenue-for-tasmac-in-3-days/articleshow/88923906.cms||---

He did not get vaccinated out of fear, his family said. Friday’s state health bulletin said Mohammed Karimullah tested positive for the Delta variant on December 26 and was admitted to RGGGH the next day. He died of Covid-19 pneumonia after battling for life in the ICU for nearly 20 days. Dr D Sudharakan, head , critical care, RGGGH, said the patient did not have any comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension, but was obese, weighing 110 kilograms. “He had a 99% lung involvement,” said the doctor, who was part of the team that treated the patient. “When we questioned his family why he did not get vaccinated, they said it was due to fear,” Dr Sudhakaran said. He said the patient was brought to the hospital in a critical state and was put in CPAP ventilator and high-flow nasal cannula. He was given Remedesivir too. In the first week of January, when Omicron cases began surging, 11 of the 17 patients admitted in the ICU of RGGGH were not vaccinated. In Omandurar GH, eight of 10 were not vaccinated. “Most patients admitted in the ICU are unvaccinated. Maybe, if this patient (Karimullah) had taken at least one dose, there could have been progress during the treatment,” Dr Sudhakaran said. Data collated from the city Covid hospitals showed, 69% of those who died due to Covid in the city in December were unvaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/25-yr-old-man-with-no-comorbidities-dies-not-vaxxed/articleshow/88923907.cms||Omjasvin M D

Earlier, the kits were given to only those who tested positive. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi on Saturday said the medical kits would include zinc tablets, paracetamol, vitamin c tablets and face masks. “In addition, azithromycin tablets would be given to the patients who need it, based on prescriptions by our doctors,” he said. The move was aimed at mitigating Covid symptoms in patients even before the test results came, the commissioner said adding that the pulse oximeters to check oxygen saturation would be given to elderly and those with comorbidities. UPHCs and private labs will share with the corporation staff the information of those who underwent RTPCR test, and corporation volunteers will distribute the medical kits at the patients’ doors. The commissioner said people can contact the corporation’s 1913 helpline for queries on medicine or home-isolation. On Sunday, Bedi inspected the houses of many home-quarantined Covid-19 positive patients. He interacted with them and asked if the services of the corporation such as door-step checkup and tele-calling reached them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/medical-kits-for-all-in-city-who-undergo-rtpcr-test/articleshow/88923909.cms||---

During the night lockdown from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Saturday, the police had registered 4,962 cases for mask non-compliance and 21 for not maintaining social distance. In the past eight days, they have registered 43,478 cases against those who did not wear masks and collected the fine amount of 86.95 lakh from them. Though the State government had on Thursday issued an order increasing the fine for mask non-compliance to 500, the city police are yet to implement the revised penalty. As many as 302 vehicles including 281 two-wheelers, 14 auto rickshaws and seven cars were confiscated from violators. These vehicles, parked at an open ground near the police stations, would be returned to the owners after a week. At least 10,000 police personnel, including from law and order, traffic and armed reserve, have been deployed to man the 312 vehicle check points in the city.

---||Chennai||Chennai court reprieve for MTC conductor suspended over deficit of Rs 3||CHENNAI: A conductor with the metropolitan transport corporation who was suspended for a cash deficit of a mere Rs 3 during inspection by MTC checking inspectors has successfully contested his suspension in a labour court. The court has set aside the order and directed MTC to issue consequential benefits due to the employee. The court noted that the suspension order was issued without conducting any domestic enquiry and directed the earlier suspension be set aside. The court however held that the transport corporation can conduct a fresh enquiry if required. The transport workers’ union, which moved the petition on behalf of the conductor, Kolanji, stated in their petition that the conductor was suspended on December 17, 2005 after the checking inspector found a deficit of three rupees and served with a memo for non co-operation and ill-treatment towards superior officer, carelessness and indifference, for which Kolanji gave an explanation. However, without considering the explanation and without conducting a domestic enquiry, the conductor was given a punishment of withholding increment for a year, against which the union moved the labour court. The corporation, in response contended that the conductor is a serial offender and argued for the petition to be dismissed. Presiding officer of the principal labour court, Chennai, C Kumarappan, after perusing the submissions observed that as per the standing order of the transport corporation, it is mandatory to conduct domestic enquiry before awarding a punishment, except for censure or fine. “Therefore, this court has no hesitation to hold that the order of suspension is liable to be set aside. Even then, the corporation is given liberty to have a domestic enquiry against the conductor according to the relevant law and standing order,” the presiding officer stated in his order and held that the conductor is entitled to have consequential benefits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/court-reprieve-for-mtc-conductor-suspended-over-deficit-of-3/articleshow/88923913.cms||---
---||Chennai||Covid-19: Telecounselling services at patients’ beck and call in Chennai||CHENNAI: It was 2 pm on Thursday afternoon and the 10 corporation staff at the Covid-19 telecounselling centre (zone 8) in Anna Nagar were busy calling patients and enquiring about their health conditions. In one of the calls, an aged patient was speaking frantically and said she had severe symptoms and needed immediate medical attention. In no-time, Mothis Kumar, a corporation doctor who heads the centre, took the call and referred a Covid-19 ambulance, along with a doctor, to the patient’s house. The patient was safely ferried to the nearby Covid care centre. In many such cases, the tele-counselling centres in the corporation have come to the rescue of patients in need. They have made 1.51 lakh calls since the first week of January when the centres were set up after the Covid cases began surging. More than 100 symptomatic patients have been shifted to health centres and were followed up. Armed with 21 doctors and 140 telecallers, these centres make 30,000 calls a day lately. Dr Mothis Kumar said their duty began at 9 am in a day. “We get the list of new positive patients in the morning in addition to those who’re already in quarantine. The telecallers phone the patients twice a day to check if they exhibit symptoms and to learn about their essential needs,” he said. When the patients don’t attend the call, their details are immediately shared with the concerned sanitary inspector. “After verifying the patient’s condition, the officer updates it in our WhatsApp group,” he said. Jeevankumar Shankar, the floor manager of the tele-counselling centre in zone 5 (Royapuram), said his job was, apart from monitoring the work of the staff, to collate the data on the daily calls, symptoms of patients, discharge details and declaration of wrong phone numbers. “The data is collated and sent to the health officers, who forward it to Ripon Buildings. It is finally reviewed by the commissioner,” he added. In some instances, the tele-callers have caught home-quarantine violators and those who play mischief by giving wrong numbers. Dr Mothis Kumar said a positive patient was found to be travelling to his farm-house without informing the corporation. Similarly, Jeevankumar said an RGGGH nurse had given the wrong phone number – 90000 00000. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the centres came in handy in zones where the virus spread is high. “Apart from offering medical help, these centres offer counselling to stressed patients. I review their works on a daily basis,” he said, adding that they played a crucial role in the city's Covid management.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/telecounselling-services-at-patients-beck-and-call/articleshow/88923914.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Elections to four civic bodies deferred by 3 weeks to February 12||KOLKATA: The elections to four civic bodies — Bidhannagar, Siliguri, Asansol and Chandernagore — that were scheduled to be held on January 22 has been deferred by three weeks to February 12. The State Election Commission (SEC) on Saturday issued a fresh notification rescheduling the date soon after the state government conveyed to the Calcutta High Court that it had no problems with the postponement in view of the Covid pandemic. Counting of votes will be held on Feb-ruary 15, SEC sources said. The development comes a day after a division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee on Friday directed the SEC to decide within 48 hours if the elections to the four civic bodies should be pushed back by four to six weeks considering the galloping rise in Covid cases. On Friday night, Trinamool Congress and the BJP wrote to the SEC proposing a deferment of polls. Trinamool urged the SEC to hold the elections on February 12 after a go-ahead from party chief Mamata Banerjee, who wanted the polls shifted to a date after the Saraswati Puja on February 5. On Saturday, the urban development and municipal affairs department wrote to the SEC saying that the state government had no problems if the civic polls were deferred to a later date. The SEC, in “compliance” with the high court order and in consultation with the state government, postponed the election date by three weeks. Trinamool national secretary Abhishek Banerjee thanked the high court and the SEC for the postponement decision. “Let us work unitedly to ensure that the positivity rate in Bengal is brought down to less than 3% in the next three weeks,”he tweeted . The need of the hour is to strengthen the fight against Covid," Trinamool national secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted, giving priority to Covid management over party politics. I wholeheartedly thank Hon'ble High Court & SEC for postponing polls by 3 weeks in the state.Let us work UNITEDLY… https://t.co/Yx1eW0opZH— Abhishek Banerjee (@abhishekaitc) 1642249526000Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said his party had been urging the SEC since December to defer the civic polls in a pandemic situation. "The SEC should have postponed the polls by four to six weeks as it was directed by the high court to consider," Majumdar said. CPM leader Sujan Chakrabarty criticised the SEC for its partisan role in deciding the new poll date. "The Trinamool wanted the polls on February 12, the SEC complied with the party's decision," he said. The Left Front later wrote to the SEC urging it to hold counting of votes together with that of the other civic bodies that go to poll in the second phase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/elections-to-4-civic-bodies-deferred-by-3-wks-to-feb-12/articleshow/88923818.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC cautions its leaders against public bickering||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Saturday said its disciplinary committee was looking into all statements made by TMC leaders against each other recently, which has “harmed the party’s image” among people. TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said: “If need be, we will recommend to the party to take strongest possible action if these statements and counter-statements are not stopped forthwith.” Chatterjee didn’t name anyone, but his remarks came in the backdrop of public spats by party MP Kalyan Banerjee on one side and Kunal Ghosh, Aparupa Poddar and Madan Mitra on the other. For now, the bickering leaders have been let off with a caution to not make public statements against one another and discuss all issues within the party first. Without elaborating, he said, “These are internal party matters.” Chatterjee said, “Some members of the party disciplinary committee met today. It has come to our notice that party leaders are speaking out against leaders and workers both in media and social media, which is harming the party’s image among people. This is unacceptable. If anything must be said, it has to be said in party forums and not outside. I had cautioned everyone before on this. We make it clear once more: no statements are to be issued by party leaders in public domain. If anyone has to say anything, they can speak within the party. If any statement is made further, we will recommend the strongest possible action.” The issue owes its genesis to Kalyan publicly questioning TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s personal views in which he advocated deferring all mass religious and political gatherings in Bengal for four weeks. Kalyan questioned how Abhishek could have personal views that ran contrary to the state’s, and the party’s. Ghosh, also the state general secretary, attacked Kalyan first, prompting Poddar, the Arambag MP, and later Mitra to take cue and attack Kalyan. With leaders bickering, their followers also took to social media to target each other. Indicating individuals cannot be bigger than the party, Chatterjee said, “If one loves the party, believes in its ideology, they will always think twice before saying — or doing — anything which harms the party. There will be divergent views, but they need to be discussed within the party first.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-cautions-its-leaders-against-public-bickering/articleshow/88923919.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Union minister challenges Bengal BJP organization rejig||Kolkata: A Union minister from Bengal threw an open challenge to a “specific leader” in the BJP state organization while four party MLAs from the Matua belt along with former state office-bearers joined a meeting Bongaon MP Shantanu Thakur had called at the Port Trust guest house on Saturday.The development put on record the brewing dissent that began with party MLAs and organizers pulling out of BJP Whatsapp groups, a phenomenon played down all these days by BJP leaders.A section within the BJP feared that the piling dissent if went unchecked might cost the BJP dear in at least four Lok Sabha constituencies in south Bengal, namely Bongaon, Barasat, Ranaghat and Krishnanagar. PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah had won over a large section of Matuas from Trinamool by promising them citizenship, though the issue had triggered fierce debates in other places.“A specific person is trying to get a grip over the entire organization and shun the senior and experienced leadership in the state. It seems that the person is in collusion with some other party,” Union minister Thakur said after the meeting.Thakur didn’t name Bengal BJP (organization) secretary Amitava Chakraborty, but posters against him pasted on train compartments in Bongaon caught attention in political circles. Only a week ago, former BJP state vice-president Ritesh Tiwari, now dropped from the state committee, uploaded a media report claiming Chakraborty’s “proximity” with election strategist Prashant Kishor’s team.Thakur openly questioned the shuffle in the BJP state committee, saying it was done keeping the BJP brass in the dark. “Many among the senior and experienced leaders who helped the party improve its vote share from 2% vote share to 40% at present didn’t find a place in the committee. The committee was formed without any representation of almost 90% of members. We will prevent efforts to harm BJP in West Bengal,” he said.Former BJP state office-bearers Sayantan Basu, Jayprakash Majumdar, former district secretary Tushar Mukherjee, BJP national morcha leader Vivek Sonkar and four BJP MLAs, namely Asim Sarkar (Haringhata), Ashok Kirtania (Bongaon Uttar), Subrata Thakur (Gaighata) and Mukutmani Adhikari (Ranaghat Dakshin) were present at Saturday’s meeting.A BJP organizer held that supporters from the Matua belt wanted the Union minister and the Matua sanghadhipati to float a new platform that Thakur and the former state leaders discarded, at least for the moment.The state BJP, however, was still in denial mode. Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya refused to read the meeting as a sign of dissent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/union-minister-challenges-bengal-bjp-organization-rejig/articleshow/88923920.cms||---
---||Kolkata||As temp rises, man-hr loss to climb in humid Bengal||Kolkata: India currently loses around 259 billion hours worth Rs 46 lakh crore annually due to the impact of humid heat on labour. Kolkata and the rest of south Bengal — among the most humid zones in the country — are two of the worst hit. A study by researchers at Duke University in the journal of Environment Research Letters says without rapid emission cuts, climate change is set to further increase losses in already hot countries, and historically cooler countries will start to see more significant labour losses. Losses in Bengal could be substantial. “The productivity is lost to a great extent because of extreme heat and humidity in this part of the world. The situation is worsening with heat and humidity increasing and rapidly sapping energy and force required for any kind of seamless production, be it industrial or agricultural,” said labour rights activist Naba Dutta. The study showed India’s labour hour loss is more than double the previous estimate of 110 billion hours. The report’s lead author Luke Parsons observed that because of increasing heat and humidity, workers are losing productivity in countries with lower temperature and humidity. But the labour losses are much higher in the tropics, as high as 500 to 600 hours per person per year. That is a week of heat-associated work loss, twice as high as previous estimates. Future warming, he warns, will magnify these impacts. “Even small increases in global temperatures in the last few decades show impacts on many of the most vulnerable to climate change. Less than 0.5°C of global warming in the last 40 years may be associated with 10% increase in global, heat-related lost labour for outdoor workers,” he pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/as-temp-rises-man-hr-loss-to-climb-in-humid-bengal/articleshow/88923922.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In the first accident near Gyan Bharti School at 10.20am on Friday, a west-bound motorcycle skidded off the road severely injuring a woman pillion rider Lata Singh (34) on her right leg. She was taken to RG Kar Hospital. At 3.20pm, at the same spot, an east-bound mini truck dashed into a bike injuring Akash Shaw (22). Shaw sustained severe left-leg injuries and was taken to Vishuddhananda Hospital. Locals said the accidents were avoidable and had been caused by potholes in the middle of the road. A dumper truck fell into a roadside water body, injuring the driver near Metropolitan crossing at EM Bypass. Police said the driver claimed he had swerved to avoid a pothole.Prolonged rains this year have led to deterioration of the road surface.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/scanner-on-roads-after-3-injured-in-accidents/articleshow/88923923.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New SOP for cops on night-naka duty||Kolkata: Four accidents involving Kolkata Traffic Police personnel in the past 48 hours — one leading to the death of a 30-year-old traffic constable — have led Lalbazar to bring in changes in night naka checks. Cops on the roads at night have been asked not to take undue risks and take greater assistance of technology.With the night restrictions extended till January 31, the top brass have asked all traffic department OCs to wear fluorescent vests. The guard rails, too, are to be put up in a scientific manner and senior officers who have years of experience in putting up these guards will oversee the job. In addition, the naka in-charge — either an SI, ASI or a sergeant — will ensure that none of the men take any undue risk while stopping heavy vehicles, like trucks. In the worst cases, cops will carry out citation cases based on CCTV footage. Kolkata Traffic Police — which had recently decided to procure another 240 police shoulder lights after several old ones got damaged or fell into disuse during the pandemic — have asked their men to wear them at night. The LED lights will mainly function as warning equipment to motorists, said sources.Jorabagan traffic guard has been at the receiving end in most of these accidents. While a sergeant escaped with minor injuries after being hit by a bus on MG Road on January 13, constable Sk Md Nasiruddin was on duty at the MG Road-Central Avenue crossing at 9.59pm was crushed to death that same night. A civic volunteer from the same guard was hit by an app cab in the Burrabazar area in the early hours of Saturday.Lalbazar has asked its men to allow everyone with valid documents and ID cards during naka checks and not crowd the nakas with checks for long durations without reason.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/new-sop-for-cops-on-night-naka-duty/articleshow/88923924.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata police warning on phishing: Don’t rely only on call-management apps to identify phone numbers||KOLKATA: Multiple educationists across the city have ended up losing close to Rs 20 lakh in less than a week — the latest being two professors from Rabindra Bharati University. Cops have now issued a warning, asking netizens not to panic but instead follow some simple safety tips to avoid such incidents. All four victims who had approached cops had reportedly trusted a couple of multi-purpose call management apps (available on Android & IOS) that usually helps one identify unknown callers. Once these apps displayed the name of the bank and the designation of the caller, none of the victims gave a second thought to verify the credentials. Instead, the victims acted according to the callers’ bidding, paving the way for the accused to cheat them. “The name shown on your phone screen is not necessarily the person you think it is. The apps simply display the name under which that number is saved. A fraudster who stores his name as a bank manager will merely have to call through his app. The potential victim at the other end will see the app display the fake name,” a cop said on Saturday. Lalbazar has taken up a probe to ascertain if the same gang is involved in all the bank frauds involving the educationists. Kolkata Police has appealed to bank officials and citizens not to solely rely on profile pictures on social media. “A criminal usually calls a potential victim after changing the setting of the application. In a case registered this week on the complaint of an economics professor from the Avishikta area, the caller’s name matched the original bank manager’s name on the app and the WhatsApp picture showed the bank manager. The imposter requested the victim to update his KYC details, sent him links and asked him to accept them. In the end, the criminal managed to walk away with Rs 3.3 lakh from the victim’s account,” the officer said. The cops have also asked victims to report cases on time. “In all these cases, valuable time was wasted in deciding their next course of action. The moment you suspect something suspicious, report the matter to police and bank, allowing us time to try and block the transactions,” said a bank official. If the fraud happens and the bank is not at fault, and it was committed by a third party through an act of scamming, phishing, etc, the RBI rules say the customer is not required to pay if the breach has been reported within three days of the fraudulent transaction. If a transaction is reported after that, but within seven days, the per transaction liability of the customer will be limited to the transaction value or an amount set by the central bank, whichever is lower. Having informed the bank, as per the RBI rules, the resolution has to be over within 90 days. Banks have to credit or reverse the unauthorized electronic transaction to the customer’s account within 10 working days from the date of notification by the customer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/police-warning-on-phishing-dont-rely-only-on-call-mgmt-apps-to-identify-phone-nos/articleshow/88923925.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Similarly, the Chatbot service will also enable a trader to apply for a trade licence or renewal of the same. This apart, the KMC brass will also offer a citizen to apply for mutation of his/her properties online and upload the property-related documents for verification by the civic officials before issuing a mutation certificate. In a bid to offer citizens hassle-free essential services, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation on Saturday introduced a Chatbot service (8335999111) which will provide a host of services. At present, a property tax payer has to visit the KMC website and pay the dues using e-banking facility through a payment gateway. “After introduction of the Chatbot service, a citizen will only need to type the assessee number and get details about his/her dues and will automatically connect the applicant to the payment option. The new system will give the applicant ample scope for using debit/credit cards or simply the e-wallets for payment of property tax,” said Sandipan Saha, MMiC and IT advisor to KMC. Similarly, an advanced software will enable a property owner seeking a mutation certificate to upload his/her property related documents (registration deed and other necessary papers relating to ownership) on the KMC assessment department Website for verification by the KMC assessors-collectors. If the documents are valid, the assessment department officials will give a green signal online. At present, there is no scope for a property owner to upload his/her property related documents online for verification of those documents by the KMC assessment department officials in case of issuance of mutation certificates. In 2016, the KMC assessment department had introduced an online mutation certificate service for the citizens. The same now gets modified with the new option for uploading documents. In case of issuance of trade license certificate or renewal of those certificates, traders can avail the Chatbot service and get the certificate without going through hurdles. Citizens welcomed the civic initiative and expressed expectations that the new system would work effectively. “It appears to be a simplified platform for payment of property tax. The scope given to citizens for uploading of property-related documents for obtaining mutation certificates is expected to bring relief for property owners,” said Biswajit Saha, a resident of Jadavpur. A senior official in the KMC assessment-collection department said they were dependent on the services of the civic body’s IT personnel. " We are ready to serve the citizens. But we need sustained support from IT personnel,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dip-into-e-wallet-to-pay-property-tax/articleshow/88923926.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||This winter, migratory bird count in Bengal's Santragachhi breaches 7-year record||KOLKATA: More birds have arrived at Santragachhi Jheel this year than in any of the past seven winters. The count of lesser whistling ducks, the most prominent variety found at the Jheel, is the highest in nine years. The official bird count at Santragachhi Jheel that was held on Saturday morning led to cheer among conservationists and birders as it confirmed the steady growth in numbers since the drastic fall four years ago. “On Saturday, 6,742 birds were recorded at Santragachhi Jheel, 20% more than last year when 5,600 birds were recorded on the second Saturday of February. This is testimony to the success of the efforts of the West Bengal Biodiversity Board and Howrah Municipal Corporation in ensuring habitat conservation at the Jheel,” said Arjan Basu Roy of Nature Mates that has been entrusted with the cleaning of the water body before the migratory season for the past four years. The census was done between 10am and 11am. A depression over south Bengal in the run-up to Saturday's census had left members of Nature Mates worried as rain threatened to scatter the birds. An informal count it had carried out last Saturday and again on Wednesday saw a wide variance attributed to the rise in temperature. However, the fears were allayed with the dip in temperature that saw birds flock back to the roosting place in Santragachhi Jheel on Saturday, leading to the record count. “Also this year, 60% of the hyacinth was removed before the arrival of migratory birds and 40% retained for floating islands as resting and roosting spots. But late rain led to high growth of hyacinth and now 60% of the water is covered by it. We have to look at how to maintain the balance,” remarked Leena Chatterjee, who has worked on the ground to oversee the clean-up of water hyacinth and arrival of migratory birds for the past several months. While the team is delighted with the overall bird count, they want to now start work on ways to increase the bird diversity. “Lesser whistling ducks that are local migrants are thriving. But the likes of ferruginous duck, common teal, northern shoveler, tufted duck and northern pintail have either come in few numbers or not at all,” he pointed out. What could have led to the fewer arrival of long-distance migratory birds is the change that has happened in rural Bengal due to development that has led to shrinking of farmlands and increased illumination in villages. While local birds that are witness to the change all year round get accustomed to it, long-range migratory birds that come once a year may find the evolution challenging.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/this-winter-migratory-bird-count-in-santragachhi-breaches-7-yr-record/articleshow/88923927.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Fairy lights sound death knell for trees, birds & insects: Activists||Kolkata: Citizens and green activists are up in arms over the increasing use of illuminated trees as props to attract customers to commercial establishments, especially restaurants.What had begun as a solitary case of a restaurant on Sarat Bose Road illuminating a tree on the pavement with fairy lights a decade ago has now become a trend with hotels and restaurants along Southern Avenue, Purna Das Road, Deshapran Sasmal Road, New Alipore and Sudder Street lighting up pavement trees to add glitz to the setting. “While trees do get illuminated the world over for brief durations during festive occasions like Christmas and Diwali, the perennial use of lights on trees is a nuisance. I am sure it is harming trees as well as birds,” remarked Biswajit Ghosh, a resident of Graham’s Lane who has seen restaurants along Deshapran Sashmal Road beside Tollygunge tram depot take to tree illumination.Arjan Basu Roy, who works on habitat conservation, said lights of all forms, including decorative lights, are a pollution for wildlife as they disrupt the natural cycle. “For birds and animals, darkness and light is determined by sunset and sunrise. There will be gradual darkness, intense darkness and then gradual light followed by bright light. When trees are illuminated, they disrupt the roosting place. It is worse for nocturnal birds like owls who do not like intense light,” he said. He also pointed out that for insects, light acts as a trap and leads to concentration of all insects from the area and their ultimate death. This reduces insect diversity and causes a food crisis for birds. Apart from the biodiversity, lights are harmful for trees as well. Horticulturist Ranjit Samanta said it’s a crime being committed against the city’s greenery. “Excessive night lighting is now recognized as a form of pollution arising out of radiation with the potential for causing damage to trees. Another negative impact is that the annual cycles of growth and reproduction in trees controlled by day length can potentially be altered by supplement night lighting,” Samanta said. Green activist Bonani Kakkar further pointed out that the tight girdling of the trunks with electric wire stifles its expansion and growth. “Fissures and tissues under the bark that transport moisture and sap through the tree get damaged and this has a debilitating effect on the growth of trees,” she said. Pointing out that trees were public property and not a furniture or tool for use by a commercial establishment, she wondered why Kolkata Municipal Corporation did not act on it.KMC parks department officials acknowledged illumination of trees as an illegal act. “We are receiving complaints and need to take up the matter with the advertisement department officials who should initiate action against errant shop or restaurant owners,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fairy-lights-sound-death-knell-for-trees-birds-insects-activists/articleshow/88923928.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||When did you have Cov? Missing query before 3rd jab raises concern||Kolkata: When septuagenarian Suresh Agarwal went to inquire about the booster vaccine dose at the civic health centre near his house on Ballygunge Circular Road, a staff there asked if nine months had passed since his second dose and if he had any comorbidity. Senior citizens Amrit Ghosh and Salma Begum, too, were asked the same questions at the urban primary health centres at Subodh Mallick Square and off Raja Dinendra Street. None was asked if they had recently contracted the novel coronavirus and when, a question posed to recipients in the second wave.This question, doctors say, was not that relevant during the second wave because Covid then was severe and senior citizens, who contracted the virus, had to be either hospitalized or were home-bound for months. But now, in the midst of the third wave, this question is absolutely vital because many senior citizens, along with the rest of the population, have been infected with a milder version of Covid and recovered. This includes many who are not even aware if they had been infected or not as many are now skipping the test, despite having symptoms.Experts pointed out ICMR guideline stated there should be a three-month gap between the last Covid infection and the booster dose. “In case an individual takes a vaccine within this period, there is a possibility of developing ‘immune tolerance’ or not enough antibodies being generated despite the booster dose. This could jeopardize recovery during future Covid infections,” said R N Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. Amrit Ghosh, who was down with Covid in mid-December along with the rest of the family, would have taken the booster dose had he not encountered his doctor by chance and told him he had scheduled his booster shot the following day. The doctor firmly told him not to. “You don’t need a booster dose till April. Delay it till then. Taking it now can lead to complications,” the physician warned Ghosh.Satyaki Bardhan, who practises in Lansdowne and Bhowanipore in south Kolkata, said he had been warning all his patients, who had Covid, not to take the vaccine till at least three months after they’d recovered. But, he said, there were many who were unaware that taking the booster dose now would be useless. “The infection leads to formation of antibodies in a patient. Injecting more antibodies will not help. In fact, if someone has the flu or a simple cough and cold, the person should not take the vaccine till two weeks after recovery,” Bardhan said.Debabrata Saha, who practices in Shyambazar-Ultadanga, said he had advised his patients who have had Omicron not to take the “precaution dose” at all. “Omicron is the best booster dose that one can get. I haven’t taken the third shot because it will do nothing to prevent Omicron. But the problem that has happened this time around is that the government has not released an advisory against taking the dose within three month of contracting the virus. Hence, there is less awareness among people,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/when-did-you-have-cov-missing-query-before-3rd-jab-raises-concern/articleshow/88923929.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Study on making regional lit global||Kolkata: The British Council has undertaken a research project to see how literature in Indian languages, including those of Bengali writers, can be translated into English for global readers. The research covered 10 cities or states in India and focused on languages which included Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. The research, in collaboration with private organisation Art X Company, focuses on writers and literary professionals and translations of their works. It brings together insights from 100 stakeholders in 10 Indian cities covering eight languages. The research attempts to identify opportunities for working and collaborating globally, scrutinizing the role of literary festivals, role of digitization and perceptions of Indian literature in English translation abroad.Though India has 427 recognised languages, with 22 official languages, most Indian literature known globally has been written in English, with very little Indian language literature in translation making it to Western markets. The report identifies the various challenges faced by the sector and outlines recommendations for the publishing ecosystem and the translation ecosystem. British Council director (Arts India) Jonathan Kennedy said, “The main aim of conducting the research was to identify barriers to internationalisation faced by Indian literature and publishing professionals and support the Indian literature sector which has suffered because of the global pandemic. The idea is to also help Indian literature in different and more languages reach foreign shores. ”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/study-on-making-regional-lit-global/articleshow/88923930.cms||---

Watching response from school students, aged between 15 and 18 years, in the past one week, the KMC has decided to set up more camps at government-aided schools. To begin with, KMC had set up camps at 16 government-run schools across 16 boroughs 15 days ago. Now, the civic body’s teams of vaccinators and para-medical staff have reached over 80 schools and the demand is still growing.“Initially, we had selected one school in one borough. But given that the pace of the vaccination drive has picked up, we have set up camps at all major schools in every borough. Currently, we are running an average of five vaccination camps at five schools in a borough,” said a KMC health department official. So far, 1 lakh 20,000 youngsters in Kolkata had got their first shots at KMC camps, a source said. According to sources in the KMC health department, the civic body’s team of vaccinators are giving the jabs to at least 100 students in a school every day. “We are setting up our temporary vaccination camps at relatively larger schools located in a KMC ward. Depending on the demands from the adjacent neighbourhoods, we invite students of other schools, which are not as big,” said a civic official who is part of the vaccination drive at schools.According to the official, the demands were particularly higher in south Kolkata and on the southeastern fringes of KMC areas. “We are running several vaccination camps in south Kolkata and southeastern fringes. The number of schools is increasing every day,” said the KMC official. The high-response areas are Tollygunge, Behala, Jadavpur, Garia, Patuli, and neighbourhoods located off EM Bypass. “Here, we are stocking up 150 doses for a day. All doses are getting exhausted at the end of the day,” said a KMC medical officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/good-news-from-kids-vax-front-kmc-sets-up-more-camps-as-demand-rises/articleshow/88923932.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Private hospitals in Kolkata increase intake capacity at Covid critical care units||Kolkata: Even as a state government-appointed committee has started checking the profile of Covid ICU patients across Kolkata hospitals — many of whom are admitted for comorbidities and tested positive on arrival — several private hospitals are ready to expand their critical care units to ensure that seriously ill Covid patients are not deprived of high-intensity treatment. While the committee has been asked to check and suggest if those with mild Covid symptoms could be treated at non-Covid wards if their primary illness is not triggered by the virus, hospitals are wary of mixing positives with negatives. Most said they would avoid taking such a risk and would rather add more Covid critical beds. “A mildly infected cardiac patient can’t be put at the non-Covid ICU at this stage. There’s no guarantee that he won’t infect a fellow patient for whom the Covid symptoms could turn out to be fatal. We must accept that every ICU patient is serious,” said a hospital head. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), for instance, 40 ICU beds are being added. RTIICS currently has 111 beds for Covid with 48 beds in critical care. “Out of the 48 beds, 39 are now occupied with the numbers being constant since the last three days. But to address a future surge, we plan to increase 40 beds in critical Covid care from Monday. This will help in accommodating Covid patients who get admitted in the hospital in a critical condition,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. TimesViewHospitals will be under pressure for some time. The problem is a lot of healthcare workers will be on sick leave at exactly the same time when hospital admissions will be near their peak. Hospital managements will have to look at stop-gap, emergency arrangements; none of them may be ideal but, hopefully, they will help tide over the situation.He added that a substantial number of ICU patients tested Covid positive at the hospital and are being treated for other illnesses. Peerless Hospital is planning to add an eight-bed Covid ICU to its existing 11-bed one. The hospital has 79 Covid patients. “While many of our Covid patients at the ITU tested positive on admission and have mild symptoms, we will continue treating them at the critical care set-up. If the number of those admitted for another primary illness rises, we shall keep expanding the ITU to accommodate all Covid positives,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. Belle Vue Clinic, which now has 70 Covid beds including 33 ICU ones, is gearing up to add another 10 critical care beds. “If the government suggests treating mild Covid patients at non-Covid wards, then our clinicians will analyze it and take a call,” said CEO P Tondon. Woodlands Hospital is planning to add a 12-bed ICU next week to cater to the rising demand, said Rupali Basu, MD & CEO. AMRI Hospitals have already raised its ICU beds from 60 last week to 128 now. It is also planning to add at least 10 SDU (step down unit) beds for critical Covid patients who were not admitted with comorbidities at its Dhakuria unit. “There is now a dominance of patients with comorbidities who incidentally tested Covid positive. So, we are screening the situation and will keep adding critical and SDU beds so that there’s enough room for those who need admission primarily for Covid,” said AMR CEO Rupak Barua.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-private-hospitals-increase-intake-capacity-at-covid-critical-care-units/articleshow/88923933.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The Chandni-Esplanade area in the central business district has the highest number of singing bars in the city which transform the area as the evening approaches. Bouncers take positions outside the gates and singers start arriving in batches. Owners have decorated the façade with bright lights to attract guests that lend the place a carnivalesque feel. According to owners of several singing bars, the area provides certain advantages over other places like better connectivity, an existing market due to presence of iconic eateries and bars and thin residential population. Now newer outlets have opened to cash in on the footfalls the area attracts due to the existing singing and non-singing bars. Kick, beside the iconic Chung Wah close to Chandni Metro station, is the latest to open in the area. The liquor shop that existed earlier has made way for the bar. “We have opened the place a few weeks ago and the response was good till the third wave struck. Business was good till the Christmas weekend,” said one of the owners. The famous Sagar Restaurant and Bar recently changed hands and the new owners have renovated the place and converted one floor into a singing bar. “The ground floor is for families who can enjoy their food and drinks. The first floor has been converted into a singing bar with live music,” said one of the new owners of the place. Rhythms on Waterloo Street has added another floor to the existing one on the ground floor. “The place has comfortable seating and also helps in social distancing in the time of pandemic,” said a manager. Opening of another singing bar on Ganesh Chandra Avenue was postponed after surge in cases late last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/singing-bars-beat-the-blues-with-launches-expansion/articleshow/88923935.cms||Zeeshan Javed

This is the first time this zone, which had reported multiple cases even during the first and second waves, has been placed on the micro containment zone list. Jadavpur Central Park, Baghajatin and Netaji Nagar are also on the list for the first time.These addresses in wards 92 and 93 are standalone buildings. Lake Police has put up single barricades and posters indicating that the addresses are in containment list. “The purpose of putting up barricades is to ensure that neighbours and others coming from outside can identify them. We have spoken to residents and explained to them that this is only for functional purposes. With most people affected by Covid, no one will ever ostracize the infected neighbours. We are merely ensuring that basic containment rules are followed,” said a police officer. According to a civic official as the virus is spreading from Jodhpur Park to Lake Gardens and parts of Jadavpur, the civic body’s Covid response team will now need to prevent spread to Golf Green. “While cases are everywhere, we are trying to concentrate on each area where fresh cases reported in past one week is higher than rest of the city,” said a KMC health department officer. According to local residents, while this will increase awareness, the entire process needs to be more transparent on choice of zones. “We need to know whether there will be more sanitization in the area or medicines will be delivered to senior citizens,” said Dipan Chakraborty, a local resident. KMC will focus on all flats that have more than 30 dwelling units as well as on the adjoining slums. “We will be putting out contact numbers of local police stations, doctors, ambulances and ward coordinators to help residents,” said a KMC official in Jodhpur Park area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6-lake-bldgs-on-micro-c-zone-list/articleshow/88923936.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

KMC market department inspectors have been deputed to keep a watch on these vendors and ensure that they comply with the closure guideline till Covid cases reduce. “We have not put curbs on their business. Instead, we have regulated their timings in the wake of a surge in Covid cases. After 11am, the vendors should not be seen in the market area. They may sit for three hours in the evening starting from 4pm,” said a civic official. According to a KMC market department official, cops from local police stations were assigned to look after the Covid protocols that include wearing of masks and maintaining distance. “The direction comes from Nabanna and our department officials as well as police are ensuring that rules are not flouted,” said the KMC market department official. Markets which are under watch include those at Ultadanga, Rani Rashmoni, Maniktala, College Street, Koley, Jadubabu’s bazaar, Lansdowne, Baghajatin, Bansdroni and Behala. However, local residents failed to understand how the regulation of timing would help reduce crowding, when it forced everyone to shop within the restricted hours. “I used to shop after the crowd thinned around noon. But with vendors not being allowed to do business, I too have to do my shopping for greens by 10.30am, when it is crowded,” said Milan Bhowick, a resident of Sarat Bose Road, who shops at Lansdowne market. In some areas markets which are located in the densely populated localities like Azadgarh, Bijoygarh, Sree Colony and Jadavpur have been put under maximum vigilance. These markets had played the role of super spreaders during the peak of the second wave and hence were shut down for some days to break the virus chain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vendors-outside-mkts-cant-sell-goods-from-11am-4pm/articleshow/88923937.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||One good deed begets another: Help pours in for second Covid wave heroes in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Sourabh Banerjee always believed that ‘a good deed never goes unrewarded’, and the pandemic has only strengthened his faith in the age old adage. The 44-year-old postal department employee was instrumental in helping several neighbours, parents of his friends and even strangers during the second wave. He was anxious when his entire family including his septuagenarian parents tested positive last week, but even before he could reach out to anybody he was flooded with calls by various people offering to help. Second wave of the pandemic last year brought immense pain and suffering as people struggled to get hospitalised, get oxygen or struggled to cremate their loved ones. But the testing times also gave rise to heroes out of ordinary individuals, who came to the rescue of people in distress. Some of the second wave heroes who tested positive during the third wave have now been flooded with calls by friends, neighbours and even acquaintances. “I had just updated on social media about my family testing positive to alert those who had come in contact with us. Within a few hours my phone was constantly ringing with so many people offering to help. Some even delivered sweets and fruits to our building,” said Banerjee. “During the second wave I had done what any human being would do in such a situation to help people get oxygen, hospitalised, vaccinated. But the way people have come forward to help me has left me emotional,” he added. Pratyusha Ghosh and her friends were part of a group in New Town that helped residents during the second wave.

Apart from all the benefits being claimed by the government if the project is implemented, the DPR goes on to list out several negative impacts of the project on the environmental and social side, both during the construction and its operational phases. It says that the frequent train movements would generate a certain level of noise and vibration and it may cause sleep disturbance and mental instabilities to the residents living adjacent to the proposed alignment. “In addition, careful attention should be paid on noise impacts on sensitive receptors (SRs) located near the proposed alignment such as educational institutions, hospitals and religious institutions,” it says.Raising concerns, the DPR says that due to change in land use, impact is envisaged on soil during the operation phase. “Improper post-plantation care and maintenance as well as illegal felling of plantation along the track will offset all positive efforts by the project. Proposed SilverLine rail which may divide the natural habitats in certain landscapes that could possibly affect faunal population range and distribution, ability to mate, connectivity between populations,” it says.However, the DPR says that no soil erosion is envisaged when the SilverLine rail is in operation as all the slopes and embankments of the project shall be stabilised through sound engineering techniques and no impact envisaged on flora during the operation phase.The DPR warns that there would be an impact on aquatic fauna in case of accidental oil spill and toxic chemicals released find their way into the water bodies. “The noise and vibration generated by the SilverLine rail project may disturb the fauna including domestic livestock especially in the night time. There is a potential of direct impact of SilverLine trains hitting avifauna since the trains will be running at a speed of 200 km/h on viaduct at a height of 10-15m,” it said.As per the findings of the DPR, the project being a linear one, would cross all the west-flowing rivers and streams and the agriculture fields and flood plains. Large quantities of earthwork involved would affect the hydrological environment and the embankments would cause obstruction to the easy flow of water downstream and increase the silt flow. Increase in soil erosion would hamper the water quality and increase siltation. Reduced infiltration would result in increase in surface flow and resultant flood. The obstruction of flow due to banking would also result in ground water fluctuation and water logging and Kollam and Kasaragod (station and yard) have been identified as the most vulnerable places of hydrological impact.Experts working in environmental sectors say that the adverse impacts of the project have been treated casually in the DPR. “Serious environmental issues have been listed, and for every issue, the DPR says that there are remedies. These issues ought to be treated much more seriously as have been dealt by the DPR,” noted environmental activist Sridhar Radhakrishnan, said.Also as per the DPR, approximately 10,349 structures and buildings are likely to be affected, and it says that in spite of all the efforts to avoid the religious structures on the SilverLine, still nine religious structures (including three temples, one church and five Masjids) are infringing the proposed alignment.The project cost estimated at Rs 63, 940.67 crore for its completion by 2025-26, will require Rs 1620.42 crore, Rs 11,051.89 crore, Rs 15,892.93 crore, Rs 15,546.84 crore, Rs 13,071.84 crore and Rs 5,231.67 crore every year for five years from 2020-21 till 2025-26, respectively.It finds that the project would yield a return of Rs 2,276 crore from fare box in 2025-26, that will increase to Rs 92,371 crore by 2074-75, and Rs 237 crore in 2025-26 from roll-on roll-off (RoRo) services that will increase to Rs 4,319 crore in 2074-75. The DPR says that the project is not viable under the build, operate and transfer (BOT) model even after providing viability gap funding to the private sector but is viable under the equity sharing SPV model, which is the present proposed model. As the project is self-sustainable as seen from the FIRR (8.49% after 50 years) and also has an EIRR (24.04% after 50 years) above the mandated levels, the project is financially and economically viable and hence is recommended to be implemented, the DPR said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/adverse-impact-on-nature-treated-casually-experts/articleshow/88924000.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Bus fare hike likely from February 1||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government is considering hiking the bus fares in the state from February 1. It is reliably learnt that the chief minister has given clearance to the recommendations given by the transport department for increasing the fare. It is learnt that the transport minister will once again hold discussions with bus owners before announcing the hike. According to sources, the minimum fare for 2.5km which at present is Rs 8, will be increased to Rs 10. The fare per km which is 80 paise, will be increased to Re 1. The other increase in the rates will be in commensuration with this fare. Even though the bus owners have been demanding that the minimum fare should be made Rs 12, the government is unlikely to agree to this demand, it is learnt. Instead, there will be a special fare for night trips. It is learnt that 50% extra will be charged for the ordinary service trips between 8pm and 5am. It is learnt that the students from below poverty line (BPL) families will be offered bus travel free of cost. This will be applicable to those who hold yellow ration cards. For other students, the minimum concession travel rates will be fixed at Rs 5. It is learnt that the government has taken a stand that it will not hold further discussions with the student representatives with regards to the minimum fare for students. The bus owners had earlier announced a strike demanding a fare hike, but had decided to postpone it in the wake of the assurance from the government that the hike will be implemented after the ongoing Sabarimala season.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/bus-fare-hike-likely-from-february-1/articleshow/88924001.cms||---

Based on at least seven points from the judgment, the prosecution has decided to go for an appeal, for which the final legal opinion is being awaited, said top police department sources. “The judgment seems to have given a colour of consent to the act which has not even been raised by the accused. Also, minor changes in deposition is a sign of credibility while it is the parrot-like version that has to be discarded. That is the principle adopted by the apex court. The court seems to have failed to appreciate this fact,” sources said. After a detailed analysis of the verdict at top level in the police force, the general opinion is that all prosecution witnesses have been discredited as unbelievable on minor grounds and it is not acceptable. “For example, an explanation was given by PW2 (a nun and witness) to her superiors to avoid disciplinary action for cooperating with the investigation. In order to escape from being expelled from her congregation, she gave a reply in which she said that she gave the statement on pressure from police and she may be not proceeded against. This has been used to conclude that she is an unreliable witness. The circumstances in which she gave the letter was given no appreciation,” sources added. The social background of the nun and the context which led to different expressions on her experience have also not been appreciated, it was felt. “Consent has to be unequivocal verbal or non-verbal for the sexual act and it has to be proved by the accused. Travelling in a car or participating in a function is not consent by any remote chance. Rather it should have been seen as her ill fate,” sources said. Investigation supervising officer and the then Kottayam SP Hari Sankar had come out openly against the verdict citing that the genuine explanations in respect of the delay and the aspect of fiduciary relationship with the accused and its repercussions on the mental condition of the survivor was not appreciated by the court. Other officers who analyzed the verdict have also given the opinion that the court has accepted that the accused is the supreme authority over the survivor and has the powers to influence her life. Under such circumstances, the inability to resist or delay in reporting, etc, is quite natural.  “This should be seen in the context. The judgment has completely missed the context,” sources said. The police top brass also expressed surprise that none of the rulings presented by the prosecution in its argument note found mention in the judgment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/judgment-missed-context-prosecution/articleshow/88924002.cms||KP Saikiran

There are a total of 56 cartoons at the exhibit, each one a sarcastic illustration of daily happenings.Cartoonist Prathapan Pulimath started drawing these cartoons in the beginning of the outbreak of Coronavirus and he has included the virus in each cartoon, symbolizing it as a witness to all that is happening. The solo cartoon exhibition is organized as part of the annual grant provided by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. The expo named as ‘Puli Madhuram’ will conclude on January 19. The vertical cartoons are framed using black tapes.The cartoon that stands out the most is the one that pokes fun at the irresponsible mentality of people who dispose of waste materials in restricted areas. It reflects the daily scene of people dumping rubbish exactly in places which have a board instructing “do not dispose waste here”. Another one on elderly politicians who cling on to their positions much to the dismay of younger people exposes stereotypical political strategies.“I believe that cartoons are the best form of art which can easily convey the intended message. We have always seen cartoons getting more attention than other written words as it is closely associated with sarcasm,”said Prathapan Pulimath, the cartoonist.Another work captures the helplessness of the ordinary policemen who risk their lives while taking on violent gangs. The cartoon also reflects the mental anguish of cops who are ordered to chase the goons.The cartoonist has demonstrated the themes from the daily life, including Covid regulations, dowry, increasing petrol price, identity theft, influence of alcoholic beverages, bribe, politics, work from home, influence of social media, cinema, black money, condition of financially backward people during the pandemic, elections, new generation and waste disposal by featuring different individuals as a representative of the real persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cartoons-depict-the-virus-as-a-witness-to-mans-follies/articleshow/88924006.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Rafeeqa Beevi, 50, her partner Al Ameen, 26, hailing from Palakkad and her son Shafeeq, 23. Santhakumari of Alummoodu Veedu at Mulloor is the victim in the case.The police said that the alleged murder took place on Friday morning at the rented house of the accused. Santhakumari was their next door neighbour. The crime was committed on the same day they were supposed to vacate the rented house.‘’Around 10.30 am the accused invited Santhakumari to their house and strangulated her using a shawl and also bludgeoned her on head using a hammer,’’ said Vizhinjam station house officer inspector Prajeesh Sasi.They then took the gold ornaments worn by the deceased and fled from the house. Before leaving, they stashed the dead body on the attic of the house. The crime became public when the house owner’s son reached there around 8.30 pm. The house owner’s son and friends used a single-room building outside the house for the purpose of competitive exam coaching classes. When he arrived at the night, he noticed that the door of the house was closed, but the key was left behind in the door. When he entered, he saw blood dripping down from the attic and informed the police.The police initially suspected that it was Rafeeqa who died. Soon, they identified the deceased as Santhakumari. With the help of cyber experts, the police found out that the trio were at Thycaud in the evening. It was the same spot where private inter-state buses commenced journeys. The police assumed that the accused were planning to escape from the city and alerted all police stations to check long distance buses. By midnight, a police team intercepted a bus at Kazhakootam and caught the accused.During the interrogation, the accused told the police that they committed the crime due to financial crisis. All three of them did not have stable jobs. Al Ameen and Shafeeq used to work in restaurants at Kovalam. Al Ameen lost his job recently owing to his wayward lifestyle involving alcoholism.The accused had robbed a gold necklace, a pair of gold earrings, two gold bangles and a gold ring from the victim. Before boarding the bus in the evening, they pawned some of the ornaments for Rs 50,000. The accused will be produced before the court on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/neighbours-murder-elderly-woman-for-gold/articleshow/88924009.cms||---

Opposition leader V D Satheesan on Saturday said that the CPM should clarify whether the party was under the control of Chinese Communist Party or not. The approach of CPM on China is very similar to that of the controversial statement of CPM ideologue EMS Namboodiripad during the Indo-Sino war.  “CPM should clarify whether Chinese interest or the national interest is of more importance to that party. The China eulogies of CPM politburo member S R Ramachandran Pillai at a time when China is routinely engaged in provocations in the Indo-China border is highly condemnable. The statement of Pillai underscores the allegations that CPM is subservient to China,” Satheesan said. Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan had on Friday demanded the CPM to tender an apology to the people of the country for the controversial and repeated statements of SR Pillai, praising China. “Owing to the blind opposition to Modi, CPM leaders hate even the motherland. SRP repeated his speech in Kottayam because the party did not stop him,” he said. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennitala said the CPM leader’s attitude to China was anti-national.  “Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan tried to correct politburo member S Ramachandran Pillai only because of the fear over public’s outrage,” he said. Recalling the controversial statement of CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan a couple of years ago that China was attacked from all sides, Chennithala said the CPM has no moral right to function in India. Chennithala said the attitude of CPM towards China was clear in chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement when 20 Indian soldiers were martyred in the Chinese attack in Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh. The CM, he said, had avoided the word China when he tweeted on the martyrdom of Indian solders.  “I had given the CM a letter, condemning the same,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cpms-love-for-china-invites-sharp-criticism/articleshow/88924012.cms||---

Alleging that the 21-year-old youth was a victim of the Marxist party’s “violent politics”, the Kannur MP said even witnesses did not say that the arrested YC activists had stabbed him. Playing a purported voice clip of some students, who are said to have witnessed the incident that happened at the Government Engineering College in Idukki last week, he told reporters here that none of them said who had stabbed the deceased man. How could the responsibility of the crime be attributed to the YC activists, he asked during a meet-the-press programme here. Sudhakaran claimed that the Kerala Students Union (KSU) and YC activists did not go after anyone to attack them and asked why the police were reluctant to rush the injured Rajendran to hospital. Urging police to find out the “real” culprits, he also rejected the criticism that he did not mourn the youth’s death. “The loss of a human life is a sad incident. My mind is not made of stone and iron... I am a person who can understand the pain of his family members. But it was the CPM that tried to celebrate his death by buying land to build a memorial in his name soon after the incident,” Sudhakarn charged. Dheeraj’s family came from the Congress background, he claimed and said he really wanted to visit and console them. Taking a dig at the ruling party, he said the CPM also did not mind organising a mega ‘thiruvathirakkali’ while mourning the student activist’s death. Coming down heavily on the SFI, he said it was an outfit that has managed to prevail in the state campuses only because of its violent politics and they were unleashing violence against the KSU activists. agencies||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/arrested-yc-activists-have-no-role-in-dheerajs-murder-sudhakaran/articleshow/88924013.cms||---

Several delegates questioned the diktat that party leaders not part of the government should not intervene in the government’s functioning. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who fielded the criticisms against the government, said the delegates should not try to compare the performance of ministers in a month-old government with that of ministers who were in the saddle for five years. A delegate from Parassala questioned the rationale behind calling China a Communist country. “Considering the economic policies that China follows, how can we call it a Communist country? China is the main villain in the climate change crisis. It is a country that builds friendship with the Taliban in Afghanistan,” said the delegate. While PWD minister Mohamed Riyas received accolades for his proactive functioning style, health, industries and local self-government departments came under severe criticism. One delegate said the health department that continues to win international awards shows scant regard to the public and partymen. Police came under attack on the second day too for what some delegates said for behaving like a ‘pack of thieves’ and a ‘bunch of insensitive gluttons’. The office of the industries minister is a hangout place of elites, alleged a delegate. Some leaders in the district faced male chauvinism charges as they were adept at spreading canards against women from ordinary families in the party. At the same time, these leaders are reluctant to send women in their homes to attend party programmes, said a delegate. Kodiyeri said that he would bring the criticisms to the attention of the concerned ministers. “It’s premature to assess the competency of the second Pinarayi government. Many ministers who performed well in the first Pinarayi government were also novices. If given more time, the ministers of this ministry will also perform well,” he said. A delegate from Attingal area committee criticized the controversial performance of mega ‘Thiruvathira’ during the district conferences. Kodiyeri said the presence of pro-RSS-BJP members in the police force was owing to the presence of such organizations and parties in Kerala. Rejecting the claims of some delegates that police were more approachable for CPM leaders when M V Jayarajan was in CM’s office, Kodiyeri said, “You may be feeling so because Jayarajan is a popular leader. In fact, he never intervened in police matters during his term.” The district conference will come to a close on Sunday with the party state secretary addressing a public meeting in virtual mode. Incumbent district secretary Anavoor Nagappan is likely to continue as the party district secretary for another term.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-govt-2-0-not-as-good-as-the-first-cpm-delegates/articleshow/88924015.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Kites give silver lining to Covid cloud||AHMEDABAD: It was the ‘Kai Po Che’ day when the city had some fun even though the memory of the devastating second wave lingered in the horizon. Celebrations were upbeat, but people appeared to be mindful of the spectre of the rising Covid cases. There were few loudspeakers blasting the latest numbers and even fewer lanterns to light up the sky, but colourful kites cheered the city in some measure on Friday. Rakesh Patel, a resident of Satellite, said that his society had strict rules about the number of persons allowed on the terrace and outsiders were banned altogether. “Thus, we could not be with our usual group for the second consecutive year,” he said. “The wind was very favourable, and we could enjoy kite-flying almost the entire day. Undhiyu party right on the terrace was the highlight of the day.” The eastern city parts, including the pol areas, captured the spirit of Uttarayan with traditional kite fights. By evening, some aficionados even sent tukkals (paper lanterns attached with the kite string) to the sky. Balwant Parekh, a resident of Kalupur, said that they missed the hustle and bustle of the traditional Uttarayan. “But it’s the time to exercise caution, so that we can celebrate the festival next year with double the vigour,” he said. Some Amdavadis, however, remarked that this year many kitists used the nylon thread, sometimes called Chinese manja, to fly kites. Vijay Dabhi, a bird rescuer, agreed with the observation. “The manja is banned, but the majority of the birds we rescued were tangled in synthetic thread which is difficult to break,” he said. “It just aggravated the injuries.” For the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), it was a relatively easier festival with fewer fire calls. The team, however, carried out a rescue operation when three persons including a teenager drowned in a lake in Moraiya near Ahmedabad. City hospitals saw over 100 cases of injuries related to Uttarayan including fall and manja gashes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/jubilation-in-the-air-kites-give-silver-lining-to-covid-cloud/articleshow/88924017.cms||---

The state forest department rescued over 2,700 birds on Friday and Saturday while NGOs tended to more than 2,000 birds. The majority of the birds injured were pigeons and crows. This year the number of injured crows was higher compared to the 2021 figure. The forest department officials said that overall more birds were injured this Uttarayan than in the previous one. The officials said that the forest department rescued 2,703 birds of which 2,494 were saved. The state government has been launching Karuna Abhiyan every year to save birds from the killer manja. The campaign aims to save birds that sustain injuries during Uttarayan across Gujarat. The campaign runs from January 10 to 20. The initiative covers 44 medical centres run by NGOs. Moreover, 10 control rooms, 129 collection sections, and 13 mobile vans were pressed into service in Ahmedabad district. Over 2,079 volunteers, including 161 veterinary doctors, participate in the project. The state forest department officials said that on the Uttarayan day, 1,021 birds were injured and the number was nearly 1,700 on Saturday. Hence more injuries were recorded on Saturday than on the Uttarayan festival day. Kartik Shastri of Jivdaya said that his trust alone rescued 1,145 birds till afternoon on Saturday. Shastri said that this year the injuries were high despite Covid restrictions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/more-manja-hits-for-birds-this-year/articleshow/88924018.cms||---

We first vaccinated the sarpanch, government employees and circulated the pictures and videos. Slowly, we got a response.” As the state marks one year of its Covid vaccination programme, 9.4 crore doses are a landmark in more than one sense, said experts. This was the biggest adult vaccination drive in the state, and a lot of planning went into taking immunization to remote corners of Gujarat. Dr B B Gadhvi from Poshina, Sabarkantha, said they held many vaccination camps at night when they found it difficult to get hold of beneficiaries in the daytime as they would be away at work. “We would send the teams for two-three days continuously, even when none were ready to take the vaccination. After the second wave, they also realized that they would get protection,” he recounted. Mamta Charel, a vaccinator in Dahod, said she contracted Covid along with her father. “But it did not deter me. After recovery, we kept going to remote villages where in a day we would cover 20-30 beneficiaries,” she said. Geeta Patel, a health worker from Gadhavi PHC in Dang near Ahwa, said the biggest challenge was changing the mindsets of people. “Second dose adherence was good, and today we have nearly 100% coverage,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/held-camps-at-night-faced-abuses-but-kept-going/articleshow/88924019.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Parents limited to video chat||Ahmedabad: In a case of interfaith marriage in which the wife’s custody was secured by the husband after a brief legal battle, the Gujarat high court recently permitted the woman to keep in touch with her parents through video conference.In this case, the parents’ advocate had expressed their concern about the daughter’s security. The woman too insisted on getting security when the parents expressed their desire to meet her. “Let the girl keep in touch with the parents through video conference. There shall be no insistence for a physical meeting in the present circumstances,” the HC asserted on Thursday. It said that it would pass further order in this regard on January 20.The couple, residents of Ahmedabad, met each other on social media, fell in love and decided to get married. They got their marriage registered on June 1, 2021 under the the Special Marriage Act. Early December, the couple eloped without informing anybody. The woman’s parents lodged a police complaint alleging that their daughter and her boyfriend had decamped with valuables. On the basis of the complaint, the city police traced the couple and allegedly separated them. A few days later, the husband approached the high court and submitted that the cops had separated him from his legally wedded wife on the pretext of a false complaint filed by her parents. He added that his wife was being forcibly kept by her parents.When the court sought to know the will of the woman, she stated that she had contracted the marriage and she would rather go with her husband. The court granted some time to the woman to re-think her decision after her parents complained that their daughter would graduate soon and the man she has married is a mechanic. They expressed concern over her future. However, during the next hearing, the woman reiterated her wish to go to her husband and the court ordered her custody to be given to her husband.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/parents-limited-to-video-chat/articleshow/88924020.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||AMC, society spar over felled tree||Ahmedabad: A grown neem tree was reduced to a stump due to apathy of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) towards its taxpayers’ complaints and callousness of a housing society towards the city’s green wealth.On January 8, the chairman of Satya Sai Society in Maninagar received a notice from the AMC’s parks and garden department asking the society to pay a penalty of Rs 27,000 for chopping down off a neem tree in the society compound. “We got the tree cut 18 months ago as it was dangerously close to the electricity pylon. Branches were touching high tension wires. We repeatedly asked the AMC to trim the tree, but on getting no response we took the matter into our own hands,” said Ramesh Patel, chairman of Satya Sai Society. The society says the penalty has been wrongly imposed. “We intend to fight back legally,” Patel said. The penalty includes a Rs 1,000 fine for damaging the environment, Rs 1,000 as administration charges and Rs 2,500 per tree to plant 10 trees.Patel also pointed out that the pylon is wrapped with barbed wire to prevent anyone from climbing it. The tree made it easy to climb the pylon without encountering the barbed wire. He says children play in that area. “It posed a great threat, especially during the monsoon,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-society-spar-over-felled-tree/articleshow/88924022.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Turn to organic farming, begin new green revolution, says Amit Shah||Gandhinagar: Highlighting the adverse impact that chemical fertilizers were creating, Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah yet again asked farmers to launch a “new green revolution” by adopting natural methods of farming. Shah was virtually addressing farmers in Gandhinagar on Saturday after launching the logo of the Gujarat government’s initiative for natural farming, its mobile application, and e-vans. The initiative is to market the produce grown using natural farming methods through a chain of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). Shah said that over the past two years, more than 2 lakh farmers in Gujarat have adopted natural farming. “Gujarat’s farmers have understood the benefits of natural farming and have adopted it,” Shah said. “If annadatas (food providers) do not think of the future, the country, and the earth, we are heading towards a great crisis.” Shah said that as a Member of Parliament from Gandhinagar, he has decided to make at least 50% of the farmers in his constituency turn to natural farming. He said Gujarat should make arrangements to ensure maximum returns for farmers on their natural farming produce, because only then will they take it up. He said the Union cooperation ministry has given the responsibility to Amul to set up laboratories where farmers adopt natural farming to certify the land and the produce, and to set up a marketing chain. “Let us launch a new green revolution through natural farming, which preserves and conserves the land for the next many years instead of damaging it,” Shah said. “To achieve this, natural farming is the only way out.” Shah said that natural farming is vital for India today. “But I can certainly see that the entire world will have to accept the natural farming methods initiated by our country,” he said. “The entire world will have to accept the importance of desi cow (which plays a major role in the natural farming process),” he said. The FPOs in Gujarat will act as a bridge between consumers and farmers. These organizations will take the farm produce to consumers after certification. This will be the first such system in the country, Shah said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/turn-to-organic-farming-begin-new-green-revolution-shah/articleshow/88924024.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: After 21 years, victory heard in botched ear operation case||AHMEDABAD: Unjha town’s Nitin Patel will finally get Rs 50,000 with 9% interest from 2001 as compensation for a procedure that had gone awry. Patel had sought the procedure to deal with his hearing impairment and the ENT surgeon could not extract the dye after pouring it into his ear. Patel had to undergo another surgery to get rid of the material. The final order to pay the compensation was made on January 10. As per case details, in January 2000, Patel consulted ENT surgeon Dr Rakesh Pathak in Unjha to tackle the hearing impairment in his left ear. The doctor proposed the implantation of a hearing aid and Patel agreed. Before implanting the hearing aid, the doctor poured some material into Patel’s ear, which stuck to his eardrum. The doctor tried to extract it over three days but could not succeed. Patel began having troubles in his ear, including a swelling. He said that he could not hear properly with his left ear. Patel had to consult another ENT surgeon, Dr Haresh Trivedi, who performed a surgery to solve his problem. Patel sued Dr Pathak, moving the Mehsana District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Dr Pathak defended himself, saying the patient had not become stone-deaf due to his treatment. The doctor said Patel was already having trouble in his ears and therefore it was agreed to implant a hearing aid. But the dye poured into his ear would not come out. The commission noted that Patel’s claim that his deafness was due to Dr Pathak’s treatment was wrong as he was already suffering from the problem. However, it said it was negligence on the part of the doctor that he could not remove the material from the patient’s ear by using his skills. He did not consult or refer the case to a senior doctor, the commission observed. In 2010, the doctor was asked to pay Rs 50,000 to the patient as compensation for the treatment he had to take from another doctor. Dr Pathak moved the Gujarat State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission; his challenge was unsuccessful.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/after-21-years-victory-heard-in-botched-ear-operation-case/articleshow/88924030.cms||---

The brick manufacturers, who are ready to opt for cleaner technology, are sceptical that stringent laws may push the small and medium business owners out of the trade. The manufacturers are also sceptical about their future in the wake of the carbon phase down policy of the Centre.There are around 2,000 plus brick kilns in the state that provide direct and indirect employment to over three lakh people. According to estimates, the industry gives employment for 120-150 days in a year at an average wage of Rs 500 per head. Despite opting for ‘environment-friendly technology’, the brick kilns are still considered as a polluting industry and they are often under the lens of environmental activists.Jharkhand Pradesh Brick Manufacturers Association’s (JPBMA) president of Ranchi district, Abhay Tiwari, said that many brick kilns have upgraded to the fuel efficient zig-zag kilns from the old model of Fixed Chimney Bull’s Trench (FCBT), which was considered ‘highly polluting’. “In the 1990s, the brick kilns operators abided by the norms and switched to fixed chimney from the moving one and in 2003, they adopted the draft zig-zag model to improve efficiency and cut down on emissions,” JPBMA president Anant Kumar Singh said.The zig-zag kilns are fitted with boosters to burn the coal efficiently, thereby reducing its consumption to 60% than what was required in the FCBT model.Recently, the National Green Tribunal had passed an order to shut the operation of coal-based zig-zag kilns in Delhi in a phased manner to safeguard the severely polluted regions.Though Jharkhand has not passed any such order, Singh feared that in case it does so, the trade would go into the hands of big corporates.“Some of the manufacturers are switching to PNG and CNG-fueled kilns but that is going to be too expensive for the small traders,” Singh said.He pointed out that Jharkhand being a coal rich state, they would prefer using coal so that there is a balance between input and output cost. “There was an effort to push fly ash bricks but they are neither durable nor environment-friendly and hence, red bricks continued to remain the preferred building blocks since thousands of years,” he said.Last year in September, the JPBMA had requested the state government to exempt the brick kilns from obtaining the mandatory ‘environment clearance’ certificate for digging soil up to 2m and said that it should not be considered as mining.The association is still awaiting a response from the government. “The neighbouring states of West Bengal and Bihar have already exempted brick kilns from obtaining the EC certificate for digging soil up to 1.5m and it was allowed as per the letter issued by the ministry of forest and environment, Government of India on March 28, 2020,” he said, Singh added, “The MoEF has empowered the states to make their own rules for digging of clay,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/brick-kilns-want-exemption-from-green-norms/articleshow/88924038.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The deceased was identified by police as 45-year-old Ajay Saw. He belonged to Pitiz village in Itkhori block of Chatra. Saw’s cousin, Mahesh Kumar, said, “The accident occurred when he was working in Vinayak oxygen plant at Mayapuri in Delhi. While he was refilling an oxygen cylinder, it suddenly burst killing him on the spot.” Sources said since other relatives of Saw also work in the same plant, they tried to request police to conduct his postmortem. But the police officials refused to do so until someone from Saw’s immediate family reached there.After his nearest family members reached Delhi on Saturday, police initiated the process of conducting the autopsy. Chatra MP Sunil Singh of BJP and labour minister Satyanand Bhokta, who is the local MLA, are in touch with officials in Delhi to ensure that the body reaches Jharkhand by Sunday night or Monday morning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/chatra-man-dies-in-delhi-oxygen-plant-mishap/articleshow/88924039.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Cong MLA vows roads smoother than Kangana’s cheeks, embarrasses party||Ranchi: At a time when Congress has declared that it would reserve 40% of its tickets in the ensuing UP election for women, a Jharkhand MLA, Irfan Ansari from the grand old party, has courted controversy with his remarks on actor Kangana Ranaut. On Friday night, Ansari released a self-made video to announce new road projects for his constituency, promising to make them smoother than Kangana’s cheeks, leaving the state’s party unit embarrassed.In the video, he says, “Dear friends, Johar. I was waiting for kharmas (inauspicious month of the Hindu calendar) to end today to announce that 14 new important roads will soon come up in my constituency, which is home to several marginalised, poor and tribal people. They will now have access to better roads, which BJP could never make. The chief minister has approved the road projects recommended by me and the process of inviting tenders is on. I want to assure you that the roads will be smoother than filmi adakara (film actor) Kangana Ranaut’s cheeks.”In 2005, former railway minister of the then UPA government and RJD leader Lalu Prasad had grabbed headlines when he had claimed that he would make the roads of Bihar “as smooth as Hema Malini’s cheeks”. In December last year, a minister in the Maharashtra government and Shiv Sena leader Gulabrao Patil, too, made a similar distasteful statement at a function in Jalgaon district when he claimed that the roads in his constituency are smoother than that of BJP MP and veteran actor Hema Malini’s cheeks.Ansari’s statement about Kangana, considered close to BJP, hasn’t gone down well within the state party unit. While none preferred to come on record, senior party leaders criticised Ansari for landing the party in the soup time and again.“He (Ansari) must be taken to task by the party high command in Delhi for such distasteful comments. This isn’t the first time. In the last two years, he has been a motormouth MLA owing to which the party has faced several embarrassing moments,” remarked a very senior state party member. Another MLA added, “He (Ansari) does it for cheap publicity often. Unfortunately, in the age of the web and social media, it gets quick traction. But such statements often put the party in trouble at a time when the crucial assembly election is coming up.”Another senior leader, who is part of the state’s brass, maintained that the party doesn’t subscribe to his comments. “Congress has always been for women empowerment. In UP, this is our key poll plank as can be seen in the way our leader Priyanka Gandhi is taking up the cause. In Jharkhand, too, five women are MLAs and MP, which speaks about our commitment for the issue,”he said.However, speaking over the phone, MLA Ansari said, “It was just a slip of tongue and I didn’t intend to demean anyone. The main issue in my area was poor roads during the BJP regime, which are now set for an overhaul. I wanted to say that the roads will be world-class and flawless and Kanganaji’s name accidentally came up. I respect Kangana ji, who is also a Padma awardee.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cong-mla-vows-roads-smoother-than-kanganas-cheeks-embarrasses-party/articleshow/88924040.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Health minister promises to review RT-PCR test rates||Ranchi: Jamshedpur (East) MLA Saryu Rai has urged the government to bring down the rates that are being charged at the private labs for RT-PCR tests. On Friday, Rai wrote to the chief secretary, Sukhdev Singh, seeking reduction in the rates and questioned the lab’s logic behind charging a suspected Covid patient Rs 200 extra for home collection of his/her swab samples.Currently, as per the government’s approved rates, the private labs are charging Rs 400 for an RT-PCR test and Rs 600 if the lab staff is collecting the samples from the patient’s home. The additional Rs 200 is to cover the cost of the PPE gear and logistics. Though the government has not made it clear if the labs can charge the extra Rs 200 per person, the labs are taking full advantage of it and are charging per patient Rs 200 even if a particular home has more than one Covid patient.In his letter, Rai said that the government must bring down the test rates to below Rs 100 and that labs shouldn’t charge additional rates for home collection. He said, “I have come across many instances where private labs are charging Rs 200 per person for home collection. Even though the government has approved Rs 200 as an additional rate for home collection, it is not clear if they should take it per head or just Rs 200 for a home visit. It is perhaps the latter as irrespective of the number of members infected in a household, the technician is visiting that home to collect the samples only once. So why charge such a hefty amount?”Activist and founder of the NGO Life Saver’s, Atul Gera, questioned the government for charging such an exorbitant amount for an RT-PCR test when home testing kits are available at Rs 50 in the markets. He added, “This is the time when rates must be slashed drastically to encourage people to go for Covid tests so that the pressure on government labs is reduced. Moreover, when our government says that we are a poor state, it must keep the testing rates minimal to provide relief to the people.”When asked, state health minister Banna Gupta didn’t commit to immediately slashing the rates but assured to review the rates after speaking with his officials. He said, “I agree that labs should charge the extra Rs 200 per house visit only and not on the basis of the number of individuals who are infected. We will come out with an order soon that will bring more clarity on the issue. As far as the RT-PCR test rates are concerned, I will soon hold a meeting with the officials concerned to review the charges.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/health-minister-promises-to-review-rt-pcr-test-rates/articleshow/88924048.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Most of the students are still attending the personal engagements too so there shouldn’t be a discrimination only for schools,” vice president of Madhya Pradesh Private school owner’s association, Gopal Soni told TOI.

IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal, who on Saturday visited different parts of the city including Ahilya Paltan, Juna Risala, Secunderabad and Sadar Bazaar and reviewed cleaning of nullahs and sewage lines, expressed displeasure over alleged negligence at part of Indore zone-1 in charge Vinod Agrawal and drainage supervisor Yogesh Bilwal in discharging the assigned duties.The commissioner suspended both the officials after a sewage line was found choked and the chamber lids were found open.Pal inspected the works being done under the Ahilya Paltan river drain cleaning project and issued instructions to connect the domestic sewerage connections by laying a pipeline along the nullah on both sides of the locality.

In the same period, the daily Covid-19 infections more than doubled to 1104 on January 12 from 512 on January 05- a rise of 117%.HoD respiratory medicine MGM Dr Salil Bhargava said, “In the last one week, the hospitalised cases of Covid-19 have increased with rise in Covid-19 cases number.”“The disease is still milder. The lung involvement is minimal. Most of the patients are admitted with Upper respiratory infection with comorbid condition and are elderly”, said Dr Bhargava.Dr Bhargava further said, “In this current third wave, the only thing of worry is chances of absolute number of hospitalised numbers remaining high to pressurise health infrastructure with lower share against infected ones.”The possibility towards which Dr Bhargava is pointing is also being reflected in numbers. The hospitalisation rate of Covid-19 patients declined from 5.27% on January 6 to 3.41% on January 13 in respect to active cases corresponding to them in the district.MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit, also an epidemiologist, however differs on this school of thought that a very substantial number of severe cases will get hospitalised in the third wave.Dr Dixit said, “People following a school of thought are believing and saying that even delta variants cause severity in later phases causing very high hospitalisation so might be the case this time with Omicron.”“The evidence however is pointing towards a different picture that disease is milder in nature this time, not causing severe lung involvement. Based on that only the government changed its policy to home isolation, waiving of asymptomatic testing and other steps”, said Dr Dixit. The district now has 6026 active cases with around 200 hospitalised, 100 being in Covid care centres and the rest are in home isolation on Friday evening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/covid-hospitalisation-triples-in-a-wk/articleshow/88924053.cms||Antriksh Singh

Later, it was upgraded to the high school as the number of students increased and was moved to the present site. It was an English-medium school,” Urs said. Among other institution that will get funding are four schools in Chamarajanagar that cumulatively have 1,118 students, six schools in Chikkamagalur with 1,7553 students, five schools in Hassan which have 1,418 students in total, six in Shivamogga with 1,302 students, six in Kodagu with 1,289 students, and two schools in Mandya with 1,037 students. According to the authorities, the developmental work will be done through the PWD or the zilla panchayat engineering section. “Emphasis will be given to improving school infrastructure,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/143-century-old-schools-to-get-development-funds/articleshow/88924060.cms||Shrinivasa M

---||Mysuru||Plans afoot to remove invasive weed taking over BRT reserve||S RameshMysuru: The forest department has initiated a drive to remove lantana weeds that have invaded over 20,000 hectares of land in B R Hills Temple Tiger Reserve.As the weeds lead to green fodder scarcity for wild animals in the reserve, the department has planned to remove the weeds in a phased manner. Three NGOs including one Kerala-based agency have evinced interest and have come forward to remove the weed to protect the forest.This comes amidst neighbouring Bandipur and Nagarhole tiger reserves having launched the drive under rural employment guarantee scheme.Lantana, which is one of the world’s ten worst invasive species, now occupies 40% of the tiger habitat reserve, officials stated. This plant competes with native plants for space and resources, and also alters the nutrient cycle in the soil. The invasion has resulted in the scarcity of native forage plants for wild herbivores. In some cases, extensive feeding on lantana has led to diarrhoea, liver failure, and even fatalities. Excessive growth of these weeds will also result in forest fires during summer season, they added. Speaking to TOI, BRT Tiger Reserve project director and deputy conservator of forests Dr G Santhoshkumar, said his department has taken up the removal of lantana weeds through non-government organisations on an experimental basis.“However, the forest department has not yet finalised this project of removal of weeds through NGOs as it is seeking opinions from the environmental scientists,” he said.“Manual removal of lantana by employing labourers under MNREGA scheme, which also provides jobs to local tribals, is better than awarding such projects to NGOs as many of them are profit-oriented. Manual removal of lantana is safer to wild animals instead of using technology and machines in the forest,” said Punajanur Doreswamy, Chamarajanagar wildlife activist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/plans-afoot-to-remove-invasive-weed-taking-over-brt-reserve/articleshow/88924063.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Elder Line logs 5,000 cases across Karnataka in 8 months||MYSURU: After facing severe abuse and torture from their son for years, a senior citizen couple from Mysuru were lucky enough to receive help from the national helpline for senior citizens, also called the Elder Line, which rescued them. The couple were tortured for several years before a kin knocked on the doors of the Elder Line (14567) — a toll-free numbe — in September. The couple received assistance from taluk officers, including local police and finally the son was ousted from their home. Like them, as many as 152 senior citizens facing abuse from their family members were given support by the activists of the Elder Line across Karnataka in the last eight months and their concerns were promptly attended to. Bengaluru tops the table with 50 cases of abuse of senior citizens, followed by Belagavi with 11 cases, Mysuru with eight, Mandya and Shivamogga with six cases each, Hassan and Dakshina Kannada with four cases each and Dharwad with five cases. An initiative of the ministry of social justice and empowerment, the helpline works in association with state governments and non-profit organisations. It was operational from May 2021, and it was officially launched in October in Karnataka. In the last eight months, the elder line has addressed concerns of over 5,771 cases of senior citizens, and about 2.6% of them were related to abuse, according to the statistics. Another major concern about senior citizens was legal issues. As many as 238 senior citizens were extended help in matters concerning property share, gift deeds, partition suits, financial matters, and Insurance bonds. About 4.1% of cases were related to legal matters. Over 2,000 elderly citizens received Covid supportThe Elder Line had come to the rescue of over 2,428 senior citizens at a time when Covid cases were at peak between May and July. Over 2,000 elderly citizen received Covid support during three months, which include providing information about the vaccine, centres, hospital bed availability, supply of food to their doorsteps, and downloading of Covid certificates. Of late, there are inquiries about precautionary doses. About 42% of calls were related to Covid related concerns. Vijayalakshmi, project manager, Elder Line Karnataka, explained to TOI that awareness among people about the toll-free helpline is low. “There is a need to popularise it so that more citizens are benefitted,” she said. “According to our analysis, many senior citizens are not coming forward to complain about the abuse at home or in the family. We are also facing challenges in reaching out to callers from faraway places.” she added. “Recently, a 102-year-old woman from Gadag was rescued with help of police and other district officials after her family threw her out of home, accusing her of causing trouble. She is now being treated at a government hospital,” said Vijayalakshmi. “We have received appreciation letters from citizens benefitted by us too,” she added. Team leader Melwin Fernandez said about 15% of total cases were related to pension matters. The helpline is extending assistance to people aged 55 years and above. Majority of callers are senior citizens and in some cases, family members and neighbours have jumped to their help by calling the helpline. Calls to existing senior citizen helpline 1090 are being attended by the executive of Elder Line, which functions from 8am to 8pm. “There have been suggestions to function round the clock,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/elder-line-logs-5k-cases-in-8-months/articleshow/88924065.cms||Lawrence Milton

The new strain of the virus is extremely infectious, and the experts have pointed out that any delay in identifying those infected with the Omicron strain could result in the infection spreading unchecked very quickly. A private doctor pointed out that results, if delayed, would be of little use in effective management of patients. “Vaccination and improvement of healthcare infrastructure will help combat Covid more effectively,” he added. Thus far, two people have tested positive for the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus in Mysuru. But officials in Mysuru fear that, given the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the past week, there may be more people who have been infected with the new strain of the virus. Although the new variant is purportedly less severe than the Delta strain, people have been advised not to let their guard down, and adhere to safety protocol. The state government has announced its intention to open genomic sequencing laboratories in four places, besides Bengaluru. One of the proposed locations was Mysuru, but the laboratory is yet to commence operations in the city, which has impacted the battle against Covid. Thus far, samples collected from 500 people have been sent to NIV in Bengaluru to be subjected for genomic sequencing test. Officials in the health department in Mysuru said that the Delta strain accounted for most of the cases in the district. However, they have been issued directions to send samples of those who have returned from abroad, and from clusters to Bengaluru. Mysuru district surveillance officer Dr T Shivaprasad told TOI, “Of the 481 samples that were tested for the Omicron strain from Mysuru district, two have tested positive. One of those infected with the new strain was a nine-year-old girl, and the other a student. Both the patients have recovered from the infection. Samples are sent to NIV in Bengaluru, and owing to the burden on the facility, there is a delay in getting the result.” ‘Operations at laboratory will start soon’Dean and director of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute Dr HN Dinesh said that the genomic sequencing laboratory in Mysuru would commence operations soon. “Experts and technicians are holding trials, and the central government recently sent a letter of approval, giving its nod to start operations at the laboratory in Mysuru. We are awaiting the appointment of a few scientists, who will conduct the test. We will also require other staff to start full-fledged operations at the laboratory. The laboratory will be functional in a week’s time,” Dr Dinesh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/lack-of-genomic-sequencing-lab-hinders-dists-fight-against-covid/articleshow/88924067.cms||Lawrence Milton

State BJP president Vishnudeo Sai wrote a letter to chief minister Bhupesh Baghel reminding him that the Congress election manifesto had promised to provide an unemployment of Rs 2500 per month.“Big hoardings were erected in cities and towns by the Congress proclaiming its promise to give unemployment allowance to the 10 lakh youths, but no provision has been made for it in the budget during the last three years,” he said in his letter adding that as per the promise now the state government must pay the youth Rs 90,000 for the last three years. He urged the government to make a budgetary provision for unemployment in the budget for fiscal 2022-23. Meanwhile, state BJP spokesman Sanjay Shrivastava took a dig at the Congress government over its announcement to set up a Chhattisgarh employment council headed by chief minister saying that it’s ridiculous to promise to generate 12 to 15 lakh job in the next five years. “The government has come up with such decision as it has failed to provide unemployment allowance as promised in the Congress manifesto,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/bjp-attacks-cm-over-unemployment-allowance/articleshow/88924072.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ranthambore, Sariska forest cover dipped by 60 km2 in a decade||JAIPUR: Two popular tiger habitats in the state, Ranthambore and Sariska, have registered a decrease in forest cover over a decade, according to the latest report of the Forest Survey of India (FSI). The total area of Ranthambore (1,765.57 sqkm) decreased by 44.57 sqkm in forest cover while the forest cover of Sariska estimated to be 1,145.80 sqkm dipped by 15.95 sqkm in the FSI report. The report further stated that in Ranthambore, the majority of the loss is for open forest (OF) from 629.94 sqkm to 572.21 sq km. However, moderately dense forest (MDF) has witnessed a slight increase from 215.98 sq km to 229.14 sq km. The tiger reserve does not have very dense forest (VDF), the report noted. Experts claimed, efforts should be made to save the tiger habitat as the big cat population in Ranthambore has increased noticeably to 53 (figures mentioned in the report) and it has the fifth highest tiger density of 9.60 per 100 sq km. Dharmendra Khandal, conservation biologist of tiger watch said, “Over the years, large land parcels of the forest reserve in many areas including Baler range and Sevti area along with Chambal are encroached for agriculture. It’s a matter of grave concern as not only trees are chopped; even forest land for tigers is also grabbed.” An official source said, to protect the forest cover in Ranthambore the department should deploy more staff. “At present, there is an acute shortage of forest staff at Ranthambore. Though, the department has deployed mostly local home guards, who do not stop villagers for wood cutting,” As per the report, forest cover of the tiger corridor between Ranthambore-Kuno- Shivpuri- Madhav (Rajasthan- MP) has also reduced by 10.83 sq km area. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, an environmentalist and a lawyer said, “Tiger corridor between two states is an important link that should be protected. In the absence of corridors, the tiger habitat may become isolated, making the tigers vulnerable to inbreeding and local extinction in coming years,” The Sariska’s assessment between 2011 and 2021 shows that the very dense forest cover has witnessed a negligible increase of 1.59 sq km area, which is from 59.83 sq km to 61.12 km. The majority of the loss is for open forest from 437.09 sq km to 420.79 sq km. The moderately dense forest cover has witnessed a slight decrease from 284.74 sq km to 283. 80 sq km.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/rbore-sariska-forest-cover-dipped-by-60km2-in-a-decade/articleshow/88924075.cms||Ajay Singh

From 20-30 areas in Jaipur that were reporting cases till a few days ago, reports of infections are now coming from 90-100 areas. Cases are being reported from almost every part of the city, which has increased the number of active cases in the city significantly. However, the number of patients admitted to hospitals is quite less compared to people testing positive. In the state’s biggest dedicated Covid RUHS Hospital, the number of patients admitted is 60. Out of them, 20 are in ICU. “We have observed that the ratio of patients in ICU and in ward has increased over the past 20 days. Earlier, Covid patients in ICU was 5% and 95% were in the wards. Now 40% are in ICUs and 60% are in wards. This shows that gradually cases with severity has increased,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. In Jaipur, active cases have increased from 796 to 20,123 in two weeks, which shows the pace at which the virus has spread in January. In Jodhpur too, cases have been reported from rural and urban areas. On January 1, Jodhpur had only 126 active cases, which have now been increased to 4,344.

Our dispensaries across the city help us in identifying the contacts. We are also tracing Covid positives through our bike ambulances,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, CMHO, Jaipur (I).The health department is also contacting the infected person through phone calls, asking about their health in home isolation and others in the family. “We are focusing on tracing and identifying any high risk patient in the house, so that he can be ensured timely treatment for preventing deaths,” a health department official said. For tracing the contacts, it is crucial for the officials to locate them in time. However, the health officials said that tracing them is also challenging due to incomplete addresses and identifications. “It happens frequently that a patient's phone number is switched off or he has not given a clear and correct address.

---||India||In EV push, govt eases rules to set up charging stations||NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday powered up the EV (electric vehicles) charging ecosystem by allowing any individual or entity to set up public charging stations (PCS) without any licensing. It cleared the way for EV owners to charge their vehicles at home or offices from existing connections at domestic tariffs. The revised guidelines and standards for EV charging issued by the power ministry opened the doors for offering government land to government or public agencies and private entities for setting up PCS on a revenue-sharing basis. The move is an element of India’s plan to reduce the transport sector’s carbon footprint in line with its COP26 commitment. It will boost EV charging network plans of a slew of private and public sector companies, including Reliance-BP, Tata Power, Ola, IndianOil, among others. The liberalised norms will attract individuals and startups in the sector, which is expected to create livelihood opportunities and lead to mushrooming of PCS just like puncture repair shops — removing range anxiety. The guidelines lay down the target of one PCS in every three-square-km grid in mega cities and every 25 kms on connecting highways in the next three years. State capitals and their connecting highways are to be covered in the next 3-5 years. According to the new regulations, government or public agencies will be offered such land for a fixed payment of Re 1 per unit of electricity used for charging to the landowning agency in line with a 10-year model revenue-share agreement. For private entities, such land will be offered through bidding with a Re 1 per unit revenue share as the floor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-ev-push-govt-eases-rules-to-set-up-charging-stations/articleshow/88924066.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The inspections will be conducted on January 15, 16, 21 and 22,” said Arvind Saxena, superintendent engineer, employment guarantee scheme (EGS). The district collectors have been directed to form probe teams. It has also been directed to the probe teams to submit their reports to NREGA commissioner on the same day by 5:30 pm. With the Covid cases rising in the state, the demand for MGNREGA work is increasing among the villagers, who have been opting for it due to work shortage in other informal sectors. As per the government of India’s MGNREGA portal, 28.61 lakh people had registered for labour engagement on Saturday. “Currently there is a huge demand for NREGA work in rural areas. Many migrant workers, who returned to the state during lockdown last year, didn’t go back to their previous work place. These workers are now demanding NREGA work in the state. Apart from this, the increase in demand for work now is also because of suspension of NREGA work in Rajasthan in May and June due to second Covid wave,” said Saxena. “The demand of around 5-6 lakh workers, who couldn’t work in May and June, is getting captured now.

In a presser on Saturday, state BJP president Satish Poonia reminded CM Ashok Gehlot of the initial statements of JK Lon Hospital doctors and police claiming the victim suffered brutal rape and assault on January 11-12. “What has changed in the last two days is again a matter of investigation. It is, however, clear that the government’s contradictory stand has lost the faith of the victim and the family in getting justice,” said Poonia while calling for the CBI inquiry considering the government is working to cover up the matter. Responding to a question on why they (BJP) can’t wait for the police investigation to be completed, Poonia replied, “The doctors who conducted the surgery for three hours confessed to have not seen such an atrocity before and drawn the equivalence with the infamous Nirbhaya case of Delhi. Also, the police to the media didn’t hesitate in calling it rape raised serious doubt on the course of investigation after the denial of rape. Our concern is that if SIT has been constituted why the government has waited for it to complete the investigation and bring the truth before the world.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-govt-working-to-cover-up-rape-case-alleges-bjp/articleshow/88924083.cms||---

The minor allegedly took the extreme step following a rift with her father, who was taking her to hometown after schools and coaching classes were shut following a spike in Covid cases. Police said the girl was reportedly adamant on not packing her books and study materials as she intended to return to Kota after the curbs were lifted. Shikha Yadav, a resident of Madhopur in Bihar, allegedly jumped from the 6th floor of her hostel, Kunhari Station House Officer Ganga Sahay Sharma said, adding that the minor girl was immediately rushed to MBS Hospital, where doctors on duty declared her brought dead. While her father was packing her luggage, books and study materials, the girl climbed to the 6th floor and jumped, the SHO said. No suicide note was recovered from the girl.

He said, “Fulfilling this responsibility, the state government has left no stone unturned in formulating schemes related to the welfare of the differently abled. Friendly facilities for such people have been made available in all government offices of the state.” In last year’s budget, he had announced plans to upgrade the special school into a college. It started as a deaf and mute school in 2002 during Gehlot’s first term and then it was upgraded as a senior secondary school during his second term in 2010. He said, “The journey of this school, established with the aim of providing quality education to deaf and mute children, has been possible only with the help of donors and service-oriented people.” Social justice and empowerment minister Tikaram Julie said with the opening of deaf and mute colleges in Jaipur and Jodhpur, such children will get an opportunity to complete their higher education from the same college. He said that in the last three years, the state government has implemented various schemes and programs for the welfare of the differently-abled. Recruitment reservations for specially qualified persons have been increased to 5%. Apart from this, customized Scooty distribution has also been started for specially abled persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/top-priority-is-to-ensure-good-life-for-disabled-people-cm/articleshow/88924086.cms||---

The scientific clearance to remove the structures from the encroached land was recently acquired by the fort from the state animal husbandry department. The discovery has strengthened the historians’ claims that the fort which was constructed in 1570 CE was the most modern one and was equipped with the latest security features. Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556-1605 CE) was regular to Ajmer from 1570 CE to 1582 CE with a record of visiting Ajmer every year during the period. Emperor Jahangir (1569 CE-1627 CE) stayed for three years from 1613 CE to 1616 CE eyeing on his vast kingdom. "The bastions were made to strengthen the fort walls and to provide additional space for armouries like passage for hot oil and later guns. The diameter of these bastions ranges between 16 feet to 30 feet which made it impossible for any invasion. The discovery will help us in re-designing the changing shapes of the fort during the Mughal period," said department of archaeology and museums, Ajmer division circle superintendent, Neeraj Tripathi. The second discovery is that of the pedestal for firing canon. "The fort was also a revenue collection point for Mughals of the entire region. Records say that at one point in time, 29% of the total revenue was kept at the Daulat Khana in Ajmer fort. Mughals had left no means to make the fort mark of their strength. The cannon pedestal was a showcase of their strength," said Tripathi. After Mughals, the fort slipped into the hands of the Marathas and subsequently Britishers. The fort was subjected to widespread encroachments until the formation of Rajasthan. "The clearance work becomes possible only after the government veterinary hospital was vacated last year. I am expecting that once the entire encroachment is removed, many missing links can be traced to bring back the lost glory of the fort," said Tripathi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ajmer/3-bastions-among-many-structures-discovered-at-akbar-fort-in-ajmer/articleshow/88928010.cms||Shoeb Khan

Police were yet to ascertain the reasons why he committed suicide. According to the police the relatives of the man identified as Anil Meena, a native of Choth Ka Barwada, had admitted him to the de-addiction centre on December 31, 2021 since he was addicted to narcotics. “In the evening, some of the inmates at the de-addiction centre saw Meena hanging from the ceiling and informed the staff and other members. They later intimated us,” said a senior police officer of City (Chowki) Sawai Madhopur. A team of senior police officers rushed to the spot. “He was brought down and was rushed to the hospital where he was declared brought dead,” the officer added. Police stated that the preliminary investigation suggested that the victim was addicted to some narcotics and he was unable to get it at the de-addiction centre and this could be the reason why he took the extreme step. It is too early to reach at any conclusion. Prima facie it appears that his urge to get his narcotics to which he was addicted could be the reason behind the suicide. We are investigating to ascertain the concrete reason behind the suicide,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/man-commits-suicide-in-sawai-madhopur-de-addiction-centre/articleshow/88924088.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Customs staff detain receivers of smuggled gold for first time||JAIPUR: Over a week ago, customs officials had seized around 600 grams of gold from a passenger who landed here and detained two persons who had come to receive the man. According to officials, this was the first time in many years that they managed to catch the persons who were supposed to receive the gold. During investigation, it was found that the receivers were merely cab drivers and they were still trying to connect the dots in the network. Moreover, officials have also seen a shift from Dubai to Sharjah in the recent seizures of gold smuggling. A customs official told TOI, “Usually, we never catch the person/persons who come to receive the gold, but in the last case we were able to.” “The carrier did not know who he was supposed to meet but our team posing as passengers went outside the airport and detained two persons who turned out to be taxi drivers. They knew the passenger by face,” the official said. Customs officials intercepted one passenger who arrived by Air Arabia flight from Sharjah last week. On examination of his checked-in baggage in the x-ray machine, dark images of some objects inside the electric meat grinder machine was noticed. On being inquired, the passenger denied being in possession of or carrying any such items and could not provide any satisfactory explanation. On dismantling the machine, six solid biscuits of fine gold (of 99.99% purity) duly packed in a small black plastic box wrapped by black carbon plastic sheet of multi layers were found concealed. Earlier too, customs officials intercepted a woman passenger and seized over 600 gram of gold from her which she had hidden in her undergarments. Prior to this, the passenger was apprehended with around 500 gram of gold. In all these cases, the passengers landed from Sharjah in the early hours. The official added, “The smugglers keep changing their destinations and starting points. Since there was a lot of focus on Dubai, now we are getting more carriers from Sharjah. In the recent case, the passenger actually travelled from Riyadh to Sharjah and then to Jaipur to avoid detection.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/customs-staff-detain-receivers-of-smuggled-gold-for-first-time/articleshow/88924098.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

One hooper each is provided in 100 wards, but it is not sufficient to carry out the task. Recently, Civil Lines has received eight new hoopers, but the condition is yet to improve. Rekha Rathore, councillor of Ward 47 from Civil Lines zone, who went to distribute kites in her neighbourhood, said that people complained about garbage everywhere. “People have been registering around 100 complaints every day despite cabinet minister Pratap Singh Khachairyawas belonging to this area. We have written hundreds of times to corporations, but with just one hooper things will remain the same. We need new hoopers immediately,” said Rathore. Every zone has invited its own tenders for renting new hoopers, but only Civil Lines and Adarsh Nagar zones have received new hoopers. Amber and Hawa Mahal zone are yet to receive the hoopers. The number of hoopers supplied is also not satisfactory and corporation officials said that it will take around a month to receive at least 100 hoopers. “Slowly hoopers are getting ready and amended as per the need of the corporation. We are sure that within a month, around 100 hoopers will arrive in every ward and the rest will keep on coming,” said a corporation official anonymously. One hooper each ward is not enough due to which garbage depots are back in their original place. Many new depots have emerged with people not having any option on how to clean up the space. Councillor Umar Daraj said that he has received so many complaints from people but due to fewer resources they are left with no option than to wait for new hoopers. In Gangori market, a resident Kamal Kumar said that twice he was slipped due to the drains being choked up with garbage. Although once corporation cleaned up the garbage but now things have again gone to a similar situation, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/lack-of-trash-vehicles-hits-heritage-hygiene/articleshow/88924100.cms||---

JJM is a target-based Central government programme. The state has also expressed that the programme can be expedited if the Centre increases its share from 50% to 90%. JJM has set a target of providing tap water connections in 1.01 crore rural households in the state by the end of 2024. Of the total target of 1.01 crore rural households, 22.40 lakh households have installed FHTC as of January 15. This is 22.08% of the total target. "By the end of the financial year 2021-22, the target was to achieve at least 50% of the tap connections which cannot be achieved with a couple of more months in hand," said a state government official. The primary task of survey has been done in less than 24,000 villages against 43,323 villages. "The survey will determine the rainfall pattern, water resources, groundwater table, drought situation, water bodies, etc., which will help the state to prepare a framework for the tap connections in the villages," said an official. However, the state is leading in constituting village-level water and sanitation committees with almost every village having one. Other than the sustainable water resources, the state has to ensure that every FHTC has 55 litres of piped water supply per person.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-may-miss-tap-connection-target-this-year/articleshow/88924103.cms||---

Health officials, however, suspect that the drop may be due to holidays and that the numbers may shoot up once again after commercial activities resume from Monday. Two deaths were recorded on Friday, of which one male was unvaccinated, while a female was partially vaccinated. On Friday, 2,986 fresh cases were recorded in the city, while the district registered 273 cases. On Saturday, 2,215 tested positive in the city, while the district got 282 positive cases. “The drop in positive cases could be because of the Uttarayan holiday and long weekend and the cases will increase as routine commercial activity restarts. As people did not go out on work, hence the number of tests also dropped,” said a health official. As against 26,800 tests on Friday, there was a drop of 7,000 tests on Saturday with only 19,400 people tested. “Test results of those samples which were sent earlier this week were declared in last two days and due to delay in results the number of positive cases were high. In the next two days, the actual picture will get clear,” a health official said. A 45-year-old unvaccinated man who was admitted in New Civil Hospital (NCH) since January 13 died on Friday. The man was addicted to liquor and had complained of breathing problems after which he was hospitalized. A 75-year-old woman suffering from diabetes and blood pressure too died on Friday.

Vaishnavi Bham was mauled to death on January 7 and her dismembered head and body was found from a nearby sugarcane farm. The leopard of around eight years of age is likely to be kept either in a rescue centre or shifted to a zoo. “It is not likely that the leopard will be released in the forest again. Further actions will be taken in accordance with directives from the department,” said a forest official. The minor had gone missing while following her mother near their home in the outskirts of the village. Her father, Rahul, a labourer, had come to Tapi for labour work with his family from Khargone village of Madhya Pradesh. Total 10 cages and 10 trap cameras were installed around the spot where the body was recovered. “The caged female leopard is the same leopard that killed the girl. Its age and pugmarks match the marking we found from the spot,” said a forest official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/leopard-which-killed-3-yr-old-girl-caged/articleshow/88924110.cms||---

Speaking on the side-lines of the workshop for snake rescuers, DCF Dinesh Kumar YK said this is probably the first of its kind initiative taken up in the state. Those genuine wildlife rescuers are being identified and soon they will be provided with an authorization letter they need to have with them during a rescue operation. “Henceforth, every rescue undertaken across the district will be documented. Details will include the species name and other related details, the place it was rescued from and the forest area it was released to, along with the name of the rescuer involved. This will help us understand the areas that have high presence of the reptile as well as the number of venomous and nonvenomous snakes rescued,” he said. The DCF decided to launch this programme, following the death of a snake rescuer recently. A preliminary meeting was held in Mangaluru last month. Rescue procedures taught in detail by resource personsDinesh Kumar said, “It is unfortunate there are many snake rescuers who are not aware of the procedures to be followed during a rescue and end up suffering a snake bite or hurting the animal. The resource persons have explained in detail the measures to be taken during a rescue operation as well as the first aid practices to be followed. Their responsibility ends only after releasing the reptile in the wild or handing it over to the forest department.” “We have also observed several social media rescuers who end up torturing the reptile in the name of rescue. Identification of genuine rescuers is the need of the hour and is also an attempt to curb illegal snake venom trade and attempt to threaten victims using snakes. This initiative has been appreciated by minister S Angara as well as experts from Kerala and Bengaluru,” DCF Dinesh said. On priority, a list of shortlisted rescuers will be finalised range wise and authorisation letters will be issued in a week. Resource persons present at the workshop included expert rescuers Manoj from Kerala, Rajesh from Bengaluru and veterinary doctors including Dr Yashasvi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/forest-department-identifies-snake-rescuers-trains-them/articleshow/88924112.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

This is essential for the welfare of truck owners, as well as the formation of guidelines and strict implementation of the same, said advocate and advisor to Dakshina Kannada Truck Owners Association, Kumar Sathyanarayan. “The association is looking for the formation of an authority, so that their voice can be heard by the government. It was a rare opportunity for the truck owners to be part of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) meeting held on Thursday,” he said. Dakshina Kannada Truck Owners Association president Sunil D’Souza said there are several issues that need to be monitored. There are around 6 lakh trucks in Karnataka, and Dakshina Kannada has around 5,000 of them. The loading movement per day in the city is around 8,000. “Overloading and absence of fixed fares for trucks are matters of concern. Violations are high in terms of overloading. While the carrying capacity for a 10-wheel truck is 20 tonnes, there have been instances where such trucks have carried up to 30 tonnes. Overloading will also result in the movement of fewer trucks, because of which owners will face a financial crisis. It is not only risky, but overloaded trucks will have an impact on the roads. Also, while fares for autorickshaws and buses are decided by the RTA, there is a need to regulate the fares for trucks. These days, fares are decided by agents,” he said.They also urged the government to issue road closure warnings much in advance, to prevent trucks from being stranded at certain points for days. “It is common during the monsoon, for the ghat section to be closed following landslides. It would be ideal if the administration has a plan in place, and alternative routes are announced much in advance,” said D’Souza. They also hoped that the proposed truck terminal in the city, that is expected to have facilities, including a fuel refilling station, restaurant, restrooms, clinic, police outpost, spare parts shops, warehouse and lodges for the convenience of truck drivers and employees, will be commissioned at the earliest. Meanwhile, deputy commissioner K V Rajendra has assured to call for a meeting of truck owners at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/truck-owners-ask-govt-to-set-up-body-to-monitor-ops/articleshow/88924115.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Covid Care Centres reopened amid surge||Mangaluru: The spiking Covid-19 curve in Dakshina Kannada in the past one week has prompted the district administration to restart operations at Covid Care Centres (CCCs), which had been shut when the curve flattened in the aftermath of the second wave. In all, 36 CCCs had been set up across the coastal district during, and for a brief time after the second wave of Covid-19. However, as and when the active caseload in the district dropped to below 100, all the centres were closed.Unfortunately, the active caseload in Dakshina Kannada is now inching close to the 3,000-mark and the health department has decided to reopen 15 of the CCCs, where 190 are currently being treated.Dakshina Kannada district health officer Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI, “Medical officers at primary health centres (PHCs) will monitor patients currently isolated at home, and decide on whether they need to be shifted to CCCs. Most of those who have contracted the infection in Dakshina Kannada are currently quarantined at their homes. Patients living in houses where effective isolation is not feasible will be shifted to CCCs, and more such centres will be opened if required.”As on Friday, the active caseload in Dakshin Kannada stood at 2,990, of whom only 184 are being treated at hospitals – 165 of them in private hospitals, and 19 at government hospitals – while 190 are spread across various CCCs. Nearly 87% of the Covid patients are isolated at home.More than 95% of the Covid patients isolated at home were displaying no symptoms of the infection, said Dr Kumar. “At the height of the second wave of Covid, we distributed medicine kits containing paracetamol, Vitamin C supplements and anti-biotic tablets to those quarantined at home. But members of the Dakshina Kannada District Technical Advisory Committee have suggested that such a measure is not necessary this time around, since the medicines could be wasted. So, we have decided to provide medicines based on feedback from the health department personnel who have been deployed to ascertain the condition of patients quarantined at home,” the DHO said.Dr Kumar added that the district had sufficient stock of medicines for Covid-19 patients currently being treated at government hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/covid-care-centres-reopened-amid-surge/articleshow/88924120.cms||Vinobha K T

The two new vehicles will be deployed in Yeola and Baglan talukas to vaccinate beneficiaries with the help of NGO. Already, six such vehicles are deployed in the tribal talukas of Peth, Surgana, Igatpuri and Trimbakeshwar.Kailas Bhoye, district woman and child development officer of Nashik ZP, who is also supervising the vaccination programme across the rural areas, said, an NGO Jivika Health Care Pvt Ltd has joined us for the vaccination programme. The NGO will be helping in the vaccination in the two talukas.The four ambulances for the vaccination on wheels programme which were started in the tribal talukas of the district are also showing good results. The innoculators are going to the most remote parts of the talukas to get the beneficiaries vaccinated. The more the number of people get vaccinated, the lesser would be the risk of catching the Covid-19 infection or the need of hospitalization even if anyone catches the infection.Kailas Bhoye added that under the guidance of senior officials of the Nashik district administration and Nashik ZP, various initiatives are being taken up to ensure that all the beneficiaries get vaccinated at the earliest. In Yeola and Baglan talukas, about 80% of the beneficiaries have taken the first dose and the number of people, who have taken the second dose is much lesser. On this backdrop, the project vaccination on wheels through the two ambulances of Jivika Health is being implemented.

After the second wave of the pandemic, the stress is being laid on ensuring ample storage of oxygen and hence, six more Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tanks have been installed here. Of the six, the work on two tanks is in progress while the others are ready for use. Dr Raghunath Bhoye, the civil surgeon of Dhule district, said, “The focus, as suggested by the task force, is on the pediatric care, availability of oxygen and treatment. Hence, around 80 beds for pediatric purposes – some for the dual purpose (even adults) have been planned.” Bhoye said that apart from the Dhule Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) and the district civil hospital, the LMO tanks have also been installed at Shirpur, Pimpalner and Dondaicha to ensure that the people do not have to travel distances for getting treatment. “The plan will ensure that the people get treatment at facilities near their home instead of forcing them to visit the headquarters. The Dhule district also has 300 ICU beds and 160 ventilator beds to treat critically ill people. These beds are shared by Dhule district hospital, the Government Medical College Hospital and the Dhule corporation. The district has also made provision for over 5,000 isolation beds to ensure every person gets a bed if and when required. “The isolation beds have been made available through the district Covid hospitals, the District Covid Health Centres (DCHC), and the Covid Care Centres (CCC) spread across the rural areas.

At present, no patient has been admitted to this ICU.”Initially, Ahmednagar civil hospital had two ICUs, including the one that was gutted in the fire. But after the mishap, both the ICUs ceased to operate for different reasons.While the one which was burnt was sealed by the district police for investigation, the other one was also closed for conducting checks of the electrical equipment and other gadgets there.Hospital sources said that the district police are in the process of handing over the gutted ICU to civil hospital management, and after that, it would be completely renovated.“The other Intensive Care Unit, which too was shut down, is being examined by PWD to ensure that all fire safety gadgets are in place. Once ready, it would again be made operational,” officials said.The Ahmednagar unit of the Indian Medical Association had stressed the need for the civil hospital to at least have one ICU since a large section of the district population gets admitted to the civil hospital for Covid treatment.“We are also in the process of setting up a 60-bed ICU and a 42-bed paediatric ICU in our hospital. The initial process has already been started for both these ICUs. We are trying to set them up as quickly as possible,” added the acting civil surgeon.Dr Ramtakke said that although Covid-19 cases are rising in the district, most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/ahmednagar-civil-hospital-gets-covid-icu-after-2-months/articleshow/88924130.cms||---

The officials said the land will be bought from the landholders through private negotiations or it would be acquired as the case may be. This is the first instalment that the administration has received. The process of announcing the valuation of the land is being carried out. “Soon after the rates are announced, the process of making payments and transferring land to the government will be initiated by the administration. This is going to take some time even as the administration is keen to finish the work at the earliest,” said the senior officer.Speaking on the farmers’ opposing the land acquisition process, the officer said all the queries and objections were answered by the administration. There may be some who still have doubts and they can seek the help of the administration for the same.

Recognising the need for seers and pilgrims for identifying important places in the vast mela area like police stations, toilets, lost and found centre, mela authorities would be having special marking which would ease the identification of the respective facility. Foremost among these is putting up special coloured balloons on police stations which will highlight them from far away thereby making it easy for anyone to locate them in times of need. These balloons have been so designed that the details of the place, over which a given balloon would be flying in the air, would be mentioned in bold large letters. This has been done with the aim that the devotees coming to the vast mela area can spot the balloon from far away and get an idea as to in which direction they have to proceed to reach to the given police station. A similar arrangement has been made for the identification of lost and found centres and toilets. While similar balloons will be installed for marking the lost and found center, coloured lights will be arranged on the toilets for marking them.

Maurya is a native of Kaushambi.The deputy chief minister kick-started his political journey in 2004 by contesting the state polls for the first time in the by-elections from Allahabad West seat from Bhartiya Janata Party. But the results were not encouraging for BJP as Keshav polled a distant third while Bahujan Samaj Party’s Raju Pal won the seat and Khalid Azim of Samajwadi Party came second.In 2007, Maurya contested the elections from Allahabad West seat on BJP ticket once more but again the result was similar (Keshav coming third) though bagging more votes than his first outing. He was behind the winner Pooja Pal of BSP and the runner-up Khalid Azim alias Ashraf of SP. However, he finally emerged as a first-time MLA from Sirathu defeating BSP’s Anand Mohan in 2012 and has never looked back since then. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, he entered the fray from Prayagraj’s (then Allahabad) Phulpur parliamentary constituency, that was once the seat of former PM Jawaharlal Nehru, and won it. This was the first ever win on the seat for BJP when Keshav had defeated Dharam Raj Singh Patel of SP while Kapilmuni Karwariya came third and Mohhamad Kaif from Congress came fourth.In April 2016, Maurya was declared the party’s state chief by BJP the then president Amit Shah and in 2017, BJP came to power in the state with him at the helm of the party in UP. He was made the Deputy CM, widely seen as the party’s acknowledgement of his role in the win in the state. In 2017 he had resigned from Phulpur MP and was made an MLC by the party.There was talk of him fighting from Sirathu this time for the past many months. This was fuelled by the fact that he has been very active in Kaushambi district for quite some time now. Sheetla Prasad of BJP is the sitting MLA from Sirathu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/maurya-fought-1st-time-in-2004-from-west-seat/articleshow/88924139.cms||---
---||Allahabad||In Covid shadow, over 10L take holy dip during first major snan at Magh Mela||Prayagraj: Under the shadow of Covid-19, around 10.5 lakhs devotees took the holy dip on the two days of Makar Sankranti during the first major snan of the ongoing Magh Mela. Of these, around 6.5 lakh had taken the holy dip on Friday while around 4 lakh arrived at the mela area on Saturday.Around 2.25 lakhs devotees had taken the holy dip by 12 noon. The figures increased to 3 lakhs by 2pm. By the end of the day, a total of around 4 lakh people had taken the holy dip at different ghats of Magh Mela area.As the festival was divided for two days, large numbers of devotees had taken the holy dip on Friday itself. However, as per Hindu astrological calculation, since the sunrise of Saturday was under the shubh muhurat (auspicious timing) of Sankranti, all the prominent seers, their disciples and large number of devotees took the holy dip on Saturday.The 47-day religious congregation Magh Mela-2022 had formally begun with the first official snan of Makar Sankranti at the Sangam ghats in Prayagraj on Friday where over 10.5 lakhs devotees had taken holy dip. However, an equal number of devotees arrived at the ghats of river Ganga and Sangam, on Saturday as well. “Around 2.25 lakh devotees had taken holy dip by 12 noon and by the end of the day around 4 lakh pilgrims took the holy dip with no untoward incident reported from any of the five and one sub-sector of the vast mela area,” said Mela Adhikari, Shesh Mani Pandey.Devotees had started arriving in large numbers from Thursday onwards and continued to come all through Friday and Saturday. Defying the winter chill and overcoming the fear of Covid-19, the devotees arrived from different districts of the state and neighbouring states too.In view of the rush of devotees, traffic diversions were put in place at all the entry points of Prayagraj district. Railways and UP State Roadways Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) had made various arrangements for the devotees.Despite efforts and repeated appeals to the pilgrims to observe social distancing and wear face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19, most visitors were seen violating the set norms. However, less rush of pilgrims this time around eased the situation somewhat as the usual scene of pilgrims taking the dip shoulder-to-shoulder at the bathing ghats was not commonly visible. To check the spread of coronavirus in the mela area, the authorities kept on announcing the importance of wearing masks.“On the second day of the holy bathing on the festival of Makar Sankranti, around 1,25,000 masks were distributed in the Mela area by 12 noon. Out of these, about 55,000 masks were distributed at Sangam nose itself. Though about 25 Covid help desks have been set up in the Mela area, awareness is being spread about the compliance of Covid protocol and people are being given help as per their needs,” said the Mela Adhikari. Makar Sankranti snan is the second most important snan during Magh Mela after Mauni Amavasya which falls on February 1 this year. The Magh Mela will end with Maha Shivratri snan (bathing) on March 1. This time, announcements for following Covid-19 protocols dominated the sounds of bhajan and kirtans. At the 16 odd entry points, pilgrims were allowed in the mela area only after thermal scanning. Prayagraj divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal and other officers were personally appealing to pilgrims to vacate ghats immediately after taking the dip to prevent crowding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/in-covid-shadow-over-10l-take-holy-dip-during-first-major-snan-at-magh-mela/articleshow/88924140.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Residents of twin cities remain indoors despite ‘Sankranti Kari’||Dharwad/Hubballi: The near-complete silence at the otherwise bustling commercial hubs across twin cities reflected the willingness of the residents of Hubballi-Dharwad to comply with the restrictions imposed owing to the weekend curfew. The spurt in Covid-19 cases across the district has also been cited as one of the reasons that could have deterred people from venturing outdoors on Saturday.Although it was the day after Makara Sankranti, which is celebrated as ‘Sankranti Kari’ in North Karnataka, residents appeared content to partake of the festivities among family members at their homes. While it is customary for people to visit fields or the banks of a lake, where the rituals that mark Sankranti Kari are usually performed, most residents of the twin cities had completed these rituals on Friday, to prevent having to step outside on Saturday.As was the case last week, stores selling fruits, vegetables, fuel stations, hospitals and clinics remained open, while eateries offered takeaway services. However, most restaurants reported poor business, as very few orders came their way.Subhas Road, among the busiest thoroughfares in Dharwad, witnessed very little traffic, while the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) terminals wore a deserted look, with few people boarding the buses. Both BRTS and North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) operated very few buses on Saturday.Meanwhile, police had placed barricades on some of the thoroughfares to prevent crowding. Old PB Road in the heart of Dharwad witnessed little to no movement of people from dawn till dusk. Notwithstanding the compliance of the people, police intensified patrolling on the streets of the twin cities, more so in the densely populated areas, where those found loitering around with no valid reason were asked to return home.Essential services openWeekend curfew evoked good response in Hubballi. Although there was no rampant police checking, citizens remained at home and ventured out only to buy essential commodities. Essential services like hospitals, pharmacies, provision stores, vegetable and fruit shops, hotels and milk booths remained open, but they received weak response.However, there were some instances of people venturing out without sufficient reasons and police deployed at strategic points imposed penalty on such violators. NWKRTC operated its basic services to other cities and districts without much passengers. Though auto rickshaws were available, their number was meagre owing to weak movement of people. As it was Sankranti holiday, banks, government and private offices remained closed. Indira Gandhi Glass House, Nrupatunga Betta, Unkal Lake Garden, Sanjeevini Park and other public places remained closed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/residents-of-twin-cities-remain-indoors-despite-sankranti-kari/articleshow/88924142.cms||---

It was done under Section 41(1) of the Biodiversity Act 2002, to protect 92 trees, 77 tamarind and 15 neem, on both sides of the state highway. The forest department claims it’s a first of its kind move in North Karnataka. The Hasire Usiru Social Welfare Society submitted a petition to the president of the Karnataka Biodiversity Board that these trees be declared a heritage site. The committee took into consideration that these trees provide shelter for wildlife, carbon sequestration, release of oxygen, shade, soil conservation, and creation of microclimate. “These 92 trees are more than 100 years old and they could be alive for the next 200-300 years. Tamarind and neem trees are 40 ft tall and more than 2 metres in circumference. The committee hasn’t given the heritage tag just because these are a century old, but aspects such as ecological value and cultural and historical significance were considered. The heritage tag will help conserve and protect them,” said Mahesh Marennavanar, range forest officer, territorial wing, Byadagi. Ganganna Yali, a committe member, said tamarind and neem trees were under threat due to development and road widening. “We declared it a Biodiversity Heritage Site to conserve and protect them. Before cutting these trees, permission should be taken from the Biodiversity Management Committee. If the committee rejects the proposal, they cannot cut them down,” he added. Dr Prakash Basle, another panel member, pointed out that trees are our lifeline and we have to conserve and protect them. Tamarind and neem trees provide shelter for many birds and insects and shade to people. “This is a first in North Karnataka and we’ll tag more trees in our jurisdiction as heritage sites,” he said. ‘Tag will help’“Many old trees that have ecological and biological value have been cut down for development. The heritage tag will help them,” said Nandish Veeranagoudra, member, Hasire Usiru Social Welfare Society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/old-tamarind-and-neem-treesget-biodiversity-heritage-tag/articleshow/88924145.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

We need to keep improving because the girls don't want to be a one-day wonder,” Schopman said during a virtual press conference ahead of Asia Cup.“They want to be right up there and play against the best of the world to their potential.”After the Olympics, the Indian women played just one game in the Asian Champions Trophy in Donghae, South Korea last month when they were forced to pull out of the event after one player tested positive for Covid-19.“Since Olympics we played just one game. The Asia Cup is very important to us as it is a qualifying tournament for the World Cup. There is plenty of stake at place,” the coach said.The top four team from the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held between January 21-28 at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in Muscat, will directly qualify for this year's World Cup.Schopman said her coaching style is simple: “work on your individual game and try to be dominant" over the opponents.”“As a coach I have a clear philosophy. I would like us to be more dominant when in possession. We need to work our game and strike a balance between attack and defence. The thing which we have learnt from Tokyo is that we need to focus on what we can control and can do ourselves,” she said.“We need to figure out what we are good at on the pitch and see work on our shortcomings.”Veteran goalkeeper Savita Punia, who will lead the side in the Asia Cup in the absence of regular skipper Rani Rampal who is recovering from an injury, said Tokyo Games is a thing of the past as a busy season awaits, which includes two big-ticket events -- the Asian Games and the Commonwealth Games.“The whole year is important for us. We have 3-4 major tournaments lined up including the CWG and Asian Games. Besides we will also make our debut at the FIH Pro League this year.”“Our main focus is to qualify for the World Cup through Asia Cup and then win the Asian Games to directly qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/want-to-prove-tokyo-wasnt-a-one-day-wonder-says-womens-hockey-coach-schopman/articleshow/88924160.cms||---

The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has cleared public objections it received over the policy and sent it to the Chandigarh administration for final notification. Since the C&D waste policy is a new one, it will be notified by the Punjab governor and UT administrator in consultation with senior officials of the Chandigarh administration. Sources said that the civic body authority had received around half a dozen public objections over the C&D waste policy. These were scrutinised on merit and discussed. In the case of two objections, the authority made changes before proposing notification. The two objections were related to annual charges and jurisdiction in case of dispute. “The increase on annual charges under the C&D waste policy was fixed at 10% and was decreased to 5% based on the objection, as it was found genuine. Besides, earlier, disputes were decided by the MC commissioner and courts will also do so. After making these changes, the file has been sent to the UT administration for consideration and to issue the notification,” sources in the MC said. Since the Chandigarh administration had approved the draft rules of the C&D Waste Policy aiming to reuse 100% C&D waste in the city after recycling, the UT will give various options to residents to bring C&D waste to its plant in Industrial Area. The UT is aiming to get C&D waste of Panchkula and Mohali as well. After processing raw material, the machines recycle aggregates such as stones, gravel and a mix of debris to make concrete and related material. The recycled concrete goes into making tiles, curb channels and paver blocks, which the MC uses in different works. Silt, which is one of the by-products, is used in filling jobs on the construction sites. The Chandigarh MC's C&D waste plant was even selected as a model unit in the country and former MC commissioner K K Yadav was called for a presentation in Visakhapatnam to Smart City project representatives from various cities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/finally-chd-mc-all-set-to-notify-cd-waste-policy/articleshow/88924161.cms||Deepak Yadav

Although the BJP managed to win the mayoral election, but since the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has the maximum number of elected councillors, the first-timers are ready to corner the saffron party on key issues.Besides AAP, the Congress, with seven municipal councillors, is also preparing to keep the BJP in check. The saffron party may not find it easy to run the civic body the way it did in its last term, when it had full majority.The role of senior officers of the authority will also become more crucial mainly to run the proceedings of the monthly general house and keep everyone together to resolve major issues and make policy decisions. “Since many agenda items of a crucial nature, including the matter related to removal of the garbage dump from the dumping ground of Daddumajra, proper functioning of the garbage processing plant, C&D waste policy etc need proper and useful discussion, we are hoping that all the newly-elected councillors will understand the importance of these issues besides others and come together for the betterment of the city,” an MC official said.Suggestion of the training camp for newly-elected municipal councillors came in the last monthly general house, when a former municipal councillor raised the issue, saying that training was important to understand the role of councillors in the MC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/newly-elected-councillors-get-lowdown-on-mc-procedures/articleshow/88924163.cms||---

However, in the last MC constituted in the year 2016, out of nine nominated councillors, five persons having affiliations with BJP were nominated as councillors in contrary to the objectives of the Act.”Naming BJP leaders selected as nominated councillors in the past, Chawla wrote, “Kamla Sharma; the first mayor of the city and a senior BJP leader, Sachin Kumar Lohtiya, a former president of the SC Morcha of BJP who was even an aspirant for BJP ticket for the MC Elections 2016, Haji Mohd Khurshid Ali, president of minority morcha of the BJP and Sat Prakash Aggarwal; a former elected councillor who switched over his affiliation to the BJP, and Shipra Bansal; the daughter of general secretary of the BJP’s Mahila Morcha Sabina Bansal, were nominated as nominated councillors.”Chandigarh Congress members said that there were speculations of many BJP leaders eyeing the post of nominated councillors for themselves or their family members.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/nominated-councillors-should-not-have-bjp-link-says-cong/articleshow/88924164.cms||---

Neernilaigal Pathukappu Iyakkam founder R Abu Backer said they were celebrating the festival on the local tank in anticipation that all the tanks in the state would be brimming with water in the coming year and that agriculture and activities dependent on tanks also flourished.“It is time that we started sensitising people on the importance of the tanks and their maintenance, as they are the lifeline of any system,” said Abu Backer.They cleared a spot on the bund of the tank while women lit a fire and cooked pongal. “Such events should be organised regularly in a community to make the people take ownership of waterbodies as only then can they be properly maintained,” said M P Sankarapandian, an activist.Madurai Kamaraj University professor S Nagarathinam said that such rituals and ceremonies should be organised for all the tanks in Vaigai river’s cascading system. “Pongal celebrated for water bodies was something that had been a part of the Tamil culture for many generations as they were called Kalungu Pongal and was an important part of the local communities. Respecting and thanking nature, was an important part of these rituals and ceremonies.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/kalungu-pongal-celebrated-in-sellur/articleshow/88924183.cms||---

Six active containment zones have been established in both rural and urban areas in Madurai. However, requirement of oxygen and hospitalization for Covid-19 patients remain low and only around 10% of beds in tertiary care centres are filled. Health officials observed a few days ago that there were no clusters in Madurai and the spread had been largely sporadic. But now, there are a total of six active containment zones. “In rural areas, there are three containment zones, one each in Paravai, Oomatchikulam and Othakadai areas. Currently, there are more cases in areas under city limits compared to rural. However, there is always possibility of the spread rising due to movement of people. With Pongal celebrations going on, there is a need to be vigilant,” said an official. Three other containment zones are in Madurai city. More than 200 fever camps are being conducted every day across the district and all primary health centres are collecting samples from those with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Random samples are also being collected from crowded public places such as markets. The positivity rate in Madurai was at 8.2% on Friday with around 7,000-8,000 samples being tested per day. Officials are also closely monitoring occupancy of hospital beds and need for oxygen to ensure enough availability. As on Saturday, out of 3,813 hospital beds allotted for Covid-19 patients in Madurai, 394 were occupied. These include 25 ICU beds out of 665 allotted beds. Meanwhile, Covid-19 safety norms like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing continue to be flouted across the district. This was largely witnessed during Pongal celebrations and jallikattu events. At the jallikattu events held in Palamedu and Avaniyapuram, many from the public, despite efforts of police, wandered in and around the venues in groups without following the safety norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/six-containment-zones-in-madurai-as-surge-continues/articleshow/88924186.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The ticket for the seat was given to Raghvendra Sharma, a doctor with a clean image who is closely associated with the RSS. Another BJP MLA and former finance minister of the state Rajesh Agarwal was also denied a ticket by BJP in the first list of candidates. Sources said Rajesh Agarwal’s age, 79, was a major factor for giving the ticket to Sanjeev Agarwal, a businessman of Bareilly. The exclusion of Bhartaul, an influential two-time MLA, has come as a surprise to many. This prominent Brahmin leader was engulfed in several controversies during his tenure. In July last year, Bhartaul found himself in the midst of a controversy when his daughter released videos, saying she feared for her life from him and her brother because she had married a Dalit. She was provided police protection by the then SSP Muniraj G and continues to live under the security cover.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/ups-former-finance-minister-agarwal-pappu-bhartaul-dropped-from-bjp-list/articleshow/88924189.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Amid presence of police force, at least 27 houses were razed on plot number 125 for the construction of the Punpun leg of Mithapur flyover. The flyover will provide direct connectivity between Mithapur bridge and Mithapur-Mahuali elevated road via Sipara. It will go parallel with the rail overbridge. According to the officials of the district administration, a team of engineers from Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited, land acquisition office and amin of sadar zone had made a red mark in the area where the houses were to be demolished, apart from measuring the land. The construction of Punpun leg of the flyover is yet to be completed due to disruptions at a stretch of about 800 metres where the anti-encroachment drive was conducted on Saturday. When a joint team of the district administration and the Patna Municipal Corporation reached the site with JCB machines and bulldozers, people started pelting stones. Later, a heavy police force was deployed at the site. The locals alleged that they received the notice from the district administration on Friday evening and asked to vacate houses. One Savita Devi said her home was demolished on a short notice. “It takes a lifetime to build a house, but the administration has bulldozed our homes in just few hours. The administration is giving only Rs 40,000 as compensation for each house on which we have spent lakhs,” said Sumitra Devi, another woman whose house was razed. The district administration, however, said they had issued notices to the property owners about eight months back. “Three notices were sent about six months back, asking the owners to claim their compensation amount,” an official said. Pramod Kumar, district land acquisition officer, said 77 decimals of land on plot number 125 had to be acquired for the completion of the flyover project. The owners of the 27 houses were issued notices about eight months ago. The cost of this land is Rs 19.5 crore. Three notices were served on the landowners and they were asked to claim compensation. However, just two of them have claimed compensation amount so far,” he added. Kumar said announcements were made for two days, asking the people to vacate their houses. “A camp was also organised to give compensation to the affected people. We have got 10 more applications for compensation. The district administration will organise another camp on Sunday so that the remaining people can apply for compensation,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/27-houses-razed-to-the-ground-in-patna-for-construction-of-flyover/articleshow/88924195.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: People construct thatched bridge in Madhepura block||MADHEPURA: Murliganj block residents in Madhepura district have built a thatched bridge over the Benga river on their own to make the village road accessible to SH-91, the block headquarters and other areas in this region. This section of the river was previously crossed by an RCC (reinforced concrete cement) bridge, but it was completely destroyed by catastrophic floods in 2008. An assistant professor, Firoz Manshuri, told this reporter on Saturday, “Although reconstruction works have been carried out, many village roads are still left to be rebuilt across the region.” Residents of the affected villages have difficulty getting to the block headquarters and other parts of the district because of the delay in the construction of new bridges. Hence, they have built a thatched bridge to alleviate traffic congestion on the village road connecting SH-91 with Murligant and Beharigan. “We have been pleading for a long time for the ravaged bridge to be rebuilt, but to no avail. As a result, we constructed this makeshift thatched bridge. A concrete bridge is still needed in this area,” claimed Pranav Kumar, a Velahi village resident. He continued, “Even on the most important days of our lives, people from the cities stay away from our villages. The villagers prefer to hold their weddings in Madhepura town’s marriage halls, which are much more expensive.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/people-construct-thatched-bridge-in-madhepura-block/articleshow/88924196.cms||---

---||Patna||Doctors: Take rest andkeep yourself hydrated during home isolation||Patna: Most people who get infected with coronavirus experience mild illness and usually recover at home. One of the frequently asked questions by the patients staying in home isolation is about the medical care they need to have for getting cured.According to the health experts, infected people need not worry if they do not have any co-morbidity. Symptoms might last a few days and they would feel better in a week. Treatment aimed at relieving symptoms includes rest, fluid intake and pain relievers, they say. However, elderly people with existing medical conditions should call their doctor as soon as the symptoms start, they caution.Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology’s joint director Dr A K Ashu said patients in home isolation with mild symptoms should take rest and stay in a well ventilated room.“In case of high temperature, they should take paracetamol and keep themselves hydrated by consuming plenty of fluids. They may also take vitamin C and zinc tablets to maintain their immunity,” Ashu said, adding that people who are already vaccinated need not worry and should only follow the Covid safety protocols sincerely.Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah observed that patients with compromised immunity must take proper care while staying in home isolation. They must keep a constant watch on their body temperature and oxygen saturation level.“When the oxygen saturation level falls below 94, they should immediately rush to a hospital for better medical care,” he said.Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s medicine faculty dean Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad also pleaded for proper rest and ventilation for patients staying in home isolation.“They should take protein rich diet for boosting their immunity. In case of cough and cold, they should inhale water vapour and gargle at frequent intervals,” Prasad said, adding that a patient needs to stay in home isolation for a week even if he has no fever after two or three days.Dr Gangadhar Singh of Government Ayurvedic College Hospital-Patna pointed out that all Covid patients should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables daily. “They can also drink ‘kadha’ and practice some yogic exercises to boost their immunity,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/doctors-take-rest-andkeep-yourself-hydrated-during-home-isolation/articleshow/88924201.cms||---

It is a divine coincidence that today when Sun God is transiting from one zodiac to another, this Arun of his (Sun God) is also moving from government service to public service.”He said, “My 28 years of IPS career has been extremely satisfying and this is my identity. I am very grateful to Bharatiya Janata Party, the party saw something in me and encouraged me to join public service.”He further said, “However, this was not an easy decision. A sophisticated life on the one hand and the possibilities of going to high government posts, on the other hand the lifestyle of a common person, but along with this an opportunity to serve the deprived society particularly dalits is also there.”He said, “Not just mine, but my decision was going to completely change the life of the whole family and then also I chose the opportunity of public service given by the party. I know that my next 25 years will be full of ups and downs but I don’t worry as there are possibilities to work in many ways in public service.”He said, “As economic development is taking place and the scope of the private sector is expanding, our industries have made their mark on the global market. In the changing scenario one should rethink about social justice and about various representations.”“It is the misfortune of the dalits and all the rural areas that their most talented youth have to go away from home in search of good education and good job, but, it’s natural, like I want to give something back to my people, well there are many other men and women in the society who also want to contribute for their native land. And to make this possible, I will make this arrangement in my Kannauj,” he said and added, “Like this, we will be on a new level of development and harmony.”“As my wife Jyotsna, sons Abhijat and Aman and my entire family in Khair Nagar are with me, I firmly believe the journey will be enjoyable and I also move from one service to another while bowing down to the Sun God,” he said further. On January 8, Asim Kumar Arun had surprised everyone by releasing a post on the social media containing information about the application for voluntary retirement from the post of police commissioner. In the letter, he shared his views about serving the nation and society.After this, he had also released a video, in which he had given a message to his fellow colleagues and asked them to consider the video to be a farewell party. Along with this, he also shared about the reason for keeping the pictures of the nation’s three supreme leaders including Mahatma Gandhi, Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar and Sardar Patel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/asim-arun-talks-of-moving-over-to-public-service/articleshow/88924206.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

TOI, however, does not confirm the veracity of the viral video. In the video, Kuldeep’s daughter Aishwarya said, “I am a girl, I can also fight to bring the truth in front of everyone. Priyanka Gandhi, this step taken from the point of view of politics may sound right to you but I do not know politics, but the religion of society and morality will never forgive you for this.” Aishwarya further said, “Those to whom you have given ticket have been booked under IPC Section 420 for making a fake TC. Their bail has also been rejected. Dozens of cases are registered in Unnao against the family to whom you have given a ticket. When my mother got the ticket, then your party remembered all the religions and ‘adharma’. In this case, they changed the time three times. It is true that at that time, the location of my father was found 17-km away at his Unnao office. My father was also ready for the Narco test, but these people refused.” In the video, Aishwarya said, “Even today I am saying that if there is even a single evidence that my father has or if he had even dared to stare at these people, then my entire family should be hanged to death.” She told Priyanka Vadra that your brother was also facing similar allegations. “My Unnao will never accept such politics which destroys a family. You will get its result on March 10. My Unnao was with me and always will be,” she said. Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a former MLA from Bangermau legislative assembly seat, has been convicted of rape, murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation. He is the main defendant in the Unnao rape case and was booked under the POCSO Act. He is also accused of killing three people, including the victim's father in police custody and later her aunts by a conspired truck accident. A Delhi district and sessions court reportedly upheld an investigation conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that had ruled out any foul play in the Unnao rape survivor’s accident in 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/ex-mlas-daughter-flays-priyankaon-partys-unnao-sadar-ticket-choice/articleshow/88924209.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The sitting MLAs, including two cabinet ministers, retained their candidature amid speculations that the party might not give a chance to all of them, fearing anti-incumbency. Of those whose name found amongst the list of candidates six are sitting MLAs, one is new face, while two others, who had lost previous polls have been given another chance. Sanjay Talwar from Ludhiana East constituency, Bharat Bhushan Ashu from Ludhiana West, Surinder Dawar from Ludhiana central, Rakesh Pandey from Ludhiana North, Kamaljit Singh Karwal from Atam Nagar, Gurkirat Singh Kotli from Khanna, Lakhvir Singh Lakha from Payal and Kamil Amar Singh from Raikot were declared as the official Congress candidates for upcoming Punjab assembly elections, scheduled for February 14. But surprising factor for many within the party was the candidature of Captain Sandeep Sandhu from Dakha. Sandhu had been the adviser to former chief minister Amarinder Singh and had lost bypolls in 2019 as well. Apparently, it was a positive feedback and his association with the local constituency that seem to have worked in his favour, observers felt. Similarly, Karwal had lost from Atam Nagar in 2017 to Lok Insaf Party chief Simarjit Singh Bains in 2017. His supporters felt it was his hard work in his constituency during the past five years that made party go for him. Congress candidate and sitting MLA from East constituency Sanjay Talwar said, “We have been working hard for the past five years. I was sure to get a ticket again as my work has spoken for me. Last time, I got very lesser time for the campaigning as candidature was announced at the eleventh hour and when result was out, it was narrow victory, but this time results will prove that party has not done any mistake while giving me chance once again.” Senior most Congress MLA from North constituency Rakesh Pandey, who is going to contest his eighth election (seven times he had won from North constituency) said, “We worked in the past five years and now we will go to public to rate our works. We are ready for the elections. Campaigning will also kick off at full pace after the official announcement by the party.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/six-17-winners-get-cong-tickets-for-22/articleshow/88924213.cms||---

Asked as to why it took so long for the police to nab the accused, the SI said he joined as an SHO a few days back and started probing all the pending cases.

---||India||Border position unambiguous: India to Nepal on Lipulekh row||NEW DELHI: India's position on the India-Nepal border is well-known, consistent and unambiguous and has been communicated to Nepal, the government said on Saturday. This was the government's reaction to a series of statements made by political parties in Kathmandu, slamming India for allegedly undermining Nepal's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The response by the Indian embassy in Nepal followed a statement by the main ruling party, Nepali Congress, calling India's widening of the road to the Lipulekh pass, near the tri-junction with China, objectionable and demanding that India withdraw its troops from the area. It had also said Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani - areas that remain under India's administrative control in Uttarakhand - are Nepalese territories. The embassy also reminded Nepal authorities of India's view that the established inter-governmental mechanisms and channels were "most appropriate" for communication and dialogue. "Mutually agreed boundary issues that are outstanding can always be addressed in the spirit of our close and friendly bilateral relations," the embassy said. The latest flare-up on the boundary issue is said to have been caused by PM Narendra Modi's remark in Haldwani last month that India was working to further expand the road to Lipulekh pass. Indian authorities said New Delhi has repeatedly conveyed to Nepal, since the latter issued a new political map to justify "artificial enlargement" of its claims, that it should refrain from making any unjustified cartographic assertion and respect India's sovereignty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/border-position-unambiguous-india-to-nepal-on-lipulekh-row/articleshow/88924217.cms||Sachin Parashar

It has been alleged that people living in other states or other cities have been provided the cheques. However, the officials claimed that in 58 applications, it has been noticed that residents were from other states who had not updated their local addresses in their Aadhaar cards. By next week, things will become clear, they said. Additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said, “The SEs have been deputed for an inquiry, and by next week I am expecting the report. In case anybody got the cheques wrongly, we will take it back. If cheque would have been encashed, we will get a demand draft made, but there will be no loss to the public exchequer."It was the BJP that had raised the issue of alleged misuse of funds under Punjab Nirman scheme. On Saturday, city-based activist Kumar Gaurav also staged a protest in Haibowal. He alleged that the MLAs got Rs 15 crore each in all constituencies and if it had been utilised properly it could have brought drastic change in the state. He alleged that MLAs gave away funds to their party workers instead of poor people for which the money was allocated. Earlier, BJP leaders had pointed out alleged misuse of scheme not only in the district but also in the state. BJP had demanded a probe in this matter.

Congress councillor from Ludhiana’s ward number 81, Rashi Aggarwal, who was interest in contesting for the Ludhiana North assembly seat, said: "I am really disappointed with how the party leadership has gone about selecting candidates. Senior party member Harish Chaudhary had called me on October 17, 2021, and told me to be ready, claiming that the party was looking to field a young and dynamic candidate. Even Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu claimed that the party will encourage women but it doesn’t reflect in the announcement for Ludhiana North."She said: "If the party didn’t want to try out a fresh face then what was the purpose of accepting applications from the leaders of that profile. I received offers from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiromani Akali Dal, and Aam Aadmi Party to contest for the MLA’s seat but it is because of (minister) Bharat Bhushan Ashu that I did not switch. I didn’t want a blot on my report card, even though I am still unhappy with the party’s decision." Yogesh Handa of the Youth Congress, who wanted ticket from the Ludhiana Central constituency but was overlooked, said: "It is the party’ decision and I welcome it. It is our right to raise the demand for the ticket but the final decision rests with the party. This decision has brought disappointment to the party workers. We will come out with some strategy in the coming days." Ward 48 Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran, who wanted to contest from Atam Nagar, said he’d remain loyal to the party despite not being considered. He said: “There is disappointment but what can be done now. The party doesn’t understand that the voters look for young faces.

Genomic sequencing at the two institutes, between November 28 and January 8, found that Omicron was in just 1% of samples from November 28 to December 4. But in samples analysed between January 2 and January 8, the variant was in 83% of samples. Scientists from the two institutes said the finding indicated that the new variant has been spreading in the community. The data also suggested that most of the Covid-19 cases being reported currently could be attributed to Omicron, Dr Krishanpal Karmodiya, professor of biology at IISER, told TOI. Omicron present in 83% of samples sequenced in cityDelta, meanwhile, seems to have lost its hold on Pune, with just 0. 004% of samples sequenced in the latest week (January 2-8) reporting the variant and 14% reporting Delta sub-lineages. Experts said though Omicron is seeing rapid spread, a silver lining is that it has replaced the more virulent Delta variant, which was associated with severe Covid and a large number of hospitalisations during the second wave. The scientists, however, said the public needs to be cautious. “Omicron has exponential growth advantage which facilitates high transmission. This property of the virus threatens to offset any relief due to less severe disease caused by this variant,” Dr Dhanasekaran Shanmugam, senior principal scientist and coprincipal investigator on the project at NCL, told TOI. “Therefore, regardless of the variant, Delta or Omicron, Covid-appropriate behavior will help in getting through the current wave,” he said. Dr Karmodiya from IISER said, “Although there is a reduced risk of severity, since there are many confounding variables that influence the course of disease, it makes it difficult to predict outcomes. ” Dr Anu Raghunathan, senior principal scientist and principal investigator at the NCL said, “The Omicron variant is concerning mainly for antibody countermeasure efficacy because of the number of mutations in the spike protein. The worry is that antibodies in clinical use may lose efficacy against the B. 1. 1. 529 Omicron variant. ” She added, “When transmission rates are high and there is an inevitable lag between infection and hospitalisation, infection among large numbers in the population eventually run the risk of undesirable outcomes. In the end it’s not just the virus, but also the host and the environment that dictate outcomes. ” Dr Sanjay Pujari, member of the national Covid task force, said, “Omicron seems to cause mild illness in a majority of patients but it can still cause severe Covid in the unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or vulnerable population. ” Researchers at IISER Pune and CSIR-NCL have sequenced samples through generous funding from Rockefeller Foundation and also supported by CSIR-NCL, the Villoo Poonawalla Foundation and the Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sanstha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/in-just-over-a-month-omicron-in-83-covid-samples-in-pune/articleshow/88924224.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 90% of 2 lakh patients till January 12 didn’t need hospitals, Pradeep Vyas||PUNE: Out of 2.4 lakh active Covid cases in Maharashtra till January 12, about 90.9% cases were either in home isolation or Covid care centers with only 21,783 (9.1% of the active cases) in actual hospitals, additional chief secretary ( health) Pradeep Vyas said in a letter dated January 14 to all district authorities of the state. Dr Vyas said from this number, nearly 16,175 or 74.2% patients were with mild symptoms and just 2.3% (5,602) of total active cases needed intensive care or oxygen support. He added that 700 patients — or 0.29% of total active patients — were on ventilators. The letter stated, “...till now the surge mainly has been in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Pune and Nagpur which have relatively better cover of Covid vaccination. So same presentation may not unfold in districts with poor Covid vaccination coverage.” He said that the availability of good quality data to determine actual bed occupancy and utilization of oxygen beds, ICU and ventilators now becomes extremely important. “We need to have a clear plan with clearly scalable strategy, if the need arises. Till that time, we can probably use our energy and resources to better monitor the cases under home isolation and create good awareness about signs and symptoms, when the home isolated patient should seek the care in hospital and rapidly increase cover of covid vaccination,” he said in the letter. A senior state health department official added, “Daily trends indicate that almost 80-87% Covid cases in Maharashtra are mild or asymptomatic. Since the state is recording a large number of cases, the absolute number of hospitalisations has gone up but the percentage proportion (of hospitalisations) to active cases has not gone up. In fact, percentage of hospital admissions in proportion to total active cases has come down. Only the absolute number of hospitalisations has gone up as the active caseload is quite high.” Another state public health department official said, “Vaccination among most age groups has had an important role to play in keeping majority of cases mild. There has also not been a surge in critical Covid patients among the elderly, where the vaccination rate has been good.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/90-of-2l-patients-till-jan-12-didnt-need-hospitals-vyas/articleshow/88924225.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pandemic triggered loneliness in elderly: Study||PUNE: The pandemic has exacerbated social isolation and loneliness among older people. A recent research about the availability of emotional and physical support among the elder population above the age of 55 carried out by the International Longevity Centre (ILC) India, Pune Chapter, a not-for-profit organisation, showed a significant increase in depression due to survivor’s guilt and a corresponding struggle to overcome loneliness by engaging in activities and forming support circles with peers going through similar circumstances. Yaashodaa Padhye, research and development coordinator, ILC, Pune, said, “Many senior citizens expressed remorse at not getting a chance to say a final goodbye to close friends and neighbours they saw daily, or siblings who lived away.” A 75-year-old widow came to terms with her bereavement by writing stories, while others gave vent to their grief through poetry or art. A 65-year-old widow said she was suddenly left alone after her husband passed away and stood outside her gate for hours waiting to speak to someone. “I lost my wife to the second wave, but my daughters helped me get through the tragedy,” said a retired defence personnel (74). Another retired teacher (64), who lost her husband in 2020, said, “My son wanted me to come and live with him in Bangalore, but I prefer staying here even though it gets very lonely living alone.” According to the World Health Organization, elderly population in India is predicted to rise from current 60 million to over 227 million by 2050. Tapan Mishra, founder, Evergreen Club, an online community for older adults, said, “In India, work-life and social life are intertwined, leaving retired population socially isolated at the age of 55-60. Retired people need platforms where they can connect with like-minded peers.” Psychologist Aishwariya Sanavaran said, “The biggest struggle after losing one’s spouse from a 30, 40 or 50 year-old marriage is acceptance.While women make themselves busy by taking care of grandchildren and household chores, men feel displaced and disoriented for a much longer time. Ignoring mental wellness can lead to physical issues, such as heart diseases, high blood pressure, immune-system related issues, and so on.” Aimed at providing an opportunity to all single, widowed or divorced citizens above the age of 55 to find partners, city-based social group Sindhu Seva Dal is organising a matrimonial conference on January 30 at Alpa Bachat Bhavan. “We borrowed the concept from Anubandh Foundation, an Ahmedabad-based NGO. Its founder Natu Bhai Patel set it up in 2002 after noticing issues being faced by senior citizens who lost spouses and family members to the Kutch earthquake,” said Manohar Pherwani, programme coordinator.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pandemic-triggered-loneliness-in-elderly-study/articleshow/88924226.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Sarita Arya was an MLA from the reserved (SC) seat of Nainital from 2012 to 2017. In 2017, she lost to BJP candidate Sanjeev Arya. However, Sanjeev and his father Yashpal Arya recently returned to Congress, queering the pitch for Sarita Arya. There is talk that either Sanjeev or his father will get the Congress ticket from Nainital. She told TOI on Saturday, “Senior Congress members have asked me to help the party win the election. I have dedicated myself to this (Nainital) constituency and people here have faith in me. Dedicated party members should not be ignored." During the 2016 political turmoil in the state, in which 10 Congress MLAs openly revolted against the then chief minister Harish Rawat, Sarita Arya, the party's state women's chief since May 2015, was among the 26 party MLAs who stood firmly behind Rawat. And the Congress was subsequently successful in saving its government. On the possibility of her switching over to the BJP, Sarita Arya said, “I'll only join them if they allow me to contest from Nainital. Without getting a poll ticket from Nainital, there is no point in joining the BJP.” Incidentally, Yashpal was a minister in the Harish Rawat-led government. He along with his son Sanjeev left Congress and joined BJP barely a few weeks before the 2017 assembly election. While Yashpal won from the Bazpur seat of Udham Singh Nagar, his son Sanjeev emerged victorious from Nainital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-cong-womens-cell-chief-revolts-says-will-join-bjp-if-it-gives-ticket/articleshow/88922064.cms||Kautilya Singh

For humans, however, wedding attendees have been capped at 150, strictly. So, when two calves got married in Surat on Friday, it was an open invitation to at least 10,000 people, who thronged the cowshed on the outskirts of the city in Ladvi village to bless the newlyweds. “Over 10,000 people visited the temple on Friday during the day and participated in the marriage. Food was also prepared for 10,000 people and everybody enjoyed the event,” said a volunteer and property broker, Vinod Saraswat, who was one of the participants at the wedding of Shankeshwar, a male calf, and Chandramauli, a heifer. The grand wedding, replete with invitation cards and a huge mandap, was solemnized at the cowshed managed by Shree Om Nandeshwar Mahadev Trust (SONMT) in Ladvi village, where the bride was brought to Ladvi from Gandhari Ashram Gaushala in Amroli. The organizers claimed the event to be the fulfilment of a dream that Pipladgiri Maharaj of Gandhari Ashram had seen to create awareness about cow rearing. “Pipladgiri Maharaj had dreamt of organizing the marriage and all at the cowsheds wished that we should create awareness about cow rearing and its importance. The bride calf was brought to the venue amid all traditional wedding razzmatazz,” Jayanti Malani, one of the organizers, told TOI. Malani added that after her marriage, the young bride, however, stopped eating and so, to comfort her in her ‘sasural’, the calf’s mother too was brought to Ladvi for a few days! As for wedding gifts, silver anklets, head teeka and waist belt were offered by a few guests. SONMT shed is home to around 3,000 cattle. The trust runs four pens across the state in which they house 5,000 cattle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/covid-curbs-go-for-a-toss-as-10k-people-turn-up-at-surat-bovine-shaadi/articleshow/88922635.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

We have covered 40% (2.24 lakh) of them within 12 days. We aim to cover the remaining 60% with the first dose within the next 20 days so that we can take up their inoculation with the second dose in the first week of February,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region.The adolescents’ vaccination was done the fastest in rural areas of the district, with 74% of the target beneficiaries being inoculated in just 10 days. Pune Zilla Parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “We made a clear action plan by identifying schools that have classes X, XI and XII.

---||Pune||Pune women flex their muscles, blaze a trail of glory in powerlifting||PUNE: A bunch of city women, some in their late thirties, forties and even in their sixties, are straining their every sinew and blazing a trail in powerlifting, picking up medals in local, regional and international competitions. At the recent Asian Masters Powerlifting Championship in Istanbul, five women from the city bagged gold in their respective age-group and weight categories. What sets these women apart is that none of them are professional sportspersons. They got drawn towards powerlifting for various reasons — to lose weight, feel stronger or to keep bone density issues away. Powerlifting, an offshoot of weightlifting, is the sport of lifting heavy weights in three different ways: squat, bench press and deadlift. Among the five women, Sharvari Inamdar (38), an ayurveda practitioner, bagged five gold medals — four in Asian classic powerlifting championship and one in Asian classic bench press championship. “My expectation was the least when I went to Istanbul. It took me nearly four years to win my first gold medal and that, too, at an international level,” said Inamdar, a mother of two teens, who had to juggle between attending to her patients at the clinic and hitting the gym whenever she could find time to keep her practice going. Till then, she had stood fifth and fourth in national championships in 2018 and 2019, respectively. She has now set her goals on participating in the Asia Pacific championship. “Powerlifting is generally perceived to be a men’s sport. Many women are not introduced to it because in India being thin is considered beautiful for women, not strong,” she said. Coach Girish Binjwe, whose G99 academy has trained many women in powerlifting, said the entry of women into the sport has been gradual in the last three to four years. “Many of them joined the academy for fitness training, but after being introduced to the sport, they have done amazingly well in various competitions,” he said. Among them, Jyoti Bhadekar (43), a homemaker, bagged eight gold medals at the Istanbul championship. “I lifted 320kg weight in total. Just three weeks before the event, I suffered an injury during training and got eight stitches on my finger. But I went for it after taking a fitness certificate from my doctor,” said Bhadekar, who took to powerlifting in 2018 after being introduced to it by a trainer in a gym. “When women do strength training, they feel extremely independent. Many women anyway lift a lot of weight in their day to day lives, for example, in the kitchen. With proper training, they can do extremely well in this sport,” said coach Omkar Chincholkar. Lorraine More (66), started power lifting at the age of 64 in 2019 by lifting 2kg dumbbells after realising that it helped in increasing bone density. She gradually went on to lift higher weights, winning gold at district and national championships. At the Asian championship in Istanbul, she won eight gold medals after lifting a total weight of 165kg. “Today, I feel stronger than I was in my thirties. I don’t have to depend on anybody to pull anything for me,” said More, who has now set her sights on the Commonwealth championship. “I want to challenge myself and lift higher weights,” she said. Others who won four medals each at the championship are Shrutika Raut and Neeta Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/city-women-flex-muscles-blaze-a-trail-of-glory-in-powerlifting/articleshow/88924228.cms||Avijit Chatterjee

---||Pune||Doctors remove pumpkin-sized tumour from 22-year-old in Pune||PUNE: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in cases of weight gain. But obesity can have a deeper underlying cause too. A 22-year-old woman from a well-to-do family was found to be nurturing a massive pumpkin-size ovarian tumour when her parents took her to a physician for weight gain. They thought that her weight was rising due to lack of exercise, increased screen time and sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic. “The young woman had a huge 45cm ovarian mass weighing 11.2kg. Our major challenge was to remove the tumour without rupturing it and harming her other organs,” said gynaec-oncosurgeon Dr Nikhil Parwate, who successfully removed the massive tumour at the Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital in Chinchwad on January 5. The tumour was removed without compromising her fertility and chances of becoming a mother. The heaviest recorded tumour (18.5kg) in the medical literature was reported from Wardha (Maharashtra) in October 2019. In the last 20 years, 48 cases worldwide have been reported of giant ovarian masses. Twelve of these cases, including the 22-year-old Pune girl, had cancerous tumours, he said. “The mass in the girl’s case was so huge that the upper border of the mass was touching the border of the patient’s breast,” said the hospital’s gynaecologist Dr Madhulika Singh. Dr Singh doubted that the mass was benign and hence immediately referred the patient to Dr Parwate. Removing the tumour without rupturing it or spilling any contents of the tumour was among the major challenges in the surgery. “Clinically, we could assess the possibility of the tumour being early-stage cancer. Based on this, we kept the uterus and another normal ovary, but removed the other ovary, tissues surrounding the tumour and the path of its spread,” Dr Parwate said. The complicated surgery went on for three hours and fifteen minutes. The woman was allowed to go home within a week post-surgery. “Currently, she is not on any cancer medication because she has early (stage 1A grade 2) cancer for which surgery is the only treatment. No additional chemotherapy is required,” Dr Parwate said. “She is absolutely fine. However, she has been advised strict monitoring till she gets married, conceive normally and has a baby,” one of her parents said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/docs-remove-pumpkin-sized-tumour-from-22-year-old/articleshow/88924234.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Schools closed, students stressed in run-up to boards||PUNE: Students and teachers of classes X and XII are going through a lot of stress with the closure of schools owing to the renewed surge in Covid-19 cases across the state. In normal times, January would have been the month when students were made to solve question banks, appear for prelims or mock tests and the results were analysed to solve the remaining doubts. This year, schools are not being able to do any of these. The question bank available is also the same as uploaded by SCERT last year. While in 2021, board examinations were cancelled and students were given marks based on a formula of internal assessment, this year the state board has clarified that examinations will be conducted offline. Though schools are doing their best to ensure that students solve as many mock tests online as possible and also clear doubts on call, teachers feel more needs to be done. Mahendra Ganpule, the spokesperson for Maharashtra School Headmasters’ Forum, said notices to close down schools did mention that they can conduct board-related activities for classes X and XII. This, however, has created confusion because practicals start after February 15, which means there are no board-related activities before that. “In the actual sense, they should have written all educational activities that can be conducted for classes X and XII so that students could have been called for preliminary exams, practicals among others. It is a common mentality of most of the students to start studying for the boards in the last three months. The marks obtained in prelims generally jolt them into action and teachers also understand the problem areas for each kid so that they can focus there. But these are not possible now because of the closure of schools,” said Ganpule. Bhagwan Pandekar, a senior teacher with Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said while some schools are conducting the prelims online, they are not that effective, as they would have been if they would have been conducted offline. “Students need to appear for the prelims offline because then we know at what stage, for example in mathematics, are they facing problems and tell them how to get past that stage. Very few students ask questions online and even when they do, we try to explain it to them. But we do not know whether they have actually understood or not. But in a classroom, we can have one look at the kid and understand how much he or she has understood the explanation. Missing out on the January and February schedule would be a great loss for students, especially the ones who are average or below average in academics,” said Pandekar. A Class X student said schools should have remained open because without the mock tests and their results, there is hardly any competition or motivation to do better than the remaining students. “Asking doubts in an online class feels weird. Plus asking the same question again is also weird. Hence offline classes would have been a better option,” said the student. Ayushka Gahine, another Class X student, said her school is yet to finish a chapter or two in some subjects and they are doing it online. “It would have been good if the schools would have been allowed to remain open for full time at least for the students appearing for their boards. It would have given schools enough time to complete the syllabus, take mock tests and also help us overcome the mistakes,” said Gahine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/schools-closed-students-stressed-in-run-up-to-boards/articleshow/88924235.cms||Ardhra Nair

The experts have advised against this initiative. The chances of flooding will increase.”Shailaja Deshpande of Jeevit Nadi, an organisation working for river rejuvenation, said, “The project will have an impact on the green and sensitive areas of the rivers. It will prove disastrous for the natural resource. The flora and fauna would be affected badly. The initiative has been undertaken without any in-depth study on its long-term impact on rivers and the eco-system based on them.” The project’s cost was increased to Rs4,200 crore from Rs2,300 crore last year. The standing committee of the PMC had given its nod to the revised budget in October 2021. The general body also unanimously approved the proposal though a group of activists objected to it.According to the PMC officials, the financial feasibility would be checked before finalising the work for each phase. “The financial bids and capabilities would be checked and sent to the standing committee for green signal. After their go-ahead, work will start,” said Mangesh Dighe, the environment officer for PMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/experts-flag-hazards-activists-flay-new-budget/articleshow/88924238.cms||---

It will be commissioned in two stages, using technology patented by city-based energy firm Praj Industries that extends the shelf-life of sugarcane juice, a key input in ethanol.The first phase of the plant, which will be commissioned by the end of the year, will have an ethanol production capacity of 500 kilolitres per day (KLPD). The second phase of the project is scheduled to enhance the capacity to 1100 KLPD, the promoters said in a statement. The parties previously collaborated to set up another ethanol plant in 2018, which has a capacity of 60 KLPD.Praj’s technology, Biosyrup, was launched commercially by the company last month, which consists of converting sucrose into glucose and fructose, and using patented bioenzymes to drain out excess water from the resultant water, that extends the life of the sugarcane juice to up to 12 months, the company claimed. It partnered with a sugar processing unit in Karad to deploy the pilot project, which also resulted in a definitive order. While launching the technology, the company claimed the increased production of ethanol will help the sugar industry in increasing its revenue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/phaltan-to-get-asias-largest-ethanol-plant/articleshow/88924242.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

It includes salary, pension, and basic civic services. With no VEF and GST share, we will not generate the required revenue. As a result, we have decided to construct commercial complexes on the land plots that are under the management of the cantonment,” said Pramod Kumar Singh, CEO, KCB.“We have identified plots that are under the management of the cantonment board. A few of them are with the defence estates office of the Pune circle. We will put forth some of the proposals before the general body meeting of the cantonment.

They accused Panchalingam of tax evasion, took away his mobile phone and then locked his house from inside. They found Rs 20 lakh in cash and cheque leaves that Panchalingam had received from others in an almirah,” a police officer said. When Panchalingam asked them why they did not bring police officers with them, the officer said, they stold him it was because police would arrest him and lodge him in jail for the offence that he had committed. “The five were wearing formal dress with a tie and used fake id cards. They spoke among them in English often.” The gang told Panchalingam to collect the cash after submitting the original documents at the income tax office at Pollachi and left the spot.

A report named “Migration & Uttarakhand 2017 Electoral Data”, released on Friday by Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation, suggests that migration was a major reason behind constituencies in remote areas recording very low voting. According to the report, the average voter turnout in Uttarakhand was 65.6% in 2017. “Barring Uttarkashi district, which recorded an average turnout of 69.38%, voting in all hill districts in Uttarakhand was far less than the average turnout of the state. Tehri (55.68%), Pauri (54.86%) and Almora (53.07%) had the least polling percentages,” said Anoop Nautiyal, president of SDC Foundation. Meanwhile, some of the plain districts had significantly higher voter turnouts, with Udham Singh Nagar at 76.01%, Haridwar at 75.68% and Uttarkashi at 69.38%. In 2017, the highest voter turnout, between 81-82%, was recorded in three constituencies of plain district Haridwar: Laksar (81.95%), Haridwar (rural) (81.76%) and Piran Kaliyar (81.6%). The lowest turnouts were in three seats of two hill districts: Salt (46.01%) in Almora district, Chaubattakhal (46.91%) and Lansdowne (47.87%), both in Pauri Garhwal district. Ghansali in Tehri Garhwal district had 49.19 polling percentage. “In most hill constituencies, the total average number of voters is in the 45,000 to 60,000 range … it can be safely assumed that one of the biggest reasons for the low voter turnout in the hill districts is migration,” the report says. Nautiyal said that to ensure that the pattern isn’t repeated this time and voting percentage remains high in hill districts as well, authorities must follow the “Uttarkashi model”. “The government, policy makers and public representatives need to deeply understand how Uttarkashi maintained a high voting percentage unlike all other hill districts of Uttarakhand. The Election Commission should make efforts to increase the voting percentage in other hilly areas like Uttarkashi district,” Nautiyal said. He added that in light of the pandemic, technology should also be used to ensure safe voting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/migration-hit-hill-districts-of-ukhand-recorded-least-voter-turnout-during-2017-polls-report/articleshow/88928691.cms||Kautilya Singh

Meanwhile, the Pachapalayam village panchayat president received information about the body and informed police, who reached the spot and sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem.During inquiry, Chiranjeevi told police that his father was taking care of 600 goats of a dairy farmer for the past three months.Around 3pm on Friday, Nataraj and his friend N Gurusamy, 50, of the same village, went to consume liquor at a Tasmac bar at Pachapalayam, a police officer said.“When his father did not return for a long time, Chiranjeevi went to the outlet and asked Gurusamy about his father. Gurusamy, who was drunk, told him that his father had left home after consuming liquor,” the officer said.After Nataraj was found murdered, police tried to get hold of Gurusamy, who went into hiding. “We subsequently formed a team and launched a manhunt for him. We caught him on Saturday evening. Gurusamy said Nataraj had used expletives while talking about his wife.

Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said the recreational facilities would remain closed from Saturday until further orders. The move has disappointed many families, who ventured out to the parks and zoo on the day only to find them closed for the public. Madhan Kumar, a resident of Nanjundapuram, said, “We went out to spend some time away from home. But all the leisure spots were closed. Children were disappointed as they had to spend the time in front of TV.” Santhanamari, a resident of Velandipalayam, said they wouldn’t have gone out if the authorities had announced the closure of recreational places for the public in advance. “Since the parks were open on Friday, we thought they would be open today (Saturday) too. It is a long way back home.” The district administration, meanwhile, said the temples would also remain closed for devotees from Saturday. District collector G S Sameeran said the Covid-19 cases were on the rise and appealed the public to strictly follow the pandemic protocols and avoid large gatherings during the Pongal holidays. “Celebrate the festival with your near and dear ones at home.” Police were deployed at Race Course and other leisure spots in the city to dissuade people from gathering there. On Friday, the residents had thronged the public places and parks to unwind with the family members. Many of them visited VOC Park and Zoo, while youngsters went out on long bike rides.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/temples-leisure-spots-shut-in-dist-to-contain-virus-spread/articleshow/88924257.cms||---

Lack of fund has delayed both the payment to the contractor and execution of the project. The work was commenced in early 2020 and it should have been completed by now. We will speed up the work after Tufidco sanctions the loan and releases the amount,” the official said.The bus terminal was proposed to be set up on 61.62 acres land for the first time at the end of 2019. While works started in the early 2020, the project was mired in various issues, including scarcity of fund and delay, after the outbreak of Covid-19. The bus terminal would be bigger than the terminal in Delhi that is spread across 60 acres.The bus terminal would have 140 bays for outstation buses, 112 bays for idle parking and 33 bays for town buses. There would be more than 100 parking slots for cars and more than 1,000 slots for two-wheelers.“The bus terminal is expected to address the traffic woes and fuel the city’s growth,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/corpn-to-take-84cr-loan-for-vellalore-bus-terminal-project/articleshow/88924258.cms||---

That was some 120 years ago. One of the ancestors then turned towards Islam and the rivalry began. It continues till this day. When the BJP released its first list for the UP polls with names of 107 candidates, it picked Mriganka Singh, daughter of the late MP Hukum Singh, as its candidate from Kairana. In the SP list from the same constituency was Nahid Hasan, the sitting MLA. Over a century ago, the Singhs and the Hasans were united, part of one family headed by Baba Kalsa, until an ancestor branched out after converting to Islam. According to Suhaib Ansari, an old resident of Kairana, "Both families belong to the Kalshyan khap of the Gujjar community, which is spread across 84 villages. Until a few years ago, Hukum Singh was considered the leader of the Hindu group, while Munawwar Hasan, father of Nahid, headed the Muslim wing." Ever since the early 1990s, Kairana has sent representatives from both these families to the state assembly as well as the Lok Sabha. Through the decades the two clans changed their political allegiances at various points of time. But it was always Singh versus Hasan. Now that both Hukum Singh and Munawwar Hasan are dead, the long-standing political rivalry between the two families has moved on to the next generation. Munawwar Hasan's son Nahid defeated Hukum Singh's daughter Mriganka in the 2017 state polls. Then, Tabassum Hasan, widow of Munawwar Hasan, triumphed over Mriganka in the 2018 Lok Sabha by-polls, necessitated by the death of sitting MP Hukum Singh. The cycle was broken somewhat in 2019, when for the Lok Sabha polls the BJP brought in an "outsider", Pradeep Chaudhary, who eventually defeated Tabassum Hasan. Now, though, Mriganka is pitted once again against the Hasan scion. "I am grateful to the party that it has recognised the hard work of my father. I will continue his legacy, given a chance by voters," Mriganka said. In a dramatic turn on Saturday, Nahid Hasan was arrested and sent to judicial custody as he headed towards the sessions court in Kairana to "surrender" in a pending case from February 2021. He had been evading arrest since he, along with his mother and 40 other supporters, were booked under provisions of the Gangsters Act. A non-bailable warrant had been issued against all of them. In the past five years, several cases were slapped against his family, while many older ones have been reopened by the local administration. The two families have dominated Kairana's political landscape for over four decades. Hukum Singh won from this assembly seat seven times and was a cabinet minister in the BJP governments headed by Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh. He was also the Lok Sabha MP from this constituency in 2014. Munawwar Hasan, meanwhile, was elected from Kairana twice and was a two-term Lok Sabha MP. He had been a member of the Rajya Sabha and once. The big question in Kairana now is: who will breast the tape this time? A Hasan or a Singh?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/1-clan-120-yrs-ago-now-its-hasan-vs-singh-in-kairana/articleshow/88925457.cms||Sandeep Rai

The cycle was broken somewhat in 2019, when for the Lok Sabha polls the BJP brought in an "outsider", Pradeep Chaudhary, who eventually defeated Tabassum Hasan. Now, though, Mriganka is pitted once again against the Hasan scion. "I am grateful to the party that it has recognised the hard work of my father. I will continue his legacy, given a chance by voters," Mriganka said. In a dramatic turn on Saturday, Nahid Hasan was arrested and sent to judicial custody as he headed towards the sessions court in Kairana to "surrender" in a pending case from February 2021. He had been evading arrest since he, along with his mother and 40 other supporters, were booked under provisions of the Gangsters Act. A non-bailable warrant had been issued against all of them. In the past five years, several cases were slapped against his family, while many older ones have been reopened by the local administration. The two families have dominated Kairana's political landscape for over four decades. Hukum Singh won from this assembly seat seven times and was a cabinet minister in the BJP governments headed by Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh. He was also the Lok Sabha MP from this constituency in 2014. Munawwar Hasan, meanwhile, was elected from Kairana twice and was a two-term Lok Sabha MP. He had been a member of the Rajya Sabha and once. The big question in Kairana now is: who will breast the tape this time? A Hasan or a Singh?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/1-clan-120-yrs-ago-now-its-hasan-vs-singh-in-kairana/articleshow/88924261.cms||Sandeep Rai

With most parties announcing their candidates for the forthcoming UP polls, ticket aspirants are simmering with anger in various constituencies of western UP districts. On Saturday, soon after the declaration of BJP candidates, protests erupted in Amroha's Nauganva Sadat seat, where sitting MLA Sangeeta Chauhan, wife of late UP cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan, was replaced by Devender Nagpal. In no time, effigies were burnt and slogans were raised against Nagpal and BJP in general. Similarly, all is not well with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) stronghold Shamli constituency, from where the party has announced a BJP turncoat, Prasann Chaudhary, as its candidate which has unsettled the party cadre. In a recently-held panchayat, senior RLD leader Arvind Pawar said, "Prasann Chaudhary is the same person who distributed sweets when RLD supremo Ajit Singh was defeated in Muzaffarnagar in the 2019 LS polls. At the same time those workers who had been with the RLD in difficult times have been sidelined. We do not support this move." Sunil Rohta, RLD spokesperson, said, "Politics is about compulsions and adjustments. In the prevailing circumstances, senior leaders have taken a decision which is in the interest of the party. We will explain this situation to those dejected. They will come around." Similarly, effigies were burnt across Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat a night before the BJP was to release its first list of 107 candidates. BJP workers too burnt effigies of Yogesh Dhama in Baghpat. Workers in several villages in Meerapur constituency protested against former MLC Prashant Gurjar, a strong contender. Both candidates are there on the list of 107 candidates released by the BJP on Saturday. "Ours is a disciplined party with a disciplined cadre. This is the opposition's gameplan to give an impression that BJP workers are not happy. Our investigation has revealed that in some places like Baghpat, it was RLD's workers who burnt effigies of Yogesh Dhama. Other regions too have the similar situation", said UP west vice president of BJP Manoj Poswal.

---||Cuttack||Omicron sweeps across Odisha as 75% samples show strain||BHUBANESWAR: More than 75% Covid positive samples — 32 out of 42 — analysed in the state on Saturday returned positive for Omicron. Experts said this is a big indication that the new variant is gradually replacing Delta. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences, where the genome sequencing was done, said the samples were of Covid positive students of VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (Vimsar), Sambalpur, National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) Bhubaneswar, besides doctors or staff members of some other hospitals. Fifteen of the 18 positive samples from Vimsar and six out of nine samples from NISER were found positive for Omicron. Parida said samples from sites of cluster infections are largely turning out to be Omicron. More than 50 students and doctors of Vimsar and over 30 students from NISER had tested positive for Covid last week. From the samples analysed and from the clinical manifestations of Covid cases, doctors believe Omicron is becoming the dominant strain. Most of the Covid patients these days have mild symptoms and getting cured very early, which are presumed to be due to Omicron. This, and the high percentage of Omicron among samples sent for genome sequencing, indicate the new variant is gradually taking over," said Sadhu Charan Panda, a professor of community medicine at Vimsar. Ashok Mahapatra, vice-chancellor at SOA University, said the sample size is too small to draw a definite conclusion and generalise findings of all Covid cases, though there's a hint of Omicron dominance. "More samples are needed to be tested for Omicron," Mahapatra said. "Irrespective of whether it is Omicron or Delta, people have no reason to panic or become lax. We must continue to stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour and take vaccines," he added. With the 32 new cases, confirmed Omicron infections in the state rose to 202. The ILS had analysed genomes of 263 samples of those who tested positive between December 29 and January 8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/cuttack/omicron-sweeps-across-state-as-75-samples-show-strain/articleshow/88929025.cms||Ashok Pradhan

In the last five days alone, the excise department sleuths here seized around 1600kg contraband from the city. In the latest haul, about 1100kg marijuana worth Rs 55 lakh was seized from an under-construction house near Ankuli early on Saturday. Utham Singh of Adava in Gajapati district was arrested for allegedly stocking the contraband in the house. Excise officials suspect the accused person would procure the ganja from Gajapati and transport it to other states from here. “Investigation is under way to find out the destination and procurement points of the ganja,” Rajendra Bhotra, excise superintendent (Ganjam), said. Earlier on January 11, the sleuths had seized around 500kg ganja worth Rs 25 lakh from the first gate area in the city. It was reportedly being transported illegally from Gajapati district to Bihar when the vehicle ferrying it was intercepted. “Berhampur is widely used to peddle narcotic substances as the city has good communication facilities, including bus and train services,” Bhotra said. The sources said ganja peddlers from marijuana-growing districts like Kandhamal, Gajapati, Rayagada and Malkangiri supply the contraband to Berhampur. From here, it is smuggled to other places through couriers.Additional SP (Berhampur) Ramesh Chandra Sethi said they will keep a strict vigil on the peddlers at different points like the railway station, bus stops, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/1-held-in-ganjam-with-marijuana-worth-55l/articleshow/88924270.cms||---

But little did they know that one day it will open doors to the world. Naushin and Swati recently won gold at IndiaSkills-2021 in Robot System Integration and are now looking to represent India at the World Skills Competition in Shanghai in October.“I decided to participate in the robotics competition because being an electronics student I want to learn more about new technology,” said Nigar, a third year electronics and telecommunication engineering student of CV Raman Global University (CVRGU). Currently, Nausin and Swati are preparing for six to seven hours every day, apart from their regular classes and studies, for the global competition.Praveen Giri, who won gold in IndiaSkills in Water Technology, is also putting in 10 to 12 hours of effort daily to make it to the Shanghai event. “River water going waste and its pollution are issues that bother me a lot. I felt a solution can be found through automation and started working towards it,” said Praveen, a third year mechanical engineering student of CVRGU.Like them, seven other gold medal winners and 18 silver medallists from the state are working hard. A competition will be held from among the medal winners before the final team is selected for the Shanghai event. They will be trained by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). Odisha bagged 37 medals, including nine bronze medals, and 14 medallions, the highest among participating teams at the IndiaSkills-2021 organised by the NSDC in New Delhi earlier this month. At the last event in 2018, Odisha had finished second behind Maharashtra. The achievement has been possible due to a well thought out plan by the state government and its meticulous implementation over the past six years. At the helm of affairs is the Odisha Skill Development Authority that worked on transforming Odisha’s ITIs, scaled up short-term skill development, set up the World Skills Centre and aggressively pushed for participation in World Skills Competition. The result, it came back with the first-ever gold medal for India from World Skills Competition at Kazan, Russia in 2019. Odisha’s latest show in IndiaSkills is the result of two years of hard work despite the obstacles posed by the pandemic.“We are now working on Mission 234 for World Skills Competition to be held in Shanghai. This means 2 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze medals, a substantive jump in our ambition,” said Subroto Bagchi, chairman, Odisha Skill Development Authority.The Indian contingent, which will have the highest number of participants from Odisha, will now receive the highest level of coaching jointly by the state government and the Centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/state-backing-opens-skills-door-for-odishas-youths/articleshow/88924281.cms||Arunika Mohapatra

---||Bhubaneswar||Despite fear, kids not as badly affected as adults in 3rd wave||Bhubaneswar: Contrary to fears, the third wave of Covid hasn’t affected the children much until now. Even among those infected, the impact is far less severe compared to the adults. The doctors, who have handled cases of children in OPDs and IPDs, said the most common complaint among those below 18 years of age is of fever with sore throat. But these two symptoms are far less pronounced in them compared to what the adults have been experiencing since the beginning of the wave, they added. Out of the 5,000 active cases among children, only 35 are admitted in hospitals, which is roughly about 0.64%. “The comparatively less severity of the new variant of Covid hasn’t resulted in any complications among children so far. We are coming across cases, which are mild or near mild. In rare cases only, gastrointestinal representation is seen in paediatric patients. But that too can be handled in home isolation. The condition may rather aggravate if hospitalisation in mild cases is opted for, in case of children,” Dr Janaki Ballav Pradhan, senior doctor of paediatric critical care and neonatologist at AMRI Hospital here, said. Earlier, experts had said children would constitute the bulk of the infected people in the third wave on account of them being unvaccinated. But the trend, so far, has been that it is affecting all age groups causing mild to moderate symptoms without translating into disease. Niranjan Mishra, director of public health, said, “At this juncture, parents should be careful so that they don’t contract the virus and pass it on to their wards.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/despite-fear-kids-not-as-badly-affected-as-adults-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/88924283.cms||---

That means, the state will witness more cases in the coming days.

He said several of the candidates have tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of the examination. “Many of them may get infected while attending the examination and it will affect their performance.

Playing safe and to rule out the possibility of desertions in a five-cornered contest, Congress has decided to repeat a majority of its sitting MLAs, including all 17 Cabinet ministers, except Brahm Mohindra, who has vacated the Patiala (rural) seat for his son, Mohit Mohindra. Channi has been renominated from Chamkaur Sahib constituency, and Sidhu from Amritsar (East). Elections will be held on February 14 for all 117 assembly constituencies in the state. Meanwhile, the party has dropped four sitting Congress MLAs: Harjot Kamal was ignored in favour of Malvika Sood, and joined BJP. The party has selected Rupinder Kaur Ruby, who joined the party after winning the last election on an AAP ticket. She has been fielded from Malout in place of sitting MLA Ajaib Singh Bhatti. Former CM Bhattal gets ticket from Lehra, Rajya Sabha MP Bajwa from QadianAnother sitting MLA Balwinder Singh Laddi has been dropped from Hargobindpur to make way for Mandeep Singh Ragar Nangal. Laddi had joined the BJP briefly only to return to Congress fold. From Balluana (SC) seat, sitting MLA Nathu Ram has been replaced with Rajinder Kaur. Former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has been named as teh party's nominee from Lehra even though she lost the last election. Contrary to speculation that Channi could also contest from a second seat – Adampur in Doaba, the party has given the ticket to former BSP leader Sukhwinder Singh Kotli from there. Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa will make a comeback in state politics by contesting from Qadian. There were reports of his candidature being opposed by Sunil Jakhar at the meetings of the screening committee. Apart from Ruby, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who had won from Bholath on an AAP ticket will now be the Congress nominee from the seat. Four of the five ministers in Amarinder Singh’s cabinet who were dropped last year have been given tickets. They include Balbir Singh Sidhu (Mohali), Sunder Sham Arora (Hoshiarpur), Gurpreet Singh Kangar (Rampura Phul) and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot (Nabha). But the party is yet to field someone from Guru Har Sahai, which was represented by former minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who joined the BJP. Apart from Mohindra, the list included the names of all other cabinet ministers including Manpreet Singh Badal (Bathinda urban), Razia Sultana (Malerkotla), Vijay Inder Singla (Sangrur), Gurkirat Singh Kotli (Khanna), Rana Gurjit Singh (Kapur- thala), Tript Rajinder Bajwa (Fatehgarh Churian), Randeep Singh Nabha (Amloh), Amarinder Singh Raja Warring (Gidderbaha), Pargat Singh (Jalandhar Cantonment), Sangat Singh Gilzian (Umar), Raj Kumar Verka (Amritsar West), Sukhbinder Sarkaria (Rajasansi), Bharat Bhushan Ashu (Ludhiana West) and Aruna Choudhary (Dinanagar). The party has also fielded the two deputy chief ministers – Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa from Dera Baba Nanak and OP Soni from Amritsar Central, their present seats. Former Punjab Youth Congress president Amanpreet Singh Lally has got a ticket from Garhshanker even though Channi was pushing for Nimisha Mehta. Another PYC leader Barinder Singh Dhillon will contest from Ropar. Jakhar is believed to have opposed Lally’s name in the meetings of poll panels. Erstwhile Amarinder loyalist Sandeep Sandhu will contest from Dakha. "The party has been cautious to avoid any major dissidence as the alliance between BJP and former CM Amarinder Singh’s party is waiting to poach on disgruntled Congress MLAs," said a party leader. Sidhu's stamp on selection?Even though Congress has gone with the obvious choices by retaining 60 of its sitting MLAs in the first list, Sidhu is believed to have had his way in his choice of candidates including Naresh Puri from Sujanpur and party MP Amar Singh’s son Kamil Amar Singh from Rajkot. Cabinet minister Rana Gurjit Singh was keen on a ticket for his son from Sultanpur Lodhi but the sitting MLA Navtej Singh Cheema – who had the backing of Sidhu – has been retained. There were also speculations that Harvinder Singh Ladi could be dropped due to opposition from Manpreet Badal but that did not happen, and Sidhu’s support is believed to be a reason. Party leaders said Balwinder Singh Laddi, who is believed to have been assured a ticket by CM Channi to bring him back to Congress fold from BJP, has been denied candidature. At the last meeting of the screening committee, there was a dispute over some names with Channi, Sidhu and Jakhar failing to arrive at a consensus. However, Jakhar’s objections to Amanpreet Singh Lally and Partap Singh Bajwa were ignored while Channi’s choice Nimisha Mehta was not considered, said party insiders. No ticket for Channi’s brotherCM Channi’s brother Manohar Singh, who recently quit as senior medical officer to seek a party ticket from Bassi Pathana lost the race to sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP. The party has so far gone by the ‘one family one ticket’ rule. Sidhu had held a rally in GP’s support.

Playing safe and to rule out the possibility of desertions in a five-cornered contest, Congress has decided to repeat a majority of its sitting MLAs, including all 17 Cabinet ministers, except Brahm Mohindra, who has vacated the Patiala (rural) seat for his son, Mohit Mohindra. Channi has been renominated from Chamkaur Sahib constituency, and Sidhu from Amritsar (East). Elections will be held on February 14 for all 117 assembly constituencies in the state.

Brahm Mohindra, who got elected to Punjab assembly in 1980, 1985, 1992, 2007, 2012 and 2017, a total of six out of eight times he contested his fate, said that he would not contest elections from any other constituency. Moreover, the party’s high command has already announced not to give more than one ticket in one family. “I will not contest the elections. I would support the party candidates. Mohit has been given ticket from party’s Youth Congress quota as he was elected vice-president of Punjab Youth Congress. It is party’s decision and I welcome it. Mohit has been working at the ground level from quite a long time”, said Brahm Mohindra, who in 2017 and 2012 elections, won by a healthy vote share from his rivals from Patiala (Rural) constituency that became his stronghold after delimitation. Mohit would face his major opponents including SAD (B) Jaspal Singh Bittu Chatha, AAP candidate Dr Balbir Singh and Brahm’s bête noire, Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu, who had recently joined Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and also successfully reestablished himself as mayor despite a section of councilors opposed him by seeking his removal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/youth-cong-leader-mohindra-to-contest-from-fathers-seat/articleshow/88924286.cms||---

---||---||Punjab assembly polls: Out of 23 seats of Doaba, candidates cleared for 20||JALANDHAR: When all the sitting legislators have been retained in Doaba region, barring Nawanshahr constituency that has been put on hold for now, Congress has replaced only two candidates who lost election last time while giving ticket to another who had lost. Now, out of 23 seats in four districts of the region, only three candidates are yet to be decided. From among the three Bahujan Samaj Partry (BSP) leaders who switched over from BSP to Congress, Sukhwinder Singh Kotli has been fielded from Adampur, where chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was backing former Punjab Congress president and former minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee, who had also been given charge of the constituency. Kaypee also happens to be Channi’s relative. The list also makes it clear that no single leader has been able to assert themselves. A couple of other seats, where Congress insiders said surveys were held by the party reflected losses and fresh faces were expected to cut anti-incumbency, party has decided to bet on old horses. Apart from Kaypee, who had lost in 2017, former MLA Lov Kumar Goldy, who had lost from Garshankar in 2017, has been replaced with youth leader Amarpreet Singh Lally. Here CM Channi was reportedly backing Nimisha Mehta, who was ticket aspirant from the constituency in 2017 also. However, this approach to try new faces at the seats lost in 2017 has been dumped in case of Phillaur, where Vikramjit Singh Chaudhary, who had lost in 2017, has been retained as candidate. His father Chaudhary Santokh Singh is Jalandhar MP and latter had lost from Phillaur in 2007 and 2012. From Phillaur former minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur and Amritpal Bhonsle, who had come from BSP a few weeks ago were also in the race. Apart from Kotli, Bhonsle Sukhbir Mananwali had also shifted from BSP and he was in the race for ticket from Phagwara constituency. These BSP leaders had joined at a rally organised by minister Pargat Singh in his constituency Jalandhar Cantt. However, sources said Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu put his foot down against replacing sitting MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal. In district Nawanshahr, Balachaur MLA Darshan Lal has been retained, but Nawanshahr MLA Angad Singh’s fate still hangs in balance. From Banga and Nakodar constituencies candidates have yet not been announced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/out-of-23-seats-of-doaba-candidates-cleared-for-20/articleshow/88928299.cms||IP Singh

It has decided to distance itself completely from the farmer groups contesting the state assembly elections under the banner of Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) for four months, after which it will take a fresh call on whether to take them along or not. “We have no issues with farmer groups forming a political party called Sanyukt Samaj Morcha, but we will not keep any ties with them. We have given no call to oppose them, but whatever we do with other political parties could be done to them (keeping a distance). Any further decision will be taken after four months,” said farmer leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan. The SKM also gave a call for relaunch Mission UP from February 1, if the Centre fails to proceed beyond mere assurances on setting up a committee for minimum support price (MSP) and withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during the protests against the now repealed three agri-marketing laws. It also decided to hold protests at district and subdivision level across the country on January 31 as part of Vada Khilafi (breach of promise) Divas. Farm leaders Rakesh Tikait and Yudhvir Singh said, “We have been waiting for the government response for over a month, but it has done nothing on the remaining issues. We will wait till January 31 and resume Mission UP thereafter. Before that, we will visit Lakhimpur Kheri for three days, from January 21, to stand by the victims’ families. The government does not seem to be with farmers.” KMSC To Relaunch AgitationAccusing the Union government of not keeping its word on forming a committee for deciding the minimum support price (MSP) issue and withdrawing cases against farmers, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) has decided to relaunch the agitation by ensuring a big gathering at Jandiala Guru on January 26. KMSC claimed that the central government had “forgotten its word it had given to ensure no disruption of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally at Ferozepur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/farmer-unions-in-poll-fray-no-longer-part-of-front-skm/articleshow/88924295.cms||Neel Kamal

The EC, however, has extended the ban on political rallies and road shows till January 22. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that in view of the increase in Covid cases, it has come as a relief to political parties and they will be able to reach out to the voters. “Now, we will be able to manage our political campaign through small nukkad meetings. Otherwise it was very difficult for the political parties to reach out to everyone,” said Cheema. He added that despite these relaxations, political parties would not be able to avail the support of star campaigners. “Depending on the improvement of the Covid situation, the EC may review its order by January 22,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sad-welcomes-ec-decision-on-meetings/articleshow/88924296.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Vague allegations of revenge not criminal intimidation: Punjab and Haryana HC||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that mere vague allegations by the accused that he was going to take revenge by filing false complaints, cannot amount to criminal intimidation. It also made it clear that the exercise of power under Section 482 of CrPC for quashing an FIR has not been absolutely excluded where a report under Section 173 of CrPC is not filed. “The said power is to be exercised sparingly and no straitjacket formula can be laid down as to in which situations and when the said power can be or should be exercised,” the HC has observed. Justice Vikas Bahl passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Gurmail Singh of Sangrur district in Punjab. The petitioner has sought the quashing of FIR No. 236 dated September 15, 2021 under sections 384 (extortion), 511 (attempt to commit offence) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC, registered at Police Station Lehra in Sangrur district. The FIR was registered on the statement of complainant Jagdeep Singh. As per the complaint, in 2020, one Gurjit Singh had told the complainant that girl ‘S’ (name withheld) was demanding money by blackmailing the said Gurjit and the complainant, being an advocate, advised him to get a case registered against ‘S’. And as per the advice given by the complainant, Gurjit got a case registered under Section 384 of the IPC against ‘S’ and it was the petitioner who helped her get bail and then provoked her to register a false case against the complainant. But ‘S’ refused to do so and got the rape case registered only against Gurjit, which was subsequently cancelled as it was found to be false. It was further alleged that now, the petitioner, in connivance with other persons, is demanding Rs14 lakh from the complainant and has threatened that in case, the amount is not paid, a false rape case will again be registered against the complainant. On the basis of the said complaint, the present FIR was registered. Seeking quashing of the FIR, the petitioner argued that the registration of the present FIR is a complete abuse of the process of the court. “Even the allegations to the effect that the petitioner is demanding Rs14 lakh and threatening the complainant to involve in a false rape case in case the amount is not paid, are vague... no details as to when the said demand was made or when the threat was issued have been mentioned in the FIR and at any rate, would not constitute an offence and have apparently been made only to get the present false FIR registered for mala fide reasons to harass the present petitioner,” the HC was informed. The counsel for the state opposed the present petition for quashing of FIR and submitted that the present petition deserves to be dismissed on the ground that the charge-sheet under Section 173 CrPC in the present case has not been submitted. After hearing all the parties, the HC held that there is no overt act alleged in the FIR and it has only been vaguely stated that the petitioner is threatening to implicate the complainant in a false rape case and thus, as per the settled principles of law, the provision of Section 506 of the IPC would not be attracted even in case the allegations levelled in the FIR are taken on its face value. “Even with respect to the offence of extortion/attempt to extort, it is apparent that the allegations are far-fetched, no alleged false case has been registered even till date and thus, the question of seeking money is too far-fetched. In case, on the basis of such allegations, an FIR is registered, then, it would be very easy for any person to implicate another person by merely making vague allegations, more so, when there is previous enmity between the parties. Thus, as per the opinion of this court, the present FIR has no legs to stand on,” observed the HC while setting aside the FIR registered against the petitioner. On the contentions made by the state that FIR cannot be quashed because the charge sheet has not been filed in this case, the HC made it clear that the entire material, which was required for the adjudication of the present case, was before this Court and it could not be said that the facts were incomplete so as to await the charge sheet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/vague-allegations-of-revenge-not-criminal-intimidation-hc/articleshow/88924299.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Ropar maize farmers to be compensated for crop loss||PATIALA: The district revenue officials in Ropar are all set to disburse the compensation among farmers who faced loss of their maize crop following pest attack. The farmers in the district have been protesting for more than four months against the Congress government in the state over their demand to get adequate compensation for the crop loss . The revenue officials claimed that the process to collect the complete details of the farmers’ bank accounts was underway and soon the compensation would be disbursed into their accounts. However, this has irked the rival parties and their candidates, who had termed the disbursement of compensation at this time as an act to lure the voters. Ropar District Revenue Officer (DRO) Gurjinder Singh revealed that a total fund of Rs 3.42 crores has been received to be disbursed among the farmers as compensation for their crop loss. The revenue officials have found a total of 6,096 acres of land where maize crop was affected due to pest attack. The maize crop was affected in a total of 5,711 acres in villages under Anandpur Sahib division that received Rs 3.17 crores as compensation amount, whereas, Nangal division received Rs 17.44 lakh as compensation amount for crop loss in 323 acres, Ropar division received Rs 6.85 lakh for crop loss in 58 acres and Chamkaur Sahib division got Rs 28000 for loss recorded in only two acres of land, according to revenue officials. SDM Anandpur Sahib Keshav Goyal, said, “The funds were received from the state government before imposition of code of conduct and the same have been transferred to the concerned Tehsildars for further disbursal to the beneficiaries. But, we have sought a legal opinion from the higher officials that if compensation can be disbursed during the model code of conduct”. Manjit Singh, Tehsildar of Anadpur Sahib said, “We are collecting the details of all the beneficiaries and would soon disburse the compensation into their accounts”. The farmer unions are divided on the view over compensation being given could lure the farm voters but said the affected farmers should be given the appropriate compensation. BKU Ekta-Ugrahan General Secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokarikalan said, “No doubt the government, in attempt to woo the voters, delayed in giving compensation for crop-damage so that the compensation may reach the farmers near elections.” Veer Singh, leader of Kirti Kisan Morcha said, “farmers would not be lured or impressed by the government as we had to protest for a long time on the roads to get the compensation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ropar-maize-farmers-to-be-compensated-for-crop-loss/articleshow/88924300.cms||Bharat Khanna

Shopping malls in Guwahati seemed to be most efficient in implementing the verification of the vaccination status of the customers before entry. However, in temples and other places of merriment, which are usually thronged by denizens on the first day of Magh, the “no-vaccine, no-entry” policy still eluded implementation, barring a few exceptions. In the Assam state zoo in Guwahati, which witnessed big crowds on Magh Bihu, the authorities were in a dilemma. Zoo DFO Ashwini Kumar said though there was random checking of the vaccination status on Saturday, rules had to be flexed in order to avoid congregation of people. Zoo tweaks vax rule to avoid gatheringWe could not check the vaccination status of each and every person who came to the zoo today. It would have aggravated the Covid situation if we had compelled all to show the vaccination status. Long queues and huge gatherings would have emerged then," said DFO, Assam State Zoo cum Botanical Garden, Ashwini Kumar. A state government directive early this month stated that non-vaccinated people shall not be allowed entry in public spaces/places (except hospitals ) w.e.f. January 15, 2022. "All people are mandated to carry proof of being fully vaccinated at all the places. The owners of such public/private enterprises shall be responsible to ensure that the entrants are fully vaccinated by checking their vaccination status. Failure to do so shall attract penal action," read the order. The Assam government has revised the vaccination target to 2.20 crore, but around 1.65 crore people have received the second dose till date.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-bars-unvaxxed-fromeverywhere-except-hospitals/articleshow/88924302.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Army Chief Gen. MM Naravane on Wednesday said “appropriate action”, as required to uphold the law of the land, would be taken based on the investigation and the Army’s court of inquiry is expected to submit its findings in a day or two. On the other hand, the state government’s SIT has already submitted a preliminary report and is expected to submit the final report to the court after receiving the forensic results. “The special investigation team (SIT) and Army’s court of inquiry-certified report must be shared with the Konyak Union for perusal after necessary formalities are completed from both the parties,” the Konyak Union on Friday resolved at a summit. The union resolved to give 10 more days from January 15 as ultimatum to authorities to deliver justice and prosecute the special force personnel involved in the botched operation and its aftermath on December 4 and 5 last year in which 14 civilians were killed. The union said if authorities fail meet their demands in the next10 days, the Konyak people will abstain from all national events within its customary jurisdiction as endorsed upon by the Eastern Nagaland Peoples’ Organisation. “The Konyaks once again reaffirm their stance/demands as submitted to His Excellency the President of India which clearly stated that ‘all rank and files involved in massacring 14 innocent Konyak Youths on 4th & 5th Dec 2021 must be prosecuted in the applicable civil court’ and ‘justice taken report must be brought before the public domain’,” the union said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/konyak-union-wants-access-to-sit-army-reports-on-oting/articleshow/88924305.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Guwahati||Assam: Covid puts brakes on buffalo fights in Morigaon district||GUWAHATI: What a Supreme Court order could not totally do, Covid scare did — put a halt to buffalo fights this Magh Bihu. A surge in Covid cases amid Omicron scare compelled most of the villagers’ groups — which used to organise buffalo fights unofficially — to give up the tradition completely in and around Ahatguri in central Assam’s Morigaon district. The fights are usually organised in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam to commemorate Makar Sankranti. In Baidyabori in Morigaon, however, there was an attempt to “secretly” organise buffalo fights but the administration blocked the plan after getting information from a section of villagers. Police had to resort to a baton charge to disperse emerging crowds. A group of Gowals at Kampur in nearby Nagaon district, however, managed to defy the ban but could not draw crowds. Morigaon deputy commissioner Prakash Ranjan Gharphalia said, “We have been very strict as far as buffalo fights are concerned. Besides the court’s order, Covid can worsen due to such gatherings.” Around 5,000 to 10,000 people would enjoy buffalo fights in central Assam earlier where several noted personalities were also invited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/covid-puts-brakes-on-buffalo-fights-in-morigaon-dist/articleshow/88924306.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Agra||Three out of five BJP MLAs denied tickets in Agra district||AGRA: Three out of five BJP MLAs from Agra district were denied tickets to contest the assembly polls in the first list of 107 candidates announced by BJP on Saturday. Etmadpur MLA Ram Pratap Singh Chauhan, Agra (rural) MLA Hemlata Diwakar Kushwah and Fatehabad MLA Jitendra Verma told TOI that the cancellation of their tickets is "unjustified". MoS in Yogi cabinet and Fatehpur Sikri MLA Chaudhary Udaybhan Singh, another MLA whose name didn’t feature in the list of candidates, was not reachable. Sources said that the minister, who has exceeded the 75 years age limit, was aware that he may have to make way for someone else. Ex-BSP MLA Dharmpal Singh - the official candidate from Etmadpur seat - had joined BJP three days ago. In the last assembly polls, Dharmpal was trounced by BJP’s Ram Pratap Singh Chauhan by nearly 50,000 votes. While BJP has given ticket to another former BSP MLA Chotelal Verma for the Fatehabad seat. In the Agra rural (SC) seat, BJP has fielded former governor of Uttarakhand Baby Rani Maurya, a decision which did not go down well among the party's core supporters. Hemlata Diwakar Kushwah, who had won by over 65,000 votes in 2017, said, “As an MLA, I had worked hard for public welfare in the last five years. My party leadership should have at least discussed with me if it was necessary to cancel my ticket. I have called for a meeting of my supporters now.” There were similar sentiments in Kheragarh too. BJP has fielded yet another ex-BSP MLA Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha from here. He had switched sides only a month ago. In 2017, BJP's then candidate, Mahesh Goyal, had defeated Kushwaha by over 31,000 votes. Angry party workers and supporters staged protests against the official candidates for Etmadpur and Kheragarh seats on Saturday and burnt their effigies. According to sources, at least three of the sitting BJP MLAs who were denied tickets are now trying to convince their party leadership to field them from some other constituency while two others are in touch with rival parties for a ticket. Senior BJP functionaries, including state president Swatantra Dev Singh, are trying to convince the disgruntled MLAs, sources added. Meanwhile, Agra's dominant Agarwal community - whose population is estimated to be around 3 lakh in the district - has publicly criticised the BJP at a community meeting for not giving a single seat to any of their representatives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/three-out-of-five-bjp-mlas-denied-tickets-in-agra-dist/articleshow/88924307.cms||Deepak Lavania

The team of doctors was successful in closing the hole with the help of an occluder device. This was the first of this kind of surgery performed in Kolhapur.Dr Akshay Bafna, the head of the heart department at the CPR hospital, said, “This bay is four months and 12 days old. She is from Radhanagari, and had a 4.5 mm hole in her heart. Her weight was also only 3.8kg, which is very low. Moreover, the baby’s blood vessels carrying pure and impure blood were attached to each other, further increasing the complications. The family members were against open-heart surgery. Fortunately, we were successful in carrying out the surgery using an occluder device. It was a big challenge as we had to perform the surgery through a 1.5-2mm blood vessel.”The surgery was performed for free under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana of the government.“A similar surgery was also performed successfully on a two-year-old girl from Kagal. She is recovering well and will be discharged soon,” added Dr Bafna.Both these surgeries were performed under the guidance of CPR dean Prashant Dixit, medical superintendent Dr Girish Kamble, and was performed by Dr Bafna with the help of Dr Kuldeep Totawar, Dr Majeed Mulla, Dr Bhupendra Patil, child specialist Dr Sudheer Sarwade, Dr Nidha Ijaz, Dr Sriganesh Kamat and other medical staff.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/critical-heart-op-performed-on-4-month-old-in-kolhapur/articleshow/88924309.cms||---

The counting process of the offerings received was completed on Friday evening.  The donations received in the past two months is more than the amount received during the Navaratra and Diwali periods last year. Shivraj Naikawde, the secretary of the Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti, said, “During the time of Makar Sankranti, devotees pour sweet ‘tilgul’ in the donation boxes. So, the currency notes can be damaged. Therefore, we had started the counting process before Makar Sankranti.” “There are nine donation boxes in the temple premises, and 50 people had been deployed to carry out the counting process over four days,” he said. With the temples remaining shut most of the time due to the Covid situation, and with only online darshan slots available, the committee had expected fewer donations. However, the devotees have offered much more than they had offered during the Navaratra and Diwali periods. After Diwali, the counting was done and the amount came to about Rs 1.3 crore. In the next two months, Rs 1,60,64,000 was received. The devotees have not only donated in Indian currency, but have also offered $137 of various countries like America, Canada, Singapore etc. said Naikawde.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mahalaxmi-temple-gets-over-1-6cr-donation-in-2-months/articleshow/88924311.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

It is equal to 10 lakh tonne of stone ballast. It admits that the state will have to depend on neighbouring states, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, for the stone ballast as the state may not get this ‘huge quantum’ of material.For earthwork in embankment and blanket materials, quarries will be identified locally and will be on one in every 75 to 100km stretch along the corridor. The DPR says that additional 5-10 hectare will have to be temporarily acquired. It has identified 10 locations for quarries — two in Attingal, Kundara, Mahadevapuram, one in Kanayannur, Naduvattom, near Vellarakkad railway station and Kundill with a tentative area of 116 hectare.A large quantity of soil will be required to fill embankments, it said. “Besides the excavated/ generated materials/ earth, etc, from the cuttings, cut and cover locations, etc, shall be segregated and reused in the adjoining reaches of the project. This will contribute for a large quantity of soil to be used as fill materials in embankments as well as for subgrade and blanketing, etc, based on the suitability,” reads the DPR.For stone ballast, the DPR says, “It may not be possible for Kerala to get this huge quantum of stone ballast from the quarries in Kerala alone. Hence it is proposed to obtain permission from competent authority for quarrying and moving ballast from adjoining states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.”It has even identified the locations where good quality stone ballast is available in TN and Karnataka. It identified Eraniel/Aralvaimozhi in Kanyakumari, Madukkarai near Podanur in Coimbatore and Mangaluru/Puttur in Dakshina Kannada district.CR Neelakandan, environmental activist, noted that there are no surprising details in the DPR. “What they said in the executive summary has been explained in the DPR. The costing is not proper and does not say about the quantity of raw materials required for the project. As per our calculations, for embankment alone on 327km, around 35 lakh cubic metre ballast and stone ballast is required and 100 lakh cubic metre red earth is required. Huge quantities of raw materials are required for other works,” he said. Neelakandan also questioned how Kerala can obtain permission from other states for quarrying when TN is restricting quarrying within the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/plans-to-get-stone-ballast-from-tn-ktaka-dpr/articleshow/88924314.cms||T C Sreemol

TOI had reported about the crisis on Friday. The government order fixing the retirement age of the CEOs issued on January 6 had made it clear that the decision would come into effect from that day.However, the government had not issued any specific order detailing whether they have to immediately hand over charge, and whom to hand over charge.This had triggered an administrative crisis as the secretaries who are the CEOs in most cultural institutions, had crossed the age of 65. Some of them were irked by the unceremonious exit they had to face, even though they were LDF sympathizers.But principal secretary Rani George, who is in charge of the cultural department, has now issued an order assigning officials to take over as the CEOs of nine cultural institutions, with immediate effect, till alternate arrangements are made. Accordingly, the additional secretary in the cultural affairs department has been directed to take over as the secretary of the Kerala Sahithya Academy, Sangeetha Nataka Academy and Folklore Academy.The deputy secretary in the department will take over as the secretary of the Kumaranasan Deseeya Samskarika Institute and Kerala State Book Mart, while the deputy secretary in the department will hold the post of director general of the Centre for Heritage Studies. Officials have been designated for taking over the administration of the Jawahar Balabhavans in Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam and Thrissur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/govt-steps-in-to-end-stalemate-in-cultural-bodies/articleshow/88924315.cms||T Ramavarman

Aby N Joseph is the new vice chairman while N Balamurali Krishnan has been appointed as the new secretary. The new team took charge at the Akademi headquarters on Saturday.Pushparaj is leaving the office without distributing the controversial cartoon awards. The awards announced by the Akademi for 2018-19 and 2019-20 had run into rough weather following attacks by different sections.The award for 2018-19, won by Subhash Kalloor, had won the wrath of members of the Catholic Church as the cartoon attacked the controversial Bishop Franco Mulakkal. Among the cartoon awards for 2019-20, the one by Anoop Radhakrishnan was selected for the honourable mention prize. This cartoon had been chastised by the pro-Sangh Parivar groups as it caricatures the Indian representative attending a global meet as a saffron-clad monk with the head of a cow. The Akademi had announced the awards for 2018-19 and for the next year in November and both have not been presented yet.Interestingly, some of the higher ups in the LDF government had also raised objections against the selection of the cartoon on Bishop Franco and the Akademi had to appoint a panel to review the decision. However, all along Pushparaj had said that the Akademi will stand by its decision and will present the award to the original winners.Pushparaj, meanwhile, clarified that the delay was only due to technical issues. “The Akademi had planned to give the awards for both the years together. But it was delayed due to Covid and other factors,” Pushparaj said.Interestingly, the Akademi had arranged functions to distribute some other awards even during this period.Subhash Kalloor said he was pained at the enormous delay in receiving the award. Even though the outgoing chairman was saying that the award would definitely be given, we are yet to received it, and his tenure is over now. We are running out of patience, as we have not yet been told even now when the award would actually be presented,” he said. “Now that a new committee has taken over, we don’t know how they will approach the issue,” said Radhakrishnan. When contacted, the new chairman said he has to study the issue before taking a decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/new-team-takes-over-amid-row-over-cartoon-awards/articleshow/88924316.cms||T Ramavarman

Addressing the annual Army Day parade, during which the 13-lakh force's new combat uniform with a "digital disruptive pattern" was also displayed, Gen Naravane said the last year was "extremely challenging" due to the ongoing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh as well as Covid pandemic. Referring to the 14th round of Corps commander-level talks between India and China on January 12, he said steps were being taken to keep the situation under control. "Joint efforts at various levels led to disengagement in many areas which is a constructive step. The efforts will continue to find a solution on the basis of mutual and equal security," he said. Gen Naravane, however, added, "Our patience is a sign of our self-confidence, but no one should make the mistake of testing it... Our message is clear, the Indian Army won't let any attempt to unilaterally change status quo along country's borders to succeed." The Army also displayed its new lighter, stronger and more climate-friendly combat uniform during the parade, which has been finalised after extensive consultations with the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) and study of the military uniforms of other countries, as was earlier reported by TOI. The ergonomically-designed camouflage fatigues, with the new "digital disruptive pattern" and a mix of colours from earthen to olive, is suitable for the diverse terrains like jungles, mountains and deserts in which the force operates. The shirt-like jacket, with a combat T-shirt underneath, will not be tucked into the trouser in the new uniform.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-to-thwart-bids-to-alter-border-status-quo-naravane/articleshow/88924317.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kochi: Social impact assessment study gives green signal to Vaduthala rail overbridge||KOCHI: The social impact assessment (SIA) study of the land acquisition for the proposed rail overbridge (ROB) at Vaduthala shows that the authorities can go ahead with the project by ensuring proper compensation and rehabilitation of affected persons. The detailed report regarding the SIA study, which was conducted by the Bharat Mata School of Social Work (BMSSW), Thrikkakkara, was submitted to the district collector. It is expected that the long-pending ROB project will gain momentum as the SIA study was completed last week. It is learnt that authorities would form an expert committee of engineers and people’s representatives in the region, in the following days, for a final assessment of the project, before issuing an official notification regarding land acquisition. The Vaduthala ROB project has been featured in many election campaigns over the years, as gridlocks on either side of the Vaduthala railway gate pose difficulties to thousands of commuters in the city daily. Vehicles from the city depend on the Vaduthala-Chittoor Road to easily reach the Container Terminal Road, avoiding Goshree Bridge Road and Edappally Junction. Also, it is expected that the ROB would resolve the issue of traffic congestion on the route to a certain extent. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala Ltd (RBDCK) had taken up the ROB project in 2016 alongside Pachalam ROB as part of the Kochi Metro package. Though the first alignment of the project was almost approved by the railways, the proposal to double the railway lines between Ernakulam and Shoranur forced the authorities to redesign the proposed ROB at Vaduthala. As per the existing proposal of ROB a total of 1.48 acres owned by 48 persons would be acquired for the project. A total of Rs 51.80 crore has already been sanctioned for the project. The SIA study says that the project will directly affect 47 landowners in the region and 10 families would be evicted from their houses. It asks authorities to ensure proper compensation to all landowners and building owners in the region and to properly rehabilitate them in other suitable locations in the city. It asks authorities to give priorities to the downtrodden people while envisaging schemes of compensation and rehabilitation. Vaduthala ROB action council chairman K G Panicker said that the land acquisition for the project can be completed in time-bound manner if the authorities take proper decision on the compensation amount. “When the land was acquired for the Pachalam ROB, each landowner was given Rs 15 lakh per cent as compensation. We are expecting more than Rs 20 lakh for each cent,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sia-study-gives-green-signal-to-vaduthala-rob/articleshow/88924320.cms||---

Social forestry authorities will convert an area of minimum five cents at Perumbavoor and Paravur into urban forests. At Paravur, Nagaravanam would be set up on the SN College campus and at Perumbavoor it would be set up on a school campus. “It would also be a solution for the surging air pollution in the cities,” said a source at the social forestry office at Erankulam. “We will plant only indigenous plants as they can easily survive here. It was two years ago that the state government decided to adopt the method of growing mini forests in urban areas. The method was called as Miyawaki model as the method was popularized by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. The project was launched as part of the Rebuild Kerala Initiative and the forest department is the implementing agency in the state. The programme is being implemented with the support of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/two-nagarvanams-to-be-set-up-in-district-this-year/articleshow/88924323.cms||---

In the letter to the VC, the professors referred to a notification, which stated that candidates require 65 marks to be included in the list of shortlisted candidates and the corresponding marks for SC, ST and PwD category is 60. Candidates belonging to the OBC category are required to get 65 marks. The group of professors, which also includes executive council member Seema Das, said that similar guidelines for both the reserved and unreserved categories are against the “principle of social justice.” “The same requirement for shortlisting of candidates — belonging to both reserved and unreserved categories — erodes the principle of social justice as enshrined in our constitution. The relaxation given to the reserved category applicants is not adequate to ensure their representation,” the letter said. It added, “As per the rules of Government of India, candidates hailing from reserved categories are given more relaxation in the criteria of evaluation as compared with the general category candidates.” Seeking a revision of the guidelines for shortlisting of candidates belonging to the reserved categories, the letter also demanded that all such candidates should be called for the interview.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/vc-urged-to-review-teacher-selection-rule/articleshow/88923085.cms||TNN

The joint move started by these agencies and students on the Gandhi Jayanti Day last year continues on every Saturday. On Saturday, around 100 students and others took part in the cleaning drive from 7am to 11pm. “We have been carrying out the drive ever since the project was launched on October 2 last year. We are trying to make Fort Kochi a model heritage centre with cleanliness. We do ensure people’s participation to successfully implement it,” an official with CHZCS said. As of now, the daily cleaning works are being carried out by 24 Kudumbashree workers deployed for the purpose. “Though they do their job in a commendable manner, the floating waste being deposited from the sea every day is huge. So, the drive being carried out every Saturday morning has a key role in ensuring a clean beach,” said an official associated with the project said. “It is during Saturdays and Sundays that more visitors turn up. So, the cleaning drive helps us provide the visitors a clean beach,” the official said. The officials are planning to introduce mechanisation for cleaning the beach in a more effective manner. They are also planning to plant trees on vacant areas so as to beautify the place. Despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases, Fort Kochi beach is witnessing more footfall. It is mainly those from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts who visit the beach in groups.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/collective-effort-to-ensure-a-clean-beach/articleshow/88924328.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: One in five samples test positive for Covid in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Roughly one of the five persons being tested is turning out to be Covid-19 positive in Ernakulam. As many as 6,60,773 people, who account for about 17% of the total population in the district, have tested positive for the virus so far. As cases soar, health officials have warned people to strictly follow social distancing, masking and sanitization. Ernakulam on Saturday reported as many as 2,637 Covid positive cases with the test positivity rate increasing from 30.84% on Friday to 33. 06%. Health authorities have urged those who remain unvaccinated to get inoculated at the earliest. The death toll due to Covid-19 in the district has risen to 5,895 and 67.97% of them were patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Health authorities said 87.04% of the Covid patients who died were unvaccinated, while 9.1% took only one jab. About 3.86% of those who died were vaccinated. Among the current active cases, only 0.98 patients have required ICU admission. “Though cases are rising, it has not reflected in hospital admissions and deaths. The weekly TPR in the district is at around 22%. But due to staff shortage in primary health centres it has been difficult to collect data on TPR in each local body. The PHCs are currently focusing on vaccination. We have asked local bodies to activate rapid response teams,” said Ernakulam DMO V Jayasree. The district has reported 79 Omicron cases so far and 46 among them had come from high-risk countries and 31 from low-risk countries. Two contracted the disease from their contacts. Forty-four of them have recovered while the remaining are undergoing treatment. “It is spreading like a flu and contact tracing is impossible at this juncture considering the transmission pace. The rate of hospitalization and ICU admissions has been low. Breathlessness was a big issue during Delta wave. But such a situation has not emerged now. We ask asymptomatic patients to undergo home isolation, if they don’t have other health issues,” said another health official. The health officials warned people against letting their guard down and stressed the need to follow Covid protocols. People should avoid coming into contact with others with fever and other symptoms. Wearing masks and regularly washing hands with sanitizers can reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. Those undergoing home quarantine should ensure that they do not come in contact with others. They should remain in a bath-attached room and ensure ventilation. The patient and bystanders should wear N95 mask. The utensils and cloths should be washed by the patients themselves and they increase intake of water and nutritious food. Their oxygen level has to be monitored daily and if the oxygen saturation is lower than 94% health officials need to be alerted. The health authorities said those undergoing home treatment can contact eSanjeevani for emergency. The service of Covid OP is available anytime through eSanjeevani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/one-in-five-samples-test-positive-for-covid-in-ekm/articleshow/88924329.cms||---

A TOI reality check showed that the three main railway stations have a proper system in place for waste segregation and disposal. Following the National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines for railway stations, the state pollution control board had issued a circular asking its officials to check the status of waste management in the railway stations. It called for total waste management in the stations. The railway stations have tied up with local bodies for collecting the waste from shops, platforms, waiting rooms, and washrooms that are deposited in colour-coded waste bins on the platforms. On the premises of Aluva railway station there are blue and red waste bins with stickers ‘Swachh Bharat Mission by Jan Kalyan Society'. One can find a long stretch of vegetables like spinach, different flowers, and plants grown across the vicinity of all railway stations in Ernakulam--it’s a special effort put in by the cleaning and representative staff during their free time. “Our work is usually to collect waste from the tracks, bins and platforms. There are not many rag pickers around here, so we arrive in the morning, begin our work and leave them in front of the parcel office in plastic bags. The station has a tie-up with the corporation which collects the waste and leave by 11am every morning,” said a cleaning staff at South Ernakulam railway station. “The central government has given much importance to waste management and we have been asked to implement changes in our waste management system by the end of 2023. We have been asked to organize and minimise waste in railways itself, and as a result, a plastic bundle crushing unit has been installed in platform 1 to crush the plastic, reduce its size, and auction it for use in plastic manufacturing units,” said Arun P A, chief health inspector, Ernakulam North railway station. “Currently, we have a tie-up with agencies who collect waste that our staff deposit in sacks in a sanitised corner near the building. They come and pick up the waste and ensure that it reaches the corporation who takes care of it,” he said. The National Green Tribunal has also instructed the railway board to ensure the development of a model design plan/standard operating procedure to enable individual stations to evolve a suitable environment management plan covering all aspects of waste management.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/railway-stations-better-at-dealing-with-waste-materials/articleshow/88924330.cms||---

According to Idukki circle inspector Jayan B, one of the injured SFI (Students Federation of India) activists belongs to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes community and so these charges were invoked. Meanwhile, the court postponed considering the custody application of the accused. Police sought 10-day custody to recover the weapon used in the crime. “The prime accused Nikhil Paily confessed that he committed the crime and threw away the weapon. We need to recover the weapon and it is very important for the case. After getting the accused in custody we will recover the weapon,” said the officer. Rajendran, a Kannur resident and an SFI activist at Idukki Government Engineering College, Painavu, was stabbed to death during clashes between Youth Congress and SFI activists in connection last Monday during college union elections.

---||Vadodara||A lab to promote research amongst science undergrads||Vadodara: Research is usually carried out by students pursuing PhDs or those who are studying in the last year of their master’s degree course. But MS University’s Faculty of Science is starting a new concept – curiosity laboratory – for grooming undergraduate students for research.This is to cater curiosity or inquisitiveness which many students develop during their school years.“This is the first of its kind initiative. The basic objective of this curiosity laboratory is to cater to curiosity or inquisitiveness which many students develop during their school days,” said faculty dean professor Haribhai Kataria.The laboratory will be a dedicated place for selected first and second year Bachelor of Science (BSc) students and if possible extended to third year students as well.Unlike regular laboratories where science students carry out experiments based on their regular studies, at the curiosity lab they will perform experiments based on what they had imagined during their school days or curiosity-driven subjects given by a teacher.Selected students will dedicate a minimum of 8-10 hours a week at this lab, outside their regular studies, maintain their research notebook, submit quarterly and annual reports with presentation.“We will prepare students so that they can present their work at national level conferences. They will be trained for reading, understanding, writing, presenting scientific research papers,” said Kataria, adding that every year such students will earn meritorious budding scientist certificates during a ceremony to be conducted by the faculty.To begin with, the faculty will choose five eligible students. For this a preliminary screening will be carried out at the faculty level. Students who have obtained 88% and above marks in their class 12 will be eligible to apply.The faculty will consider past academic performance of such students including their NEET, JEET, Olympiad scores, grades and any projects/ presentations during school, hobby, achievements and awards. “The partial funding for running this laboratory will be done by Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited,” said Kataria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/a-lab-to-promote-research-amongst-science-undergrads/articleshow/88924334.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Dehradun||‘Migration-hit hill dists had least voter turnout in 2017’||Dehradun: During the last Uttarakhand assembly elections in 2017, plain districts recorded the highest voter turnouts and hill districts, where migration had emptied out villages, the least. A report named “Migration & Uttarakhand 2017 Electoral Data”, released on Friday by Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation, suggests that migration was a major reason behind constituencies in remote areas recording very low voting. According to the report, the average voter turnout in Uttarakhand was 65.6% in 2017. “Barring Uttarkashi district, which recorded an average turnout of 69.38%, voting in all hill districts in Uttarakhand was far less than the average turnout of the state. Tehri (55.68%), Pauri (54.86%) and Almora (53.07%) had the least polling percentages,” said Anoop Nautiyal, president of SDC Foundation. Meanwhile, some of the plain districts had significantly higher voter turnouts, with Udham Singh Nagar at 76.01%, Haridwar at 75.68% and Uttarkashi at 69.38%. In 2017, the highest voter turnout, between 81-82%, was recorded in three constituencies of plain district Haridwar: Laksar (81.95%), Haridwar (rural) (81.76%) and Piran Kaliyar (81.6%). The lowest turnouts were in three seats of two hill districts: Salt (46.01%) in Almora district, Chaubattakhal (46.91%) and Lansdowne (47.87%), both in Pauri Garhwal district. Ghansali in Tehri Garhwal district had 49.19 polling percentage. Nautiyal said that to ensure that the pattern isn’t repeated this time and voting percentage remains high in hill districts as well, authorities must follow the “Uttarkashi model”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/migration-hit-hill-dists-had-least-voter-turnout-in-2017/articleshow/88924338.cms||Kautilya Singh

The group members were found infected in rapid antigen tests that were conducted while they were entering Rishikesh on Saturday. Jagdish Joshi, in-charge of the Covid care centre at Phakot (Tehri Garhwal), told TOI, "The group arrived in Uttarakhand on January 11 and was scheduled to leave the state on Sunday (January 17). They will be allowed to leave once they recover." Dr Sanjay Jain, the chief medical officer of Tehri, told TOI, "We have put them in isolation at the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam's Covid care centre in Rishilok.  Their conditions are stable. Besides, we are tracing all other people who attended the Bhagwad Geeta session with them." The health authorities have also decided to send the samples of these pilgrims for genome sequencing to detect if they have the Omicron variant. However, given the slow pace of testing, it is expected that they will recover from the virus before the test results come in. Notably, the Government Doon Medical College and Hospital is the only facility in the entire state where the Omicron variant can be detected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/41-ahmedabad-pilgrims-on-visit-to-haridwar-test-ve/articleshow/88924340.cms||Shivani Azad

We have enough staff to handle the situation,” said Pant. Doctors, housekeeping and record room managers at the hospital have also tested positive, said officials. On average, 30 Covid patients are treated at the hospital. While, Doon hospital is using its own labs for processing results, health department has roped in additional private labs to handle the situation.

Sources said, his induction in BJP was strategically organised in Agra to send out a larger message to upper castes in the politically crucial region. Upadhyay donning the saffron robe comes amid Mayawati’s freedom to her aide and party national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra to catalyze party’s acceptance among upper castes through Prabuddha Varg Sammellans.The development also comes amid SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s bellicose attempts to fragment BJP’s larger social coalition comprising upper caste, non-Yadav OBC and non-Jatav Dalits through poaching of backward caste ministers and BJP MLAs. Upadhyay, who resigned from BSP a day ago, already has his entire family in BJP. His wife Seema Upadhayay, a former MP from Fathepur Sikri, was elected as Hathras zila panchayat chairperson as a BJP-backed candidate during UP rural bodies polls. In fact, there had been reports that Ramveer campaigned for his wife wearing a scarf with “Jai Sri Ram ‘‘embossed on it. Since then there had been speculation he might join BJP by resigning from the BSP.Ramveer was suspended by BSP during 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when he reportedly opposed BSP candidates in Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Aligarh seats. This was the year when his younger brother and former BSP MLC Mukul Upadhyay crossed over to BJP. Soon, Ramveer’s wife Seema and son Chirag came in the saffron fold. Upadhyay’s another brother, Vinod, too has been working for BJP. One of the most powerful ministers in the Mayawati cabinet between 2007-12, Upadhyay was the leader of BSP’s Bhaichara committee to woo Brahmins in west UP during 2017 assembly elections. Not surprisingly, he is being considered a significant catch by BJP, which is being relentlessly dubbed as “anti-Brahmin” by the Opposition. BJP, nonetheless, has been signalling its soft approach towards Brhamins by not taking any action against junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Monu, is a prime accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight persons, including four farmers were killed.Upadhay won as a BSP candidate for the first time from Hathras seat in 1996. He became a cabinet minister for transport and energy in 1997, when BSP and BJP came together to form the government. He was again elected from Hathras in 2002 and then in 2007. In 2012, when Hathras became a reserved seat Ramveer shifted to Sikandra Rao seat and won. He switched over to Sadabad in the 2017 assembly election and won.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bsp-turncoat-ramveer-to-be-hoisted-as-bjps-brahmin-face-in-western-up/articleshow/88924356.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Aurangabad||Marathwada: Crackdown against illegal streetlights from January 17||Aurangabad: In a first-of-its-kind drive, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has announced a crackdown against 'illegal' streetlights in Marathwada. As per the directions of MSEDCL joint managing director for Aurangabad division Mangesh Gondavale, the action is slated to begin across eight districts of Marathwada from January 17.The local self-governing bodies have installed these illegal streetlights in both urban and rural areas on their own, without providing the provision of an independent phase. “The local self-governing bodies should remove these illegal streetlights before January 17, failing which, legal action for power theft would be taken as per the Electricity Act, 2003,” an official release said on Saturday quoting Gondavale. In absence of an independent phase, many of these streetlights are operating even during the daytime, causing a huge losses. “The power is a national asset, and such illegal public streetlight systems are inflicting huge financial damage to MSEDCL,” Gondavale said. Section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003, deals with Unauthorised Use of Energy (UUE) and has a provision for charging a tariff equal to twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category if the MSEDCL authorities conclude that unauthorised use of electricity has taken place. The MSEDCL has also appealed to the local self-governing bodies and other consumers to pay their dues, if any, at the earliest to avoid action in the form of disconnection of power supply. “Our teams are visiting the consumers' doorstep to clear their doubts and queries regarding power bills. The timely payment of bills is in the best interest of consumers as well as MSEDCL,” the state power utility officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/marathwada-crackdown-against-illegal-streetlights-from-january-17/articleshow/88924357.cms||---
---||---||Uttar Pradesh assembly elections: BJP uses Kalyan Singh formula to crack poll’s caste arithmetic||LUCKNOW: The first list of 107 candidates released by the Bharatiya Janata Party for the first two phases follows the formula propounded by former CM Kalyan Singh — and perfected by Union home minister Amit Shah when he was UP in charge in 2013 — to unit all castes, especially the OBCs and Dalits, under the grand umbrella of Hindutva. Despite a section of experts and Opposition members trying to set a narrative that OBCs are leaving the saffron pariwar when three backward ministers and six MLAs resigned from the party a couple of days back, the BJP has stuck to the formula first used by Kalyan Singh to ensure a clear majority of BJP in 1991 and then after 2014 Lok Sabha elections to give adequate representation to the OBCs and Dalits. So, the BJP’s first list has 44 OBCs, and 19 Dalits, which is nearly 60% of the tickets distributed in the first round. If Baldev Singh Aulakh — who is a Jat Sikh — is also counted, the number of OBCs in the list would be 45. In 2017, the party had fielded 44 OBCs on these seats. Assembly elections live updatesA fair number of seats given to Dalits is also with an aim to wooing a section of the community which may have drifted away from BSP. In 2019 Lok Sabha election, Dalit and Muslim consolidation led to BJP losing on nine seats as compared to 2014 while BSP managed to win 10.

---||Lucknow||BJP’s Dalit-Jat-Thakur trumpcard in restive west||Lucknow: While the arc lights remained focussed on the candidature of CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya from Gorakhpur (urban) and Sirathu respectively, there were three other names in the BJP’s list of 105 that also stood out — Baby Rani Maurya, Jaiveer Singh and Sahendra Singh Ramala.While Maurya is a Jatav, the Dalit sub-caste to which BSP chief Mayawati belongs, Jaiveer Singh, a Thakur, is a BSP turncoat who resigned from the UP legislative council to make way for Yogi Adityanath, who took over reins after BJP stormed to power in 2017. Ramala happens to be a Jat, who resigned from Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) to join BJP in 2018.Analysts saw this as BJP’s astute move to lend the much-needed traction to its grand Dalit-Jat-Thakur social coalition which is electorally crucial in west UP region, where BJP faces an assertive alliance of SP and RLD. While SP draws its electoral power essentially from the Muslim community, RLD has a formidable base among Jat voters.Baby Rani Maurya, who is BJP national vice-president, will contest from the reserved Agra (rural) seat, replacing sitting BJP MLA Hemlata Diwakar Kushwaha, who comes from the Dhobi sub-caste. In 2017, Hemlata had defeated BSP’s Kalicharan Suman by a margin of nearly 65,000 votes while cornering over 52% of votes polled. Sources said, by fielding Maurya from Agra, also considered to be the Dalit capital of UP, BJP seeks to wean away Dalit voters who stand staunchly behind Mayawati’s BSP.Wife of a banker, Maurya has been the first woman mayor of Agra from 1995 to 2000. In 2007, she contested from Etmadpur reserved seat in Agra, but lost to Narayan Singh of BSP. Maurya was appointed Uttarakhand governor in 2018, but she resigned two years later in September 2021. She was subsequently appointed BJP national vice-president. Her rise in the organizational ladder had fuelled speculations of her entering the poll fray.Jaiveer Singh, who has been fielded from Barauli assembly seat in Aligarh, too, has replaced the sitting BJP MLA Dalvir Singh. Significantly, soon after he vacated the seat for Yogi in 2017, Jaiveer was elected back to UP legislative council in 2018. Jaiveer had won from Barauli in 2002 and 2007, twice defeating Dalvir Singh, who was then with RLD. In 2012, however, Dalvir defeated Jaiveer. Dalvir later defected to BJP and defeated Jaiveer in 2017 assembly elections. With Mayawati out of power for nearly 10 years, Jaiveer too crossed over to BJP in 2018.So is the case with Sahendra Singh Ramala, sitting MLA from Chhaprauli in Baghpat district, the erstwhile pocket borough of RLD. He was the only RLD candidate to have won in 2017 assembly elections. His defection to BJP had left the then Ajit Singh-led outfit faceless in the UP assembly. BJP leaders said Ramala, a native of Baraut in Baghpat, wields considerable influence in the region and can help BJP consolidate Jat voters in the aftermath of farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjps-dalit-jat-thakur-trumpcard-in-restive-west/articleshow/88924359.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Swami Prasad Maurya is talking nonsense, says Mayawati||LUCKNOW: Sparing no barb against former party MLA Swami Prasad Maurya, who first quit BSP to become a minister in the Yogi government and then resigned recently to join Samajwadi Party, BSP chief Mayawati said that the OBC leader went from party to party before his fate finally shone in BSP. “BSP mein aane ke baad unki kismet chamki thhi,” she said, adding that Maurya had never won an election when he was in another party, be it Janata Dal or Lok Dal. “He won his first election after coming to BSP and became an MLA. He is talking nonsense. BJP carried him for five years. They tried telling him that they have to carry sarvsamaj with them but he did not listen. You know how his language is,” Mayawati said, adding that when one talks of Ambedkarwad, they should also understand Ambedkar’s thinking. The leader was not against any caste or religion but against casteism. Mayawati also demanded for a strong law against switching political parties before an election. In a sharp attack against SP, which has seen the highest influx of leaders from both BSP and BJP in the past few months, Mayawati said that all such people who are now joining SP are claiming that it is an Ambedkarwadi party which is also pro-minorities, pro-Dalits and backwards, but it is not true. “I would like to remind you that SP is the party which tore the Bill on reservation in promotions for SC/ST. They changed names of places and created hurdles in everything we did. I changed the name of Bhadohi to Sant Ravi Das Nagar but when SP changed the name again. SP only looked after the Yadavs and orchestrated riots which damaged Hindu-Muslim unity. They took Muslim votes but also ignored the community,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-maurya-is-talking-nonsense/articleshow/88924360.cms||---

Observing a quiet birthday in Lucknow, Mayawati told party workers that when Kanshiram was alive and well, he managed the party and she would be free to contest. Now, she’s burdened with handling party work and her job is to ensure others win. “I can even become CM by entering the Parishad,” she said. “The Opposition is plotting against me and asking why I didn’t hit the campaign trail. They are giving the impression I didn’t contest polls ever. They should know I have been a member of Lok Sabha four times, of the Rajya Sabha thrice, an MLA twice and an MLC twice. When poll results are declared, no survey or opinion poll will hold true. BSP will win with full majority,” she said. She hit out at the Opposition for targeting her nephew, Akash Anand, saying while she’s busy managing elections, he handles non-election states. “When the time is right, he and other young members will get their chance in electoral politics,” she said and lauded SC Mishra’s son, Kapil, for handling of BSP’s youth affairs in UP. Taking on the Opposition for questioning Akash’s absence in UP elections, she said, “I have no family. All poor, Dalits, and backwards are my family. Crores of youngsters are my nieces and nephews, whose parents call me Behenji. These children also call me Behenji. They should be given chance to move forward in life. If they continue hounding Akash, then like Kanshiram ji, I will promote him even more in the party. SC Mishra ji’s son Kapil has also been working to induct youth in the party and I am confident more youth will vote for BSP this time,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/can-become-cm-via-parishad-route-maya-tells-cadre-on-bday/articleshow/88924361.cms||Neha Lalchandani
