---||Goa||Covid-hit ISL: Match postponed but league goes on||Panaji: The Indian Super League (ISL) saw its third postponement as Kerala Blasters “did not have the requisite number of players available for the match” against Mumbai City on Sunday. Kerala, the league leaders, were forced into isolation since their clash against Odisha FC on Wednesday and did not have any training session prior to Sunday’s scheduled clash. While two players, hotel staff and non-technical staff were known to have tested positive for Covid-19, there were no indications of a postponement during the meeting with CEOs earlier in the day. In fact, both teams shared social media posts surrounding the all-important clash, only for the League to announce the postponement at 4.15pm, less than three and half hours before the game. “The decision has been taken in consultation with the League's medical team after it was assessed Kerala Blasters do not have the requisite number of players available for the match,” the organisers said in a statement on Sunday. FSDL CEO Martin Bain has previously said that if 15 players are not available for a match, the league will “try and reschedule” the match at a later date. This is the third postponement in this edition of ISL and, given the rise in number of positive cases, unlikely to be the last. Jamshedpur FC have been locked indoors since their solitary goal win against SC East Bengal on January 11 and are now scheduled to face Hyderabad FC on Monday. Except for Hyderabad, Chennaiyin FC and Mumbai, all other teams are isolating at the moment. Goa are allowed to step out of their hotel rooms only for training at the nearby Sesa FA ground. The organisers had a meeting with CEOs of all clubs on Sunday afternoon to discuss “urgent matters.” At last count, sources said, there were approximately 60 Covid positives within the eight bio-secure bubbles that have been breached, so far. Between ATK Mohun Bagan, Goa and East Bengal, there are 37 cases. Among those affected are players, coaches, support staff, non-technical staff, hotel staff, wives and girlfriends. There was no indication, however, from the organisers that the League would be paused to allow cases to subside and give the struggling teams some breathing space. “The league, as of now, is not considering postponement,” a senior official who attended the meeting told TOI. “Matches will be evaluated on case-to-case basis, and if teams are unable to field 15 players, the rules will come into effect.” According to the rules, if rescheduling of a match is not possible, a win with 3-0 margin will be awarded to the other team. If both teams have players unavailable, it will be considered a goalless draw. Sources said the league is revising its SOPs to allow clubs to train, rather than remain isolated in their rooms, which is the biggest concern at the moment. “Labs are stretched due to cases (across the country). The League is investing to get the results quicker by partnering other labs. If earlier RT-PCR results were available after 10-12 hours, in the next three to four days, results will be available inside three hours,” said another source. At the meeting, some clubs wondered why there was lack of clarity in postponing matches. “The 15-player rule is something that the Premier League also follows. While those rules are there, the final call is based on medical advice. It’s not just about positive cases and isolations. “For example, one has to consider the availability of at least two goalkeepers, development players, medical staff. A cancellation does not happen just because there are cases. The rule is the same for everyone,” said another source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/covid-hit-isl-match-postponed-but-league-goes-on/articleshow/88938320.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The action against Rawat has been taken for anti-party activities. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has dismissed Rawat from his Cabinet. Rawat along with his daughter-in-law Anukriti met Congress state chief on Sunday evening and they both are likely to join the Congress on Monday. While Rawat is likely to get a party ticket from Doiwala in Dehradun, Anukriti is seeking a ticket from Lansdowne assembly seat in Pauri district. Sources in the chief minister's office have confirmed the fact and the state BJP unit has also issued a statement on Rawat’s expulsion. According to a release from the Uttarakhand unit of the party, state BJP chief Madan Kaushik has maintained that indiscipline will not be tolerated, therefore a strict step was being taken against Rawat. He is regarded as a political stalwart and in the 1990's was a minister in Uttar Pradesh government after being elected from Pauri constituency. In 2002 and 2007, Rawat won from Lansdowne constituency and in 2012 registered a win from Rudraprayag. In 2017, he contested on BJP ticket and won from Kotdwar.

Adolescent vaccination is making impressive strides across the country. A total of 3.31 crore children in the age bracket of 15 to 17 years have already received their first dose, accounting for almost 45% coverage, just 13 days into the drive on January 3 this year. "We aim to cover all the 7.4 crore adolescents in the 15-17 age bracket with the first dose by January-end so that we can start vaccinating them with the second dose from early February and finish the second dose by February-end. We want to start vaccinating children between 12 and 14 years from February-end or early March," Dr Arora said. Children aged 12 to 17 are quite like adults, experts said. "So, the decision was mainly taken to protect the adolescents in the 15-17 group first. Once their full vaccination is done, the government will take up the policy decision to include the next age group, which is the 12-14 bracket," he added. Immunising adolescents is important as they are quite mobile. They go to schools, colleges, mingle and run a high risk of acquiring infection, particularly due to the fast-paced Omicron variant of the coronavirus. This is why the government prioritised this group from the under-18 category, experts said. “Expanding the ambit of children’s vaccination is a welcome step. The government should also consider prioritising the vaccination of comorbid children in the 5-14 age group as they are also more at risk of developing severe Covid,” said Dr Pramod Jog, former national president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which is being given to the country’s adolescents (15-17 group) has the Centre’s Emergency Use Approval for children in the 2-17 group. The vaccine has been found safe and effective in children’s trials in the 2-17 age bracket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-vaccination-for-12-14-age-group-likely-to-start-by-march-ntagi-chief/articleshow/88939002.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||India||Covid: India's 1st strain-specific vaccine targeting Omicron is in sight||MUMBAI: India could soon have its first messenger or mRNA vaccine soon, with the near-completion of Phase 3 clinical trials by Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, even as the company also started developing a variant or Omicron-specific vaccine using the same tech platform. The Pune firm has recently submitted Phase 2 trial data of their two-dose mRNA vaccine, and is close to completing phase 3 trials (over 3000 of the 4000 subjects have received the 2nd dose), sources told TOI. It has started manufacturing the vaccine "at risk" and can roll out "sufficient" quantities once it gets the regulatory nod. India's drug regulator is expected to review the data this week and take a decision regarding the approval soon, official sources said. Coronavirus live updatesPune-based Gennova has developed the mRNA vaccine for the Omicron variant in the laboratory, which will be tested for human use for efficacy and immunogenicity soon, sources told TOI. Dr VK Paul, chief of the national Covid-19 task force, told TOI that the development of the mRNA platform was a significant scientific feat for the country. The thermo-stable vaccine (using the existing cold chain infrastructure) and the platform could be useful for Covid once deployed, and even beyond, he said. The Omicron-specific vaccine under development is also exciting while the quick-switch platform would come into play as and when mutant strains emerge, he said. "The drug regulator will study and take a decision on whether an approval can be given (to Gennova)," Dr NK Arora, chairman of India's technical advisory group on Covid vaccination, said. Bharat Biotech recently claimed that a booster shot of its Covaxin would neutralise the Omicron variant, but it is understood that the data is yet to be studied by the regulator. Globally, too, Moderna, Janssen, Sinopharm, Gamaleya, Novavax and AstraZeneca are being tested to check their efficacy against Omicron, while many others are in development. Pfizer said its mRNA vaccine that targets the Omicron variant would be ready in March. A safe and effective vaccine using the next-generation mRNA platform could be an important option for boosting the immunity of health workers and the vulnerable population, as well as to widen the vaccine basket for the country's Covid immunisation programme. Gennova, a subsidiary of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, is also progressing on a paediatric vaccine for the age group 5 to 17 years, and has submitted the stipulated protocol to conduct trials. The mRNA vaccine technology is synthetic in nature and has the potential to reduce the speed of vaccine development timeline, Gennova Biopharm CEO Dr Sanjay Singh told TOI. The same tech platform, so-called 'pandemic-ready', can be utilised and scaled up quickly as the virus mutates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-indias-1st-strain-specific-vaccine-targeting-omicron-is-in-sight/articleshow/88939137.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The camps of former CM Harish Rawat and leader of opposition Pritam Singh are pushing for different leaders for these seats, which include five from Dehradun: Raipur, Doiwala, Rishikesh, Mussoorie and Sahaspur, the sources added. In Sahaspur, it was almost certain that Aarendra Sharma, considered a member of the Pritam Singh camp, would get the Congress ticket. That changed a few months ago, when the name of youth leader and zila panchayat member Rakesh Singh Negi, backed by Harish Rawat, cropped up. Negi is now being considered a strong contender. In Doiwala, Heera Singh Bisht, who had won the seat in 2014 bypoll, was speculated to get the ticket. Now, sources say, an "unexpected and surprise name" may get the Doiwala ticket and Bisht may be shifted to Raipur. In Raipur, Prabhu Lal Bahuguna and Mahendra Negi Guruji are in the race for Congress ticket. In Mussoorie, Congress is likely to decide between Jot Singh Gunsola and Godavari Thapli. It is a similar situation in Rishikesh, where the party is yet to take a call between Shoorveer Sajwan and Rajpal Kharola. When contacted, Congress general secretary (administration) Mathura Dutt Joshi told TOI that "it was a healthy competition for the party ticket." "It would be wrong to say that there are any differences. Each party member has the right to throw their hat in the ring and it's up to the party to decide on whom to place the bet," he said. Joshi added that almost all parties had more than one contender for each seat and that Congress will announce its list any day now. Both Rawat and Singh also denied being at loggerheads. Harish Rawat said, "There are no differences. A screening committee has visited areas of Garhwal and Kumaon and has directly interacted with the candidates."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caught-in-rawat-rival-tug-of-war-congress-20-uttarakhand-seats/articleshow/88939270.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||India||Covid: In one year, 70% of adults fully vaccinated||NEW DELHI: In an achievement unprecedented in both scale and reach, India has fully vaccinated nearly 70% of its adult population with two doses of Covid jabs in one year since the rollout of the world's largest vaccination drive against Covid-19 on January 16 last year. A postage stamp on indigenously-developed Covaxin was released on Sunday to mark one year of the inoculation drive. While more than 93% of adults have been covered under the programme with at least one jab, over 46% of adolescents in the 15-17 age group has also received the first dose. Besides, 42.98 lakh 'precaution dose' have also been administered so far. Lauding the feat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, "I salute each and every individual who is associated with the vaccination drive. Our vaccination programme has added great strength to the fight against Covid-19. It has led to saving lives and thus protecting livelihoods." The nationwide drive has added great strength to India's fight against the pandemic and resulted in saving lives and protecting livelihoods, he added. Despite the slow pick up of vaccination during the initial days of the drive, marred by supply constraints as well as hesitancy, the government managed to ramp up both stocks as well as administration of jabs in phases helped by strong awareness campaigns. The latest 10 crore doses were given in only 14 days, as against 85 days taken during the initial 10 crore vaccinations. While 12 states and Union territories have achieved 100% coverage of first dose of Covid jabs, 26 states have more than 90% coverage for the same. Seven states and UTs have more than 95% adults fully vaccinated. The Centre has urged states and UTs to speed up vaccination coverage to ensure people are protected against severe Covid-related disease and deaths. Overall, a total of 157 crore doses have been administered in the country till 9pm on Sunday - this includes 86% Covishield and 13% Covaxin. However, apart from these two jabs that were widely used under the government programme, several other vaccines have been approved in the country during last one year. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya released a commemorative postage stamp on Covaxin on Sunday to mark one year of India's inoculation drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-in-one-year-70-of-adults-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/88939293.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Indian infantry group with around 570 soldiers will be deployed under the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), which is tasked with monitoring the volatile border between north and south and facilitating humanitarian aid. The UNISFA is also authorized to use force in protecting civilians and humanitarian workers in Abyei. With 5,300 soldiers currently deployed in eight of the 12 UN ongoing missions around the globe, the Indian Army is the world’s third largest troop contributor to peacekeeping operations after Bangladesh and Nepal. The decision to send another infantry battalion comes amidst India’s ongoing two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council since January last year. This is the eight time India has a seat at the famous horseshoe table at the 15-member UNSC. The 13-lakh strong Indian Army has contributed over 2.58 lakh troops in 51 of the 71 UN missions since the first one for Korea in 1953-54, with 159 Indian soldiers having also laid down their lives in the operations. The deployments have ranged from Yemen, Namibia, Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia-Eritrea to Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, Lebanon, Congo and Sudan. But this has not yielded anything till now in terms of India’s concerted efforts to seek a permanent seat with veto powers in the UNSC. Just last month, India’s envoy to the UN, T S Tirumurti, had again underlined India’s case for a permanent UNSC membership. “India will continue to push for UNSC reforms. Apart from our performance at the UN and other factors, the Army’s participation in various peacekeeping operations has ensured stability in different parts of the world. The large troop contributions do reinforce India's claim for a permanent UNSC seat,” a senior official said. The UN deployments also earn goodwill for India, especially in places like the mineral-rich Africa, where the new “great game” is now being played with China making major strategic inroads into the continent. Apart from “international exposure”, UN assignments also give Indian battalions a much-needed break from being deployed along the long “active” borders with Pakistan and China as well as relentless counter-insurgency operations in J&K and north-east. Moreover, hefty UN allowances in dollars given to the soldiers, over and above their Indian rupee salaries, are also more than welcome.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-send-a-battalion-for-peacekeeping-ops-in-africa/articleshow/88939315.cms||Rajat Pandit

The minor girl was found in a distressed condition on a bridge in Alwar with injuries on her private parts on January 11. Soon, the state government will recommend the central government for the CBI inquiry, said an official statement released by the CMO. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting headed by CM Ashok Gehlot. It came a day after Gehlot hinted that the investigation can be handed over to senior police officers, CID, Crime Branch or CBI if the family demanded. It is, however, unclear whether the family has demanded the CBI probe. BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra and Shahzad Poonawala's post highlighting the crime on Twitter had gone viral. BJP state president Satish Poonia formed a three-member delegation to visit Alwar on January 12.The case took a U-turn on January 14 when Alwar SP Tejaswini Gautam called an urgent press conference to rule out the possibility of rape.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-pressure-from-bjp-rajasthan-set-to-give-alwar-girls-case-to-cbi/articleshow/88939387.cms||---

The proposed Bengal tableau was on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary, celebrating his Indian National Army, and had portraits of "some of the most illustrious sons and daughters of this country", including Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Sri Aurobindo, Matangini Hazra, Nazrul Islam and Birsa Munda. "I have been profoundly shocked and hurt by the decision of the Government of India to abruptly exclude the proposed tableau of the Government of West Bengal from the ensuing Republic Day Parade," the CM wrote to the PM, adding, "It is even more baffling for us that the tableau was rejected without assigning any reasons or justifications... I may like to inform you that all the people of West Bengal are deeply pained by this attitude of the central government. Bengal was at the forefront of the Indian freedom struggle and has paid the heaviest price for the country's Independence through Partition and uprooting of millions of people. It is shocking to find that this contribution of its valiant freedom fighters finds no place in the nation's ceremony to celebrate the occasion of the Republic Day in the 75th year of our Independence." Meanwhile, Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy tweeted that the state government is thinking of bringing the tableau on Subhas Bose and his INA to Kolkata if it isn't showcased in New Delhi as Netaji is goi-ng to be the central theme during the Red Road Republic Day parade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shocked-by-move-to-drop-r-day-tableau-mamata-to-pm/articleshow/88939405.cms||Debasis Konar

In the second development, a Canada court that had last year allowed the freezing of Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Air India (AI) assets on the appeal of Mauritius investors in the Devas company gives a partial relief to the government of India a few days ago by quashing its own order on freezing of AAI assets lying with international airlines body IATA. It also amended its second order and allowed only 50% of AI funds, lying with IATA, to be seized by Devas investors. Explaining the case, Antrix legal officer Chinmoy Roy told TOI that Isro’s commercial arm “had moved the NCLT for liquidation of the company after it found that it had committed a fraud. Once the NCLT ruled in favour of Antrix, Devas then filed an appeal in the NCLAT against the liquidation order. However, NCLAT also ruled against Devas, which then moved the Supreme Court against the tribunal order. On Monday, the Supreme Court upheld the NCLAT order on liquidation of the company for committing fraud.” A bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian dismissed the plea filed by Devas challenging the NCLAT order. The Devas case, which is simultaneously being heard in the Quebec Superior Court in Canada and a French court, is not against Antrix but against the government of India as foreign investors in the company, some of whom are based in Mauritius and Germany, have accused India of violating bilateral agreements between countries by not saving their trade interests while cancelling the satellite deal in 2011. Both AI and AAI have recently moved against the two separate orders, on November 24 and December 21, of the Quebec Supreme Court, which had permitted Devas shareholders to seize assets of AAI and AI held by IATA in connection with the two arbitration awards the company won in international courts for “wrongful” cancellation of the deal. During the hearing of the AAI-AI appeals, IATA told the Canadian court on January 3 that it held $17.3 million on behalf of the national carrier and $12.76 million on behalf of AAI, as of December 31. Giving a partial relief to the AI on January 8, the Canada court stated, “The court finds that it is in the interest of justice to limit the scope of the Air India seizure to 50% of the AI funds presently held by IATA, the whole retroactively to December 21, 2021, and that henceforth and until further order from the court, the AI seizure shall be limited to 50% of the funds received and held from time to time by IATA.” Freeing up AAI’s funds that were seized by Devas shareholders, the court said it “shall grant the AAI application to dismiss and shall declare that the first seizure should not have been heard and granted on an ex parte basis, without first disposing of AAI's claim to state Immunity”. The Canada court also clarified that AAI was an entity of the Indian state, enjoyed state immunity and that navigational charges and aerodrome charges collected by IATA on behalf of AAI were related to sovereign functions, not commercial functions. As per the January 2005 agreement, Antrix had agreed to build, launch and operate two satellites — Gsat-6 and Gsat-6A — and lease out 90% of the satellite transponder capacity to Devas, which had planned to use it to offer hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication services throughout India. However, the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government had to cancel the deal in 2011 when it found allegations of manipulation in the deal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devas-case-sc-likely-to-decide-on-liquidation-order-today/articleshow/88939428.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||4.6cr Indians slipped into extreme poverty during pandemic, but billionaires’ wealth rose: Oxfam||NEW DELHI: A new report on rising inequality highlights that while 4.6 crore Indians are estimated to have fallen into extreme poverty in 2020, accounting for nearly half of the global ‘new poor’ according to the United Nations, the number of Indian billionaires grew from 102 to 143 during the pandemic period. The collective wealth of India’s 100 richest people hit a record high of Rs 57.3 lakh crore ($775 billion) in 2021. The analysis is part of the statement released by Oxfam India, based on the ‘Inequality Kills Report: The Davos India Supplement’, that is part of the global report to be released at the World Economic Forum’s virtual event ‘The Davos Agenda’ on Monday. In India, the wealth of billionaires during the pandemic (from March, 2020 to November 30, 2021) increased from Rs 23.1 lakh crore ($313 billion) to Rs 53.2 lakh crore ($719 billion). In contrast, the report cites the Consumer Pyramid Household Survey data collated by CMIE for 2021 to point that it is estimated that 84% of households in the country suffered a decline in their income in a year marked by unprecedented loss of life and livelihoods. The data factsheets on wealth highlights that 142 Indian billionaires own more wealth ($719 billion) than 555 million people ($657 billion, bottom 40%). The richest 98 have the same wealth($657 billion) as the poorest 555 million people (bottom 40%). “If each of the 10 richest Indians billionaires were to spend $1 million daily, it would take them 84 years to exhaust their current wealth. Indians billionaires have seen their combined fortunes more than double during the pandemic. Their number shot up by 39%,” the Oxfam statement said. Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar said, “It has never been so important to start righting the wrongs of this obscene inequality by targeting extreme wealth through taxation and getting that money back into the real economy to save lives.” He also highlighted that the pandemic has set gender parity back from 99 years to 135 years now. Women collectively lost Rs 59.1 lakh crore ($800 billion) in earnings in 2020, with 1.3 crore fewer women in work now than in 2019. The analysis also shows that allocation towards health in 2021-22 saw a decline of 10% from the previous year in the Union budget, while the allocation towards education in 2021-22 saw an increase of 10% over 2020-21. However, education spending as a percentage of GDP has remained low at 3% and increased only 0.07% over the last 18 years. Similarly health spending as a percentage of GDP has remained abysmally low at 1.2% to 1.6% and increased only 0.09% over the last 22 years. It is further stated that with 93% of the nation’s workforce comprising workers who fall in the ambit of informal employment, there has been little success in bringing them under the ambit of formal employment. The report calls for focus on laying the legal groundwork for basic social protection for this sector. Oxfam India recommends that it is important to “recognise inequality is real and agree to measure it” with a robust and transparent data collection mechanism to measure income and wealth inequality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-6cr-slid-into-extreme-poverty-billionaire-count-rose-too-in-2020/articleshow/88939448.cms||Ambika Pandit

The maximum temperature rose from Saturday’s 12 degrees to 15.5 degrees Celsius, but it was still five notches below normal. The minimum temperature dipped slightly to 7.2 degrees from Saturday’s 7.5 degrees Celsius.According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), it is a ‘cold day’ when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below the normal for the season. The city has been reeling under an intense cold spell since January 14. So far, in this month Gurgaon saw three ‘cold day’ conditions on January 10, 14 and 16 and a ‘severe cold day’ condition on January 15.The IMD has issued a ‘yellow alert’ for Monday and has predicted the possibility of ‘cold day’ conditions. “As there is cloud and fog at the lower level of the atmosphere, the sunlight is getting obstructed from reaching the surface. This coupled with cold winds from snow-laden mountains brings a chill into the region. “Both the temperatures are likely to witness a rise from January 18. There will be a gradual rise in minimum temperatures by 3-4 degree Celsius during the next five days. Moreover, there is a possibility of drizzle on January 21 and 23 under the influence of western disturbance,” the IMD official said.According to the IMD weekly forecast for today, there will be a partly cloudy sky with a shallow to moderate fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperature is likely to hover around 15 and 6 degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, the AQI in the city improved slightly, but remained in the ‘moderate’ category for the second day in a row. The overall AQI reading was at 181, slightly better than 199 on Saturday.Two of the four monitoring stations including Gwalpahari and Sector 51 recorded the AQI in ‘moderate’ category with readings of 180 and 185, respectively. It was in the ‘poor’ category at Teri Gram with reading at 206. The AQI at Vikas Sadan could be recorded due to insufficient data.Meanwhile, there was a marginal improvement in the harsh weather conditions in Delhi on Sunday after shivering due to cold-day conditions for the past four days. However, the weather department still did not rule out the possibility of a cold day on Monday.Both minimum and maximum temperatures soared by over two degrees Celsius on Sunday, with a partially clear sun bringing much-needed respite for the people. The visibility at Palam was also better at 1000 metres at 8.30am, while the same at the Safdarjung was 400 metresCity’s base station Safdarjung recorded a maximum temperature of 17.2 degrees, three notches below the season's average against 14.8 degrees Celsius a day earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-respite-yet-cold-day-conditions-grip-city/articleshow/88939458.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Health training for teachers to restart from today in city||Gurgaon: The second phase of a five-day-long mental and physical health training of teachers of the state-run schools will resume from today. According to the education department, around 50 teachers from all four blocks of the district have been selected for the training.There are 11 modules as part of the programme and the teachers will be trained to improve the mental and physical health of the students. The department officials have maintained that with the prolonged closure of schools and absence of physical education, students have been developing health issues and there are growing anxiety-related issues.Thus, it is imperative for the schools to focus on the mental and physical well-being of the students when the schools, which have been closed due to the Omicron-led third wave, reopen.“We are conducting training of teachers of all the government schools for their and students’ physical and mental wellness. The first phase has already been completed and the second phase was put on hold as the schools were shut down. Now, teachers are being called back to the schools on a 50% attendance basis. So, we want to resume the training,” said an education department official.The department first aims to train at least two teachers each from the government schools and then they would impart the same training to other teachers and students in their schools. In the training, teachers would be taught yoga and other mental wellbeing techniques.“For better concept clarity and improved performance, both mind and body need to be fit and in a harmonious condition. That’s the only objective of this training,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/health-training-for-teachers-to-restart-from-today-in-city/articleshow/88939459.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Covid cases are rising, allow us to work from home: Teachers||Gurgaon: As the state education department has directed all the district education officers to ensure that school heads, teachers and non-teaching staff go to schools and take online classes from there, teaching and non-teaching staff of the state-run schools have raised their objections. Protesting against the recent directions, the teachers have said that the schools have been closed due to the third wave, and calling them back will risk their safety and well-being. Teachers have demanded that they should be allowed to work from home, especially at a time when the Covid cases are on the rise and schools are shut. “We don’t understand the need of calling teachers back to the schools for online education when the same work can be done from the home itself. Everything has moved online and officers can also track our work digitally,” said Tarun Suhag, state president of Rajkiya Prathmik Shikshak Sangh.“Calling students will unnecessarily expose them to Covid and in case they get infected their family members will also become vulnerable. Next week we have called a meeting and will raise a unanimous demand to not compel teachers to come to school,” he added. Last week, the directorate of school education had issued an order asking all the district education officers to inform the school heads, teachers, and the non-teaching staff that their winter break is over and that they need to report to the schools to continue with the online classes of the students. The directorate had further noted that teachers should be called on a rotational basis. Following the orders, all the block education officers released a circular informing the teaching and the non-teaching staff of the government schools. According to a few school heads in the Gurgaon block, however, all the teachers and the non-teaching staff have been called to the school. “Firstly, calling teachers at this time doesn’t make sense. On top of that, they are calling everyone and not adhering to the 50% rule mandated by the directorate. Despite our objection, the officials are not ready to listen to us and prepare a roster to ensure 50% attendance,” said a school teacher of Government School in sector 54. Meanwhile, the education department has denied the charges. “We haven’t come across any such complaints from the schools. It could be the case with a few schools where there’s just one school head and a teacher and few schools have just one staff only. A 50% of rule in such cases would be meaningless,” said an education department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/covid-cases-are-rising-allow-us-to-work-from-home-teachers/articleshow/88939460.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||City sees over 3k cases for 4th day in a row||Gurgaon: With Gurgaon continuing to see over 3,000 cases for the fourth consecutive day, the total active cases in the city catapulted to 21,129 on Sunday. An 83-year-old man, a resident of Sector 66, also succumbed to the infection. This is the sixth Covid-related fatality to be reported in the last six days —while two people succumbed on January 14, one person each died on January 10, 12 and 15.On Sunday, 3,378 more people tested positive for the infection, which is marginally more than the 3,349 cases reported on Saturday. The district reported over 3,000 cases since Thursday --- 3,897on January 14 and 3,031on January 13. A spike in a daily positivity rate, up from 25.6% to 27.7%, was also noted in the last 24 hours. As many as 933 people have succumbed to the infection since the outbreak of the pandemic. The octogenarian, who succumbed on Sunday, had been admitted to a private hospital on January 13 with decreased response and drowsiness. The patient also had comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetics and chronic dementia. The patient, officials said, was initially administered IV fluids, antibiotics and put on oxygen support. Later, he was also given BiPAP support in view of hypoxia but suffered cardiac arrest. The deceased, officials added, had not taken any vaccine doses. “In the recent cases, patients were found Covid positive after they were admitted to hospitals for some other investigation. Prior to hospitalisation, they were not tested as they did not have any symptoms,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, said.Doctors, meanwhile, pointed out that more people were recovering without hospitalisation in this wave. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, the founder-director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said, “ This time people are also recovering in four to six days, unlike the last time when it took 10 to 15 days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/city-sees-over-3k-cases-for-4th-day-in-a-row/articleshow/88939461.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Recovery is faster, say patients who had Covid in 2nd wave too||Gurgaon: Prakash Sharma (52) had the Covid report in his hand. He had tested positive — for the second time. He sniffed his hand, he could smell. A couple of bites into the biscuit, he hadn’t lost taste either. There was no breathing distress too.This wasn’t like the last time. Sharma, a private firm employee, is among many others in the city who have been found to have Covid in the subsequent waves. Both he and his family agreed that though the virus is more infectious this time, it isn’t as virulent as the deadly second wave.Four days of cough and body ache, Sharma decided to get himself tested on January 4. Though the symptoms were mild, he was worried all the more because he had diabetes.“My wife was extremely worried this time as my oxygen level had plunged to 85 the last time I tested positive on May 31. I had to be wheeled into a hospital,” Sharma told TOI, adding that he and his family get shivers just thinking about that.But, it’s different this time. “Last time, I had to be put on a ventilator for three days. But this time, a home isolation for a week was enough. Unlike the last time, when I was given several high-dose medicines and injections, just a few basic tablets did the trick. Our friends and neighbours reached out to us with help,” he added.For many like Sharma, the recovery phase after Covid has been quite faster and less challenging than the second wave. Several patients TOI spoke to said they had not been experiencing breathlessness, fatigue, palpitation or joint pain — quite common for patients in the weeks after recovering in the previous phase. In the second wave, many patients had viral pneumonia in the lungs, which caused other organs such as the heart, kidney and brain to witness inflammation. This lingered on for months and slowed down the recovery process. This, in turn, led to anxiety among patients that they might get infected again. Most patients in home isolation are taking less than seven days to recover in the current wave, according to doctors. Aakash Kumar (42), who tested positive on January 4 after three days of fever, said he had already started to feel better in three days. “When I had Covid in June, I had to be put on oxygen support. But this time, I had been taking only antibiotics. My wife, son and daughter were infected too. We were all in home isolation and spent time together. Even our neighbours cooked meals and brought for us. It was a community effort to win over the virus. I think people have slowly realised they will have to live with the virus,” said Kumar, a resident of Sector 31. “The last time, the infection had an effect on my mental health. It broke me from within.”According to officials, nearly 95% patients in the city have recovered despite surging cases. “Yes, people are recovering much faster as the virus is not affecting the lungs in maximum cases. With time, our teams are also well-versed in handling home isolation cases,” said Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Although many of the symptoms are similar to that in the previous wave, such as cough, cold, fever, body ache and so on, patients are also experiencing chills and headaches this time. Doctors are mostly advising anti-inflammatory drugs like paracetamol and seven days of home isolation. “Home isolation is more than enough. No unnecessary tests or hospitalisation are required in case of mild symptoms. In the last wave, we noticed that around 30% had persistent fever for more than 5-6 days, followed by lung infection, low oxygen level and in some cases, even clotting. Most of them required treatment accordingly, like domiciliary oxygen, hospital admissions both in wards and ICUs, depending upon the severity. Number wise, more people have been affected this time. But the severity is practically negligible,” said Dr Amitabha Ghosh, senior consultant (internal medicine) at Manipal Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/recovery-is-faster-say-patients-who-had-covid-in-2nd-wave-too/articleshow/88939462.cms||Ipsita Pati

The account had share portfolio of Rs 65 crore, much of it, police believe, is from the fraud money. Deputy commandant Praveen Yadav, who was on deputation on the NSG campus in Manesar till May last year, had allegedly orchestrated the Rs 125-crore fraud by awarding tenders for the construction of projects that did not exist at all. Praveen had allegedly planned the fraud after losing nearly Rs 50,000 in share trading. Till now, the police have recovered around Rs 13.8 crore in cash, 10 luxury cars, items of jewellery believed to be worth Rs 1 crore and sealed properties worth Rs 12 crore. Praveen had allegedly given a luxury car and a flat in Noida to a women whom he had met on Facebook. The police have recorded the statement of the woman. While Praveen, his wife and sister have been arrested along with a property dealer, his brother-in-law — an ITBP assistant commandant — is on the run. The police have also recovered three laptops and have sent them to the forensic lab for investigation. Police believe the data from these devices would help in collecting more details about the financial transactions of the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/contract-fraud-bsf-mans-share-trading-a/c-frozen/articleshow/88939463.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Close call for man as bikers shoot at car on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway||GURUGRAM: A 51-year-old man had a close shave when two bikers allegedly fired at his vehicle in Panchgaon while he was driving past the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway on Saturday. The bullet hit the rear window of his car. Parveen Rao (51), a resident of Rewari, was on his way to Gurugram in his Mahindra Thar to meet his brother, who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city. Rao was near Panchgaon when two miscreants followed him on a bike and tried to block his way. When he did not stop, the accused opened fire targeting him and one of the bullets hit the rear window of the Thar.  Rao then sped up and went straight to the Manesar police station. “They fired a few rounds and one of the bullets hit the rear window of the vehicle,” said Rao. “The accused tried to chase me but they could not keep pace with the speed of my vehicle. They were trying to kill me,” he added. Inspector Pankaj, station house officer (SHO) of Manesar police station told that the complainant reached the police station with his car which had a bullet mark. “We have registered a case and are trying to track the accused,” he said. Rao suspects that the attack might be related to his complaints filed with union minister Rao Inderjit Singh against two societies in Gurugram and Rewari. However, the police believe that this could also be a vehicle snatching attempt. “It could be a possible case of vehicle snatching as well,” said a police officer. A case has been registered under sections 307 (offence of attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and relevant sections of Arms Act at Manesar police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/close-call-for-man-as-bikers-shoot-at-car-on-e-way/articleshow/88939464.cms||---

In its order, a copy of which has been accessed by TOI, Vivek Kalia, the state registrar, writes, “It is its (authority) bounden duty to be constitutionally and legally correct even when its view and judgement is counter majoritarian. It has utmost regards for the mandate of the residents of Jalvayu Towers but in the instant cases they were misled and made to exercise their franchise not fully expounded about the danger of resorting to such stratagem.”The election to theRWA of Jalvayu Towers was held in April last year, but its result was challenged by some of the residents alleging gross violation in the conduct of the election process. Following this, the residents had approached the state registrar alleging bias and misuse of power by the then district registrar in favour of one of the group contesting the election.One of the residents of the society had filed a complaint against the district registrar for upholding the poll results. The resident in the appeal had said that just four days before the date of poll, the then district registrar ordered changes in the eligibility criteria of the contestants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/jalvayu-towers-rwa-election-set-aside-by-state-registrar/articleshow/88939465.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Associate director of the department of neonatology and paediatrics at Japyee Hospital, Dr Ashu Sawhney told TOI that while the number of children testing positive for Covid was similar to the second wave last year, this time children were symptomatic with high-grade fever, throat pain and cough persisting for more than 2-3 days in some cases. “Children, especially the ones below one year, are also exhibiting symptoms. Children with comorbidities, like allergy and asthma, are experiencing severe infection and are at high risk. But, fortunately, most of them are recovering with medication and treatment at home,” Dr Sawhney said. Currently, 10 children are undergoing treatment for the viral infection at The Post Graduate Institute of Child Health in Noida. “Most of the children admitted at the facility had come for the treatment of other diseases but found positive for Covid when tested. Children, who are visiting the OPD, are also being checked by doctors and based on their symptoms and severity, they are being hospitalised. The third wave was expected to be a little severe for the children as the vaccinations for the minors (below 14 years) are yet to start. However, we were better prepared for the situation with facilities like Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) in place”, Dr Jyotsna Madan, the director of Child PGI, said. Dr Deepika Rastogi, a consultant in the department of neonatology and paediatrics at Ghaziabad’s Yashoda Hospital said that besides fever, throat pain and cough, many children were also experiencing problems like stomach ache and intestinal infection. “Children, especially aged between six months and 15 years, are exhibiting symptoms though their severity can vary from case to case,” the doctor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/kids-showing-more-symptoms-this-time/articleshow/88939467.cms||---

For this, the authority has tied up with HDFC Bank and fines will be levied through the POS machines and the slip of the challan will be handed to the offender on the spot, unlike earlier when it was done manually and it had to be updated in the authority records. To start with, smaller fines will be implemented, officials in the authority said. “We are the first authority in the country that will impose fines for unattended garbage using the point of sale machine. With this, an on-the-spot challan will be generated, and the amount of the challan will also be debited immediately, just like any debit card machine. This will eliminate the hassle of generating a manual challan and updating it in the authority records. A slip will also be given on the spot from this handheld machine which will be given to the person or company on whom the challan will be levied,” said Salil Yadav, the deputy general manager of public health department, GNIDA. This machine will be with the public health department of the authority and will be used by their teams during their routine sanitation inspections across the city. According to officials, along with the awareness campaign to make Greater Noida clean, the authority is also tapping the use of technology in this drive. “With the POS machine, the authority is making a new beginning by using technology. The point of sale machine is developed in collaboration with HDFC Bank. Its trial has started and the fine data will be updated on the website of the authority,” added Yadav.Meanwhile, as Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 are in force in Greater Noida, under it, all bulk waste generators have to manage their waste on their own.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/spot-fine-for-illegal-waste-dumping-in-greater-noida/articleshow/88939468.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

According to the police, the suspects have been identified as Ravi Kumar (30), a native of the same village as hers, and his friend Vijendra Kasana (40), from Sector 133. The complainant said that on Saturday afternoon, she was returning home from a local market. After covering some distance, Ravi intercepted her and started abusing her and when she raised an alarm, some local people came for her rescue.“But, he tried to run away but he fell on the road. He received injuries on his head and I caught hold of him,” she said.The locals informed the police and a team arrived and brought Ravi to the police station where he apologized to the woman after which she did not file a complaint.However, the accused had other plans. “Around 8.30 pm, when the woman reached her house, Ravi and his associate Kasana were there already. They knocked on the door but the woman didn’t open it after which both the accused had used foul language. When the lady opened the door and tried to oppose it, both the men thrashed her badly in front of the neighbours. Both fled from the spot after threatening her with consequences,” the complaint read.Sujeet Upadhayay, SHO, Phase-2 police station, told TOI that on the basis of complaint, an FIR has been registered against both the accused under sections 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Noida||In lockdown years, rape cases more than halved in Noida||NOIDA: The number of rape cases registered in the city have more than halved in the two lockdown years of 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. According to data sourced from police, while 96 rape cases were reported in 2019, there were 42 complaints 2020 and 41 the next year. Social activists, however, dubbed the dip “nothing unusual”, considering most people stayed indoors during the lockdown months of 2020 and 2021. “Our teams are working rigorously in tackling crime against women. It is very important to raise awareness among them,” said deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety) Vrinda Shukla. The officer said one of the biggest challenges was to make women aware about what could be construed as crime against them and gain their trust so that they come out and report the cases. Special women helpdesks have been set up in every police station because of this. “The dedicated helpdesk works towards women issues so that the cases are solved at the earliest and chargesheets are filed within a month,” Shukla said. “We have introduced the women’s beat system, under which rural areas have been divided into 127 beats. Every week, beat officers from respective police stations meet women in the villages and make them aware about the crimes that can happen against them and encourage them to raise their voice,” Shukla said. Yogita Bhayana, the founder of People Against Rapes in India (PARI), said the dip was expected during the lockdown. “The main reason behind the dip in cases is the lockdown, when everybody was confined to homes. The number would have been higher had domestic rapes been reported too. In such cases, the accused are mostly known to the woman. The fear of social stigma often makes women keep the crimes to themselves,” she added. Yogita said the police had a long way to go to making the city safer for women. “Before taking credit for the numbers going down, the police have a lot to do on the ground. Connectivity still remains a major issue at night and there are a lot of dark stretches in the city, especially towards Noida Extension. Not to forget the harassment one goes through to get a complaint registered,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/in-lockdown-years-rape-cases-more-than-halved-in-noida/articleshow/88939471.cms||Advitya Bahl

A cache of 360 weapons was seized in these shootouts, it stated. According to the data, a total of 211 people were arrested and 154 weapons were seized in the 86 shootouts reported in 2021, while 252 people were nabbed and 206 weapons seized in as many as 140 shootouts recorded in the previous year. The district police, it added, nabbed 209 criminals carrying cash rewards, in 2020. “At least three of the criminals carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh cash, followed by a bounty of Rs 50,000 on 16 others, and Rs 25,000 on 173,” the data for 2020 stated. It added that 46 criminals carrying cash rewards were held after cross-firing in 2021. Criminal Ajay alias Kalia, who carried Rs 1-lakh price money on his arrest, was also killed in of the shootouts last year, police said. No specific details on the total number of people injured or killed in these shootouts, however, have been mentioned in the data which was released by the district police on the completion of two years of the commissionerate system — in 2020, the Uttar Pradesh government had approved a commissionerate system of policing in Lucknow, Kanpur and Gautam Budh Nagar. IPS officer (1998-batch) Alok Singh, the commissioner of GB Nagar Police, told TOI that the department has a “zero-tolerance policy” against gangsters and criminals. “Our aim is clear: to go hard against the organised criminals and gangs active from the past several years. Action under the Gangster Act was initiated in 54 cases and property worth around Rs 148 crore has been seized since January 2020,” he said, adding that Rs 73.13 crore property of gangster Sunder Bhati, who is facing charges in 73 cases, was also seized in the past two years. Bhati is currently lodged in jail. According to senior police officers, seizure of property in such cases sends a strong message to other gangs and discourages criminal activities. “The crackdown is being carried out chiefly under Section 14(1) of the Gangster Act, which allows attachment of illegal properties in order to effectively curb gangsters, mafias and criminals and their associates,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/over-460-held-in-city-in-226-shootouts-in-2-years/articleshow/88939472.cms||---

When the businessman and his wife returned home, they found the safe broken and the servant missing. They lodged a complaint of theft after which the property cell started a parallel probe.

---||Mumbai||HC rejects pre-arrest bail plea of 4 builders in cheating case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court recently rejected the pre-arrest bail applications of four persons in a January 2020 case filed by buyers alleging they were cheated in a project in Mumbai suburbs.The HC single judge bench of Justice S V Kotwal had on January 11 turned down applications filed by S G Kallan, Abdul Zoeb and Raychel D’Souza in 2020, and a separate one filed by A R Tinani last year. “The prosecution’s case is that the entire building is unauthorised. The plans were sanctioned for 18 flats and they entered into 70 transactions for sale of 18 flats. Obviously, the transactions are fraudulent,” said the bench. “The applicants’ role is described in the FIR as well as in the investigation carried out so far. Even after accepting money, agreements were not executed and possession was not given. Their custodial interrogation is absolutely necessary,” said Justice Kotwal in the order, adding that since “many victims have suffered monetary losses. No case for grant of anticipatory bail is made out and the applications are rejected.”The HC heard advocate Murataza Nazmi appearing for Tinani and advocate Sudeep Pasbola for Kallan and others. Over a dozen buyers had filed intervention applications through their advocate Shahbaz Khan Pathan and opposed grant of any relief to the builders. Additional public prosecutor Ajay Patil, too, “strongly opposed” the pre-arrest bail plea, said the HC. The FIR lodged by aggrieved Dr Devidas Raut said that in 2012, he wanted to buy a house and learnt of a project called ‘Hazel Homes’ at Daftary road by M/s Nine Globe Builders. On project site, Raut said he met Kallan and Tinani as directors of M/s Urban One Realty. He booked a flat for Rs 73 lakh and paid Rs 32 lakh in cash in January 2013. He subsequently made cheque payments to Urban One Realty, but no agreement was executed, he alleged in the FIR. He later learnt that his flat was earlier sold by Nine Globe Builders to one Dharmendra Mehta through a registered agreement on December 2014, and who in turn sold it to someone else about a year later.Pasbola said his clients sold flats pursuant to an agreement between developer Nine Global and co-developer Urban One Realty shown as a proprietary concern, but later the flat numbers were changed unilaterally by the developer and it was beyond his clients’ control to give effect to the earlier transactions. They were, however, willing to give alternate flats and therefore there was no element of cheating, said Pasbola, reiterating that the flats were actually sold by the developer.Nazmi said Tinani was not a director but only an employee of Urban One Realty and cannot be made an accused. The HC, however, said, “there is no force in the submissions made by either of the counsel that the applicants had no role in the transactions.” To a plea to extend an interim relief, Justice Kotwal said, “Considering the seriousness of the allegations, I’m not inclined to extend the stay.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-plea-of-4-builders-in-cheating-case/articleshow/88939496.cms||---

---||Mumbai||2 suspended, notices issued to dozen over KEM ‘ragging’||Mumbai: Parel’s KEM Hospital has suspended two medical students and served notices of misconduct to a dozen more after a third year Occupational Therapy student from the Scheduled Caste community alleged he was being harassed. The college, though, has categorically said that investigations by two of their committees didn’t find any evidence of ragging or casteist remarks made against him, but only of improper behaviour. The student, who hails from Hingoli, had first registered a complaint with the college authorities on December 13, saying he was being harassed and pushed inside his room, and about alleged threats by hostel mates to remove the belt and beat him. The fight allegedly started with him clicking pictures of roommates over the phone. Dean Dr Sangeeta Ravat said the matter was heard by the institute’s anti-ragging committee on December 14 and 15, and a report was sent to the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences. However, since the committee didn’t have the mandatory 21 members—an NGO representation was missing — a second committee was formed. The second committee met on January 10, and video recorded statements of everyone named by him. “The committee didn’t find any evidence of ragging or casteist remarks,” said the dean. The committee still decided to suspend two from the hostel for two weeks and cancel one’s scholarship for a month as there was some “misconduct”. The hostel’s caretaker who went on leave on the day of the incident has also been put under suspension. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-suspended-notices-issued-to-dozen-over-kem-ragging/articleshow/88939498.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Severe immune effect seen in Delta absent in Omicron cases in Mumbai: City hospital data||MUMBAI: Cytokine storm, a severe immune reaction that was seen in many Delta patients after seven to eight days, was not reported in a single case of Omicron treated at SevenHills Hospital, Andheri. The civic-run hospital has treated more than 125 confirmed cases of the new variant, the highest in the city.  Doctors at the hospital said not a single patient needed oxygen or any non-invasive ventilator support. Dr Rajas Walinjkar, consultant and unit in-charge at SevenHills DCH, who has handled Omicron cases with his team, said that no clinically significant rise in inflammatory markers like CRP was seen in a single case. “We didn’t see a single case of cytokine storm. Such patients tend to become severe and go on to need oxygen and other intensive treatments as we experienced during the Delta wave,” he said.  Globally, there has been evidence that Omicron largely affects the upper respiratory tract and doesn’t attack the lungs outrightly. SevenHills’ patients too largely saw clear lungs in Omicron patients, the doctor said, adding that the highest HRCT scan score they have seen was 5 or 6 out of 25. “It was also mainly found in those who either delayed coming to us by a few days or had some underlying co-morbid conditions,” Dr Walinjkar said, adding that in most the lung lesions resolved shortly and without heavy intervention.  Can clinicians tell if a patient has Delta or Omicron variant by looking at symptoms? “No, it’s unlikely. The disease usually starts with sore throat or fever, then progresses to body ache. The fever spikes usually manifest for 2-3 days before it starts to subside,” he said. However, early symptoms resolution is probably one of the indicators that the person was probably affected by Omicron.  Of 125 confirmed cases in hospital, 119 were discharged and six transferred to private hospitals. He said cases are no more segregated as Omicron or Delta and treated symptomatically. “The biggest red flag for treatment escalation has to be persistent high-grade fever that doesn’t subside after 3-4 days and needs to be evaluated,” he said.  However, most of these patients were either fully or partially vaccinated. Data shows 74% were vaccinated with both doses, including eight patients who’d taken booster shots, 13% were partially vaccinated and nearly 12% unvaccinated. Vaccination status of six patients was unknown. The doctor said since none of their conditions was severe, it wasn’t possible to compare behaviour of disease in the vaccinated and unvaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/severe-immune-effect-seen-in-delta-absent-in-omicron-city-hosp-data/articleshow/88939499.cms||Sumitra Debroy

On Sunday, there was confusion among residents as parks and gardens in some localities were open during the morning and evening but shut down during the day. Samajwadi Party MLA and Corporator Rais Shaikh wrote to Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal saying that all parks and gardens were shut in Mumbai despite there being no written orders or circular. “The state government orders only mentioned amusement parks, zoos and museums since there are massive crowds at these locations. Gyms, saloons, spas and hotels and restaurants are open at 50% capacity. The decision to shut down parks and gardens is one-sided and defies logic. Many senior citizens and residents have complained that parks and gardens are shut and they don’t have any place for exercise too. The BMC must scrap the decision on closing down parks and gardens and allow citizens to use them,” Shaikh said. BMC officials said that parks and gardens were shut down for a day but later they have been kept open from 5 and to 9 am in the morning and 5 pm to 8 pm in the evening. However in a tweet by the BMC’s G-North ward stated that all parks and gardens were shut leading to confusion among residents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/oppn-parties-slam-bmc-for-closure-of-city-parks-gardens/articleshow/88939500.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

While Mumbai reported a 25% dip in cases, the state reported a 3% decline in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra reported 41,327 cases and 29 deaths, taking its total cases to 72.11 lakh and 1,41,808 deaths. Mumbai reported 7,895 cases and 11 deaths, inching close to the 10 lakh cases mark. The state and the city also reported huge discharges on Sunday.  Though active cases in the state rose again, they declined in the city. Covid discharges in Mumbai were nearly three times higher than daily detections on Sunday. Over 2.65 lakh cases are under treatment in the state, of which 60,371 are in the city. Daily Covid hospitalisations in the city also saw a slide, but doctors cautioned that it would be early to believe the third wave is over. From a high of daily admissions in the range of 1,200-1,400 between January 5 and January 9, it has dropped to under 1,000 for the past seven days. On Sunday, 688 people took admission, of which 92 went on oxygen support.  Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist with Fortis Hospital and a member of the state Covid-19 taskforce, said deaths are seen in people who are delaying consulting a doctor. “Many have bought into the narrative of Omicron being a mild variant and are delaying seeing a doctor till the eighth or ninth day. Such delays should be avoided at all costs,” he said, adding that those who are sick are not the ones dying within 48 hours, but after 1-2 weeks of treatment. Mumbai continues to see thousands of cases. So, the city’s death graph could continue to rise for days. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, another member of the taskforce, said ICUs are seeing more admissions, although there is no rush or crisis that was seen during the Delta wave. “The Delta variant is still in circulation and hence vulnerable people shouldn't delay seeking medical help,” he said.  A change in HRCT scan score and persistent high fever are some of the red flags showing the disease could be progressing. Civic numbers updated on Saturday showed that 15% of the active cases are symptomatic and 1% are critical. After Sunday's admissions, 15% of Mumbai's Covid beds were occupied. Almost a third of the city's ICU beds are occupied. Officials said that cases in cities like Nashik and Nagpur are on the rise. Nashik reported over 3,000 cases, a rise from 1,500 early last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/citys-new-covid-cases-under-10k-after-13-days/articleshow/88939503.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Haj in time of Covid focuses on health and hygiene for pilgrims||MUMBAI: Last week, the spacious conference hall on the ground floor of the massive Haj House in south Mumbai saw a fascinating function. While unveiling the Haj trainers’ training programme, Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi underlined the importance of “health, hygiene and precaution” in the Haj 2022 being planned under the shadow of the pandemic. “Don’t lower your guard. Mask up and follow the latest guidelines of Indian and Saudi authorities,” said Naqvi to over 500 trainers spread across the country, of which only 175 were physically present in the hall while the rest joined online. Extraordinary problems require extraordinary solutions. Though Saudi Arabia has asked its officials to get ready for Haj 2022—no foreign pilgrims were allowed to perform this annual pilgrimage in 2020 and 2021—Haj Committee of India, the nodal agency for arranging Hai of 2 lakh Indian pilgrims, is giving utmost priority to precaution, health and hygiene. “Health and security are our top priorities. The orientation programme for trainers was aimed at giving the message that we must prepare our pilgrims mentally and physically to perform rituals, some of which involved many kilometres of walking,” said Haj Committee of India CEO Mohammed Yaqoob Sheikha. “So far, 57,340 Haj applicants have registered. Of this, 1,148 are women pilgrims who will travel without mahram or male guardians.” Since most of the pilgrims will travel internationally for the first time — many may not have boarded an plane earlier— the task of trainers becomes very crucial. “Many pilgrims come from rural areas and do not know how to use a commode. We tell them about its use. We also tell them that they should keep their passports, visas and the bracelets always with them. These will help them in finding the Indian camp, especially in the vast tent valley of Mina near Mecca,” said Haj social worker for two decades Shams Chaudhary who has been training the pilgrims for the last four years. Private tour operators too will soon start training of the pilgrims but they await signing of the bilateral agreements between India and Saudi Arabia. “Both the governments should expedite signing bilateral agreements and allocating the quota. Training our Hajis is not very difficult. We will start once we get our quotas,” said Yusuf Ahmed Khereda of Al Khalid Tours and Travels. Khereda has been in this field for over three decades. Nagpur-based trainer Haji Mohammed Kalam said that all pilgrims are being told to remain alert and avoid going to extremely crowded places during the performance of rituals. “We are telling pilgrims to always look for Indian flags at the camps if they lose their way,” said Kalam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/haj-in-time-of-covid-focuses-on-health-hygiene-for-pilgrims/articleshow/88939504.cms||Mohammed Wajihudin
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Educational institutes ordered to cut ties with edtech companies||MUMBAI: Cracking down on educational institutes that join hands with edtech companies to offer online or conventional programmes, the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education have warned them of derecognition. In a red-letter notice issued on Sunday, both the bodies asked higher education institutes (HEIs) to annul agreements with edtech companies. Officials said the higher education secretary had flagged advertisements offering educational degrees through edtech firms. “Some edtech companies are giving advertisements in newspapers/social media/TV, etc, that they are offering degree and diploma programmes in ODL/online modes in association with some universities/institutions. Such a franchise arrangement is not permissible and action will be taken against defaulting edtech companies as well as HEIs under applicable laws/ rules,” said the notice. A senior official explained that universities were outsourcing content creation to edtech players, some were asking faculty from such companies to teach and certain edtech companies are also awarding degrees. "Some universities and institutes are running programmes through edtech companies. Using a particular platform or a learning management system is different but many higher education institutes in India are outsourcing the running of their online courses to edtech firms. That kind of outsourcing or franchising is definitely not permitted," said an officer from AICTE. "We don't want edtech players advertising that they are offering MBA or BMS. They do not have the permission to do so. How do we keep a check on the quality?" asked a UGC officer. The January 16 notice also cautioned students against such arrangements and said they must check the recognition/entitlement status of a programme before enrolling in it. This is not the first time that stern advisories against the edtech space have been issued. Three weeks ago, India's education ministry issued an advisory about edtech platforms, saying some firms were targeting families by getting the electronic fund transfer (EFT) mandate signed or activating the auto-debit feature. The ministry advised parents to deactivate the automatic debit option for payment of subscription fee in 'freemium' models. Experts feel the notice is a death knell for edtech firms. "Most edtech firms derive their authenticity and recognition because of their partnerships with recognised and well-known universities. With that kind of arrangement being questioned, will students still sign up at dotcom universities?" asked a retired UGC chairman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/edu-institutes-ordered-to-cut-ties-with-edtech-cos/articleshow/88939452.cms||Hemali Chhapia Shah

Police on Saturday arrested deceased Shruti Mahadik’s distant relative Sachin Mahadik and his father Kishore in the alleged abetment to suicide case. Police said that in the suicide note, Shruti had mentioned harassment by these two relatives over some domestic issues. On Friday the Nehru Nagar police had recovered the body of Shruti Mahadik and her son Rajveer from a creek behind their house at Alta Vista Tower in Nehru Nagar area. The Nehru Nagar police had initially registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and but the case was later transferred to Chunnabhatti police which registered an abetment to suicide case and arrested the two. “The family had some domestic issues. We have just taken the duo’s custody, and their interrogation is underway,’’ said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-kin-held-for-abetment-in-mother-son-suicide-case/articleshow/88939505.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Severe immune effect seen in Delta absent in Omciron: City hosp data||Mumbai: Cytokine storm, a severe immune reaction that was seen in many Delta patients after seven to eight days, was not reported in a single case of Omicron treated at SevenHills Hospital, Andheri. The civic-run hospital has treated more than 125 confirmed cases of the new variant, the highest in the city.  Doctors at the hospital said not a single patient needed oxygen or any non-invasive ventilator support. Dr Rajas Walinjkar, consultant and unit in-charge at SevenHills DCH, who has handled Omicron cases with his team, said that no clinically significant rise in inflammatory markers like CRP was seen in a single case. “We didn’t see a single case of cytokine storm. Such patients tend to become severe and go on to need oxygen and other intensive treatments as we experienced during the Delta wave,” he said. Globally, there has been evidence that Omicron largely affects the upper respiratory tract and doesn’t attack the lungs outrightly. SevenHills’ patients too largely saw clear lungs in Omicron patients, the doctor said, adding that the highest HRCT scan score they have seen was 5 or 6 out of 25. “It was also mainly found in those who either delayed coming to us by a few days or had some underlying co-morbid conditions,” Dr Walinjkar said, adding that in most the lung lesions resolved shortly and without heavy intervention. Can clinicians tell if a patient has Delta or Omicron variant by looking at symptoms? “No, it’s unlikely. The disease usually starts with sore throat or fever, then progresses to body ache. The fever spikes usually manifest for 2-3 days before it starts to subside,” he said. However, early symptoms resolution is probably one of the indicators that the person was probably affected by Omicron. Of 125 confirmed cases in hospital, 119 were discharged and six transferred to private hospitals. He said cases are no more segregated as Omicron or Delta and treated symptomatically. “The biggest red flag for treatment escalation has to be persistent high-grade fever that doesn’t subside after 3-4 days and needs to be evaluated,” he said. However, most of these patients were either fully or partially vaccinated. Data shows 74% were vaccinated with both doses, including eight patients who’d taken booster shots, 13% were partially vaccinated and nearly 12% unvaccinated. Vaccination status of six patients was unknown. The doctor said since none of their conditions was severe, it wasn’t possible to compare behaviour of disease in the vaccinated and unvaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/severe-immune-effect-seen-in-delta-absent-in-omciron-city-hosp-data/articleshow/88939506.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Banks’ e-biz ambitions set to face talent crunch||Mumbai: Banks are set to face a major challenge in finding talent to meet their digital ambitions. While banks have the resources to invest in technology and are putting more money in digital than branches, they are finding it difficult to hire the right people.According to Sonali Kulkarni, Accenture’s lead for financial services in India, banks have emerged stronger with better liquidity and bad loans under control. They have also learnt to deal with uncertainty and operate with staff working from home. But they now face change at an unprecedented velocity — whether it is technology, customer behaviour and expectation or fintechs unbundling their value chain. “The demand in the market today is for the right talent, whether it’s for business, technology or some of the niche skills around AI or analytics. How do banks attract the best talent given that there are more than enough fintechs competing for them and banks are not seen as a home for these skills?” While some banks have chosen to outsource, they would still need some technical skills to understand which way these technologies are going. “A lot of banks have recently made statements around wanting to be a technology company in the business of financial services. Given that focus and ambition, it can’t be just left to consultants,” said Kulkarni.Besides hiring talent in technology, banks will need to reskill existing employees to enable them to have the right conversations with customers, either around selling or resolving some of the more complex queries. The interim alternative for banks is to enter into collaborations with fintechs and leverage their capabilities. Moving to cloud-based architecture will also address some issues around scalability or infrastructure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/banks-e-biz-ambitions-set-to-face-talent-crunch/articleshow/88939507.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Mumbai||78% bankers see frauds rising in 2 years: Survey||Mumbai: Around 78% of bankers expect frauds to increase over the next two years because of the current business disruption due to the pandemic. The fear of frauds is triggered by the reduction in human contact due to large-scale remote working and an increase in customers using non-banking channels for transactions.According to the Indian Banking Fraud Survey released by Deloitte, the most common concern for bankers is loan fraud (24%) followed by frauds in internet & mobile banking (14%). Respondents cited limited monitoring of assets after disbursement (38%), the economic slowdown (24%) and insufficient due diligence prior to disbursement (21%) as the top three factors leading to higher problem loans. These suggest that banks may need to overhaul their due diligence and monitoring frameworks.“The number of fraud incidents encountered by banks over the last two years appears to have increased, compared with the findings of our previous survey. Around 53% of respondents indicated that they have faced more than 100 fraud incidents in retail banking (over the last two years) — a 29% increase since the previous edition,” the report said.According to the report, bankers said they have managed to detect fraud largely during routine audit and reconciliation followed by proactive measures through internal automated data analysis or transaction monitoring software.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/78-bankers-see-frauds-rising-in-2-years-survey/articleshow/88939508.cms||---

Of the restructured accounts, 40% are secured with good collateral. Approximately, two-thirds are salaried customers and about 40% have a Cibil score of above 700,” said Vaidyanathan.According to published numbers, the bank has restructured Rs 14,564 crore of personal loans, Rs 1,566 crore of business loans and Rs 1,889 crore of loans to small businesses under the RBI Resolution Framework - 2, dated May 5, 2021. “Covid restructuring has been an enabler for our customers to tide over the uncertainty in the last few quarters. The initial indicators suggest that most of these customers are now in a position to resume their payment with minimal impact on the overall quality of advances,” he added. Vaidyanathan said the impact of restructuring on the bank’s gross non-performing asset (NPA) numbers would be 10-20bps in any given quarter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/most-recast-loans-on-track-hdfc-bk/articleshow/88939510.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fintechs must prepare for more compliance: NPCI||Mumbai: The chief of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has said that fintechs would need to keep aside money and management bandwidth for regulatory compliance and these requirements will keep coming up as they become part of the mainstream.“Please reserve reasonable money that you are raising for compliance aspect. The regulator always takes a long-term view on policy. When you are already into such a mainstream, the compliance requirements will be there,” said Dilip Asbe, MD & CEO of NPCI, in a fireside chat with Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, at an Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) event.Incidentally, the RBI last week had written to some fintechs, asking them to give details of the algorithms that they use in their business. The query comes days after the central bank set up an independent fintech department. This was created by carving out the earlier fintech unit from the department of payments & settlements.Asbe said that the NPCI was working towards the goal of a billion transactions a day and this required a high level of customer education and awareness and a robust law enforcement agency. In addition to this, it needed what he described as the three zeros — zero-touch, zero time, and zero cost to the consumer. “From a customer standpoint, the transaction should be instant and free. If these three come together, a billion a day is possible and should be achieved in three to five years,” said Asbe.Responding to a query from Rau on what can be done so that fintechs, which are driving digital transactions in the country, get a voice in policymaking, Asbe said that it is only the banks that are bearing the high cost of compliance. “Fintechs will start appreciating the life of a banker with compliance requirements,” he said. Explaining the need for compliance, he said that innovation has to come with responsibilities as, without trust in the system, customers will move back to cash. “The efforts by the regulator in terms of tokenisation and data storage are necessary,” said Asbe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fintechs-must-prepare-for-more-compliance-npci/articleshow/88939511.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra saw 13% rise in drowning deaths in lockdown year: NCRB||MUMBAI: Despite restricted access to beaches during the pandemic-induced lockdown year of 2020, deaths by drowning shot up by 13% in Maharashtra as compared to 2019. Maharashtra had the second highest number of drowning-related fatalities in the country (5,136) after Madhya Pradesh (5,779), showed data with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020. At least 88% of all drowning-related fatalities in Maharashtra have been attributed to fall in water bodies. “We have appointed trained lifeguards with gear on six Mumbai’s beaches, which has considerably reduced the number of drownings at these locations,” said Hemant Parab, chief fire officer, Mumbai Fire Brigade. Lifeguards at Juhu, Gorai, Aksa, Girgaum, Dadar and Versova beaches were involved in 14 rescue operations in the lockdown year. But rocky seafronts, such as Bandra Bandstand, where lifeguards can’t be deployed remain a challenge. In June 2020, two youngsters, Mohsin Shah and Ashraf Chaudhary, drowned at Malad’s Marve beach, which does not have lifeguards. The duo had gone to the beach with a group of friends. “At times, mishaps occur because of flouting of guidelines. There have been instances when visitors have jumped over barricades to access a beach or sneaked in through access points,” said corporator Renu Hansraj, whose civic ward includes Juhu beach. Drowning victims at beaches are typically students or young adults, in the 13-29 age group, said officials. “Training vendors who operate around a waterfront on basic life-saving techniques could work at spots where there are no lifeguards. In 2012, we had a training session for vendors at Tungareshwar who were taught how to rescue a person stranded in the water and clear his airway. CPR need not be performed in all situations,” said Dr Rita Savla, who runs a non-profit on disaster awareness. As many as 16 lives were lost in separate instances of boat capsizing in the state, NCRB data showed. Three of these were warehouse employees who had hired a boat to travel unnoticed from Madh to Versova in April 2020, after their employer failed to offer them a place to stay overnight. “Boat capsizing is typically the result of negligence. The worthiness of the vessel goes unchecked. Boat owners may take in more passengers without weighing the risk of the vessel tipping over,” said former fire chief P D Karguppikar. In Mumbai, overflowing nullahs and quarries in monsoon often become death traps for residents of nearby slum colonies. Some of the drowning deaths in the state are also instances of suicide.

Seven people have been arrested for attempt to murder and rioting. The police said they will get the meat tested to verify if it is beef, as claimed by the activists. Animal welfare officer Ashish Kamlakar Barik sustained serious head injury after being hit with rods while another activist, Pratik Nanavare, was hit with sticks on the back. Two police personnel were pushed around. A bleeding Barik had to be taken to hospital. Nanavare told TOI: “We had a tip-off that a truck (MH03-CV7665) was to head towards Kasaiwada with beef around 6am on Sunday. We called up the police for help to raid the truck and seize the beef. Two unarmed police officials accompanied us.” He said that as soon as the vehicle reached Kasaiwada, an angry crowd of over 40 men attacked them with sticks and rods. “Barik was especially targeted... He started bleeding from the head. I was hit on the back. I am now filing my statement with the police,” said Nanavare. Of seven who have been arrested two — Aslam Abdul Mulla Qureshi and Salim Qureshi — are the key accused who smuggled the meat. The police have seized 5-7 tonnes of the suspected meat. Samples will be sent to a laboratory for testing to verify if it is beef or something else, said senior inspector Anil Desai of Nehru Nagar police station where a case of attempt to murder has been filed against the seven at Another animal activist, Bhavin Gathani of Karuna Parivar Trust, said the attack is a “very serious” issue. “The two activists of Dhyan Foundation were assaulted in front of the accompanying police personnel who were in their police vehicle,” he said that a large police force should be deployed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/beef-seized-mob-attacks-2-activists-in-police-presence/articleshow/88939513.cms||Vijay Singh

His lawyer, Ashley Cusher, said she is 25, has never indulged in any immoral activities and on suspicion was falsely implicated. She wishes to go home, he said, and Justice Revati Mohite Dere observed that she is competent and capable of looking after herself.Shehzad Naqvi, counsel for the rescue shelter, said it has no objection to her release to her father.The magistrate had sent her to the shelter to be looked after as she was found to be unwell then, said the NGO.Prosecutor Veera Shinde submitted a report dated January 12 of the Rescue Foundation rehabilitation centre, before the HC at the hearing via video-conferencing. The report said the father could take his daughter home and should give all necessary medical treatment to her. The HC said that all three women had denied that they were lured into prostitution. Justice Mohite-Dere, citing an earlier judgment where HC had held that fundamental rights of adult victims to move to a place of their choice has to be considered and they cannot be subjected to detention contrary to their wish, quashed the magistrate’s order and directed her release forthwith.The HC was also informed that two other victims who had been similarly rescued have already been released.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-lets-actor-rescued-from-hotel-go-home-from-shelter/articleshow/88939514.cms||Swati Deshpande

The few numbers in the city leads to acute shortage of stamp papers across Mumbai, said the PIL adding that in 1999 Mumbai had more than 250 licensed stamp vendors, but the number drastically went down after many of them surrendered their licenses and stopped vending stamp papers, as they were either prosecuted or apprehended prosecution for selling counterfeit stamps in the fake stamp paper scam involving Abdul Karim Laadsab Telgi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-asks-state-for-response-to-pil-about-stamp-paper/articleshow/88939516.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Abandoned leopard cubs learn to live without mum||MUMBAI: A month after two leopard cubs were brought to the city, the siblings are in the pink of health and are living it up, as it were. Found abandoned by the mother in Nandurbar district, the two cubs are being looked after at Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Borivli. About two months old, they had arrived on December 3. They’ve been put up in a room where a few caretakers baby-sit them. All day, they romp about playfully, eat and sleep. The cubs – a male and a female – are hale and hearty, said G Mallikarjuna, conservator of forests and director of the national park. To keep them warm in this nippy weather, park officials have installed a heater in their room. Also, the floor has a soft carpet that is changed regularly since they mess it up. The cubs follow a daily schedule under the watchful eyes of their caretakers. In the mornings, they are taken to the fenced and netted courtyard of the house. They frolic around for an hour at least, said range forest officer Vijay Barabde. “The idea is to let them bask in the sun and to give them some exercise,” he said. To get them running about, one of their attendants wags a cloth to get their attention. “Anything that moves attracts them. They run to grab it, in keeping with their instinct,” said Barabde. When they came in last month, the cubs weighed a little less than a kilo. Now, they’ve put on. The male weighs 3.25kg, the female’s weight is 3kg, said Barabde. Inside their room, which has CCTV cameras installed, the cubs yank and grapple with a clutch of toys. “A ball and other playthings which they can’t chew or swallow,” he said. The babies have a good appetite. They lap up the blanched minced boneless chicken served to them in four small feeds a day. Initially, they were fed cat food imported from the US. “The special nutrition for felines works like mother’s milk…,” said Barabde. At bedtime, the siblings snuggle into each other’s arms and doze off in a tight embrace, like they would have with their mother. Are the two naughty? “Surprisingly, the male is well behaved,” said Barabde, adding that the female is a mischievous ball of fur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/abandoned-leopard-cubs-learn-to-live-without-mum/articleshow/88939517.cms||Alex Fernandes
---||Mumbai||Min alleges a nexus to shun global firms in tenders for zoo enclosures||Mumbai: Congress leader and cabinet minister Aslam Shaikh has alleged a nexus between BMC officials and tainted contractors to keep international firms out of the new animal enclosure project at Byculla zoo. In a letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal, Shaikh, the guardian minister for Mumbai, said, “I am now pointing out how international companies were kept out, and the tenders were rigged for Ms Highway Construction Company and Ms Skyway Infraprojects. The department has smartly added 10 marks in technical evaluation in the last column asking experience in the construction of exhibits for exotic/Indian species. Only for this “experience in the construction of exhibits for exotic/Indian species, the bidder cannot claim the experience through an MoU, thereby, ensuring maximum marks will be secured by the two companies – Highway and Skyway – and if at all any other company attempted to place a bid, their bid would have been not considered based on the low marking system.”Following Shaikh’s December 2021 letter, the BMC sought an explanation from Byculla zoo officials and its building maintenance (BM) department after bids for construction of the new set of animal enclosures at Byculla zoo shot up by a massive Rs 106 crore above the BMC’s estimates and only two companies submitted bids.The BMC had last year floated two tenders; one for construction of new animal enclosures for black jaguar, cheetah, white lion, wallaby, chimpanzee, ringtail lemur, mandrill monkey and lesser flamingo and the other enclosure for constructing exhibits for the hippo, animals from African Savanna, emu, and setting up a bird aviary. These new enclosures are to be constructed on the land received from Poddar and Mafatlal Mills adjacent to the Byculla zoo.While the tenders were estimated to cost Rs 91 crore and Rs 94 crore, the two companies bid Rs 146 crore and Rs 145 crore respectively, an escalation of around Rs 106 crore. “As I have previously pointed out, the fact that both the bids are Rs 106 crore above estimates, it only reveals the extent of this nexus between the companies and BMC officials. This nexus has just been exposed – healthy competition is restricted and only these two companies have been accommodated. I urge you to direct the officials to scrap the tenders with immediate effect and instruct the department to float a transparent and global tender allowing healthy competition,” Shaikh said in his letter, adding that he had not received a reply from the BMC to his previous letter. When approached for comment, Ashwini Bhide, Additional Municipal Commissioner, said the bid evaluation process was still in progress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/min-alleges-a-nexus-to-shun-global-firms-in-tenders-for-zoo-enclosures/articleshow/88939519.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Iyer, as is evident now, wants to be named as the captain of whichever franchise he plays for. The middle-order batsman quit the Delhi Capitals after they appointed Rishabh Pant as their skipper. Post that, he didn’t join Lucknow or Ahmedabad as both franchises weren’t offering him the captaincy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rcb-eye-captain-iyer-kkr-punjab-may-bid-too/articleshow/88939522.cms||---

Rajashri and Vaijanath Biradar of Dr Biradar Sushruth Nursing Home in Bidar and an employee were sent to two years in jail while Dr Rajashekhar Patil of another hospital was given a prison term of six months. They will appeal the January 4 order of Bidar second civil and JMFC court judge Abdul Khadar, sources said. The case pertains to the death of Sampavathi Ghaleppa Auradkar, who was admitted to the nursing home for a hysterectomy on October 12, 2014. Rajashri and Vaijanath performed the surgery, but her condition worsened as the nursing home allegedly didn't have a ventilator that could have saved her. Sampavathi was shifted to Patil's hospital but it didn't have a ventilator either. Patil allegedly didn't inform her relatives about her death for hours, saying he was treating her. The doctor was accused of lying after an autopsy confirmed the time of death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-karnataka-doctors-get-up-to-2-years-in-prison-in-med-negligence-case/articleshow/88939525.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Secunderabad Club, one of the oldest in the country, ravaged by fire||HYDERABAD: A massive pre-dawn fire ravaged the iconic heritage structure of the 144-year-old Secunderabad Club, with fire fighters battling for more than three hours to bring the blaze under control. While law enforcing agencies began a detailed probe to ascertain the reasons behind the blaze, police and club officials said the billiards room, wooden staircase leading to the club's famous ballroom, offices of the club bearers, an 1878 bar and men's colonnade, were all reduced to ashes. Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) department special chief secretary Arvind Kumar asked the fire department to ascertain if appropriate fire protection measures were installed and whether a fire no-objection certificate (NOC) from authorities was taken and a safety audit put in place. The club authorities pegged the loss to an estimated Rs 25 crore. "The fire damaged some 50,000 square feet area. We suspect that a short circuit due to voltage fluctuation may have triggered the fire. A lot of memorabilia, furniture among other resources has been gutted in the accident, estimates of which are being made by the insurance company and the fire department," said R Raghuram Reddy, president of the club. Secunderabad Club had British officials as its president from 1878 till 1947. The first Indian to be elected president of the Club was General Syed Ahmad El-Edroos. He was the chief of Hyderabad Army at the time of Operation Polo in September 1948. The Hyderabad army led by him had surrendered to Indian forces leading to the merger of Hyderabad with the Indian Union. Interestingly, El-Edroos was succeeded in 1949 as the club president by Major General (later General) JN Choudhary, who led Operation Polo. MK Vellodi, the interim chief minister of Hyderabad state before the first general elections, also headed the club. Cricketer ML Jaisimha also served as the president of Secunderabad Club from 1985-87. Witnesses said the fire started at the bar and quickly spread to other areas before anyone could respond "I was near the main gate and immediately rushed to the reception area. We tried to douse the fire with internal resources. However, the fire started to spread rapidly. Soon, the fire control room was called in," said one guard, still shaking in disbelief pointing towards the smouldering embers and burnt wood and furniture strewn everywhere. A blue colts police team of the Karkhana area, who were on patrolling duty, also alerted the control room when they noticed the fire. Regional fire officer V Papaiah said they received a call at 3.15 am about the fire in the three-storied building. "As the building was built mostly with wood and the fire was rapidly spreading, the multi-purpose fire tender from the cantonment fire station, water cum foam tender, water bowsers and multi-purpose fire tenders from secretariat were rushed to the spot," Papaiah said. Fire department officials initially thought of drawing water from the swimming pools at the club, but three water tankers from the cantonment were sufficient. "The internal staircase of the building which was made of wood was completely destroyed in the fire and the fire-fighting was carried out from an external staircase. We had to access the first and second floor flames through the windows. After three hours, the fire was brought under control and extinguished at 8.40 am," Papaiah added. While Marredpally police said they are seeking forensic opinion to determine the possible causes, a Clues team collected samples from the site and sent them for analysis in the forensic lab. The fire department also asked the club management to produce the fire NOC and the fire audit report. "As per our records, they have not obtained NOC from us. They have not applied for fire audit with us also. As the height of the building is below 15 metres, they might have applied for NOC from the Cantonment board. We have to see what certificates they furnish," said a senior fire department official. The Secunderabad Cantonment Board, which has leased out the land to the Secunderabad Club, has sought a report from the managing committee as to what led to the accident and consequent damage. Police said miraculously, the kitchen area, supermarket, liquor storage in the same building were not damaged and the nearby petrol pump remained completely unaffected. "A few kitchen staff sleeping in the kitchen also managed to leave when they noticed the fire," Marredpally inspector M Mattaiah said. Intach Hyderabad convenor Anuradha Reddy said they will await an investigation report of fire and police wings. "Intach is ready to extend support to Secunderabad club for restoration," she said. Hours after the incident, the Secunderabad Club was cordoned off by the Hyderabad police and people stopped from entering the premises. As the news of the accident started spreading like wildfire, members of the club started trickling in to check the condition of the structure. Key members of the Secunderabad Club's managing committee were seen making rounds of the premises and huddled in meetings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/secbad-club-one-of-the-oldest-in-the-country-ravaged-by-fire/articleshow/88939527.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru cops put 40 rowdies under preventive detention last year||BENGALURU: City police broke fresh ground in 2021 to enforce the rule of law. For the first time, deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) were allowed to exercise their powers as executive magistrates under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrCP), following which about 40 rowdies were put under preventive detention. And 27 ‘notorious’ ones were booked under Goonda Act. “Curbing their (rowdies’) activities which span from land grabbing to drug peddling, to gambling to chain snatching has been the main focus of the city police from the past few years,” said Sandeep Patil, additional commissioner of police (West). Police have adopted a two-step approach to eradicate rowdy menace in the city: first, to detain/arrest the suspects, and second, to entangle them in court trials. Officials say they are also keeping a check on new, prospective recruitments. “We are keeping a close watch on them, their associates, and any persons with unstable income who come in contact with them as they are most likely to turn to such activities for a livelihood,” said Sanjeev Patil, DCP (Crime, West). South division of the city police saw the maximum of 617 cases in 2021 where bonds were taken from suspected rowdies that they will not indulge in illegal activities under Section 110 of CrPC, followed by West Bengaluru 565, and East Bengaluru 463. Central division saw the least number of cases at 136, with Whitefield (217) and Southeast (255 cases) ahead of it. “We are ensuring that there is no fear of rowdies among the vulnerable sections of the populace. We have also been inspecting their houses and business turfs because thugs hide weapons where they live and operate. The number of charges under the Arms Act also went up in 2021,” said DCP Harish Pandey (South). The recent report released by the city police about the crimes that were registered and detected between 2019 and 2021 corroborates the statement that the number of cases under the Arms Act shot up in 2021(218 cases). The case count in 2021 was nine times the previous year’s tally. Police sources said rowdyism is prevalent in five kinds of activities - extortion, gambling, drug peddling, prostitution, and land grabbing. “They are willing to do anything that earns them money. Infighting and gang wars start if another group gets involved in their areas and businesses,” Patil said. The value of drugs seized in various raids and checks in 2021 was over Rs 60 crore — the highest since 2019. Even the total number of cases, quantity of drugs seized, and people arrested under the scope of narcotic control was the highest in 2021, accounting for 4,555 cases, 3,706kg of illicit drugs, and 5,749 arrests. Officials said they have begun offering police protection to witnesses of court cases against rowdies and procuring non-bailable warrants from the judiciary in case the accused evaded trial.  “As police personnel, we need to admit that such crimes happen and then we go after them. If the report shows a spike in cases, it must be inferred that there is an increase in deterrence against rowdyism,” Pandey added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bluru-cops-put-40-rowdies-under-preventive-detention-last-year/articleshow/88939535.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Bengaluru||10,000 unaided schools in Karnataka won’t renew recognition this year, claims association||BENGALURU: The state government has relaxed for one year fire and building safety norms for school buildings, but private school associations are still unhappy. The department of public instruction ordered school administrations to submit an affidavit that they will provide building and fire safety documents from departments by the next academic year for recognition/renewal. Calling the system corrupt and full of red tape, the Recognised Unaided Private Schools Association (RUPSA) said its member-schools will boycott the process this year. It said around 10,000 institutions will not take part. “The Karnataka Education Act-1983 does not specify any renewal process; it only speaks about registration and recognition of a school. The renewal process is just another means for the education department to extort money from schools,” alleged Lokesh T, president of RUPSA. “We need 59 documents from various departments for the renewal process. At every step, we have to pay a bribe. While other boards have a very simple process of renewal, why do we alone have such an elaborate procedure where we have to visit every other government department?” he asked. “While the government relaxed the rule for this year, we have been asked to give an affidavit that we will comply and submit the certificate in a year. Officials will deliberately ask only for these documents as they know it is not possible to get them,” said a school management official. “At the BEO office, we pay the case worker, the superintendent and the BEO. At DDPIs, we do the same. Then there is an RTE officer. The renewal application fee itself is Rs 20,000. Over and above that, we pay Rs 25,000-75,000 at each office. The figures run into lakhs of rupees in places like Bengaluru,” claimed a school owner from Davanagere. Another school owner said there are inspections from other departments also. “For instance, we have police department inspections of CCTV cameras; district health officers check the premises for sanitation and other things. We have to get certificates from BBMP or the local administration, revenue, fire and safety, and PWD, among other departments. At every point, we end up paying bribes,” rued the owner. Schools, whose incomes have been affected ever since they were asked to shut down during the pandemic, said they cannot afford to be fleeced any more. D Sashi Kumar, secretary of Association of Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka which also raised issues with the renewal processes, referred to the building-safety norms for schools. “According to them, schools that were in existence before 2018 also have to comply with the new rules. In 99% of the schools, the existing buildings cannot comply with the new rules, even if they give us one year’s time. Our argument is to make the demands logical and possible,” he said. The issue has been a bone of contention since 2018 and raised several times by schools in the past, including at the recent Belagavi legislature session. A 17-member committee, headed by MLC SV Sankanur and comprising eight MLCs, had submitted a report to the primary and secondary education minister recommending changes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/10k-unaided-schools-wont-renew-recognition-this-year-claims-assn/articleshow/88939536.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

He said of the 54,000 startups in the country, 13,000 of them are in Karnataka. He said under various state schemes, 482 startups have been provided Rs 120 crore as seed funding. “We are also planning to introduce chapters on entrepreneurship in school syllabi in the coming academic year,” he said.

The Centre announced awards for startups, and Karnataka bagged 30% of those awards (14 of 46). The Centre had received 2,177 applications from startups across 15 sectors. Of these 459 had come from Karnataka, the highest across all states. Three out of the 14 startup award winners were also winners of the state’s flagship startup programme Elevate100. These were Tinkerbell, Steradian and Tagbox.Recently, the state amended the Karnataka Public Procurement Transparency (KTPP) Rules, the state rules governing public procurement, to make it easier for startups to participate in state government purchase tenders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-has-a-quarter-of-all-of-indias-startups/articleshow/88939538.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||IT professional unearths 4 Jain inscriptions in Karnataka||BENGALURU: An IT professional working with Wipro in Bengaluru discovered four unpublished Kannada inscriptions at an abandoned Jain temple in Kudrigi village of Honnavar taluk, Uttara Kannada district. Nithin HP, a history enthusiast, makes regular field trips in search of Jain heritage sites in the state. He unearthed the latest in November 2021 and it took him over a month to get the inscriptions deciphered and establish them as previously unpublished. The findings, from 13th century, include three ‘Nishadi’ memorials and a ‘pedestal’ inscription. A Nishadi inscription is installed in memory of devoted Jains who give up their lives following the Sallekhana practice, which involves not eating food and devoting oneself fully to worship. The pedestal inscription, as the name suggests, is found on the pedestal of an idol. Nithin has so far discovered 14 inscriptions in Mysuru, Hassan, Uttara Kannada and Chikkamagaluru. “I take year-end holidays for two weeks and most of these discoveries were made hen. I also plan holidays in a year where I get a 3/4-day weekend. This one was my 2021 year-end discovery, though I have been visiting the place for over two years now,” he said. The pedestal inscription was discovered on a mutilated Adinatha Tirthankar idol about 2.5ft high. The inscription mentions the basadi (Jain temple), known as Narana Jina Chaityalaya, was built by the younger sister of a disciple of Samayacharana Guru of Sri Mulasangha Deshiya Gana. Though it is undated, other inscriptions from the 13th century mention Samayacharana and Narana, indicating a similar age for this inscription. The three Nishadis were also found on the premises of the basadi. One of them has an eight-line inscription mentioning ‘Samayacharana Muni’s disciple’ donating rice to the basadi. The second Nishadi has a five-line inscription that is mostly worn out, but the words ‘Samayacharana Muni’s disciple’ can be deciphered. The entire text on the third Nishadi is illegible. All the three Nishadis have carvings depicting a person performing Sallekhana in various stages of the vow. “The date can’t be ascertained, but from the name Samayacharana Muni, who lived in the 13th century, we can safely conclude they are from that period,” said Nithin. Research scholar and historian Ravikumar K Navalagunda, who helped Nithin decipher the inscriptions, said there are more awaiting discovery in the region. “Coastal Karnataka was a stronghold of several Jain dynasties. ‘Pepper Queen’ Chennabhairadevi ruled from Gerusoppa, which is a few kilometres away. Many of the ancient temples and basadis have been lost to forest growth over the centuries. This is a significant addition to the Jain inscriptions of Karnataka, but I believe there is more to be found,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/it-professional-unearths-4-jain-inscriptions/articleshow/88939540.cms||Shyam Prasad S

But the project is still not ready as the flyover design is being tweaked to avoid land acquisition-related litigation. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is changing the design as private land owners have refused to part with their land for the down ramp and taken legal recourse. Instead of wasting time on a battle in court, the civic agency has chosen to shorten the length of the ramp. It will save around Rs 40 crore payable to the property owners, officials said. “We offered TDR for land acquisition, but the owners refused it. However, the matter is in court and we are to file an affidavit. But we are executing the work as decided earlier,” said Lokesh, BBMP chief engineer (projects). As per the existing design, BBMP needs to acquire 579.5sqm of land towards Seshadripuram railway underpass to complete the project. The flyover was mooted to decongest the central part by connecting Race Course Road with Harekrishna Road and towards Seshadripuram railway underbridge. With the design change, the down ramp will start much earlier than what was planned as the length will reduce by 30m, Lokesh said. Ever since construction started on the four-lane elevated stretch, there have been multiple design changes. In fact, BBMP had initially planned to construct a 326m flyover. It was later extended to 492.8m. The flyover was to be supported by 16 pillars, but work got stuck when it came to one pillar as the authorities realised a BWSSB water pipeline had to be shifted. “The project, which was supposed to be completed in under a year, has been delayed for over four years,” an official admitted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/design-changes-delay-shivananda-circle-flyover-by-over-four-years/articleshow/88939541.cms||---

Police suspect Mangala, 35, and Gowtami N, a class 1 student of a private school, died of suffocation caused by carbon monoxide leakage from the geyser. The incident came to light at 4pm, after Mangala’s husband Narasimhamurthy requested his landlord to check what had happened to his wife as she was not answering his calls since afternoon. Narasimhamurthy works with a fabrication firm and lived in a leased house at Ganapatinagar with his wife and daughter. He had left home in the morning for work and called his wife around 1pm. She did not pick his call and later, he tried to contact her by calling multiple times. That’s when he suspected something was amiss and alerted his landlord. The landlord found the door was locked from inside and managed to open it through a window. He found the washroom was closed and knocked repeatedly. He informed Narasimhamurthy and police about it. Soladevanahalli police rushed to the spot and broke open the door. Both Mangala and Gowthami were found dead inside. “We suspect the incident took place at 11am when the duo went for a bath. They fell unconscious and breathed their last. They had closed the windows while taking bath. We suspect the duo suffocated to death after inhaling carbon monoxide that leaked from the substandard gas geyser in the bathroom,” an officer said. Police have taken up a case of unnatural death. “We are waiting for the autopsy report to know the exact reason,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/woman-7-yr-old-daughter-die-on-inhaling-toxic-gas-from-geyser/articleshow/88939546.cms||---

Most of the city’s eligible population due for the second dose are in these four zones, according to officials. In terms of numbers, that’s eight lakh people. While only 49% have taken their second dose in Thiruvottiyur, it’s 47% in Tondiarpet, 56% in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and 51% in Teynampet. There is marginal hesitancy in some of the densely populated localities in these regions, officials added. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, however, said many might have taken their doses in places they work, which is why a few zones show over 100% coverage. “There is, however, hesitancy in some areas, especially the coastal ones,” he said. He said the corporation is trying to overcome it by educating the public through awareness programmes. “We have also been visiting house and persuading residents to take the vaccine,” he said. While the eligible population in Manali (Zone 2) is only 81,182, a total of 1,04,912 have taken their second dose in the zone. The reason, officials said, is that it’s an industrial area where workers from across the city and even other states might have taken their doses. Similarly, Madhavaram, another industrial locality, also showed 100% coverage. Dr MS Hemalatha, additional director, city medical office of the corporation, said the staff have been instructed to conduct camps in places where there is less coverage and higher hesitancy. “There has been some hesitancy in the slum areas, but it has largely been resolved. We have been organising camps in all places where coverage is less, and encouraging people to take the jab,” she said. Meanwhile, the city has vaccinated 97% of its population with the first dose. A total of 414 people aged above 60 have also received their booster shot at their houses. The CoWin portal of the Government of India shows that 19,208 people have taken their booster shot, which is about 25% of those eligible in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/four-zones-lag-in-2nd-dose-cover/articleshow/88939552.cms||Omjasvin M D

In the second year of the pandemic, the commission received 30,865 complaints of which 72.5% (22,379) fall in three categories - to secure their right to live with dignity (36%); protection from domestic violence (21.6%); and matters of harassment of married women including for dowry (15%). Statewise break-up shows that 51.3% of all the complaints across 24 categories are from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Delhi (10.8%) and Maharashtra (4.9%). A comparison with previous year’s data shows that the number of total complaints rose over 30% from 23,722 received in 2020 to 30,865. In 2020, nearly 70% of the total complaints were from the three categories for which the maximum complaints have been received this year. On the rise in the number of complaints, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said, “The pandemic has been a challenge for everyone across the globe, especially women. Last year the NCW launched a 24/7 helpline (7827170170) for women affected by violence...We have more and more women coming forward and getting help from NCW. We receive around 400 calls daily on the helpline including those for information about NCW and get around 10 SOS calls a week seeking emergency help,” she added. As per the data on the NCW portal, in 2021, the complaints pertaining to securing the right to live with dignity shot up 44% to 11,084 compared to 7,715 in the previous year. The "right to live with dignity" category includes complaints that involve harassment other than domestic violence. The complaints category was defined this way in 2019 by NCW as more and more women had started approaching the commission alleging harassment at the hands of parents, husband and the in-laws trying to curtail their freedom to take decisions, stopping them from working, and situations that infringed their privacy. The next big reasons for women to reach out to the commission in 2021 like in 2020 remained protection from domestic violence with 6,682 complaints received in this category up 26 per cent. As many as 4,613 complaints were made pertaining to harassment of married women including matters related to dowry in comparison to the 3,788 such complaints in 2020. There were 341 complaints related to dowry death as against 330 in the previous year. In 2021, nearly 6% (1,839) of the total complaints were of cases involving outraging the modesty of a women/ molestation which was up from 1,679 complaints in 2020. Compared to 376 complaints related to sexual harassment in 2020, last year NCW received 624 complaints in this category in 2021. Besides this the Commission received 250 complaints related to sexual harassment at workplace and 145 related to sexual assault in 2021. Reflecting the challenges emerging from the virtual space, the number of complaints related to cybercrime too shot up significantly at 863 compared to 704 complaints in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/domestic-violence-plaints-to-ncw-rose-26-last-year/articleshow/88939556.cms||Ambika Pandit

Chennai topped the list in Covid norms violations, registering 43,417 cases and collecting a sum of 86 lakh. The north zone of the state booked 40,148 people and collected 83 lakh in fine. At 1,552 locations across the state, 1,910 people were booked for not following social distancing norms. On Sunday, the Chennai police held vehicle checks at various places. Those who had copies of the flight and train tickets were let off after verification, so were those with appointments with doctors. “Some stepped out for reasons like visiting relatives, despite knowing that it was a lockdown,” said a police officer. On Saturday night, the city police booked 5,469 people for norms violations and collected a fine of 10.93 lakh. Police also seized 307 vehicles. The city police had set up 312 check points in its jurisdiction to enforce the night lockdown and deployed 10,000 police personnel. The Tamil Nadu government last week, extended the existing Covid-19 curbs till January 31 in view of rising cases. The night curfew, which was imposed from January 6, will also continue till the end of the month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/over-1-6-lakh-people-booked-for-not-wearing-masks/articleshow/88939558.cms||---

This is the third lion to have died at the zoo in the last seven months. While the first two had died of coronavirus last year, zoo authorities claimed that Saturday’s death of Vishnu, a five-year-old male, was due to an infection in the food pipe. The carcass has been sent to the government veterinary college hospital in Vepery for autopsy. Veterinarians say it could be shock caused by oesophageal rupture and pulmonary The zoo has been temporarily shut for the public till January 31 after 80 employees including zookeepers tested positive for Covid-19, an official release from AAZP director V Karunapriya said. Samples have been collected from other animals and and they will be sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for screening, she said.  During the second wave, as many as 17 lions fell sick and two died of the disease. P Ganesan, a Chennai-based research veterinarian, said that in between both the waves of Covid-19, a few ostriches died at the zoo due to an unknown disease. Instead of pushing the reasons for deaths under the carpet, the zoo should be more transparent in explaining what had happened to the animals. “We don't know whether they had collected samples from the deceased lion and sent them for genome sequencing before it fell sick. Only when they start sharing such information, we can get to know if the death was due to coronavirus or a pathogenic problem," he said. The state government had earlier constituted a state-level task force to provide support to authorities on prevention and mitigation of Covid-19 infection in wild and captive animals in the tiger reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests. This six-member team headed by state environment secretary Supriya Sahu was given the task of keeping a close watch on disease surveillance. Some officials from the Tamil N adu forest department said that this committee will soon be publishing reports about the efforts taken to monitor the disease spread and vaccination etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/five-year-old-lion-dies-at-vandalur-zoo/articleshow/88939559.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Absence of video conferencing in lower courts delays hearing||Chennai: Lack of video conferencing facilities in the sub ordinate and magistrate courts has made life difficult for litigants and lawyers. Though the circular issued regarding physical hearing of cases notes that urgent cases will be taken on file through video conferencing, it is not the case, say advocates practicing in these courts. This eventually results in backlog of cases. The magistrate courts are only taking in bail applications and other cases are postponed to future dates, say advocates. With Covid cases surging again, the move to restrict litigants and advocates in courts is inevitable, but advocates feel that arrangements could have been made earlier to arrange video conferencing facilities in some of the trial courts, where hundreds of cases are heard everyday. For now, such facilities are in the court of Principal District Judge, where only important cases are heard and the case load is lesser compared to the trial judges hearing civil, criminal cases, according to advocates. V S Suresh, an advocate said that there is a direction to finish accident claims tribunal cases within one year of filing, but because of these delays, hearing will not be completed in time and the victims getting compensation too will be delayed. “There are several trial lawyers who are also not earning regularly because they are not handling cases. In sub ordinate courts, for now, the importance is given only to those cases where both sides are ready and high court direction cases,” advocate Suresh said. There are at least 50 magistrate courts in the city and considering that we are already in the third year of pandemic, arrangements could have been made for video conferencing in some of the lower courts too, wherever such infrastructure is available, according to advocates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/absence-of-video-conferencing-in-lower-courts-delays-hearing/articleshow/88939561.cms||---

The student was released on bail on Sunday evening. The transfer follows an internal probe conducted by joint commissioner (west) Rajeshwari, who found that the cops were at fault too. Constables Uthirakumar and Boominathan from Kodungaiyur police station have been shifted to the modern control room. The victim Abdul Rehman, 21, was arrested on charges of slapping a constable who questioned him for riding a bike without a mask at M R Nagar on Friday. When Uthirakumar, a constable, advised the biker to wear a mask, Abdul told him that cops could not control anti-social activities but ensure they penalise people for masks. An argument ensued, where the biker allegedly slapped the constable. The police team took him to the station where he was allegedly beaten up by cops. He was arrested on charge of preventing police from discharging their duty. "They have all rights to book a case, but cannot harass him in custody,” said Shankar, the biker’s friend.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/two-cops-transferred-for-assaulting-maskless-biker/articleshow/88939562.cms||---
---||Chennai||No vapour recovery systems at petrol bunks in Chennai||CHENNAI: Most petrol bunks in the city don't have vapour recovery systems (VRS), which can arrest the release of harmful organic compounds, according to a report submitted before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by oil companies. Every time a vehicle tank is refilled at a fuel station, petrol vapour tends to dissipate into the atmosphere. This vapour contains cancer-causing substances like benzene, toluene and xylene. The Union petroleum ministry in 2016 had directed all public and private oil companies to install VRS at fuel stations to prevent petrol vapours from escaping the bunks. But there was poor compliance of this fiat. In 2020, Chennai had around 250 petrol bunks. But only 32 had VRS installed in them. Subsequently, advocate VBR Menon filed a case with the NGT southern bench in Chennai, calling for immediate compliance to the VRS-rule as many fuel stations in the city were located near residential buildings, schools, and parks etc. Oil companies, however, were slow in implementing the rule. They said that there were only two qualified government-approved vendors to install VRS and the Supreme Court had directed them to complete the pending work in the national capital on a priority basis. Data presented before the NGT shows that some high turnover bunks in Chennai do not have the VRS facility. As a result, the tribunal directed CPCB to take appropriate action and impose an environmental compensation (penalty) against such petrol bunks. Besides this, the NGT Southern bench ordered all existing petrol bunks to obtain the state pollution control board's nod within six months. New outlets will also get the board's consent before commencing operations, read the order dated December 23.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/no-vapour-recovery-systems-at-petrol-bunks/articleshow/88939564.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Chorus for OBC quota at law varsities||CHENNAI: Most National Law Universities, including the one in Tamil Nadu, have once again failed to reserve seats for Other Backward Class (OBC) students. The chorus to implement the 27% OBC reservation rule has got louder with lawmakers from Tamil Nadu, student bodies and OBC welfare organisations recently writing to the Union government regarding this.  There are 23 NLUs in the country and only three have reserved 27 % seats for OBC candidates, under the all-India quota, as mandated by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Five NLUs in Bengaluru (16.2%), Delhi (22%), Hyderabad (18%), Raipur (12.9%) and Bhopal (14%) have earmarked a lesser percentage of seats. The law university in Trichy has ignored this rule completely while filling all-India quota seats. In 2019, Bhagwanlal Sahani, NCBC chairman, directed all NLUs to adhere to the reservation norms from the forthcoming academic year. The application process for Common Law Admission Test began two weeks ago. However, this year too, some of the NLUs have not reserved seats for OBC candidates. Around 1,300 undergraduate and 425 postgraduate students are expected to join NLUs this academic year. DMK MP Wilson wrote to the union law ministry stating that it is alarming to see NLU administrations proactive in providing reservations for NRIs, but not for OBCs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chorus-for-obc-quota-at-law-varsities/articleshow/88939565.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Chennai: No bail for bank manager in Port Trust fixed deposit scam||CHENNAI: A special court for CBI cases has denied bail to the manager of Indian Bank, Koyambedu branch who has been arrayed as an accused in the Chennai Port Trust fixed deposit scam, where fraudulent premature closure of fixed deposits led to a loss of 45 crore. The CBI had filed a chargesheet against 18 accused including the bank manager in November 2021 in connection with a financial fraud that caused a loss of 45 crore to Indian Bank. The accused were involved in foreclosing fixed deposits (FDs) in the name of Chennai Port Trust (CPT) and transferring or withdrawing the amount through various accounts. According to CBI, the accused canvassed the bank and CPT to open 45 FDs between March and May 2020. One of the accused, who presented himself as deputy director of the CPT, created a fake current account in the same branch. The manager, Sermathy Raja, in his bail petition stated that he was recently transferred to the Koyambedu branch and he was duped by the other accused involved in the case by producing forged documents. In response, the CBI’s counsel submitted to the court that the bank manager had facilitated the fraud by creating forged fixed deposit receipts and is one of the main conspirators who had actively participated in the offence. The central bureau of investigation argued that economic offences involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously and considered as a grave offence affecting the economy of the country as a whole, which the court agreed to while denying bail to the bank manager. After perusing the submissions, principal special judge for CBI cases, N Venkatavaradan observed that the court is not inclined to accept the petitioner’s contention that he was carried away by the claims of other accused pointed out the sequence of events submitted by the CBI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/no-bail-for-bank-manager-in-port-trust-fixed-deposit-scam/articleshow/88939567.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Encroachers deny family cremation rights||CHENNAI: A Pallavaram-based family on Sunday lodged a complaint with the Tambaram corporation, stating that it was denied cremation at its traditional corporation-run facility by people who had encroached upon the premises. The family later conducted the cremation at a different facility. In a complaint to Tambaram Corporation commissioner M Elangovan, the family members said that when they took the body of 64-year-old Kannammal to the corporation-run crematorium on Pallavaram’s Vathiyar Manickam Street, the encroachers blocked their entry and created a ruckus, citing the rituals would cause pollution. The encroachers behaved like thugs, the complaint stated. Even after Tambaram commissioner M Elangovan passed the information to police and a team of personnel arrived, the encroachers created a ruckus, said S Ramachandran, a relative of the deceased Kannamal. Police, in a bid to avoid law and order problems, requested the family members to visit another crematorium in Chromepet, he said. “We did not want a confrontation and moved to another common crematorium,” Ramachandran added. The family members and the crematorium staff said that the crematorium was being used by members a particular Hindu community group, numbering about 5,000 in the locality, for the last 30 years. However, during the recent lockdown, due to lack of any movement, many encroachers had come up on the premises, they said. S Jayanthi, who maintains the crematorium, alleged that the encroachers had wanted to usurp the land ever since lockdown began. “They have been wanting to take over the land. If they prevent cremation, the place will go unused and they can occupy it,” she said. Commissioner Elangovan said the crematorium would be restored, all obstructions removed and put to full use soon for the community members. “No one will be denied their rights,” he added. Tambaram police commissioner M Ravi said he had escalated the issue to the collectorate. “We will take up the issue with all the parties concerned and sort it out by restoring the rights of the affected persons by ensuring they get to perform last rights and cremation at their traditional place itself,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/encroachers-deny-family-cremation-rights/articleshow/88939568.cms||Omjasvin M D

"Wherever random genome samples have been taken and tested, Omicron is found in more than 90% of samples," said a top health official. Telangana has been informing Centre about foreign arrivals and status of Omicron cases. But now it's a case of more cases in local community, officials said. Given this scenario, the peak is expected around last week of February, with health officials saying it could last till early March, warning that daily peak may even touch 50,000 cases if Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is not adopted. "It is important to complete vaccination by taking both doses and it is also equally important to adhere to precautions against Covid, including wearing a face mask and maintaining physical distance," the government warned on Sunday. According to experts, more cases of Omicron have both advantages and disadvantages. While more people will have fewer severe symptoms, the proportionate number of hospital admissions will increase. While no in-depth studies in community transmission with the Omicron variant have been conducted, data from the Liver and Biliary Institute in Delhi show that 61% patients are asymptomatic and 96% patients are recovering at home, with an average time taken for a negative RTPCR result of 10 days. "We have everything in place. We are also monitoring hospital admissions and we have enough beds with oxygen supply. People need not fear," health minister Harish Rao said. On the other hand, many people in the state are perplexed because seasonal fevers are on the rise as a result of the cold and rain. The health department said it is constantly supplying home isolation kits to those suffering from fever and other symptoms. A total of one lakh home isolation kits were distributed, with 85% of them given within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/90-ve-covid-cases-in-t-now-of-omicron-variant/articleshow/88939580.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Top party sources told reporters that neither recent defections of some of the OBC ministers of the Yogi government and party MLAs nor the agitation against the farm laws will dent the party's performance in UP. "A few individual figures may have moved away from the party, but the communities they claim to represent are very much with BJP," said a senior party leader and added, "in fact, their main problem is that they are not ready to stomach a new crop of young and energetic leaders from BJP's own ranks and belonging to the same communities who have emerged in the past few years." He also said that the party rebels, who have quit, are spreading lies on the OBC quota as there are no pending issues related to the subject. The leader also maintained that the farm laws will have no bearing on BJP's poll prospects and the party will once again retain its dominance in the western districts of UP. The assertion is significant as, after Punjab and Haryana, western UP accounted for the largest contingent of farm law protesters on Delhi borders. Farm union leader Rakesh Tikait has openly vowed to "punish" BJP in polls in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. The BJP leader, however, said that it will have no bearing on the party's performance in the state. "Just like recent state polls in Uttar Pradesh like 2007, 2012, 2017, the state will give a decisive verdict with BJP winning more than 300 seats once again," the BJP leader said. He said BJP will win 83 of the 103 seats for which the party has announced its candidates so far, which will set the momentum to cross the 300-mark and repeat its 2017 performance. Asked about speculations about CM Yogi Adityanath's candidature from Ayodhya, the BJP leader said that Ayodhya is a key issue for the party and not the candidate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-to-repeat-2017-feat-in-up-despite-defections-farm-stir/articleshow/88939596.cms||Akhilesh Singh

Considering the style and theme of the art, convener of NTHG, Sriramoju Haragopal said that they were painted 1500 years ago. The art relating to spiritual figures reflect their religious beliefs. Similar kind of rock carvings were found in Rachakonda, Mattanralla Tanda and Velpugonda in Medak district. "We have found nine inner circle designs in the paintings. The beautiful diagrams extend from one circle to another. These type of carvings are rarely seen. The canvas, which is 6 feet high and 10 feet wide, is considered be ‘Maisamma’ by the villagers, especially the Tenugu (Mudiraj) families," Haragopal said. "The decorative figures of the same pattern on a white background indicates that they were carved in late historic period, for religious purposes. The figures in center have slight difference, but the pattern is same. One big center figure contains inner circle and the outer circle has lines around it, similar to the rays. There is also small inner circle to its right, where the rays also have small lines," explained rock painting expert Bandi Muralidhar Reddy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/historians-discover-rare-rock-paintings-in-sircilla/articleshow/88939600.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Telangana among top five states that aided MSME sector||HYDERABAD: Telangana is among the top five states in the country for providing relief to the micro, small and medium enterprices (MSME) sector from becoming Non-Performing Assets (NPA) as a result of the Covid-19-induced economic slowdown. Various schemes were availed by nearly 4.9% of the units in the state. The central government has released loans under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). Amongst states, Gujarat with 12.4% has been the biggest beneficiary, followed by Maharashtra (11.4), Tamil Nadu (10.3), Uttar Pradesh (8.0), Telangana (5.9), West Bengal (5.9), Andhra Pradesh (5. 3), Rajasthan (5.0), Karnataka (5.0) and Kerala (4.4). According to a recent report from the State Bank of India (SBI), in financial year 2021, the central government has disbursed loans worth 9.5 lakh crore to the MSME sector, which is significantly higher than preceding years of Rs 6.8 lakh crore in FY 2020, owing primarily to the ECLGS. Telangana is among the top five states in terms of private company ownership among MSMEs. The micro and small enterprises’ loans in banks share around 80% of the total MSME loan portfolio. The trading sector has benefitted the most, followed by food processing, textiles and commercial real estate. The top ten sectors accounted for 75% of the outstanding amount saved for becoming NPAs. Hyderabad is the major growth engine and hub of MSME. Telangana is estimated to have 2.6 million MSMEs, with 56% of them located in rural areas and 44% in urban parts. Since the formation of the state, 63.388 million registered MSME units have begun operations, with an investment of 11,487 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-among-top-five-states-that-aided-msme-sector/articleshow/88939604.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad growing in circular fashion, expanding fast||HYDERABAD: The growth of Hyderabad has come full circle. It’s now expanding in the region from where the city and its predecessor Golconda had started a little over 550 years ago. The city of Hyderabad was formed in 1591 CE after then capital city Golconda could not hold the growing population.  From Golconda, Hyderabad first expanded towards the south of the Musi river. A couple of decades later, a new satellite town called Sultan Nagar was formed towards the east. But before the new fort at Sultan Nagar could be completed Qutb Shahi ruler Sultan Mohammad passed away. And, around 1620s another satellite town called Hayatnagar was formed further east by Sultan’s wife Hayat Bakshi Begum. After the devastating 1908 Musi flood and a series of pandemics and epidemics, the Nizam government was forced to expand the city as part of social distancing towards the north by forming Ameerpet, Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills. It further grew towards the north when Kukatpally, BHEL and ICRISAT were formed. And now nearly five centuries later, the city is once again expanding around Golconda and Shaikpet area on the old Surat-Machilipatnam trade route. The city began from the western side and after expanding in three directions, it is now growing towards the west. A perusal of satellite maps of Hyderabad over the past few decades show that the area on the old Mumbai (Surat) highway had witnessed the maximum growth not only in terms of skyscrapers and population but also in city planning and job generation. According to city heritage experts, Hyderabad and its predecessor Golconda has never been a static city. It has been expanding in all directions but in a circular fashion. The city had witnessed most of the growth towards the east till 1990s, but after 2004 it began expanding towards the west. Once it gets saturation towards the west, the city would again record growth towards the north. The growth was also steep towards the south after the opening of the new airport at Shamshabad. Geographer and GI scientist Kevin Haynes believes that the next growth axis would be towards the north.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-growing-in-circular-fashion-expanding-fast/articleshow/88939606.cms||Syed Akbar

According to Greater Hyderabad Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GHSPCA) workers, they rescued 38 birds entangled in Chinese manja in the last two days with one pigeon succumbing to fatal injuries. “It’s worse this year, we rescued 14 of them yesterday and 24 of them today (Sunday). A pigeon died by the time we reached the spot. Some of the birds include Indian eagles, pigeons and crows,” Soudharm Bhandari, an animal welfare officer (AWO) and head of GHSPCA told TOI. The glass-coated nylon thread continued to be sold across Hyderabad’s kite market this year and several birds were found trapped on high branches, lamp posts and electric poles which required human intervention. Animal Warriors Conservation Society (AWCS), another animal welfare NGO based in Hyderabad rescued a total of 70 birds in the last two days. “We are a team of four people and we received calls from across the city. Pigeons, crows, black kites, sunbirds are some of the birds we rescued,” Pradeep Parakuth, founder of AWCS told TOI. Experts note that it’s just the beginning of a year-long problem as post-Sankranti, the leftover Chinese manja on trees, electric poles and other elevated regions will continue to pose a threat to the birds. Pradeep explained that recently a painted stork was rescued by local police but died during treatment after a Chinese manja cut through its left-wing and even the bone. “The bird bled a lot and eventually passed away despite taking a lot of effort,” Pradeep added. Last year alone, AWCS rescued over 250 birds that were injured due to Chinese manja and claims that it’s a small number compared to previous years. “Due to COVID, last Sankranti did not see a lot of kites flying and enforcement against the trade of Chinese manja bore fruit. But, this year, it has gotten worse,” Pradeep said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/banned-chinese-manja-still-haunts-hyds-avifauna/articleshow/88939607.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

However, officials claim that the past enforcement did see the supply of the glass-coated manja decrease over the years. The forest department organized mobile squads to check the sale and purchase of synthetic manja during the Sankranthi festival 2022 in and around the twin cities. Similar mobile parties have been formed in the districts by District Forest Officers (DFOs) to implement the ban orders. “Due to the sustained efforts in implementing the ban since 2016, it is observed that the sales and use of the banned manja are coming down year after year. There is more awareness among the sellers as well as buyers. The forest department, with the help of NGOs and volunteers, is ensuring the display of posters in the shops to create awareness about the harm caused by these banned substances on animals, birds, humans, and environment,” the forest officials said in a press statement. “The sale of Chinese manja is affecting those who are running a business of selling normal manja. Since Chinese manja is cheap and more durable , youngsters prefer them more,” Mohammed Rizwan, a kite vendor at Dhoolpet, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chinese-manja-sale-booms-amidst-poor-enforcement/articleshow/88939609.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Perhaps, the talismanic charm failed to work on Sunday and the invaluable collection in the main hall of the 144-year-old grand club was lost in the flames forever. Every piece of heritage in the ballroom, Colonnade Bar and billiards room and a few office rooms of the club were reduced to ashes in the early Sunday morning fire. Right from billiards tables to hunting trophies, chandeliers and war memorials to sports trophies and wooden furniture to regimental coat-of-arms were lost. None from the lost collection is less than 120 years old. “Though the property loss is estimated to be around 20 crore, the heritage and antique value of the arts and artefacts burnt to ashes cannot be valued,” said heritage experts. According to them, they are simply priceless as they reflect the heritage of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. What however came as a solace is that the fire had not touched the library and the mixed lounge where some of the priceless books and murals are present. The heritage trees on the campus including the 120-year-old Peepul and 140-year-old Baobab trees are in good condition. The club built on Salar Jung’s land in 1878 is one of the five oldest clubs in India. Prior to the relocation of the club on the current premises, the campus served as a sojourn for the Nizam’s prime minister. The fire consumed the largest collection of regimental coat of arms (of Secunderabad troops) in any club in India. Sports trophies including the one with Hussainsagar engraved on it was also lost, as also the trophy wall containing stuffed crocodile, mountain goat, bison and a tiger skin. The main clubhouse building had won Intach heritage award. Intach city convener P Anuradha Reddy told TOI that it was a major loss for the heritage of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. “The collection was priceless and one of a kind.

Hours after the accident, the club was cordoned off by police. The club, which hosts hundreds of people for Sunday lunch, turned into a fortress following the accident. “It rained heavily in the wee hours of Sunday due to which the club was facing voltage fluctuations between 2am and 3am,” Reddy said. “Suddenly, a fire broke out at the main club house following which a call was made to the fire control room.” While discussions were rife on the fire safety aspects of the club, Reddy said fire audits were being taken up half-yearly. “This is the first time that the club has experienced a fire accident. Due to excessive wood work, the fire spread very rapidly. The bar area, where alcohol was stored, added to the fire. Following this, we will now have to use fire retardant construction material,” said Reddy. While the club has been closed for members, the managing committee intends to begin sports activities and other services in areas unaffected in the accident. Meanwhile, the Deccan Heritage Academy expressed its concerns over the fire accident. “I request the club’s managing committee to restore it to normal glory. I also request the state government to take steps to conserve the heritage building,” said Vedakumar Manikonda, DHA chairman.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/short-circuit-likely-cause-of-mishap/articleshow/88939620.cms||Preeti Biswas

To put things in perspective, at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) the first fortnight of January has recorded 113 Covid cases, at an average of 7.5 cases daily. At IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), the officials said "a few new mild cases have been recorded, the new cases are quite mild and recovery is fast". IIM-A has, since the start of the pandemic, recorded 579 cases, whereas IIT-Gn had recorded 267 cases on campus by the end of the second wave. An IIM-A spokesperson told TOI that resident students are allowed on campus, even as the classes are conducted online. "All movements are subject to the permission from the Students Activities Office (SAO). Gatherings are not allowed and visits from the outside are subject to purpose – virtual meetings are encouraged," said the spokesperson. Likewise, at IIT-Gn, gathering of more than four persons is discouraged. A senior official told TOI that student volunteers are appointed to ensure that Covid protocols are followed. "Those not wearing masks are fined Rs 1,000. Outside entry is only through prior approval. Double vaccination certificate and taking the temperature is mandatory," said the official. At both the institutes, the isolation period of seven days upon arrival and negative RT-PCR report are mandatory to be on the campus. Outside food is also restricted to some extent. Some other residential campuses have also put stringent restrictions for those wishing to stay in the city. The plans to open the campuses for students has also taken a backseat. While CEPT University has shifted its convocation in January online, several youth festivals – generally taking place in January – would also take place online in the majority of the institutes. "We had planned to open the campus for offline studies from January. But given the recent surge in cases, we would continue the education in online mode," said Dr. Jagadeesh Chandra T G, registrar of GNLU. "We have also asked the LLM students staying on the campus to vacate hostels. Accordingly, we do not have any students on campus now."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/iim-a-iit-gn-wrap-students-in-bio-bubble/articleshow/88939628.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Republic Day snub to Netaji hurts Bengal: CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to reconsider the Centre’s decision to exclude Bengal’s tableau from the Republic Day parade in New Delhi in the 75th year of Independence, saying the move had “shocked and hurt” her and “pained” people in Bengal, while pointing out that the omission “belittled” and “undermined” several freedom fighters from the state. The proposed Bengal tableau was on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations, his Indian National Army, and had portraits of “some of the most illustrious sons and daughters of this country”, including Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Sri Aurobindo, Matangini Hazra, Nazrul Islam and Birsa Munda. “I have been profoundly shocked and hurt by the decision of the Government of India to abruptly exclude the proposed tableau of the Government of West Bengal from the ensuing Republic Day Parade,” the CM wrote to the PM, adding, “It is even more baffling for us that the tableau was rejected without assigning any reasons or justifications.... All the people of West Bengal are deeply pained by this attitude of the central government. Bengal was at the forefront of the Indian Freedom Struggle and has paid the heaviest price for the country’s independence through Partition and uprooting of millions of people. It is shocking to find that this contribution of its valiant freedom fighters finds no place in the nation’s ceremony to celebrate the occasion of the Republic Day in the 75th year of our Independence.” CM letter stresses Bengal role in freedom movementBanerjee's letter also sought to outline Bengal's role in freedom struggle: It may kindly be remembered that Rishi Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay had articulated the first mantra of our nationalism, 'Vande Mataram', which later went on to become the National Song. Ramesh Chandra Dutt wrote the first comprehensive economic critique of British colonialism. Surendranath Banerjee founded the first nationalist political organisation in the country, the Indian Association. Swami Vivekananda provided the spiritual foundation of Indian nationalism. Sri Aurobindo furnished the ascetic-philosophical platform, while Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das emerged as a mentor for even Mahatma Gandhi. Then Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose brought a radical dimension to the anti-imperial crusade and it was his INA that gave the final death blow to the British Raj." It also spoke of "Hundreds of revolutionaries, from Khudiram Bose to Bagha Jatin to Masterda Surya Sen to the brave lady Matangini Hazra, who sacrificed their lives and became martyrs in the cause of Indian Independence. Kazi Nazrul lslam, the rebel poet, brought a socialist dimension to the evolving national culture, while Birsa Munda remained the ever-inspiring guardian of the spirit of freedom. The exclusion of the tableau amounts to belittling and undermining these freedom fighters." She urged the PM to reconsider the decision. Amid the Centre's decision to start the January 26 Republic Day celebrations on January 23 to coincide with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary celebrations, Trinamool on Saturday reacted sharply to reports of the Centre's rejection of the Bengal tableau. Even Netaji's grand-nephew, the former Bengal BJP leader Chandra Bose, opposed this move. The Congress, too, urged the Centre to reconsider its decision. Sources said Bengal had been part of meetings in New Delhi on parade preparations, but the state wasn't invited to the meeting earlier this month. There has been no official word from either the Centre or the defence ministry on this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/r-day-snub-to-netaji-hurts-bengal-mamata/articleshow/88939599.cms||Debasis Konar

Soon, the two fell in love and decided to marry. But Afsana’s family, especially her mother Tara Bano, were unwilling to accept their relationship and wanted to get her married to a Bangladeshi national. On Thursday, the 21-year-old fled her home, took local transport to reach the border and crossed into India to be with Hasan. But destiny landed her in the hands of BSF. “We held her at Bighaltari border in Dinhata’s Nazirhat area. This stretch has no fencing and taking advantage of that, the lady crossed over. We handed her over to Sahebganj police,” a BSF official said. On Sunday, Afsana was produced in a Dinhata court, which sent her to judicial custody for 14 days. “I want to marry Hasan. So I ran away from my house and entered India, despite knowing that it was risky,” said Afsana. Hasan, a garage owner, had gone to Bighaltari to receive her. Now afraid and depressed over the turn of eve-nts, he has stopped speaking.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bangla-woman-crosses-border-for-love-held/articleshow/88939631.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vegetable prices high, traders blame manpower shortage||KOLKATA: Even though winter is at its peak, the prices of vegetables remain unusually high due to the shortage of manpower triggered by a sudden surge in Covid infection among retailers and wholesalers. This shortage has upset the supply chain, preventing a steady drop in retail prices. Most of the winter vegetables are as costly as above Rs 50 a kg — the price had plunged below Rs 20 by mid-January in previous years. “There is a severe manpower shortage. The loading-unloading men are not there, coolies (porters) are absent and the collection boys are not working too. It is a very difficult situation at every market in the city,” said Kamal De, president, Bengal Vendors’ Association. Moreover, the dearth of drivers in adequate numbers has made the transportation of goods costlier. There are only a few drivers available and they are demanding exorbitant charges, sensing a demand-supply gap. Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Koley Market, said, “Whether retail or wholesale, besides the vendor, a chain of workers work relentlessly to facilitate the market to operate seamlessly. But there are major disruptions now. Even the collection boys, who collect money from the retailers, are not joining.” “This winter, we could not buy enough vegetables that were beyonf the reach of affordability. For the first time it happened. Winter is known for the variety of vegetables at affordable prices. But we had to buy a minimum amount of vegetables this time to strike a balance in the monthly budget. Retailers kept giving excuses for high vegetable prices this year. But these excuses don’t appear convincing to me,” said Amritangshu Chakraborty, a school teacher at Brahmo Samaj Road, Behala. If winter vegetables remain costly, the all-season vegetables remain even costlier — most of them are being sold for above Rs 100 a kg. Pointed gourd is priced at Rs 150 a kg, drumsticks at Rs 250 a kg, bitter gourd at Rs 80 a kg. A bottle gourd is priced at Rs 50 a piece. “The weather is wreaking havoc on the crop production in Bengal. This results in a shortage of production, which in turn increases the prices of vegetables,” said De who works closely with farmers in Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/veggie-prices-high-traders-blame-manpower-shortage/articleshow/88939633.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The KMDA, the custodian of the Lake, was requested repeatedly by some morning walkers at Rabindra Sarobar in this regard. Citizens questioned why the Lake premises could not be opened for morning walk for a few hours while restaurants and other commercial establishments were allowed to remain open and even fairs were allowed to be held in open air venues. With the gates of Rabindra Sarobar closed, many people have to walk outside the Lake premises in the morning. “We have requested the authorities to allow the opening of the lake for two hours from 6am to 8am,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh who has sent a letter to the state chief secretary and KMDA authorities on behalf of the morning walkers. The KMDA officials said they are strictly following the government’s instructions on this matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/request-from-morning-walkers-for-lake-opening/articleshow/88939634.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cyber cell nabs crypto conman||KOLKATA: Port division cyber cell has nabbed a man in less than 24 hours for allegedly creating a fake Instagram account posing as a crypto currency and forex trading guru and duping many of their har- earned money. According to police, a young share broker residing at Garden Reach complained on the National Cyber Reporting Portal that he has been duped by an Instagram user who introduced himself as Daksh Vohra in the name of investing in forex trade and converting the investment into crypto currency to make huge profits. “The victim had paid through a private payment gateway. Cyber Cell Port division started an enquiry, and in 24 hours nabbed the accused, Arif Raza, a resident of Nazir Lane in the Port area. Raza had created an Insta-profile posing as a crypto expert offering his ‘expertise’ to earn huge profits by investing with him. The victim paid into the given account, but after some days the profile vanished. During questioning, Raza told us about his associates and their role in the scam. Further legal process has been taken up by Garden Reach police to unearth the gang and nab his associate,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cyber-cell-nabs-crypto-conman/articleshow/88939635.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Saoli Mitra leaves stage, curtains on Sombhu-Tripti legacy||KOLKATA: Theatre activist Saoli Mitra passed away at her residence on Sunday afternoon. She was 73. Like her father Sombhu Mitra, the Padmasri winner and Sangeet Natak Akademi award winner had written her instructions on a stamp paper stating that the news of her death should be made public only after the cremation was over.  People close to her made sure that her last wish was fulfilled. Her first performance on stage in a leading role was for ‘Raja’. That was in 1987. As a playwright, she was known for ‘Nathabati Ananthabat’ and ‘Katha Amritasaman’. Her performances in both these plays along with that ‘Raja’ and ‘Galileo’ have inspired later generations. Her directorial ventures on stage for Pancham Vaidic include ‘Nathabati Ananthabat’, ‘Katha Amritasaman’, ‘Putul Khela’, ‘Ekti Rajnoitik Hatya’ and ‘Chandali’. Mitra also worked in Ritwik Ghatak’s film ‘Jukti Tokko Aar Goppo’ as Bangabala. Till her death, she was the president of Paschim Banga Bangla Academy and edited its magazine. The last time Mitra acted on stage was in 2005. That was with Arpita Ghosh for ‘Chandali’. In 2019, she was last seen on stage when she did a solo play-reading of ‘Sita Katha’. In 2020, she left behind instructions on a stamp paper, in which she made it clear that she didn’t want hospitalization and wanted to be cremated at the earliest with no frills at all. She didn’t even fancy wreaths to be offered to her. After her demise at 3.40 pm on Sunday, Arpita Ghosh and Sayak Chakraborty ensured that her last wishes were fulfilled. Everyone was informed only at night once her cremation was over. Mitra was ailing for quite some time now. On Sunday morning, she was extremely unwell. Ghosh had wanted to excuse herself from the rehearsal of a solo-act play that was scheduled for Sunday. “Around 9.30 in the morning, I asked her if I should cancel the rehearsal. Usually, she doesn’t like rehearsals being cancelled and always talks about how it will inconvenience a theatre group. But, I still called up Debasish Ray of Theatre Platform and excused myself. I told her about this and said the rehearsals can always happen a day or two later. Mammo, as I addressed her, looked at me and said: ‘I don’t have much time’,” Ghosh remembered. When the end was nearing, she looked at Ghosh, smiled and said, ‘Ebar tahole choli? (So, let me leave now…)’. "I lost my biological mother in June last year. The person who made me Arpita Ghosh left me today. Mammo taught me how to accept everything in life head on and to learn from everything that life offers,” said Ghosh. Theatre personality Debesh Chattopadhyay, who was also present at the funeral, described her demise as “end of an era”. “Her ‘Nathabati Anathabath’ had a landmark performance in Bengali theatre. It was a learning experience to watch how she transformed herself on stage to play so many characters in that solo-act play. The way she used her diction was exemplary. She gave a modern touch to the story telling format and the play was a great example of the blending of modern theatre with our cultural roots,” he explained. She had also taken to the streets during the Singur agitation. "When I saw the sufferings of the farmers, I couldn’t sit back. If some situations demand my protest, I’ll again do so. If I take to the streets daily, I’ll be accused of being publicity hungry. I voice my views through my articles," she had said. Despite all her intentions, Mitra was not spared from criticism. At 68, she had told TOI that she no longer cared if she was called “an escapist for not having an opinion on every television debate”. “I’ve grown up hearing that my lineage got me favours. But I never said anything. I’ve learnt to choose my battles,” she had said. On being asked how she dealt with malice, she said, “I remember Baba’s words — ‘Think of what Tagore had to face despite being a sensitive soul!’” As the president of the Paschim Banga Bangla Academy, she had worked relentlessly. “I even check proofs. After lot of research, we’ve come up with 11 volumes of Rabindrarachanabali. It is not a reprint. We have come out with two volumes of Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s works,” she had said. The magazine of Paschim Banga Bangla Academy, which she edited, dealt with important issues of literature, culture and cultural history. "Important articles were published by authors. She was very keen to publish several new types of books when she joined as the chairperson. One of the works is a collection of essays on Vidyasagar by eminent historians and literary critics. Our last meeting was in December, she attended it on the telephone and guided us on how to host the little magazine fair and also gave us instructions on the new issue of the magazine. She was currently editing complete writings of her father,” said Aveek Mazumdar, professor of comparative literature at Jadavpur University and executive council member of Bangla Academy. In the recent times, she wrote several books on Bengali theatre and its history. “She also wrote some books on the cultural history of Bengal. This year’s diary of Bangla Academy has her name as the president. We will keep that diary forever,” Mazumdar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/saoli-leaves-stage-curtains-on-sombhu-tripti-legacy/articleshow/88939637.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Booster drive a week old; demand may rise as most seniors to finish 9-month wait soon||KOLKATA: Around 2.5 lakh people in Bengal, including 33,546 people in Kolkata, have taken their precaution dose till Sunday evening, a week after it was rolled out. According to sources among the 2.5 lakh vaccine recipients, a bulk has been health care workers and a small proportion of elderly population. The precaution dose demand for elderly persons are likely to see a substantial increase by end January when most complete the nine-month gap after their second dose. Vaccination for the 60 plus population in India began on March 1 last year. For Covaxin the gap between two doses was around a month but initially for Covishield it was around a month-and-a-half. There is a nine-month gap in which one can take the booster dose, which makes most eligible in end-January. Former banker and Jadavpur resident Dipankar Dasgupta, who was among the first few batches of elderlies to get fully vaccinated by the end of April 2021, said he is eagerly waiting to take the booster dose. “My second dose of vaccination was done on April 25, which means by the end of this month, my nine months period will be over, and I can take the booster dose,” said Dasgupta (73), who suffers from high sugar and a chest ailment. In the meantime, several elderly people tested Covid positive delaying their booster dose dates by a further three months after recovering. Behala resident Ruby Banerjee (66) who had got fully vaccinated by April 19 was also looking forward to taking the booster dose. But she tested positive for Covid earlier this month. “As we were among the first few batches to be vaccinated, the process was extremely seamless back then. It was only after few more weeks that the crisis for vaccines began. I was again looking forward to be among the firsts to get the booster dose but I contracted the infection and now I have to wait. I hope there is no crisis later on,” said Banerjee. KMC officials say the initial response was lukewarm but after a gap of five days the numbers are on a rise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/booster-drive-a-week-old-demand-may-rise-as-most-seniors-to-finish-9-month-wait-soon/articleshow/88939638.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Normal operations at Kolkata Municipal Corporation birth-death certificate wing, clinics||KOLKATA: A resumption in the distribution of birth and death certificates last week — that had to be stalled with several civic employees testing Covid positive — is set to be followed by the revival of normal services at Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s vaccination centres and its sanitization drive. Covid vaccination clinics, testing and sanitization drives were affected by a surge in cases among civic employees. With many testing negative, these services were restored last week, but with more employees set to join work after their home isolation, they will now gain momentum. “We had to send around 200 KMC health department staff to home isolation by the first week of January. A crisis emerged that had crippled our normal functions. Now we are about to get back our staff strength and will resume normal services in several spheres,” said a KMC official. The KMC health department resumed distribution of birth and death certificates last week. KMC bosses were compelled to suspend functions of the wing after a majority of employees tested positive 10 days ago. “We have reopened the birth and death registration wing after several employees rejoined office after the mandatory home isolation,” said an official. At present, the department offers citizens applications for birth and death certificates through a chatbot service that allows them to seek an appointment with an official. Among the KMC health department officials, chief municipal health officer, several borough executive health officers and medical officers tested positive in quick succession in the first week of January, paralysing the department. Besides that, the KMC secretary’s department was one of the worst hit. The department couldn’t function normally after a majority of staff were infected. Even municipal commissioner Binod Kumar was on leave after he tested positive. “We have experienced the worst after hundreds of employees, some of them top officials, tested positive. Now, a majority of them are medically fit and have rejoined office. Now we are ready to resume all activities,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/normal-ops-at-kmc-birth-death-cert-wing-clinics/articleshow/88939639.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Theatre groups hit as shows cancelled after Covid spike||KOLKATA: Among the 17 shows that Shyamabajar Mukhomukhi had of ‘Andhayug’ and ‘Typist’ in January, only one has not been cancelled. ‘Typist’, which was adapted from Soumitra Chatterjee’s script, was first staged on November 14 and till the end of December, it had staged a dozen shows. Actor Tapan Das, who was in the headlines for selling fish during the first wave at Shantinagar’s Satadal Pally 2 in Khardah after travelling the world over with the Royal Shakespeare Company for Tim Supple’s ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’, continues to do so. “Things had improved a little. I had taken part in festivals and workshops too. But the situation is tight now. I still sell fish. However, I have not come across anyone new from the theatre world who is selling fish or vegetables in the third wave,” Das said. The audience count, Das pointed out, has dipped drastically after the outbreak of Omicron. “We are now getting 20%-25% audience from what we used to before,” he said. “Things started going downhill since January 3 when our Krishnagore show got cancelled. Since then, everything fell like a stack of cards. Now, we hear only one show is happening on January 22 at Joynagar. We are unsure if our play, ‘Andhayug’, will finally be staged at the NSD festival in Agartala,” said theatre personality Poulami Bose. According to Bose, logistics is the main problem if she stages plays even with 50% occupancy. “If someone gets infected after coming to watch our play, the moral responsibility will rest on us. That’s why we can’t risk staging shows now,” Bose says. Theatre personality Suman Mukhopadhyay too has kept shows on hold. “Few are staging shows now. But I have been talking to producers who admit that theatre is facing a bad loss now. Only a few are in the auditorium. Most viewers are infected and staying at home,” Mukhopadhyay said. However, not everyone is ready to press the panic button yet. “I am going everywhere. Things will settle down. The less one panics, the better it is,” said theatre personality Sohini Sengupta. Even her father, thespian Rudraprasad Sengupta, is attending Nandikar’s rehearsals daily. “He had viral fever and got all his tests done. After recovery, baba is attending rehearsals,” she added. Nandikar had to cancel just one show in Cooch Behar. Its next Kolkata show will be in February. On Sunday evening, Abhijit Sengupta, joint secretary of Aneek theatre group, attended Amta Parichay’s play at Puppetorium. “Thirty people were invited in the small theatre space. Everyone came over enjoyed the performance,” Sengupta said. Arup Roy, the secretary and director of Aneek theatre group, followed all protocol and staged its play – ‘Ishwar’ – at the Minerva Theatre on January 7. “The state government has allowed theatres to be staged with 50% occupancy. More than 150 viewers were present at the auditorium for this show. We have our Ganga Jamuna Natya Utsav in Joynagar from January 21 to 23 and invite everyone to stage plays without any fear.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/theatre-groups-hit-as-shows-cancelled-after-covid-spike/articleshow/88939640.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||As HCW vaccination completes a year, docs recall how jabs helped in Cov fight||Kolkata: On Sunday, Kolkata completed a year of its first vaccination drive, launched on January 16, 2021, with over 1,800 healthcare workers from nine state hospitals, four private hospitals and five urban primary health centres (UPHC) being the first beneficiaries in the fight against Covid. A year on, some of them recalled a tentative beginning to the drive that had started on an uncertain note, overcame glitches and finally attracted thousands each day to the vaccination centres across the city.Healthworkers also completed a week of their ‘precaution’ or third dose on Sunday. It is being considered as an essential safeguard by doctors who had completed their vaccination by March, 2021. The Co-Win software, which was supposed to notify the beneficiaries about the time and venue of inoculation, had malfunctioned. Hospitals then proceeded to notify beneficiaries by call or text message. But once everything settled down and the drive gained momentum, there was no looking back.Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain took the vaccine on the first day even as many of his hospital staff chose to stay away. “People were scared of the vaccine and it threatened to halt the drive. But soon, most realized that it was the most effective shield to the virus, which has been proved by the decline in the number of deaths and hospitalizations during the current wave,” said Jain, who has received his precaution dose. Bipasha Seth, critical care specialist at AMRI Dhakuria, recalled her first dose as “efficient” and “hassle-free.” “I remember many people, including some relatives, were facing problems with registration. But since I am a healthcare worker, the process was relatively easy for me.” On the days preceding the first vaccination drive, there was a lack of clarity as to how exactly the beneficiaries would be chosen. The app was allegedly supposed to choose beneficiaries on a random basis. But two days before the drive, hospitals were asked to prepare a list of 100 hospital staff each. Anirudhha Maiti, retina surgeon, said, “The process was very systematic. All hospital staff including support staff like sweepers were informed of the date and venue of their inoculation. Frankly, I had to deliver a critical operation on my stipulated date, but there was no problem when I requested a change in date.” CMRI Hospital pulmonology director Raja Dhar said he also took the shot on the inaugural day. Immediately after the first vaccine shots were administered, Kolkata reported over 200 operational vaccine sites across the city. Speculating the future of pandemic, UK-based doctor Samit Purkaisthya, who is from Kolkata, said, “Though it is difficult to speak definitely about the virulence of future variants, people must remember to abide by social-distancing and sanitation rules.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/as-hcw-vaccination-completes-a-year-docs-recall-how-jabs-helped-in-cov-fight/articleshow/88939641.cms||---
---||Kolkata||As doctors resume duty post Covid, hospitals in Kolkata start planned surgeries||KOLKATA: With Covid-affected surgeons and physicians trickling back to work after serving their home-isolation period, non-Covid treatment and surgeries have started climbing up across Kolkata’s hospitals. Even though less than half of the usual number of surgeries are being carried out at most hospitals on an average, doctors and experts expect it to rise over the next two weeks as the spate of transmission slows and the number of healthcare workers in home isolation decreases. At SSKM Hospital, around 400 major surgeries are being conducted every day after a temporary slide prompted by several surgeons, physicians and patients testing positive. Most doctors have since returned, and surgeries have reached the near-normal mark. “We struggled till January 10, but there has been a steady revival since. The number of outdoor patients, however, remains low,” said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar. Non-Covid treatment and surgeries are fast approaching the pre-third wave numbers at Kolkata’s government hospitals, according to Rajya Sabha MP and medic Shantanu Sen. “There had been a drop in the number of patients and surgeries due to the sudden surge in transmission. But with the first group of affected healthcare workers returning and fewer getting infected subsequently, operations have returned to near-normal numbers,” he said. Private hospitals, too, have seen a revival of activity at the operation theatres and non-Covid wards. At Peerless Hospital, number of surgeries have gone up to almost 40% of normal. “Most of our surgeons and consultants are back. We have around 120 non-Covid patients admitted but people are still wary of infection. So, the number of surgeries and non-Covid treatment remain low. We expect both to reach 80% of the normal mark in the next two weeks since positivity rate has started sliding across labs,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. Woodlands Hospital has decided to go ahead with surgeries on Covid patients. “We are not postponing planned surgeries due to patients’ Covid status and have established our own protocol on safe surgeries, similar to other infectious diseases,” said CEO Rupali Basu. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, surgeries have gone up to 20 a day from around 12 last week. “Almost all our doctors who had been infected have returned. Elective and emergency surgeries are fast approaching the normal mark. Unless we see another surge, non-Covid treatment should normalize by next week,” said chairperson Alok Roy. Non-Covid treatment and surgeries have risen marginally at CMRI Hospital. “This is an encouraging trend,” said director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. Surgeries had come to a near-halt at Charnock Hospital last week with more than 30 healthcare workers testing positive. Surgeries have now crawled up to around 30% of the normal mark. “Operations have resumed and most of our doctors and surgeons are now back,” said MD Prashant Sharma. AMRI Hospitals, however, are yet to see a revival in the number of non-Covid patients and surgeries. The hospital conducts around 50 surgeries across three units, which dipped to less than 10 during the first week of January. “It has picked up marginally, but a large number of patients reporting for elective and emergency surgeries are testing positive, forcing procedures to be deferred,” said CEO Rupak Barua. A state health official said one reason behind the quick return to normalcy at government hospitals was the practice of doctors working for seven days and then taking a break for a week. “This is an unofficial arrangement that has shielded doctors from infection,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/as-docs-resume-duty-post-cov-hosps-start-planned-surgeries/articleshow/88939642.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Spot fines, seizures make a comeback on Kolkata roads||KOLKATA: The city traffic police has decided to reintroduce spot fines and seizures after a 10-day break, although a decision on resuming breathalyzer tests has been pushed back for a couple more days. “A decision on the most important test on road will be taken based on the response to the spot fines,” said a senior officer at the Lalbazar Traffic Building. The spot fines were stopped from January 6 due to surging Covid cases among both citizens and Kolkata Police personnel. So far, Kolkata Police has recorded over 730 Covid cases in the third wave. Over 95% of these cases were recorded after January 2. Of them, 146 were from the traffic wing — with as many as 52 sergeants getting infected by Covid. According to top Lalbazar officers, two developments in the past couple of days have led them to reverse their decision. “The number of Covid cases within the traffic unit has finally seen a slight decline since the first week of January. Officers from all ranks have begun rejoining work — starting from the additional CP, joint CP and DCPs, and most importantly, sergeants and constables,” said another officer. Additionally, the rising number of accidents on the road — especially those involving trucks and two-wheelers — has also hastened the decision. While eight persons were left injured in the past week, two persons died in fatal accidents. One of them happened to be a cop himself. Till last week, there were 80-90 Covid cases a day. However, the past 72 hours have seen these numbers dip to between 50-60 per day. “While the traffic cops were the first to fall ill — a trend witnessed from the first wave as they have maximum exposure to the public — the numbers are now declining,” said an ACP. Commissioner Vineet Goyal held a video conference with senior officers on Saturday and asked all traffic guards to restart spot fines along with citation cases. Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey then held video conferences with all OCs and ACPs asking them to begin checks but without compromising their security. “Though he is yet to mention breathalyzer tests, he insisted on carrying out seizures and compound cases, which is only possible when we carry out spot checks. However, there is a catch. Cops, especially those who have taken the booster dose, will have to take the lead,” said an officer. “There is a rumour that we have stopped all prosecutions. We have not taken any such decision at any time, especially when our daily prosecutions were regularly crossing 2,000 before the third wave. The only advice from the top now is to avoid direct conversation in close quarters. Citation and sticker cases will continue. But we are very serious about drink-driving prosecutions and a review on breathalyzer tests will be done soon,” said an officer. Traffic personnel have also been asked to use gloves and face shields in addition to masks while interacting with the public on roads. “This was enforced during both the first and second waves, and is just a reiteration of the old order as is the importance given to sanitizing the police stations and traffic guards,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/spot-fines-seizures-make-a-comeback-on-kol-roads/articleshow/88939643.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Cyber Cell Port division started an enquiry, and in 24 hours nabbed the accused, Arif Raza, a resident of Nazir Lane in the Port area. Raza had created an Insta-profile posing as a crypto expert offering his ‘expertise’ to earn huge profits by investing with him. The victim paid into the given account, but after some days the profile vanished. During questioning, Raza told us about his associates and their role in the scam. Further legal process has been taken up by Garden Reach police to unearth the gang and nab his associate,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cyber-cell-nabs-insta-crypto-guru/articleshow/88939644.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: People connect and virus check in focus as Covid delays Salt Lake polls||KOLKATA: The pushing back of the civic poll dates in Bidhannagar has put the candidates and party workers in a dilemma of sorts — whether to take a break or intensify the poll campaign further over the extra three weeks they now have before the polls on February 12. While senior candidates like Sabyasachi Dutta of TMC, Devasis Jana of BJP and Radhanath Chand of Left said they would concentrate on intensifying poll campaigns across blocks and revisit houses and neighbourhoods they have already visited, other candidates like Rajesh Chirimar and Debraj Chakraborty of TMC said they will prefer to take a break from campaigns to uphold the spirit in which the election was deferred and focus more on controlling the Covid situation in their wards. TMC’s Ward 39 candidate Rajesh Chirimar, who is still recuperating from post Covid, said he has already suspended all campaigns over the next one week and will begin campaigning only thereafter depending on the Covid situation. “The elections were deferred to ensure the Covid numbers do not accentuate further. If we don’t respect that and suspend the campaign activities the reason behind the act will be lost,” said Chirimar. TMC’s Ward 7 and Ward 35 candidates Debraj Chakraborty and Jaydev Naskar are also of the same opinion as they plan to expedite Covid control measures giving the campaigning a break in next few days. “We will focus on how to cooperate with the state on checking the Covid spread,” Chakraborty said. However, former TMC’s Ward 31 candidate and former BMC mayor Sabyasachi Dutta said the three weeks will be more beneficial in terms of having more residents going out to vote. “Many have been affected by Covid. At least 70% of the Covid affected residents will recover by these three weeks and they will be able to cast their vote. Also, now I have more time to plan the next phase of campaigning,” Dutta said. Former BMC MMIC Devasish Jana, who is contesting as a BJP candidate this time from Ward 31 said he would utilize this additional three weeks to connect more with the people. Left’s Ward 39 and Ward 36 candidates Radhanath Chand and Chandana Mondal are also planning to utilize this extra time for more intensive door-to-door campaigns. Outgoing BMC mayor Krishna Chakraborty said they had started conducting their campaign in full flow. “People and their safety are our top priority. We have now got time to carry out our official work and will also simultaneously conduct our poll campaign as per the EC guidelines,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/people-connect-and-virus-check-in-focus-as-cov-delays-salt-lake-polls/articleshow/88939645.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Also, the tableau on Netaji and his INA will be brought to Kolkata if it isn’t showcased in New Delhi. The Bengal government is gearing up to showcase Republic Day as an extended programme of Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary and plans are afoot to use tableau on Netaji on Red Road.Netaji’s birth anniversary programmes are going to be curtailed due to the ongoing pandemic. The state government has cancelled the padayatra from Shyambazar on January 23 to avoid the congregation of many people at a point, an official said.State officials are planning to use R-Day to showcase Netaji as well. Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “With the Centre rejecting the tableau on Netaji and thus depriving the people of Bengal to pay tribute to the Bengal hero we are considering if the tableau can be brought to Kolkata for display during the R-Day show.”A senior official said there are plans to showcase Netaji at the R-Day programme, though this time it might be a low-key affair due to Covid. “We are keeping a close watch on the positivity rate and accordingly the cards for the function of R-Day will be distributed, as the flag hoisting programme will be done following all safety norms on Red Road.”He said a tableau on Netaji may be on display and added some additional programmes on Netaji can happen if the CM wants, as she has pleaded to the Centre to reconsider the tableau of Bengal on Netaji. Bengal officials said earlier, too, the Centre had rejected the tableaus of Bengal government. They said in 2020 the tableau on Kanyashree was not entertained by the Centre. Even the 2018 tableau on unity in diversity was rejected. Both were later displayed in Red Road parade. The state is also planning to request the Centre to bring out a commemorative stamp and a coin on Netaji.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/netaji-freedom-struggle-to-be-theme-of-r-day-parade/articleshow/88939646.cms||---

The solar dome is a truncated geodetic spherical dome with active solar panels on its outer side for continuous generation of solar power throughout the day.  Inside the dome there will be a huge space with at least three floors of exhibition spaces connected with a spiral ramp for visitors to go up and a central lift to come down to the ground floor. The top floor level will offer a spectacular viewing gallery. Officials said it is being worked out how multiple exhibits, theatrical shows on global warming and hi-tech interactive display shows of international standard could be organised inside the solar dome on its three different floors. About 2,000 solar panels have been fixed on the outer side of the solar dome that will produce 180 KWH of solar power when fully completed. The generated solar power will be used for its internal lighting and to light up the surrounding streetlights, officials said. Though the project is expected to be completed and ready by this year end, authorities are planning to open at least the first floor of the solar dome globe within the next few months. Work on the project which had started in February 2017, is being executed jointly by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL) and Hidco. There will also be various participatory attractions for visitors. One floor will have fixed cycles and paddling on it will generate power.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/three-storey-solar-dome-in-new-town-likely-by-yr-end/articleshow/88939647.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Both were either vaccinated or partially vaccinated, but it was not known if they were infected by the newer variant, Omicron, or the earlier variant, Delta, as no genome sequencing of their samples was done, said health department officials. With the current fatalities, the death toll due to coronavirus in the district reached 404 since the outbreak, while at least 296 people tested positive for the virus in the last 24 hours, said officials. According to health department authorities, the two deaths were reported after a gap of almost six months. The man (80) was admitted to a hospital on Saturday, while he died on early Sunday morning. He was fully vaccinated and had tested positive for the disease at the time of admission to the hospital. The woman, a resident of Vrindavan, was taken to Agra for treatment after her condition started deteriorating. She died at SN Medical College in Agra on Saturday. She was vaccinated, but it was not known if she was vaccinated fully or partially, said officials. Nodal in charge of the rapid response team Dr Bhudev (goes by the first name only) said so far, 404 deaths have been reported in the district. “The Omicron test was not conducted in both the death cases. At present, the active cases in the district are 2,229, but only five patients have been admitted to the hospital,” he added. Meanwhile, the district judge has been asked to ensure that only 50% of the total strength of judicial officers attends the court on a rotation basis. Also, pregnant lady judicial officers should be exempted from attending the court, and if necessary, they should be allowed to work from home. Besides restrictions on the judicial officials, litigants or other representatives should be strictly prohibited on the court premises. However, in urgent cases, with the prior permission of district judges, the litigants may be allowed on the court premises. These guidelines will be effective from January 17 till further orders, according to a letter issued by the registrar general of the Allahabad high court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/mathura-reports-two-covid-deaths-first-in-third-wave/articleshow/88937585.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The fear of frauds is triggered by the reduction in human contact due to large-scale remote working and an increase in customers using non-banking channels for transactions. According to the Indian Banking Fraud Survey released by Deloitte, the most common concern for bankers is loan fraud (24%) followed by frauds in internet & mobile banking (14%). Respondents cited limited monitoring of assets after disbursement (38%), the economic slowdown (24%) and insufficient due diligence prior to disbursement (21%) as the top three factors leading to higher problem loans. These suggest that banks may need to overhaul their due diligence and monitoring frameworks. “The number of fraud incidents encountered by banks over the last two years appears to have increased, compared with the findings of our previous survey. Around 53% of respondents indicated that they have faced more than 100 fraud incidents in retail banking (over the last two years) — a 29% increase since the previous edition,” the report said. According to the report, bankers said they have managed to detect fraud largely during routine audit and reconciliation followed by proactive measures through internal automated data analysis or transaction monitoring software. There were also instances of fraud coming to light following complaints from customers or whistleblowers. Lenders are seeking to counter fraud by increasing their dependence on analytical tools for fraud monitoring and detection. Many are increasing awareness of frauds among customers and employees and changing the operating model. A key measure taken by 23% of the respondent banks in the last six months was optimising the existing early warning and fraud monitoring systems to cater to current banking conditions, using artificial intelligence/ machine learning and by integrating external databases. Top challenges faced by banks in performing an in-house forensic audit include technological limitations to read and analyse the borrower’s accounting records (25%), lack of data analytics capabilities (21%) and lack of requisite skill sets (20%). In addition, the lack of a dedicated team, according to 17% of respondents, is also another major impediment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/78-bankers-see-frauds-rising-in-2-years-survey/articleshow/88938489.cms||---

The Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) had given permission for the construction of a tea stall in an open area of the bus stand. However, the area was converted into a commercial property without the NOC of the transport department, and was discovered during an inspection of the bus stand in October 2021. In a letter to the KTC managing director, the deputy director of transport (admin) has stated that action be initiated by KTC to restore the land at the bus stand to its original position in 15 days. The Goa Consumer Action Network (Goacan), in a letter to director of transport Rajan Satardekar on November 3, had pointed out that the encroachment was noticed during the inspection of the bus stand conducted by the monitoring cell of the North Goa District Road Safety Committee. Goacan stated that during the inspection it was noticed that the construction of the tea stall had not only taken over the area of two benches but blocked the access to the bus bay and cut off the ventilation on one side. They also claimed that the construction of the tea stall at the bus stand did not have any permission from the Mapusa Municipal Council, either. “We understand that the KTC seeks to increase its revenue by increasing commercial activity at the bus stand, but we are unable to understand why this activity is sought to be done at the cost of the comfort and safety of the passengers,” Goacan stated in the letter adding that fire safety officer present during the inspection pointed out that the situation was a fire hazard.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/action-taken-against-mapusa-bus-stand-encroachment/articleshow/88938689.cms||---
---||Business||Banks’ e-biz ambitions set to face talent crunch||MUMBAI: Banks are set to face a major challenge in finding talent to meet their digital ambitions. While banks have the resources to invest in technology and are putting more money in digital than branches, they are finding it difficult to hire the right people. According to Sonali Kulkarni, Accenture’s lead for financial services in India, banks have emerged stronger with better liquidity and bad loans under control. They have also learnt to deal with uncertainty and operate with staff working from home. But they now face change at an unprecedented velocity — whether it is technology, customer behaviour and expectation or fintechs unbundling their value chain. “The demand in the market today is for the right talent, whether it’s for business, technology or some of the niche skills around AI or analytics. How do banks attract the best talent given that there are more than enough fintechs competing for them and banks are not seen as a home for these skills?” said Kulkarni. While some banks have chosen to outsource, they would still need some technical skills to understand which way these technologies are going and manage the changes. “A lot of banks have recently made public statements around wanting to be a technology company in the business of financial services. Given that focus and ambition, it can’t be just left to consultants,” said Kulkarni. Besides hiring talent in technology, banks will need to reskill existing employees to enable them to have the right conversations with customers, either around selling or resolving some of the more complex queries. The interim alternative for banks is to enter into collaborations with fintechs and leverage their capabilities. Moving to cloud-based architecture will also address some issues around scalability or infrastructure. “But I don’t think that will necessarily be a silver bullet,” said Kulkarni. Besides reskilling, a cultural change is required to embrace the new wave of disruption, improving the technology quotient of different segments of employees and moving to a more data-driven culture. “You may want to tie up or do collaborations with fintechs in the shorter term. But on a longer-term basis, lending is a core business. So, banks have to upgrade their lending systems and make them nimble so that they can do the same thing on their own as well.” According to Kulkarni, the other disruptive trends that 2022 will see includes the account aggregator model being operationalised. Also, the introduction of a data protection law would require banks to decide how they use external data. “The use cases for API technology have just exploded right across and not just in the retail or the payments but also wholesale, commercial and small and medium enterprises,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-e-biz-ambitions-set-to-face-talent-crunch/articleshow/88938522.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Business||Most recast loans on track: HDFC Bank||MUMBAI: HDFC Bank, which reported a record net profit of Rs 10,342 crore for the quarter ended December 2021, has said that most borrowers who availed Covid restructuring are likely to repay their loans in time, while 10-20 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) of their loans could slip into default. Addressing the analysts’ call after the results on Saturday, chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said that the bank’s restructured loans under the RBI framework for Covid, as of December-end, stand at 137bps of its loans. “This is at the borrower level and includes 28bps of other facilities of the same borrower, which were not restructured but included here. Of the restructured accounts, 40% are secured with good collateral. Approximately, two-thirds are salaried customers and about 40% have a Cibil score of above 700,” said Vaidyanathan. According to published numbers, the bank has restructured Rs 14,564 crore of personal loans, Rs 1,566 crore of business loans and Rs 1,889 crore of loans to small businesses under the RBI Resolution Framework - 2, dated May 5, 2021. “Covid restructuring has been an enabler for our customers to tide over the uncertainty in the last few quarters. The initial indicators suggest that most of these customers are now in a position to resume their payment with minimal impact on the overall quality of advances,” he added. Vaidyanathan said the impact of restructuring on the bank’s gross non-performing asset (NPA) numbers would be 10-20bps in any given quarter. The bank reported an increase in profits with both loans and deposits growing at a much faster rate than the banking system. “We have a share of more than 25% (of loans) on an incremental basis,” said Vaidyanathan. Emkay Research said in a report that the bank’s pool of restructured loans moderated by Rs 2,800 crore to Rs 17,500 crore (1.4%) of loans from 1.7% of loans in Q2FY22, of which nearly half of the reduction was attributed to the restructured loans slipping into NPA in Q3FY22. As a prudent strategy, the bank made an additional Rs 900-crore provisions in Q3, and now carries a contingent plus floating buffer of Rs 10,100 crore (0.8% of loans). The bank’s margins also got a boost with an increase in the share of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits. As against overall deposits, which grew 13.8%, CASA deposits grew by 24.6% with savings account deposits at Rs 4,71,029 crore and current account deposits at Rs 2,10,195 crore. Time deposits were at Rs 7,64,693 crore — an increase of 5.6% over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, resulting in CASA deposits comprising 47.1% of total deposits as of December 31, 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/most-recast-loans-on-track-hdfc-bk/articleshow/88938551.cms||---

The iodine nutrition status of the school aged children (6-12 years) has been taken as a proxy for the total population. According to the study, the prevalence of goitre is 1.8% amongst the 6-12 years age group, an indicator of long-term iodine deficiency. Nutrition International, a global nutrition organisation headquartered in Canada, extended the technical support for the survey conducted in 2020-21. According to experts, iodine is a micronutrient required in very small quantity in our daily diet, for optimal mental and physical development. In order to address iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs), the Union government launched the National Goitre Control Programme in 1962, which was later renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme in 1992. Based on the findings of the previous surveys, six districts i.e. Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna and Nellore were found to be goitre endemic. The Programme was implemented in these districts, and later extended to all the districts. As per the latest survey, Andhra Pradesh is close to winning the battle against IDDs, with the achievement of 72% coverage of adequately iodised salt in the population. This is an improvement from the 63.9% coverage reported in the India Iodine Survey 2018-19. The government has put considerable efforts in the last few years to improve the coverage of adequately iodised salt. These are: strengthening regulatory monitoring to improve availability of iodised salt and carrying out awareness generation initiatives. In addition, retailers and wholesalers are sensitised on dealing in only adequately iodised salt. The insights of the survey may be used to develop a contextual and district-specific strategy. This can include consolidating local salt farmers and traders to set up facilities to iodise and retail locally produced salt. Food safety officers can be asked to collect statutory samples from remote rural and tribal locations. The recent amendment, which banned the sale of non-iodised salt for direct human consumption, can be implemented in true letter and spirit. Of late, there has been an increased consumer preference for ‘traditional salt’ under the impression that it contains multiple micronutrients and trace minerals. This is pushing the sale of organic or rock salt. This non-iodised salt can make the population vulnerable to iodine deficiency disorders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ap-households-bettered-iodine-intake-shows-study/articleshow/88937574.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Business||Fintechs must prepare for more compliance: NPCI||MUMBAI: The chief of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has said that fintechs would need to keep aside money and management bandwidth for regulatory compliance and these requirements will keep coming up as they become part of the mainstream. “Please reserve reasonable money that you are raising for compliance aspect. The regulator always takes a long-term view on policy. When you are already into such a mainstream, the compliance requirements will be there,” said Dilip Asbe, MD & CEO of NPCI, in a fireside chat with Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, at an Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) event. Incidentally, the RBI last week had written to some fintechs, asking them to give details of the algorithms that they use in their business. The query comes days after the central bank set up an independent fintech department. This was created by carving out the earlier fintech unit from the department of payments & settlements. Asbe said that the NPCI was working towards the goal of a billion transactions a day and this required a high level of customer education and awareness and a robust law enforcement agency. In addition to this, it needed what he described as the three zeros — zero-touch, zero time, and zero cost to the consumer. “From a customer standpoint, the transaction should be instant and free. If these three come together, a billion a day is possible and should be achieved in three to five years,” said Asbe. Responding to a query from Rau on what can be done so that fintechs, which are driving digital transactions in the country, get a voice in policymaking, Asbe said that it is only the banks that are bearing the high cost of compliance. “Fintechs will start appreciating the life of a banker with compliance requirements,” he said. Explaining the need for compliance, he said that innovation has to come with responsibilities as, without trust in the system, customers will move back to cash. “The payment ecosystem has become so complex, it has 10-12 participants involved in completing a transaction in five seconds. The efforts by the regulator in terms of tokenisation and data storage are necessary,” said Asbe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fintechs-must-prepare-for-more-compliance-npci/articleshow/88938569.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Positivity rate spirals over 3,000% even as Covid tests rise 29%||BHOPAL: While tests done per day in the state have increased by 29% in past 15 days of this month, positivity rate that is inversely proportional to tests done per day has grown by 3,200% in the same period. This clearly reflects the speed of growth of infection, in normal conditions, when the number of tests done per day is increased, positivity rate—number of people tested positive per 100 samples tested—reduces, on the contrary it has increased in the state, though number of tests increased. On January 1, a total of 61,440 samples were tested and a positivity rate of 0.20% was reported. Fifteen days down the line, 7,97,667 tests were done on January 15, but positivity rate of 6.6 percent was reported. Positivity rate increased by 32 times in the same period, and is well above 5 percent—the rate when it is considered that more tests are required. Sources said that the infection is in growth phase in the state, and it is likely that more cases will be reported in the coming few days. If number of tests that are being done now, had been similar to the number of tests done during the second covid-19 peak in the state, where around 35,000-40,000 tests were done, then it was most likely that the current positivity rate would have been above 10%, added sources. However probably due to the vaccination in the state in the year, only around 2.9 percent of the total active patients in the state are hospitalized as of now, this was far more during the second peak. As on January 16, there are around 30,000 active covid-19 patients in the state and of these, only 900 are hospitalized, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/positivity-rate-spirals-over-3k-even-as-covid-tests-rise-29/articleshow/88939678.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Some of these stun batons and pistols were sponsored by actor Randeep Hooda through NGO Conservation, Lenses, and Wildlife (CLaW). Talking to TOI, CCF & field director of MTR, Jayoti Banerjee said, “On a pilot basis, we are deploying 40 noise pistols in Akot wildlife division, and both stun batons and pistols in Tipeshwar, where there is high tiger density. Based on the feedback, we will introduce them elsewhere by seeking funds under the annual plan of operation for tiger reserves.” Randeep Hooda told TOI, “The frontline staff is protecting the last frontiers of our natural heritage. These are also borders under constant threat, being protected by constant vigil. The wildlife and habitat are very precious but so are the lives guarding them. The forest staff at times can need protection from wild animals they are protecting. I hope these trials yield fruitful results allowing these rangers to safeguard themselves better in the line of duty.” CLaW co-founder Sarosh Lodhi said, “Bollywood actor and staunch wildlife supporter Randeep Hooda has long been advocating benefits to ‘green soldiers’. On initial demand from MTR, we approached him and he immediately released money to procure 10 stun batons and 5 pistols for Melghat on a pilot basis.” Banerjee said after Dhumne’s death, there were instructions from PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye also to go in for new methods and techniques to make foot patrolling safe for forest guards, labourers, and other personnel. The stun baton is easily charged with a C-type charger that provides sufficient charge for 30 days. It is a waterproof stick with an aluminium body and weighs 800 grams, making it easy to carry during patrols. It has emergency flashers and delivers an electric charge to scare away animals. Akot deputy conservator (DyCF) Navalkishore Reddy said, “We have issued 40 noise pistols to field staff in Akot on January 1. More than tigers and leopards, the staff is vulnerable to sloth bear attacks, and hence noise guns will be effective. Stun guns will be deployed in Tipeshwar.” Reddy added, “Though we are not averse to using stun batons, we are giving first preference to ‘Ghungru Kathi’ (metallic bells fixed to a stick). The labourers engaged in protection are comfortable with it. It is also cost-effective and scares away animals.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/randeep-hooda-funds-stun-batons-noise-pistols-for-melghat-reserve-staff/articleshow/88938681.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Nagrik Upbhokta Manch president Dr P G Najpande and Rajat Bhargava had filed a PIL challenging the legality of the notification on the ground that the President of India had declared Jabalpur bench of MP high court as the "principal bench" of MP high court in 1956. However, the registrar general of the high court through a notification issued on October 8, 2021, deleted the prefix while referring to amendments in high court rules introduced in 2008.The petitioners contended that the high court administration doesn't have powers to change the nomenclature decided by the President of India. Therefore, the notification issued to this effect is illegal and ultra vires. In the affidavit presented on behalf of the registrar general, it was pointed out that the prefix " principal seat" has only been deleted in the matters of affidavit, appeal, petition and application. The prefix continues to be in use for all other purposes. Therefore, the 2021 notification was not against the 1956 notification issued by the President of India. "Principal seat" is not used for any of the benches of the high courts of other states either. After arguments from both sides, the division bench of chief justice R V Malimath and Justice Purusendra Kaurav stayed the operation of 2021 notification till further order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/principal-seat-case-hc-stays-notification/articleshow/88939693.cms||---

The order issued by the general administration department states that the government is committed to reduce the maternal mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and malnutrition in the state. Presently maternal mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, infant mortality rate in the state is more than the national average. In order to reduce it, there is a need for an effective strategy for which the task force has been constituted. It would be headed by b Professor Shamika Ravi, former member of PM's economic advisory council, and includes additional chief secretary of MP public health and family welfare department, additional chief secretary of MP women and child development department and two specialists nominated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Good Governance and Policy Analysis.The task force would coordinate with the MP state policy & planning commission and meeting of the task force would be held once in a month or as required, the order states, adding that the task force would give its report on intervention and reduction of maternal mortality rate, neo natal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and malnutrition by June 30, 2022.On December 27, 2021, government think tank NITI Aayog released the fourth edition of its health index for 2019-20, ranking states on the basis of overall health performance. Madhya Pradesh was ranked 17th in terms of overall health performance among large states, while Kerala topped the list. Only Odisha, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were below Madhya Pradesh. Officials said a lot is required to be done to improve the health infrastructure in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/taskforce-to-boost-states-health-index/articleshow/88939701.cms||---

On January 10, around 495 patients were in hospital, and on January 16, the count had risen to 900. In sheer numbers, the rise is rapid but when compared with how fast Covid cases are multiplying, hospital numbers seem well in check. During this period, active cases shot up from 8,599 to 30,109. While active patients nearly tripled in seven days, hospitalizations have doubled. While hospital occupancy is low so far, the number of beds has increased significantly since the second wave. There were around 16,000 oxygen and HDU/ICU beds in April last year, 32% of which were occupied till the first few days of April. Now, there are 35,000 oxygen and HDU/ICU beds, only 1.2 % of which are occupied, said sources. Less hospitalization could be attributed to vaccination as 5.07 crore of the adult population in the state is fully vaccinated. This is 92.5% of the estimated 18-plus population of 5.48 crore. If Covid precautions are strictly followed and the remaining vaccination completed in quick time, hospitalization numbers can be kept low in this wave, say health officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/less-than-3-covid-patients-in-hosp-in-mp/articleshow/88939702.cms||Amarjeet Singh

While states like Gujarat and Delhi have enacted a separate statute/law banning the production, storage, sale or use of Chinese manjha, in Madhya Pradesh, some district collectors had notified a ban on use of Chinese manjha ahead of Makar Sankranti, giving an indication that there is no blanket ban on sale and use of Chinese manjha in the state. According to Khalid, a member of Bhopal Birds’ Conservation Society, district collectors of Indore, Ratlam, Mandsaur and Ujjain had notified a temporary ban ahead of Makar Sankranti on sale/use of Chinese manjha. “Since the incidents of birds getting killed or injured by Chinese manjha are not many in Bhopal. We didn’t pursue the matter or took up the issue for public awareness. But, as far as I know there is no law in MP imposing a state-wide ban on use of Chinese manjha. Some district collectors had notified a ban ahead of Makar Sankranti, when kite flying is done as a ritual by the people. Otherwise, kite flying is not so much in vogue in MP as some other states like Gujarat. District collectors of Indore, Ratlam, Mandsaur and Ujjain, where the tragic incident took place, had notified the ban separately ahead of Makar Sankranti", said Khalid. The ban was imposed by Mandsaur collector through a notification on December 21, 2021, under section 144 of the CrPC and any violation of the ban was punishable under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience of any order duly promulgated by a public servant), much in the same way as Covid restrictions are imposed by district collectors in the state and persons violating them are penalised. In fact, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the production, storage, sale and use of Chinese manjha or glass-coated synthetic or nylon manjha in 2016 following incidents of birds and some people getting killed or injured by them. In 2017, it asked the state governments to enact the law to implement the ban. Additional collector, Bhopal, Dileep Yadav, when asked whether there is a ban on sale/use of Chinese manjha in the state and of course Bhopal, and if yes, why district collector of some other districts had to ban it ahead of Makar Sankranti through a separate notification said, "The NGT had banned the sale/use of glass-coated manjha and we follow the NGT order. We had not notified a ban at the district level." District collector, Bhopal, Avinash Lavania, said "There is a ban on sale/use of Chinese manjha under section 5 of the Environment Protection Act. We take action in the matter under this law. Collectors of some other districts you are referring to may have separately banned it because kite flying on Makar Sankranti is more in practice there. We had not done it and now Makar Sankranti is over, so there is no need to do it in any case." Ban or no ban, vendors and shopkeepers who take to selling kites ahead of Makar Sankranti keep the glass-coated nylon or synthetic manjha (not necessarily made in China) for sale and hardly ever, there has been a raid or action against them. Besides, advertisements can be seen on the Internet by online trading companies offering to provide Chinese Manjha at your home. A police official, when asked whether sale of Chinese manjha is banned in MP, said "Yes" but when asked whether there has been any action or raid on kite sellers for sale of glass-coated synthetic manjha, he said, “I don't think there has been any major action in this regard.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/chinese-manjha-kills-but-mp-doesnt-have-law-to-ban-it/articleshow/88939704.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Section 24 (1) deals with notice and attachment of properties involved in benami transactions. Provisional attachment was done under Section 24 (3) of the Act. Tripathi allegedly owns a resort and farm land among other seven properties. These properties were found to be disproportionate to his known sources of income, said an officer. Inventory includes ‘Baghira Retreat Resort’ near Pench Tiger Reserve, a flat at Bhopal, shop and a house in Jabalpur along with 5 acres of agricultural land at Lakhnadon-Seoni highway.All investments were made in the name of his wife.

These 38 people have no travel exposure and have not come into contacts with any expatriates. “This is a clear case of community spread that has occurred in the state. These 51 cases had come to the hospital in the last one week. About 76% among them have been tested positive for Omicron,” said Dr Anoop Kumar A S, critical care expert who conducted the test. “As per the CDC guidelines, Omicron can be tested through SGTF (s-gene target failure) or SGMA (s-gene mutation amplification). We conducted the tests through SGTF and it has been tested positive which is a confirmatory result. We have also decided to send all these 38 samples for genome sequencing also to re-confirm,” said Dr Anoop Kumar. He said that in the coming days also it has been decided to conduct such tests on more samples. “It is evident that the rapid spread occurring in the state is Omicron. The state government should start testing the samples at least from the clusters for Omicron. Definitely such cases from the community can be identified. There is no point testing the expatriates and their contacts alone for Omicron,” said Dr Anoop Kumar. “World over Omicron is not being detected through genome sequencing alone. In African countries, the cases reported through SGTF testing. The state government soon begin start testing in each district. The same machine used for RT-PCR can be used for this testing but with a different testing kit. At least one such testing centre should be there in each district to find out the spread,” said Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert. With the pace at which the cases are increasing, it is sure that the Omicron has spread in the community. In the coming days the cases are going to double, said Dr Arun. However, the state government is still not ready to accept that a community spread has occurred in the state. Health minister Veena George had said the other day Omicron has been so far reported only among the people who have come from foreign countries or among the people who have come into contacts with them. If we are not testing the people in the community for Omicron how will we know whether it has spread in the community, the experts ask.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/experts-warn-of-community-spread/articleshow/88939712.cms||---

In the last Covid review meeting, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had asked the health and education departments to make necessary arrangements to conduct vaccination camps for children between the age group of 15-17 years in the schools itself. This was decided to prevent children from getting exposed to other people while coming to vaccination centres in the hospitals. Schools will be identified by the respective district task forces of the education department. It has been decided to make schools having at least 500 beneficiaries as vaccination centres. Like the vaccination centres in the hospitals, schools too should have a waiting area, vaccination room, observation room and resting area for the students. Schools where vaccination centres are being set up will be linked with the nearest government healthcare centre. Schools should prepare the list of children who are to be vaccinated at the centres and prior timing should be fixed for each student. This should be informed to children well in advance to prevent gathering inside schools. The health department will provide the vaccination team, and the schools should provide the support staff. Children should be kept in the observation room for 30 minutes after vaccination. If any health issues develop, the vaccination team should immediately inform the nearest health centre. All vaccination centres in schools will have an ambulance attached with an oxygen facility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/vaccination-in-schools-from-jan-19/articleshow/88939713.cms||---

She will be accompanied by the tribal development officer as well as senior officers from the excise department. Speaking to TOI, the rural SP said the purpose of her visit was to meet the people, including the families of the deceased, and gather more information about the issue. Though a decision was taken to conduct a mass event in which people could raise their concerns and complaints before the SP, the event was cancelled in the wake of rising Covid cases. The issue pertains to the five alleged suicides by young girls, most of them aged under 18, under Palode and Vithura police station limits over the past two months. In four cases, police found that the victims were sexually exploited. Excise department officers decided to address the matter after parents of a victim alleged that drug and liquor mafia had also played a role in their daughter’s suicide. They alleged that her boyfriend, who turned out to be a ganja peddler, had forced her to consume narcotic substances. A day ago, minister for health, women and child development Veena George too intervened in the issue and directed the principal secretary of women and child development department to conduct an enquiry and submit a report at the earliest. Palode station house officer inspector CK Manoj said three suicides were reported under his station limits in the past two months.  “Even before these deaths were reported, we had launched a series of awareness camps in tribal settlements regarding the safe use of technologies such as smartphones and social media, ever since children started using phones to attend online classes. Such programmes are still being conducted without fail,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/rural-sp-to-visit-tribal-settlements-today/articleshow/88939714.cms||---

According to police, a 14-year-old girl residing under Kovalam police station limits was the victim of their previous crime. During the interrogation, the duo admitted to grievously hurting the girl, which eventually led to her death a day later. Vizhinjam station house officer inspector Prajeesh Sasi said that the duo revealed about the attack when the police asked questions regarding the incident during the interrogation. ‘’Some of their neighbours told our officers during the preliminary inquiry about overhearing the mother and son loudly arguing about destroying a girl’s life during one of their quarrels. Hence we asked about it and they divulged more details,” the inspector said. The victim was a 14-year-old girl with some degree of learning disabilities and other physical ailments. Rafeeqa’s son Shafeeq was in a relationship with that girl. He started spending more time with her, neglecting his job. This led to a quarrel between the mother and son and also affected the relationship between Shafeeq and the girl too. On January 13, 2021, Rafeeqa and Shafeeq visited the girl at her home and broke into a quarrel. The duo allegedly smashed the girl’s head against the wall thrice and left the house. ‘’The next day, the girl was hospitalised owing to severe headache. She died on the same day. The cause of death was revealed to be internal haemorrhage and hence the police recorded the death as a case of unnatural death,’’ the inspector said. He added that the Kovalam police have been informed about the latest development. They would be filing a report before the court to alter charges in the FIR soon, he said. Meanwhile on Sunday, the three accused were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/probe-brings-another-murder-case-to-light/articleshow/88939715.cms||---

The cumulative dues from these defaulters have been estimated at Rs 44 crore. In the past two months, the corporation managed to collect around Rs 17 crore following the updation of tax database in all the wards.The revenue wing has issued the first round of demand notice to all the defaulters with dues above Rs 1 lakh. An amount of Rs 3 crore has so far been received by the corporation from some of the defaulters. The revenue officials said the collection of dues is expected to increase in the next two months and a major chunk of dues would be cleared by March.This has been made possible mainly by the efforts of zonal offices to update and publish the actual tax dues. Earlier, people were reluctant to make use of online system since it would reflect dues from the previous fiscals although it would have been paid. Once the data base was updated, only the actual dues of respective fiscals were reflected on the accounts and many residents opted for online payment which also enabled them to generate receipts online and store it in digital format.Corporation officials said that the total collection of property tax through online payments has increased significantly which also resulted in a peak in collection for the fiscal 2020-21. With Covid lockdown affecting direct payment of property tax in 2020-21, online payment has increased especially after the city corporation published the updated data base and actual dues for each ward.In 2020-21, the total demand of the city corporation in property tax was Rs 96.8 crore and it was able to collect Rs 75.8 crores which is the highest collection of property tax since 2016-17. The corporation has not crossed Rs 70 crore in collection in the past five fiscals.The signs of significant hike in online payment of tax were evident from November 2021. The month had recorded a collection of Rs 9.75 crore, which is more than double the amount corporation had collected in the same month in 2020. The huge inflow of tax was recorded in a month when there was no field-level collection since all the officials were occupied with tax data updation. In December, an amount of Rs 7 crore was received.The corporation officials said that with actual dues being clearly reflected on the official website of city corporation for each ward, many people made optimum use of online payment.A good percentage of tax payments in previous two months happened via online. The revenue officials are now hoping for a record collection in 2021-22. Usually, the collection picks up in February and March; however this year, there has been significant inflow since November and in the next three months if the collection exceeds Rs 40 crore, the corporation could record nearly 90% of actual demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-identifies-700-defaulters-owing-tax-dues-above-1l/articleshow/88939717.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Our research has shown that Cyclophilin A plays a major role in increasing the risk,” said Dr Surya Ramachandran, a programme scientist with the cardiovascular diseases and diabetes biology lab, RGCB. The findings of the research were recently published in Cells, an international journal of cell biology. Heart attacks result from rupture of cholesterol plaque deposited on walls of arteries. A tear or rupture in the plaque would activate a repairing mechanism resulting in a blood clot. Such clots can completely block blood flow to the heart muscle and cause a heart attack. Inhibitors of Cyclophilin A would have potential use in reducing the vulnerability to heart attacks due to plaque rupture. It is also being developed as a clinical serological marker of detecting vascular inflammation in patients with diabetes, she said. RGCB director Chandrabhas Narayana said the research findings with regard to the role played by Cyclophilin will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases. It will help in risk detection and development of novel pharmacological therapies. “The protein Cyclophilin A impairs the process of prompt and efficient clearance of cells that have been programmed to die, resulting in rapid progression of plaque formation in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus,” said Dr Ramachandran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/study-on-protein-sheds-light-on-heart-disease-risk/articleshow/88939718.cms||---

The authorities believe the bridge would resolve the traffic disruption along the bund road during monsoon. The estimated cost of the work is Rs 23 crores which will be funded by KIIFB.As per the bid document, the project envisages the construction of a bridge across Vellayani lake connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola areas of Kovalam constituency in the district. At present there is an earthen bund road connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola across the lake. It has been found that the bund road is being settled over a long period. During monsoon season, lake water flows across the earthen bund road causing a flood like situation which interrupts the regular traffic and creates difficulties in commuting of local people. Due to the continuous passage of heavy vehicles, it is susceptible to further settlement which may topple the road eventually. Therefore, the construction of a bridge is very much necessary at this location, the document says.The government had accorded administrative sanction for an amount of Rs 25crores for the construction of Vellayani bridge in 2017. Accordingly the detailed survey and soil investigation works had been carried out and the tentative design drawing was obtained from the design wing of the PWD. Based on this the DPR for the bridge work had been prepared and submitted to the KIIFB and financial sanction was accorded.For the execution of the bridge work, the existing utilities of KWA, KSEB and BSNL passing through the alignment of the bridge will be shifted. In the DPR submitted to KIIFB for financial sanction, the provision for shifting the utilities of KWA, KSEB and BSNL had also been incorporated based on the estimates received from the respective departments. A pumping main station of KWA is also located near the existing bund road adjacent to the bridge alignment from where the water of Vellayani lake is pumped and carried to the nearby treatment plant and the treated water is carried back to different destinations through the pipe lines passing through the existing bund road connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola.For the construction of the new bridge, these pumping mainlines of KWA also need to be shifted. KWA has submitted an estimate for temporary shifting of these pipe lines for the commencement of the bridge work and for relaying the pipe through separate structure provided as per the requirement from KWA. A service road is also provided for accessing the pump house. Provision is given for relaying the 300mm DI pumping main line pipes by supporting an additional steel structure outside the bridge alignment by supporting on the extension of the pile cap of the new bridge. The construction of the bridge is expected to be completed in 18 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tenders-called-for-constructing-bridge-across-vellayani-lake/articleshow/88939721.cms||---

The advertisement has been issued by the Gujarat Tribal Development Corporation (GTDC).State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said on Sunday that the government should have used the phrase ‘tribal citizens’. The advertisement was published on Sunday and listed various schemes available to the Scheduled Tribe communities.“It is insulting to the tribal population when they are addressed as ‘isamo’. Instead, the word ‘citizens’ should have been used,” Doshi said. “Action should be taken against the persons who used the word and the government must apologize to the tribal population.”The Congress leader alleged that the rights of the tribal population are being denied under the BJP regime and this advertisement reflects the anti-tribal mindset of the government. “An attempt is being made by this government to destroy the traditions and practices of the tribal community,” he alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/insulting-word-for-tribals-in-govt-ad-cong/articleshow/88939727.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Loan app transfers your secrets to crooks||AHMEDABAD: Cybercrooks have added blackmail to their arsenal: their loan-giving apps also extract personal and potentially embarrassing information, which is then used as leverage to extort money from the targets. Even some cops have been bullied with this tactic. One of the victims is a share broker from Nikol who had searched for the instant loan facility online. The broker, Ajit Gohil, found a few apps and downloaded one and availed of a loan of Rs 10,000 on November 16, 2021. Gohil had paid back about Rs 17,000 though a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) platform for the Rs 10,000 he had borrowed. Meanwhile, he found that three other apps had been downloaded in his phone without his knowledge. Through one of those apps, he got about Rs 15,000 without asking for it. Later, he began receiving calls from recovery agents who forced him to pay Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 each day and threatened to post his nude pictures online if he did not give in to their demands. Even though he ended up paying Rs 5 lakh to them, he continued facing relentless pressure. The extortionists began sending Gohil his nude pictures and said the photographs will soon be viral if he dared to disregard their demands. Gohil eventually approached police on January 8 and filed a complaint under the IT Act. During the investigation, it emerged that the extortionists gain access to a device of the target when the loan app is downloaded. The loan is given only when a person grants full access to the device. Several people have suffered like Gohil has. A 32-year-old businessman from the Odhav GIDC had also downloaded an app to take a loan. He later found that other apps had been installed in his phone. His account showed a deposit of Rs 40,000. Later, the cybercrooks demanded Rs 10,000 per day as repayment and when the businessman refused to pay, they threatened to make his morphed nude pictures viral. He took police’s help to get rid of the threat. Sources in the city police said that two kinds of people are the most vulnerable. “First, those who are really in need; and second, those who seek money to live the high life,” a police officer said. “The cybercrooks check the targets’ phones while processing the loan application. The crooks frame their demands based on the profile of the targets.” In many cases, people hesitate to go to police and the cybercrooks take advantage of the situation, said a police officer. The officer said that people should immediately approach police to tackle the cybercrooks or they will end up losing everything.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/loan-app-transfers-your-secrets-to-crooks/articleshow/88939729.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Man gets fraudsters to return Rs 10,000||AHMEDABAD: In an interesting case of ‘revenge con’, cybercrooks who cheated an activist out of Rs 10,000 were left begging for his mercy after the latter approached cops and got their bank account frozen. They also returned the money they had tricked him into paying after promising him a loan of Rs 1 lakh. Kaleem Siddiqui, a resident of Bapunagar, who led an agitation against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC (National Register of Citizens) was approached by a person posing as the representative of a financial firm on December 24, 2020 with a loan offer. After many rounds of negotiations with various representatives, Sidiqqui signed up for a loan of Rs 1 lakh against an insurance policy for which he was required to pay Rs 10,000 as EMI. On January 2, he received an email from the firm, informing him that the loan had been sanctioned. Siddiqui even paid Rs 10,000 as the first monthly instalment to the firm through real-time gross settlement (RTGS) transfer system. The next day, another representative called him up, saying the loan amount had been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.17 lakh for which he would have to pay an additional Rs 8,300. The person offered no clarification to Siddiqui and told him that only bankers would understand the nitty-gritty of such a loan system. Realizing he was being conned, he reported the fraud to the city police on January 5. Acting on Siddiqui’s application, they froze the firm’s account that was being operated from the Pune branch of a private bank. When the finance firm representatives learnt about an inquiry against them, they approached Siddiqui on January 7. “They asked me if I had filed a complaint. I told them that my relative working with the bank had frozen their account. They began pleading with me, asking for the complaint to be withdrawn. They promised to return Rs 5,000 to me if I did not initiate legal action,” said Siddiqui. After the crooks returned him Rs 5,000, Siddiqui assured them he would ask his relative to unfreeze their account if they returned the remaining Rs 5,000. They did as asked to and deposited Rs 5,000 into Siddiqui’s account on January 9. “They returned my entire money and approached again, asking me to unfreeze their account. But this time, I told them that I had filed a complaint with the cybercrime cops against them,” said Siddiqui. “They accused me of betraying their trust and I told them that they were the ones betraying others. Realizing I was not going to relent, they began pleading for mercy,” he added. Police officials said that such cybercrooks can only be nailed if the fraud victims approach the cops without delay.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/revenge-con-man-gets-fraudsters-to-return-10k/articleshow/88939730.cms||Ashish Chauhan

According to the figures provided by the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), the Covid-19 years have seen more people taking their lives than in the previous years. As many as 132 people committed suicide by jumping into the Sabarmati in 2021 – this was the highest number of accidental deaths recorded in the river in the past four years. The AFES personnel got 178 emergency calls following suicide attempts in the Sabarmati in 2021. The AFES personnel rescued 46 persons while 132 lost their lives. In 2020, the AFES had received 142 rescue calls; they could save only 23 men and six women. There were 113 persons including 98 men, 14 women and one infant whose bodies were fished out from the river. Excluding the infant, the 112 persons had allegedly committed suicide according to the police. Sources in the AFES said they had found 14 bodies during the nationwide lockdown between March 25 and June 1, 2020 – it is yet not known if these were suicides. “On March 25, 2020 the AFES personnel found the bodies of three men and one woman. Similarly, they had found three and eight bodies in April and May respectively. These cases are still unsolved,” said a source in the city police. Similarly, in 2019, the AFES got as many as 109 calls and could rescue only 20 persons. Bodies of 89 people were recovered by the personnel. Sources in the AFES and the city police said the primary reason behind the increasing suicides were financial hardships followed by domestic disputes. “If we look at the suicide figures, there were more male victims who had the responsibility of earning a livelihood to sustain their families. The pandemic-induced lockdowns and curfews resulted in financial problems for them, forcing many to resort to the extreme step,” said an officer with the city police. “Besides, the pandemic also saw a spike in cases of mental health issues and many in need of treatment and care ended their lives,” said another police officer from Sabarmati riverfront (west) which covers the most part of the river. Along with that, there were increase in cases of domestic disputes that also spurred suicides, said an AFES official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/covid-years-see-more-suicides-in-sabarmati/articleshow/88939735.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Once the dip sets in, there would be no significant change in the night temperature thereafter for next few days.The night temperature in most weather stations of the state have recorded higher temperature than normal under the influence of recent inducted western disturbance that caused fairly widespread rainfall in the later part of the previous week.Ranchi recorded 12.2 degrees minimum temperature during the past 24 hours which was 2.6 degrees notches above normal but during the day dense cloud cover, which was preceded by rainfall activity brought down the mercury 6.7 degrees below normal to record 17 degrees Celsius as the maximum temperature. “The feel temperature is what is experienced during the day because people are out of blankets or cosy comfort of home. If the night temperature is even below 4 degrees but the day temperature is above 20 degrees, people do not feel much discomfort,” said one of the officials at IMD saying that the day temperature would increase slightly making it comfortable.Almost all weather stations recorded higher night and lower day temperatures on Sunday. Jamshedpur with 13.3 degrees minimum was 1.9 notches above normal and 22.8 degrees maximum was 3.8 notches below normal. Similarly, Daltonganj at 11.4 degrees minimum was 4 notches above normal, while the day temperature at 22.2 was 3.2 notches below normal.The IMD bulletin said that there was no significant synoptic system prevailing over the state. “Though a fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region from January 18,” the bulletin read.The relative humidity levels in Ranchi ranged between 82% and 94% resulting in early morning fog. Similar condition is likely to prevail during the next two days in isolated parts of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/brace-for-further-chilly-nights-as-met-predicts-dip-in-min-temp-in-next-48-hrs/articleshow/88939740.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The project is at least four-decade-old.“Not a single stone or brick has been added to it in all these three years,” said Pratap Tirkey who with many others had steered a campaign for Kutku Doob Chhetra demanding proper rehabilitation package for more than half a dozen villages who would face displacement due to this project.He added that in September, 2021, a high-level central team had visited the site to take stock of the progress and also assured reasonable rehabilitation package in the event of displacement once this dam gets operational. Tirkey said there is no word since then either.“There is no opposition to this dam from any stakeholder and all that people want here is proper resettlement and rehabilitation,” he stressed. He said the delay is only on the part of the government which is procrastinating the issue of the dam but accusing local tribals for the delay in this project.He rued that the district administrations of Latehar and Garhwa also refrain from launching any development schemes in more than half dozen villages as it fall in the earmarked area of the dam catchment which will get submerged. “But with no work on dam, local villagers are also deprived of the benefits of development of government schemes in their region with no plans being launched for the uplift of the area,” he said.Deputy director of north division of Palamu Tiger Reserve, Kumar Ashish also said as this dam falls under the reserve area, they too are concerned about it but since September last but there is no progress or development in regard to the dam.Four sluice gates are to be installed in the dam whose full reservoir level called FRL has been brought down to 341 meters.On the other hand, assistant engineer water resources department here in Daltonganj, Sudhanshu Suman said, “People of the Doob Chhetra (submergence area) insist on getting rehabilitation first and thus not allowing the start of the work on this dam."He refused to elaborate further saying twice that people of Doob Chhetra are objecting to any initiative of work on this dam.Kumar Ashish said PTR is a major stakeholder but has no clue so far as to how and when work on the dam will start.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/three-years-on-mandal-dam-project-makes-no-headway/articleshow/88939741.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Jamtara MLA loses cool as BJP man demands roads like 'bhauji's cheeks'||RANCHI: Sample this conversation: Caller: Irfan Bhaiya namaskar, Jai Shri Ram, bhaiya, how are you? Irfan Ansari: Jai Shri Ram, I am good. Caller: Bhaiya, you made everyone happy by promising that you will make roads smoother than actor Kangana Ranaut’s cheeks. Irfan Ansari: Laughs aloud... Caller: But you know something, bhaiya? If you make the roads smoother than Bhauji’s (sister-in-law) cheeks, it would have been way better. Irfan Ansari: Who’s Bhauji? Caller: Means ... (hesitates a bit) ...your madam, our Bhauji... Irfan Ansari: Ok, ok, will make, Jai Shri Ram. (Cuts the call) After realising what the caller was trying to mean, the MLA dialled back the number and heaped abuses, threats and insults for “disrespecting” his wife, until it dawned upon him that this call, too, was being recorded. Interestingly, two days after Ansari landed in a controversy for a sexist remark on Ranaut, he finds himself in another one on Sunday for two reasons — that he could not digest any comment passed on his wife, notwithstanding the similar act that he had done, and that he can go to any lengths, including issuing of threats, to those who did it. The caller, who identified himself as Mahavir Singh and functionary of BJP from Ranchi, uploaded both the conversations on his Facebook page, criticising Congress, Ansari and commented that he who feels uneasy for the “disrespect” shown to his mother, sister or sisters-in-law should first think several times before disrespecting other women. In a self-made video two days ago, the Congress MLA had announced the sanctioning of 14 new road projects in his constituency while accusing the previous BJP government of doing nothing to improve the road conditions in Jamtara. He also added “insult” with a remark that the proposed roads will be smoother than the cheeks of Ranaut. Later, he profusely reiterated that he meant no disrespect to anyone, including Ranaut. Congress immediately distanced itself from Ansari’s comments, terming them as “distasteful” and stressed that the party always stands for women empowerment. The grand old party also cited how it has decided to field 40% women candidates in the ensuing Utter Pradesh election to drive home its point. While Ansari didn’t take calls from TOI for his comments on the development, Singh responded by saying that someone had to show the MLA the mirror, who often speaks “callously and irresponsibly” to hog the media limelight. Singh, who said he is BJP’s Jamtara district in-charge, added, “Top Congress leaders often talk about women empowerment but it should be shameful for having such an MLA and lower-rung leaders that keep on criticising women. He (Ansari) laughs aloud while talking about other women but was furious when the turn of his own family comes. My whole intention of calling him is to show him the mirror and expose him in public.” Watch Kangana Ranaut vs Bhauji's cheeks: Jamtara MLA gets a taste of his own medicine||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jamtara-mla-threatens-bjp-man/articleshow/88939742.cms||ASRP Mukesh

For outdoor gatherings, assembly of more than 100 people is forbidden. "St Paul's Cathedral, Ranchi, has not been shut down. Though the entry gates have been locked, the church continues to remain open for its faithful through live streaming services from various social platforms. Live streaming services have been necessitated to ensure compliance of state Covid guidelines,” said Vikla Bakhlaa, the general secretary of the Church of North India, Chotanagpur diocese.St Paul's Cathedral has a normal seating capacity of 500. On Sundays, shamianas are put up to accommodate the crowd. Against this backdrop, restricting the maximum number at 100, was proving quite difficult. So the church authorities decided to temporarily suspend in person church services till January 15 and on extension of partial lockdown, continued with their decision as well.All other religious rituals and marriage services would continue as usual, abiding with all Covid SOPs. Other churches under the CNI, Chotanagpur diocese, where the physical attendance during church services is not that overwhelming, are, however, open for all church services, including Sunday masses."We shall review the situation again on February 1," the CNI Chotanagpur diocese general secretary, said. Other churches under the Gossner Evangelical Luthera Church as well as the Catholic Church, continue to remain open for all services.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/st-pauls-cathedral-continues-to-suspend-church-services/articleshow/88939744.cms||Tapas Biswas

The reports of Omicron positive cases arrived only on Saturday from the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneshwar where the samples were sent for genome sequencing. The state health department’s Covid-19 bulletin said the total number of fatalities stood at 5,143 on December 30. Between December 30 and January 15, the number of deaths rose to 5,199, which means that on average at least three persons died during that period. Most of the deaths were reported from East Singbhum (23), followed by Ranchi (nine), Bokaro (seven), Seraikela-Kharsawan (four), Hazaribag (three), Koderma (two) and one each in Dhanbad and Godda. Officials said most of the victims were above 60 years or above who were vaccinated but with multiple co-morbidities. While the number of hospitalizations has been low during the ongoing third wave of the pandemic, though the number of cases is rising rapidly — the daily casualties is emerging as a concern for the health department as they are not exactly sure whether the recent deaths were due to Omicron or the Delta variant. On Saturday, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh had said that out of the 87 samples sent to ILS from Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) for genome sequencing, 14 were confirmed for the Omicron variant while one was found infected with the Delta variant and 32 samples were other Variants of Concern (VOC) of the SarCov-2 virus. The 32 samples tested for the presence of VoC are of mixed nature and were not categorized separately, Singh added. While commenting on the Covid deaths, Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, the head of the trauma centre at Rims, said, “We could probably say that those who died of Covid in the past few weeks were infected with Omicron but no one can say this with a guarantee at the moment unless each case is studied. At the same time, it is difficult to say that the deaths were solely due to Covid as a majority of the deaths are of people who had severe comorbid conditions.” He added, “Most of the deaths that took place at the trauma centre amid the ongoing third wave were due to heart attacks, acute pneumonia and kidney ailments, among other complications. Later on, they were also found to be Covid positive. The situation during the second wave was different where deaths were purely due to Covid as there were many instances where a healthy person turned severe overnight, leading to his/her death. We are not in that situation at the moment, fortunately and practically speaking, such fatalities are difficult to contain on any given day.” An official at the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme cell said that they are evaluating the deaths to analyse the cause. The official added, “The underlying reason behind the deaths is that often the non-Covid patients, who have serious co-morbidities that require check-up at regular intervals, are not coming to the hospital for their routine check-up for fear of contracting the virus and later on when their condition worsens, they get themselves hospitalised but by then, it is already too late and the situation has gone out of hand.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/medical-experts-concerned-over-daily-fatalities-in-state/articleshow/88949275.cms||ASRP Mukesh

He had threatened to kill her to stop her from filing a complaint,” Suman Tiwari, the investigating officer, told TOI. The survivor is the third wife of the prime accused, who has two children from his previous marriages, said Tiwari. He is 45 and she is 32, and they met on a matrimonial website in 2019. The woman has told police that she hails from another state and came to Indore after marrying the accused on October 24, 2019. They lived in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Indore, where, she says, her husband began forcing her into unnatural sex and then with another man. She told police that her husband burnt her with cigarettes and repeatedly assaulted her. She alleges that her husband confined her in a room for a month where he and the other man gang-raped her multiple times. Then, her husband called three of his friends to the farmhouse and all of them gang-raped her for months, took videos of the sexual torture and used the footage to force her to stay silent, she says in her complaint. The five threatened to post the gang rape videos on social media if she went to police, she says. Around three months ago, she could get out of the house and went back to her parents in her home state. She claims her husband continued to issue death threats to keep her quiet and even sent one of his friends over to keep a watch on her. According to the complaint, he threatened to kill her parents as well. After mustering courage to fight back, she returned to Indore on Saturday and filed a complaint with Kshipra police. Police have arrested all five suspects, including one from Bemetara in Chhattisgarh. Tiwari said they are investigating all angles. A case under IPC sections 376, 377, and 323 and Arms Act has been registered against the five suspects.

The state government will bear 75 per cent of the total expenses and the rest 25 per cent will be contributed by the MPIDC.Apart from six industrial belts of Indore, Naugaon and Sidhgawan industrial belts in Sagar district and IGC Maneri in Mandla district will also go under development to improve infrastructure. Rohan Saxena, executive director MPIDC, Indore said, “We are upgrading infrastructure at six industrial belts in Indore region. This will immensely help in improving the existing sets ups in these belts. Developed infrastructure will encourage industries to go for expansion and also lure fresh investments from new players.” Industries associations were long demanding to upgrade the old industrial belts of Indore region lacking basic facilities. Gautam Kothari, president, Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan said, “Upgradation work in many industrial belts were long pending and this was disturbing operations in industries. As the government is now upgrading several industrial belts this will boost industries and help in getting new investments.” Industry players said lack of proper infrastructure was hindering movement of goods, causing damage to the final products due to poor road conditions. Kothari said, “Special Economic Zone is an export-oriented belt and we need to have facilities matching international standards. The development work will aid industries to operate from well advanced belts.” Industry players said regular maintenance of industrial belts is mandatory for all industrial belts to boost economic activities.

The successful relocation of the armoury was rightly dubbed a feat in engineering. Now, with the expansion of the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, which is being upgraded into a ten-lane road posing a threat to two temples, both of which are believed to be over 500 years old, the authorities concerned have decided to shift these shrines elsewhere. The Gadde Ranganatha Swamy in Srirangapatna dates back to the days when the region was under the dominion of the Vijayanagara kings. Although not a popular tourist attraction, the 12 stone pillars holding this structure together, coupled with the unmistakable vestiges of the centuries gone by attest to its antiquity. The other shrine that is proving an obstacle to what will be the widened highway is the Mukhyaprana Anjaneya temple in Kalastavadi in Mysuru district, the construction of which is attributed to Sage Vyasatitha. Admitting that the issue was sensitive, officials of the National Highways’ Authority of India (NHAI) said that the relocation of the Gadde Ranganathaswamy temple was nearly complete, while work on relocation of the temple at Kalastavadi would commence soon. Locals, meanwhile, remain concerned about the fate of these historical shrines. Pratap Simha said that four guntas, to be purchased from a Kalastavadi resident, would serve as the new site of the Mukhrayappa Anjaneya temple. “Meanwhile, we have already identified ‘B’ kharab land, where the Gadde Ranganathaswamy temple will be shifted to. This site is also on the banks of the river. Currently, we have built a small shrine for the idol,” the MP said. Priest at the Mukhrayappa Anjaneya temple Sudarshan Datta pointed out that its west-facing entrance made the shrine a unique structure. “We have not been informed about any alternative site for the temple. It may not be possible to ensure that its entrance will face the west at this new location. The temple attracts a large number of devotees, and may lose its charm if it is shifted. We are confident that the temple will remain in its original location, and the authorities will effect a diversion for the highway,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/historic-temples-along-expanded-mysuru-bluru-highway-to-be-shifted/articleshow/88939769.cms||---

With frequent sightings of big cats including tigers and elephants near their villages on the fringes of Bandipur and Nagarahole, people here are living in fear. In the last week, residents in Antharasanthe region in HD Kote in Mysuru district sighted a tiger and a leopard. There have been incidents of attack on cattle. People are demanding authorities to help them live in peace. They are not venturing out of their homes as a precaution. Forest officials have continued their search for the big cats. Ramesh, a tribal leader, said incidents of attack on dogs and cattle by big cats mostly leopards are high in the regions of Machhuru, Chikkabyaranakuppe, Doddabyranakuppe, Vadakanamala, Anemala, Bavali, Hosur, Netkalhundi and Balle Haadi. Former honorary wildlife warden Rajkumar D claimed about two dozen villages in Bandipur forest fringes are considered high-pressure areas as the sighting of tigers, leopards and elephants are common. There are also about 80 villages where villagers fear raids on their crops by elephants or attack on their cattle by big cats. The major reasons for tigers coming out of the forest is because of old age or injury or being pushed out of the territory by dominant adults. As there is a healthy population of tigers in reserve forests, leopards have taken shelter on the fringe areas. The disturbance of elephant corridors and changing crop patterns are pulling elephants into human dwelling places, he said. A forest officer claimed sometimes villagers create confusion over the sighting of tigers for leopards. “We have dedicated teams to handle situations during man-animal conflict and immediately rush our personnel to the spot on every alarm call,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/villagers-on-forest-fringes-live-in-fear/articleshow/88939770.cms||---

The foresters can chase away the elephants if they are found moving towards the agriculture fields or villages and alert villagers so that they don’t come in the herd’s path.Radio-collar for two elephantsForesters in the Hassan division have held meetings with department high-ups in Bengaluru and prepared an action plan to take up the drive. The foresters said that after the discussion it was decided to radio-collar two elephants.

The rapid response group will start the work from 6 am to track the location of the elephants till 6 pm. During the night, announcements of the elephant movement will be done through mike to alert people.”From 1987 to 2021, a total of 64 elephants were captured and translocated. There are 40 to 50 elephants in Sakleshpur and Alur taluks.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Corporation identifies 700 defaulters owing tax dues above Rs 1 lakh||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The revenue wing of the city corporation has identified over 700 defaulters who owe corporation tax dues above Rs 1 lakh. The cumulative dues from these defaulters have been estimated at Rs 44 crore. In the past two months, the corporation managed to collect around Rs 17 crore following the updation of tax database in all the wards. The revenue wing has issued the first round of demand notice to all the defaulters with dues above Rs 1 lakh. An amount of Rs 3 crore has so far been received by the corporation from some of the defaulters. The revenue officials said the collection of dues is expected to increase in the next two months and a major chunk of dues would be cleared by March. This has been made possible mainly by the efforts of zonal offices to update and publish the actual tax dues. Earlier, people were reluctant to make use of online system since it would reflect dues from the previous fiscals although it would have been paid. Once the data base was updated, only the actual dues of respective fiscals were reflected on the accounts and many residents opted for online payment which also enabled them to generate receipts online and store it in digital format. Corporation officials said that the total collection of property tax through online payments has increased significantly which also resulted in a peak in collection for the fiscal 2020-21. With Covid lockdown affecting direct payment of property tax in 2020-21, online payment has increased especially after the city corporation published the updated data base and actual dues for each ward. In 2020-21, the total demand of the city corporation in property tax was Rs 96.8 crore and it was able to collect Rs 75.8 crores which is the highest collection of property tax since 2016-17. The corporation has not crossed Rs 70 crore in collection in the past five fiscals. The signs of significant hike in online payment of tax were evident from November 2021. The month had recorded a collection of Rs 9.75 crore, which is more than double the amount corporation had collected in the same month in 2020. The huge inflow of tax was recorded in a month when there was no field-level collection since all the officials were occupied with tax data updation. In December, an amount of Rs 7 crore was received. The corporation officials said that with actual dues being clearly reflected on the official website of city corporation for each ward, many people made optimum use of online payment. A good percentage of tax payments in previous two months happened via online. The revenue officials are now hoping for a record collection in 2021-22. Usually, the collection picks up in February and March; however this year, there has been significant inflow since November and in the next three months if the collection exceeds Rs 40 crore, the corporation could record nearly 90% of actual demand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-identifies-700-defaulters-owing-tax-dues-above-rs-1l/articleshow/88938254.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Dr. Pritam Ram, who is considered close to state health minister T S Singhdeo, represents Lundra (ST) assembly constituency in the Surguja district.

Besides, these legislators, Dr. Nilab Dubey, a lawyer considered close to health minister T S Singh, has also been appointed as director of the same corporation. During the power struggle within the Congress in September last year, Dr. Pritam Ram apparently stood strong with the health minister T S Singhdeo, without joining the Baghel loyalists, who made several trips to Delhi to throw their weight behind the chief minister.In July 2020, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had appointed 15 Congress MLAs, mostly first-timers, as parliamentary secretaries attached to the offices of cabinet ministers in the state. Besides, over a dozen ruling party MLAs have been appointed as chairmen, vice-chairmen of corporations and boards, and chairmen of the development authority.

He dashed an application to the SHO seeking four days’ leave clearly stating the reason that their absence has depressed him and he was unable to focus on work.SHO Anil Yadav found the reason for leave quite reasonable and granted him leave on Wednesday with a remark on his application that it be approved.When asked for his comments, Yadav said that the constable was depressed and genuinely needed a break.“I have done it earlier also and have reaped good results from the subordinates. It is not possible for a policeman, who already work for long hours, to work under any sort of stress,” said Yadav adding that such breaks reenergizes them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/nervous-cop-fails-to-work-after-colleagues-go-home-gets-leave/articleshow/88939780.cms||---

According to the Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors (JARD), at least 100 doctors including more than 30 doctors in the anesthesia department have already been infected with the virus. Seeing the rise in cases among the doctors, JARD has written to the SMS medical college administration to make arrangements for their quarantine facilities. Following the request, the administration has allocated a hotel with medical assistance for isolating them. So far, more than 150 doctors and healthcare staff have been infected with the virus in the current spread. Since doctors provide treatment to the patients, the hospitals under SMS medical college are regularly testing their staff for Covid to prevent spread of the virus in the hospital. Health officials said that since most doctors are asymptomatic or having mild symptoms, they do not need to be isolated. Meanwhile, Jhalawar’s CMHO Dr Sajid Khan also tested positive for Covid-19. The staff in the hospitals has become more vigilant and gets tested for Covid immediately with the onset of symptoms such as cold and cough. “I have mild symptoms. Since I took the booster dose on January 10, I did not develop severe symptoms. People should get their vaccine doses as per the schedule,” said Dr Khan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/covid-positive-docs-from-sms-hospital-isolate-at-city-hotel/articleshow/88939784.cms||---

However, a large number of tourists went to Tanot mateshwari temple at the Indo-Pak border as darshan was allowed as per the government guidelines. There were fewer tourists at Sonar fort, Patwa Haveli and Gadisar lake. The war museum at Jaisalmer military station and the battle field of Longewala has been closed till further orders by the army as a preventive measure. The main reason for closing these tourist spots is increased corona infection in defence premises. District collector Ashish Modi inspected Jawahar hospital and checked the medical arrangements and the facilities given to patients and to their attendants.

People may call at 181 helpline and they will get advice from the health experts. The doctors were deployed at the call centre two days ago. One can call at 181 and an executive will pick up the phone and would ask the reason for calling. The caller will have to provide the details and ask the executive that he need medical advice from the health experts. The doctors at the call centre advising people, who dial at the call centre, on the basis of guidelines issued by the Centre and the state time to time. Since 98% of patients are under home isolation, they have a lot of question in their mind regarding symptoms, treatment and questions regarding when to get hospitalised. The call centre will be instrumental in guiding the patients under home isolation. The functioning of the call centre has been changing with the change in waves of Covid-19. “The call centre is functioning since the first wave of Covid. At that time, people would ask for food requirement and also for medical help. In the second wave, the requirement of people changed and the demand for oxygen, medical help and medicine was seen. Now, we are witnessing demand of vaccines and medical advice,” said G K Sharma, additional director (IT cell), Information Technology and communication department. Besides, the call centre is also receiving a lot of calls from the people for vaccination. The state government has, recently, launched a facility of asking for vaccination camp at their locality.

---||Jaipur||Sunday curfew: Markets remain closed in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Several markets of the city remained closed on the first Sunday curfew. Many markets in the Walled City, Tonk Road, Barkat Nagar and Bajaj Nagar wore a deserted look, but people continued to pour in at regular intervals to purchase fruits and vegetables. The police also issued challans to people for stepping out of their houses without any valid reason. The government last week had announced that from Saturday night at 11pm to Monday at 5am would come into effect from Sunday (January 16). The home department has made some revisions to allow supplies of milk, vegetables, groceries, petrol pumps and other essential services like medical shops. The police had set up some barricades at several locations like Tonk Road, but cops remained absent most of the time. At many places of the city, the enforcement was lax during the afternoon as there was hardly anyone to check several cars and bikes passing through the main roads. A police official posted at one of the intersections claimed that there is no laxity as people themselves have chosen to stay indoors. He, however, claimed that the police have been told to strictly ensure that noone walks out without any urgent purpose during the evening. The PCR vans did patrol across the market and directed people over the mike to abide by the new curfew norms. The fruit and vegetable market on the Tonk Road seemed like any other normal weekend with people buying fresh produce, albeit masks did not seem to be a top priority for a few. At other parts of Jaipur like Nahargarh, the curfew did dampen the spirit of kite flying. By evening, the vehicular traffic had dwindled to a trickle due to bone-chilling cold. Many grocery and vegetable shops had also shut down their shutters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sunday-curfew-markets-remain-closed/articleshow/88939787.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Footfall, flights reduce at Jaipur airport in January||JAIPUR: With the Covid cases escalating in the state, the footfall at the Jaipur airport has seen a steady decrease of around 10,000 passengers on a daily basis since January 1. Officials claimed that due to the spike in corona, the average number of passengers daily, which was approximately 18,000 till last month, has reduced. Apart from this due to less crowd and weather conditions at least eight flights get cancelled every day. “Till December 31, we had the usual traffic at the airport as it was the tourist season in the state. However, from the beginning of this month, the number of flights operating on a daily basis has also reduced. Previously around 58 flights were operational, which have now reduced to 45. On Saturday, a lot of flights were cancelled and only 38 were operational due to the cold weather conditions as well as less passengers. The footfall has also reduced”, said a Jaipur international airport official. Officials also claimed that a lot of flights were diverted from Lucknow and Delhi to Jaipur due to fog. The Jaipur international airport is equipped with the second-most advanced ILS system, CAT IIIB. The CAT IIIB system allows compatible aircraft to land at a minimum of 50 metre runway visibility, which is considered a safer option. A category IIIB operation does not have a ‘decision height’ (the lowest height or altitude while approaching descent) and a runway visual range not less than 50m, while a category IIIA operation is a precision instrument approach and landing with a runway visual range not less than 200m. However, despite this, flights are cancelled as the aircrafts are not equipped with CAT IIIB compatible devices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/footfall-flights-reduce-at-jaipur-airport-in-jan/articleshow/88939788.cms||---

Swami said that both the accused ran a gang of vehicle lifters wherein they would come to Jaipur to carry out a recce of vehicles before fleeing with them.The prima facie investigation indicates that the accused would sell stolen vehicles in Bharatpur and Alwar regions of Mewat. Swami added that the accused kept a firearm with them while stealing the bikes. The accused never shied away from opening fire whenever they met any resistance. In fact, last year they had fired upon Dausa police at a checkpoint.According to the police, Bhagwan Sahay Meena was wanted by Alwar police in a criminal case and he subsequently moved to Jaipur in order to evade arrest.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Third wave harsher on hotels, hospitals||JAIPUR: In the first two waves of the pandemic, the hotels suffered the most and the hospitals gained. Now, the predicament is dire for both segments. Intriguingly, both sectors share the same plight at a time, when the third wave is considered to be less severe because of Omicron and a vaccinated population. As the hotel industry headed into a long and festive week-end, the atmosphere was far from being celebratory. Occupancies in hotels dropped to 10-15% and the situation is no different in private hospitals. “There was hardly any occupancy in hotels these days. Whatever business the industry made in the past 3-4 months, it had spent on clearing the dues. The 8pm night curfew has made the situation worse. It’s still baffling to understand how the evening crowd only spreads corona. By reducing shopping hours we are only concentrating people at other times of the day,” said Ranvijay Singh, Hotels and Restaurants Association of Rajasthan. The bed occupancy in private hospitals also tracked a similar trend. Because of Covid, people are avoiding non-urgent treatment and consultations. Dr Tarun Patni, former president of Jaipur Medical Association, said, “Barring one or two, bed occupancies are around 10-15 in private hospitals. Due to resurgence of Covid, people are postponing elective procedures. On the other hand, while the state or Jaipur is reporting large number of Covid cases, hospitalization very low.” Some estimates suggest that only around 300 beds are occupied by the Covid patients currently which is far less compared to the daily reporting of the cases. Due to snow and blizzard, many flights to Himachal and Srinagar were cancelled last week. Some of that crowd would have come to destination in Rajasthan. But the night curfew came as a dampener. “We had several booking inquires and most asked prohibitions on movement. When they learnt that markets would be closed by 8pm, most of them decided not to book,” said a hotelier. On normal times, week-ends getting longer due to festivals like Lohri and Makar Sankranti would have been a money spinner for hotels while creating a cascading of economic activities for variety of businesses. But not this time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/third-wave-harsher-on-hotels-hospitals/articleshow/88939790.cms||---

The statement came on the first anniversary of the vaccination drive started on January 16, 2021. "The average vaccination in the age group of 18 + is above the national average. Over 94% eligible persons in 18+ have been administered the first dose and the manner in which children in the age group of 15 to 17 are taking doses is highly encouraging," said Gehlot. The number of those taking precaution doses is also picking up very fast. "My appeal is for everyone to go for vaccination," said Gehlot. Countering the claims made by Gehlot, BJP state president Satish Poonia has questioned the Gehlot government mismanagement of the vaccinations in the state while observing the first anniversary of the vaccination drive in the country. "Rajasthan is among those states which had seen wastage of the vaccines due to utter failure," said Poonia, who accused the non-BJP governments including Rajasthan to show hesitancy in accepting indigenously developed vaccines. "The opposition left no stone unturned to demotivate people for the vaccines by spreading rumours and misleading people by their statements," said Poonia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cm-lauds-healthcare-workers-for-94-vaccination-coverage/articleshow/88939791.cms||---

A rise of Rs 2 to Rs 10 per kg was witnessed in the prices of the vegetables. Wholesale traders stated that the prices will decrease from Tuesday onwards as the supply would be proper from Monday. TOI on Sunday spoke to the wholesale traders and retailers to know the reason behind the change in prices of the vegetables compared to normal days. “We get a supply of 40 kg tomatoes per day, which was 15 kg on Sunday and a rise of almost Rs 2 per kg was witnessed in the wholesale market. Also the vehicle that unloaded the vegetables charged higher in the name of curfew. Thus, we sold the tomatoes in Rs 40 per kg on Sunday,” said Puroshottam Saini, a retailer at the vegetable mart at Jhotwara. Asked if the vegetables’ supply was actually affected, Abdul Sagir, a wholesale trader at the Muhana Mandi, said, “As the Sunday curfew was announced much earlier the farmer sold their items on Saturday itself and the supply of many vegetables like ladyfinger, bottle gourd, lemon, tomatoes, potatoes and onions was almost negligible.”The vegetable vendors, who roam around in different colonies too, had limited vegetables on Sunday. “We were told that we would get the supply till 8 am but that did not happen,” said Ramesh Saini, a retailer at Sodala locality.“So, we had to sell whatever items we had like lemon, coriander, tomatoes, garlic, cabbage, cucumber and a few other vegetables,” Saini said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/muhana-mandi-supply-crunch-hits-pockets-despite-curfew-clearance/articleshow/88939793.cms||---

Our research has shown that Cyclophilin A plays a major role in increasing the risk,” said Dr Surya Ramachandran, a programme scientist with the cardiovascular diseases and diabetes biology lab, RGCB. The findings of the research were recently published in Cells, an international journal of cell biology. Heart attacks result from rupture of cholesterol plaque deposited on walls of arteries. A tear or rupture in the plaque would activate a repairing mechanism resulting in a blood clot. Such clots can completely block blood flow to the heart muscle and cause a heart attack. Inhibitors of Cyclophilin A would have potential use in reducing the vulnerability to heart attacks due to plaque rupture. It is also being developed as a clinical serological marker of detecting vascular inflammation in patients with diabetes, she said. RGCB director Chandrabhas Narayana said the research findings with regard to the role played by Cyclophilin will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases. It will help in risk detection and development of novel pharmacological therapies. “The protein Cyclophilin A impairs the process of prompt and efficient clearance of cells that have been programmed to die, resulting in rapid progression of plaque formation in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus,” said Dr Ramachandran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/study-on-protein-sheds-light-on-heart-disease-risk/articleshow/88938269.cms||---

As heritage buildings at the old PWD site face demolition, their hopes have been literally swept into the creek. In a city — described globally as quaint and the smallest in the country — that celebrated its 175 years without much fanfare recently, this spot is where part of Goa’s history of public works (Obras Publicas) under Portuguese regime began. The rectangular space on the creek’s western tip wedged between the new Patto and iconic old bridge, the scenic Rua de Ourem creek and the Mandovi, could have added to the city’s cultural vibrancy. Kala Academy, the Adil Shah palace and old Goa Medical College are the other cultural hubs in the state capital. “Imagine a performance, a dance drama on a water-related theme, performers in boats carrying oil lamps, lanterns and petromax lights, and interacting with the audience onshore. They could be singing and inviting the audience to join them. There could be banter, teasing, like in a fugdi. It would be filled with surprise performers popping up from land or water!” Heta Pandit of Goa Heritage Action Group said. The uniquely suited art and culture public space can even command a view from both bridges. Planners only need a good sense of curation and a strong sense of cultural history to make it relevant to the present, cultural enthusiasts said. “Without doing much and at very minimal expense, we showed that this location can be an invaluable public space for Panaji citizens. It would be criminal to lose that for no good reason,” Vivek Menezes, who curated Panjim 175 along with co-curator, Swati Salgaocar, at the Serendipity Arts Festival said. Further, the site can serve as an interpretation and visitor centre for Panaji city at its entrance and of the Latin neighbourhood, stated Menezes. “Hundreds of tourists who walk through Fontainhas have no idea about the incredible cultural encyclopedia that they are experiencing. Today we have become used to thinking of Panaji as a tiny city in India’s smallest state at the country’s margins. But for generations, it was a centerpiece of a giant maritime empire that stretched from Mozambique to Macau,” he said. Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd is planning to restore, refurb and reconstruct four units and set up a cafeteria with a mezzanine floor, kitchen and also a ticketing office. “This is like breaking the old GMC building and expecting it to be built in the old fashion. The buildings should have been conserved, as new construction will lack heritage character,” Armando Gonsalves, founder chairman of Goa Forgiving said. Heritage lovers stressed the need for a proper heritage policy to protect cultural resources. “We have to save what’s on the table,” Gonsalves said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/heritage-lovers-bat-for-old-patto-area-as-citys-cultural-hotspot/articleshow/88938744.cms||Paul Fernandes

This year, a total of 21 migratory species were recorded in comparison to last year’s 30 species. Sambhar Lake is country's largest inland salt lake, as well as a Ramsar site (recognized wetland of international importance) in Rajasthan. However, due to degrading wetland habitat, water bird diversity and population has been fluctuating and largely decreasing every year. Ecologist TK Roy, AWC state coordinator, Delhi, said, “In 2022, overall species diversity is the same but there is a decreased migratory species population and number. We have recorded a total of 2,349 migratory birds including northern shovelers, which have the highest population of 1,981. Remaining migratory species had the least population.” The survey also revealed that this year, only three threatened water bird species including black-tailed godwit (migratory), eurasian curlew - 03 (migratory) and lesser flamingo (resident) were recorded at the lake. “Earlier, seven to eight threatened water bird species were recorded at the lake. At present, only two resident species, greater flamingo and lesser flamingo, around 20,735 in number can be seen, that too, due to temporarily improved habitat after recent winter rainfall,” said Roy. Environmentalists stressed that the state government should focus on the natural habitat of migratory birds as it is continuously degrading and is disturbed for aquatic birdlife. Moreover, the diversity and population in the migratory species are also decreasing due to dry conditions. “There is no permanent water source except monsoon rainfall. The water collected at the lake is overused by the salt making factories. To save the habitat, the government should chalk out a conservation plan for sustainable Asian waterbird census (AWC), which started on January 1 and concluded on January 16, is the largest annual water bird census. In Rajasthan, AWC 2022 was carried out at Sambhar Lake in Jaipur division in collaboration with the territorial forest division. Similarly, the survey was carried out in Nagaur division in collaboration with the district territorial forest division and administration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/sambhar-lake-sees-less-species-of-migratory-birds-asian-census/articleshow/88939795.cms||---

More importantly, they say half of the guest lecturers teaching in undergraduate or postgraduate colleges across the state, will lose their jobs. Calling it ‘not good news’, Dheeraj Kumar, president of the Dakshina Kannada First Grade Government College Guest Lecturers’ Welfare Committee, said that the new decision will cause unemployment for around 7,000 guest lecturers. “We had demanded for job security and 12 months full salary, among other demands. However, none of them have been addressed. Instead, half the guest lecturers will lose their jobs, since one person is assigned with the work of two lecturers. A guest lecturer will have to work for 15 hours a week, instead of the eight hours earlier. There is no financial burden faced by the state government as they are claiming,” Dheeraj alleged. He added that UGC or permanent staff are assigned with 16 hours of teaching work per week, whereas guest faculty will teach one hour less compared to them. However, there are a lot of shortcomings when it comes to salary, perks and recognition for the work of guest lecturers, he said. The state government has decided to increase the monthly honorarium to Rs 26,000 to 28,000 from Rs 11,000 for guest lecturers. Those candidates who have cleared UGC-NET or completed their PhD, will be paid Rs 30,000 to Rs 32,000 (Rs 13,000 earlier salary). Karnataka has around 14,000 guest faculty. “I have been working at a college as a guest faculty for a few days in a week, and the rest of the days at a private firm. However, I will not be able to continue it. Moreover, I am not sure if I will retain my job,” said a guest faculty. Udupi District Guest Lecturers’ Association president Shahida Jahan said that the government has distributed sweets to some guest lecturers, and made the rest unemployed within a day. “All the existing guest faculty must be assured job security and full salary for 12 months a year,” she urged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/new-policy-guest-lecturers-upset-over-15-hour-work-week-without-job-security/articleshow/88939804.cms||---

The Karnataka State Child Rights Policy-2016 has even prescribed a template for child protection policy for schools. With the increasing numbers of crimes against children, especially sexual abuse and cyber crime, having a child protection policy document is the need of the hour, and the committee will insist that the administration make it mandatory, said Renni D’Souza, co-convenor, Children’s Masotsava committee. He said that the committee comprising civil society groups, conducted more than 40 awareness programmes in various schools and community halls between November 10 and January 3. “We have also realised that many officials are not aware of this policy,’’ he said. “A school must clearly state not only to the students, but also the parents, that they oppose all forms of child safety violations, including child abuse, such as physical and sexual abuse, exploitation, emotional abuse, corporal punishment, and neglect. They must also make sure that all new buildings shall be designed as per the applicable laws. In order to reduce the risk of abuse of children by adults, and among children themselves, ensure safety of children in all spaces, including toilets, bathrooms, sports equipment rooms, through measures such as adequate lighting, adult attendants and peer support groups. It is important that the school maintains visitors’ registers, and that gates are monitored for entry and exit of all,” he said. “When trips outside the school are organised for children, several permissions and practices, such as written permission of parent or guardian, safety orientation to students prior to departure, contact numbers of parents or guardians for emergencies, student adult ratio for supervision, at least one adult trained in CPR, first-aid, handling of off-site bathroom breaks, and use of public transport, should be part of the team,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/90-of-dk-schools-lack-child-protection-policy-docu-panel/articleshow/88939809.cms||---

The health department has noticed the number of positive cases at MIA has increased after December. Towards the end of November, out of 30,344 passengers tested, 48 of them turned out to be positive. Data available as on January 10, reveals that 149 passengers tested positive out of 44,013 passengers. All those who tested positive during rapid RT-PCR tests, carried Covid negative RT-PCR certificates, conducted 48 hours before they could board the flight. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer, told TOI that the number of those who tested positive, among fliers to the UAE, has increased in December, with the onset of the third wave of the pandemic. “The reason is because the virus spread is more at the moment in the region. The rapid RT-PCR test is a more sensitive test, compared to the normal RT-PCR test. Also, a person can be infected after giving his swab for a RT-PCR test,” Dr Ashok said, adding that UAE has stringent rules when it comes to entry. The test is mandatory to enter the UAE. The rapid RT-PCR testing facility at MIA commenced on August 18. According to data available, Out of 149 cases, more than half of the cases are from Dakshina Kannada (72 cases), followed by Uttara Kannada (26), Kasaragod (24), Udupi (22), one case from Hassan, and two cases each from Palakkad in Kerala and Kodagu. Dr Ashok said that as many as 22 people have arrived at Mangaluru through the seaport. No one among them has tested positive so far, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/rapid-rt-pcr-test-drastic-rise-in-cases-detected-at-mia/articleshow/88939815.cms||---

Former minister and Congress leader B Ramanath Rai on Sunday dubbed the Centre’s refusal an ‘insult’ to the reformer’s legacy. Rai told reporters in Mangaluru that it “is an insult, not merely to Sri Narayana Guru, but to his message as well.”A committee of the Union ministry of defence decides on the tableau to be featured during the parade, and this panel came in for much criticism over its decision. Urging the public to raise their voice to question the grounds on which the Centre refused the Kerala government’s request, Rai added, “Sri Narayana Guru fought against inequality and untouchability. He preached the doctrine of one caste, one religion and one God. His tireless efforts to uplift, both socially and spiritually, the downtrodden masses, made him a seer.”“It was the Congress government that decided to celebrate his birth anniversary as Narayana Guru Jayanti. The Narayana Guru Chair at Mangalore University too was set up when the Congress was in power in Karnataka,” Rai said.President of Kudroli Sri Gokarnanath temple, Mangaluru HS Sairam is also deeply upset with the central government’s decision. The shrine is part of the social reformer’s legacy, given that it was Sri Narayana Guru who consecrated the Linga at the Kudroli Gokarnanatha temple in 1912. “Sri Narayana Guru was a visionary, and it is not fair to insult his legacy for political reasons. The central government must clarify as to why the Kerala government’s request to feature his tableaux in the Republic Day Parade was rejected,” Sairam said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/centre-rejects-tableaux-of-narayana-guru-cong-miffed/articleshow/88939816.cms||---

On instructions of SP Sachin Patil, rural police have set up check points and are patrolling various parts of the district — mainly on the bordering areas of other district — to check if people are following Covid norms. Those flouting the norms are being booked under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and other relevant sections of Disaster Management Act 2005.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/cops-crack-down-on-covid-norm-violators/articleshow/88939818.cms||---

Her day begins with the memory of her mother waking her up and her father — a farmer by profession — helping her with studies so she could have a good career. “Though this is true, we cannot stop here. We have to live our lives, and, therefore, we are putting such things behind us to make our parents’ dreams a reality,” said the girl. Similarly, a boy from Malegaon taluka, who is pursuing a course in electricals, said, “I have no time to weep, as I have an elder sister as well. My maternal uncle and his family members are kind and are taking care of us. But it is difficult to make ends meet, and hence, I am taking a course ,” he said. There are 12 other such children sriting their board examinations and have shown extraordinary courage and maturity in putting their grief behind them. They also express their displeasure with their own relatives and even the media who often try to sympathise with them. “In the beginning, it was a big shock to me. However, a couple of days later, I learnt that I share the same fate with many other children. We do not want sympathy anymore. If at all, the society can take steps to help us achieve our dreams and fulfil our parents’ wishes,” the young boy said. Government counsellor, Nivedita Zende, who met 14 of these children said that only two children required special assistance from psychiatrists. “After meeting the children, we realised that they were mature when compared to those of their age a few decades back. They came out of the sorrow quickly and were determined to take up challenges that life throws at them,” Zende said. Psychologists and psychiatrists from Nashik have offered all their help to these children. But fortunately, only two children required help, and they have now come out of the situation, Zende pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/children-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-overcome-trauma-to-write-board-exam/articleshow/88939820.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The district health authorities have planned to set up 18 more LMO tanks as against 2, which were available during the second wave. Dr NS Chavan, the civil surgeon of Jalgoan district, said, "Of the 18 tanks, 7 have already been installed, and the work of the rest is on the verge of completion." “The maximum demand for the oxygen during the peak of the second wave was 60 Metric Tonne (MT), and hence, the district was asked to ensure availability of 150 MT of oxygen. We now have 350 MT capacity of oxygen,” Dr Chavan pointed out. The officer also said that as part of strengthening the infrastructure, the testing capabilities of Jalgaon is being upgraded to ensure testing of maximum samples for faster delivery of results and expedite the treatment process. “We have the laboratory with a testing capacity of 1,500 swab samples daily, and the same is now being extended to 3,000 per day. This is being carried out from the Rs 6.7 crore received by the district under the emergency Covid response package by the central government,” Dr Chavan said. The officer also noted that the provision of telemedicine is also being set up at four different locations in rural areas so that the patients suffering from Covid do not have to visit major towns and cities, instead can seek advice from the doctors and staff at the headquarters. With 1,130 ICU beds, 465 ventilator beds, and the addition of 1,000 oxygen and 200 general beds through the rural and sub-district hospitals, the health authorities are ready to face any eventualities, the officer added. At present, there are 1,846 active cases in the district with 95 being symptomatic, and only 11 are on oxygen support, while none of them is in the ICU. The district has recorded 2,580 deaths so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/jalgaon-district-focuses-on-increasing-testing-o2-capacity/articleshow/88939822.cms||---

There are six toilets on each floor of the four-floor building,” said Borse. The decision has been taken considering that during the second wave, some Covid patients admitted in hospitals used to suffer from breathlessness while using the toilet. Borse said such works are being given priority as the admissions in the hospital is less despite cases rising.Meanwhile, the work to create a buffer zone equipped with at least 10 oxygen beds for people seeking admission into the Covid ward has already begun. The buffer zone will ensure that the patients are not kept waiting in vehicles and ambulances until the beds get vacant in the hospital. This had occurred frequently during the peak period of the second wave last year.The plan is to set up 10 oxygen beds on the ground floor of the building. Critical patients arriving at the hospital can be accommodated there until the beds in the wards become vacant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/oxygen-points-to-be-set-up-in-civil-hosps-toilets/articleshow/88939823.cms||---
---||Meerut||No SP-RLD ticket for Muslims in Muzaffarnagar upsets community||Muzaffarnagar: There are murmers of discontent regarding the SP-RLD's ticket distribution within sections of the Muslim community in communally sensitive Muzaffarnagar. While the region in UP has about 38% Muslim voters spread across six constituencies in the district, surprisingly the alliance has not fielded a single Muslim so far. It has declared candidates on five seats, all of them Hindus. Now all eyes are fixed on the lone city seat, and sources claim that this too might see a Hindu candidate "to avoid polarization”. This doesn't seem to have gone down well with some members of the community, who said "this is happening despite the fact that, in the last two years, RLD leaders have been promoting ‘bhaichara (brotherhood)’ committees, and speeches during anti-farm law agitation appealed for Jat-Muslim unity". Prominent Muslim leaders such as Qadir Rana, Mursaleen Rana, Liyakat Ali, among others who wanted to contest the elections now feel "neglected and disowned". A former SP leader and former MP, Amir Alam, said, “It is not about whether Muslim politicians will get to fight the election in Muzaffarnagar or not, what matters most is how to defeat communal forces.” Local politician Faisal Saifi said, “The decision not to give tickets to Muslim leaders will result in a huge loss for SP. Muslim candidates from AIMIM and BSP might gain.” But there were voices that differed. Ayoung Muslim activist, Javed Abbas, said, “The initiative by SP will avoid polarisation. Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right decision of not giving tickets to Muslims. Moreover, several Muslim leaders who had sought SP tickets are accused in riots cases.” Senior SP leader Sudheer Panwar said, “Samajwadi Party never distributes tickets on the basis of religion. We never do Hindu-Muslim politics. Enough tickets have been given to Muslims across Uttar Pradesh.” RLD’s west UP's spokesperson Abhishek Chaudhry said, “The two districts of Shamli and Muzaffarnagar are considered as one, and RLD has nominated two Muslim candidates in Shamli. Those who are saying that we have not given tickets to Muslims are wrong.” Opposition leaders were quick to criticise the development. Ziaur Rahman, asaid, “SP claims it has a soft corner for Muslims, but when it came to electoral representation, not even a single seat was given to Muslims,” BSP has announced Muslim candidates in two seats in Muzaffarnagar district so far. AIMIM is also thinking of offering tickets to Muslim politicians. Muzaffarnagar witnessed one of the worst communal riots in recent history in 2013, leaving over 50 dead and 50,000 displaced. The riots also led to a Hindu-Muslim divide in later years that farmer leaders tried to bridge during the recent anti-farm laws agitation in order to put up a united front.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/no-sp-rld-ticket-for-muslims-in-muzaffarnagar-upsets-community/articleshow/88937653.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The seer was apparently offended on being asked a certain question and threatened to have the journalist and his cameraman “beaten up”. Consequently, he was booked under sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) section 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) of IPC. Kathait said, "Earlier, Narsinghanand was arrested in connection with derogatory remarks against women but later sections for hate speech was also slapped on him. An investigation is on into the matter."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dasna-head-priest-yati-narsinghanand-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-for-misogyny-hate-speech/articleshow/88937650.cms||MS Nawaz

According to police, a 14-year-old girl residing under Kovalam police station limits was the victim of their previous crime. During the interrogation, the duo admitted to grievously hurting the girl, which eventually led to her death a day later. Vizhinjam station house officer inspector Prajeesh Sasi said that the duo revealed about the attack when the police asked questions regarding the incident during the interrogation. ‘’Some of their neighbours told our officers during the preliminary inquiry about overhearing the mother and son loudly arguing about destroying a girl’s life during one of their quarrels. Hence we asked about it and they divulged more details,” the inspector said. The victim was a 14-year-old girl with some degree of learning disabilities and other physical ailments. Rafeeqa’s son Shafeeq was in a relationship with that girl. He started spending more time with her, neglecting his job. This led to a quarrel between the mother and son and also affected the relationship between Shafeeq and the girl too. On January 13, 2021, Rafeeqa and Shafeeq visited the girl at her home and broke into a quarrel. The duo allegedly smashed the girl’s head against the wall thrice and left the house. ‘’The next day, the girl was hospitalised owing to severe headache. She died on the same day. The cause of death was revealed to be internal haemorrhage and hence the police recorded the death as a case of unnatural death,’’ the inspector said. He added that the Kovalam police have been informed about the latest development. They would be filing a report before the court to alter charges in the FIR soon, he said. Meanwhile on Sunday, the three accused were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/probe-brings-another-murder-case-to-light/articleshow/88938286.cms||---

Nitin Deshmukh, the inspector at Dhule city police station, who is investigating the case, said that some middlemen have been identified, but refused to divulge more details as the investigation is still going on. The city police have arrested four people — including three employees of the Dhule Municipal Corporation — based on a complaint registered by the civic body against ‘unidentified’ persons for creating fake vaccination sessions and issuing certificates to at least 3,191 people without giving them the actual shots. “One of the accused has confessed to committing the crime. We have some information about such people who brought these ‘customers’ to the accused to get certificates in exchange for money,” Deshmukh said. The officer said that the possibility of more employees of the corporation being involved in the case cannot be ruled out. He added, “Since the investigation is on, we are not sure if more such fake sessions were held and hence, we believe there could be more such people.” A senior officer from Malegaon who was puzzled by a large number of people presenting vaccination certificates from Dhule (55 km away) said, “Certificates are compulsory for entry in malls and shops. These people were showing fake certificates only to bypass the condition of vaccination wherever applicable.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/probe-middlemen-were-facilitators-between-beneficiaries-arrested-dhule-civic-officials/articleshow/88939829.cms||---

Over 1,000 residential projects have been approved by the civic body between August and December 2021, while over 400 building plan proposals are still pending with the civic body for approval. These projects range from five to over 50 apartments and these building projects will provide over 25,000 houses in the city. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Nashik, said that over 1,600 projects are already under construction, including the 1,000 recently-approved projects. An official of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said only 200-odd residential projects were approved during the first four months (April-July) of the current financial year due to the second wave of the pandemic, but the sector got a much-needed boost thereafter. “Around 800 residential projects have been approved during the last five months till December. This is mostly because of the 50% concession given in charges for premium FSI,” the official said. “Moreover, the government had also given exemption from online submission and approval for a period of four months between October 1 and December 31. As a result, builders and developers, who were planning execution of the projects, submitted their building plans to get double benefits,” he added. Ravi Mahajan, president of CREDAI Nashik, said, “For the first time after two years, the realty sector has got a boost. Over 1,000 residential projects are already under construction across the city. The demand for houses have also increased during the last few months due to the need for an own house realized due to Covid.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/aug-dec-21-saw-1000-residential-projects-approved-in-nashik-city/articleshow/88939834.cms||---

Usually, grape harvest begins in January, but some small pockets in the district resort to early grape harvest around two months before the usual period. Of the 1.75 lakh acres of land under grape plantation in the district, the early grape harvest is taken on 6,000 acres. However, the area for early grape harvest has dipped by 40% to 3,500 acres during the last three years due to unseasonal rains and hail. While some of the grape farmers have shifted to vegetables, onions and pomegranate, a few farmers have planted new rain-resistant varieties on around 200 acres of land across the belt. Grape farmers in this small pocket of Satana have been taking early grape harvest for the past decade to get better prices for the fruits. Khanderao Shevale, the former director and senior member of the Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh - a grape farmers’ association, said, “Farmers get better prices in October and November as compared to the prices during the usual grape harvest season between January and April. Some farmers also export early grapes to non-European countries like Russia, fetching more rates.” “But the farmers have incurred heavy losses during the past three years due to unseasonal rains and hail,” said Shevale. Fed up with this bad climate in October and November for the last three consecutive years, most farmers have uprooted their vineyards on around 2,500 acres of land and shifted to vegetables, onion and pomegranate, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/vineyards-with-early-grape-harvest-register-40-dip-in-satana-belt/articleshow/88939836.cms||Tushar Pawar

However, in view of the current progress, the officials said that by March-end the work would be over.Officials added that there were a few houses located very close to the highway owing to which they were facing certain problems. Nonetheless, the work of the vehicular underpass, which has consumed most of the time, is gaining momentum, and it will take a maximum of two months for the work to complete.Meanwhile, the main carriageway and the service roads along the highway are nearly complete, and just a little resurfacing or asphalting is needed in some areas.Once the vehicular underpass is complete and open for traffic, it will help curb traffic problems.Owing to the pending work of the underpass, the motorists have to take the service roads on either side of the highway to drive through the incomplete stretch. Given the narrow breadth of the service roads that have a huge traffic of trucks, buses, cars, bikers, cyclists and even pedestrians, commuting is a bit difficult mainly for two-wheeler riders. Nonetheless, the condition of the road is much better than six months back.It has been more than five years that people of the Sinnar Phata, Kharjul Mala and other areas along the highway are waiting for the completion of this patch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/highway-patch-near-sinnar-phata-to-be-completed-by-march-end/articleshow/88939837.cms||---

An early probe said the auxiliary nurse midwife — or the health worker — who inoculated the children at anganwadi centres did not take aseptic or surgically sterile measures, leading to the tragedy. Reproductive and child health officer the district, Dr IP Gadad, told TOI that one of the victims – a 10-month-old girl – died within hours of the vaccination. She first developing nausea, then started vomiting and died by 8pm. The officer termed the deaths “unfortunate” and said they occurred because of “sheer negligence of the health worker”. Sources said two deaths occurred at Bochagala camp where 17 children were vaccinated on January 12, and one at Mallapura where four children took the shots on January 11. Both villages are in Ramadurga taluk. The 10-month-old girl who died on the same day of the inoculation had been given the first dose against MR. A 13-month-old girl was rushed to a Ramadurga hospital and later to Belagavi Institu te of Medical Sciences for treatment after she took ill following inoculation. Though she was on ventilator at BIMS, the girl developed convulsions and died on Saturday, failing to respond to the treatment. Two other girl children – an 18-month-old and a twoyear-old – were recovering from the adverse impact after vaccination at Bochagala village. In Mallapura, a child, whose age is yet to be determined, died the same day of taking the shot at Mallapura camp on January 11. Somaning Kurakundi, whose child died in the botch-up, told TOI the health worker should be punished and the health department should ensure such incidents do not recur. Children below the age of 15 months are given the first dose against MR and those above 15 months are given the second dose. “A detailed probe will reveal the exact nature of negligence and cause of death. We’ve suspended the health worker attached to Talahalli PHC based on the findings of the initial probe,” Dr Gadad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-jab-botch-up-3-kids-die-nurse-suspended/articleshow/88939849.cms||Shreyas HS

Many farmers, including women, were irritated by the disruption and threw their produce on the road, telling police to pick them up and take them home. They also expressed their displeasure with both the state and central administrations. Police fled the scene as tension escalated. While farmers held a dharna into the afternoon, more police personnel were sent.When contacted, superintendent of police HD Anand Kumar said, “We did not stop farmers from selling vegetables. Sunday is the weekly market day in Vijayapura. As there was a heavy crowd, our personnel insisted that farmers and public maintain social distance and follow Covid guidelines. Meanwhile, enraged farmers dumped vegetables on the road. However, we called them afterwards and persuaded them to follow the rules. As a gesture of humanity, we also gave some compensation to the farmers who suffered losses as a result of discarding vegetables on the road.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/farmers-throw-produce-on-road/articleshow/88939852.cms||---

The district administration, however, is having a difficult time monitoring whether patients quarantined at home are effectively isolating themselves. Consequently, the authorities have appealed to neighbours to intimate them in the event of Covid patients in their locality violating quarantine. Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said that more than 90% of those infected with Covid in the district were asymptomatic, and are being treated at their homes. “There have been reports of a few patients not isolating themselves for the stipulated period, and are going about their routine. In response to these complaints, we decided to contact neighbours of the Covid patients, whom we have asked to perform the role of a whistleblower. Neighbours have been asked to inform us should Covid patients in their area violate quarantine. We will, of course, keep the identity of the neighbour a secret,” Patil said. The DC said that houses of infected patients would not be sealed, as was the practice before. However, he added, a sticker would be pasted on the houses of Covid patients to intimate neighbours. “The sticker will also contain the numbers of officials the neighbours can contact. These personnel can also be contacted to receive timely treatment,” Patil added. 26 teams constitutedThe DC said that as many as 26 teams, each comprising a doctor, a nurse and workers from the health department have been constituted. “The express purpose of these teams is to visit patients quarantined at home, and monitor their condition. Neighbours can also intimate members of these teams about violation of quarantine, and so far, some of them have received calls informing them about Covid patients not effectively isolating themselves,” he said. Those violating quarantine would be shifted to the nearest hospital or Covid Care Centre, the DC warned. Dharwad district health officer Dr BC Karigowder said, “We are counselling patients quarantined at home to isolate themselves effectively. They must follow the doctor’s advice to the letter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/inform-us-about-covid-patients-violating-quarantine-urges-dc/articleshow/88939853.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Covid cases may rise to 2,000 per day in Dharwad, warn experts||DHARWAD: The sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in Dharwad district has been a cause of concern for residents and the authorities, as the district which was recording a positivity rate of 0.1% to 0.3% till January 5, is recording a rise in the rate, in the last 10 days. On Sunday, the positivity rate touched 12.8%. On Sunday, the number of positive cases reported was 634, which was double the number reported on Thursday and Friday, and the number of active cases stood at 2,476. As many as 78 people were discharged on Sunday, while five are being treated in the ICU. However, there has not been a single death due to Covid-19 during the third wave. The number of positive cases per day may go up to 2,000 this week, and the curve will flatten from next week, say experts. The only solace for the people here is that less people are getting hospitalised after getting infected with the SARS CoV-2 virus, and very few infected persons may require medical liquid oxygen. However, experts have cautioned people not to let their guard down, and to continue to avoid gatherings and crowded places. On Thursday, Dharwad district had recorded 399 positive cases, and on Friday the number stood at 338. The positivity rate which was 10.3% on these two days, jumped to 12.8% on Saturday. Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said that most of the positive cases are from Hubballi. He said that experts have warned that the next seven to 10 days will be critical, as the positive cases will increase drastically. Nitesh attributed the surge in positive cases to the increase in testing. The government has asked the district administration to increase the testing to 5,000 tests per day, but the health department is conducting over 7,000 tests each day. On Saturday, 7,300 tests were conducted, of which 648 people tested positive. Almost 90% of those who got infected are in home isolation, and a few people with co-morbidities are admitted to the hospital. The ICU admissions are very less. Double masking advised“Offline classes in schools for classes I-IX have been suspended, and residents should exercise caution while venturing out. Double masking, using hand sanitiser frequently and avoiding crowded places are the best preventive measure to keep the virus at bay,” he said. Those in home isolation too are being strictly monitored, and medicines are being delivered at their doorstep.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/cases-may-rise-to-2k/day-in-dharwad-warn-experts/articleshow/88939855.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

---||Hubballi||North Karnataka to witness political churn ahead of 2023 polls?||HUBBALLI: A little more than a year to go before the state heads to the polls, and rumblings of discontent are growing louder with each passing day in North Karnataka, where the BJP has been the dominant force in recent times. Reports indicate that the ruling BJP could lose some of its incumbent MLAs, and former legislators ahead of the polls. Although switching parties ahead of elections is not uncommon, there are signs that the saffron party may lose more prominent faces than the Congress in North Karnataka. Both the BJP and Congress are keeping a close watch on legislators in each other’s camps, hoping to lure leaders and functionaries who could tilt the scales in their favour at the hustings. Furthermore, the two parties are also reaching out to a wide cross-section of the people, collecting their opinion on legislators. Among the more prominent leaders who are reportedly looking to switch sides is BJP MLA from Hubballi-Dharwad West constituency Arvind Bellad, who recently resigned as the president of the Hubballi-Dharwad city unit of the saffron party. Bellad’s absence at the proceedings on the second day of the BJP’s executive committee meeting in Dharwad too was noticeable. Bellad was among the contenders for the chief minister’s post in the wake of BS Yediyurappa’s resignation in July 2021. Although speculation is rife about his plans of joining the Congress, his aides and followers have dismissed such reports, dubbing them unfounded. On the other hand, former Congress MLC Nagaraj Chebbi’s recent meeting with industries’ minister Murugesh Nirani has set off speculation of his joining the saffron party. Chebbi is reportedly keen on contesting the assembly election from Kalghatagi, and may go over to the BJP should the party promise to field him from the segment of his choice. Former Congress MP Amarsinh Patil, who joined the BJP in 2015, meanwhile, is rumoured to be contemplating a report to his old party as well. Political observers in the region attributed the discontent among the ranks of the BJP to the recent electoral reverses in the bypolls, the MLC election and the polls to the urban local bodies. They also pointed to the vacuum in leadership in the BJP following Yediyurappa’s resignation to the CM’s post. However, many pundits are equally sceptical about Congress’s prospects in the 2023 elections, pointing to the tussle between Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president DK Shivakumar and former CM Siddaramaiah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/nk-to-witness-political-churn-ahead-of-23-polls/articleshow/88939858.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

As the ministry of housing and urban affairs has changed the guidelines, RITES will have to give multiple options, “Alternative Analysis Plans” (AAP), from walking and cycling to motorised and other modes of transportation to the UT. This is because best feasible mode can be considered and sent to the Centre for selection after consultation with neighbouring states.In 2007, only Metro project was under consideration. It was later found non-feasible. With RITES again being told to prepare the plan and report according to current scenario and traffic analysis, it could be back on track. RITES has sought eight-month time, but the UT has asked it to prepare the plan and report in six months.“There is now a full-fledged format of the ministry and all columns need to be fulfilled. If they are not, the plan or related data will not be considered. RITES will have to keep this in mind and work on it,” a senior UT officer said.Officials from the UT and RITES had been discussing the matter since the last few days.

Shopkeepers also asked authorities not to order closure of their establishments from time to time. They said that even though they were heavily affected by the Covid crisis, they have been repeatedly asked to close their shops and burdened with taxes.Shopkeepers want PU to reduce the rent of shops by half and give them relief in electricity bills. They also want authorities to increase the lease deed.Kapil Sehgal, who owns a shop in PU, said that since they were in dire straits, they would intensify their agitation if their demands were not met. Teachers and employees are facing problems because of the shopkeepers’ strike. On Sunday, in continuation of their ongoing protest, the Panjab University Shopkeepers Association took out a candle and protest march from PU Market to Gate No 2.After observing two-minute silence in memory of their colleague Neeraj, who commented suicide, they protested against Panjab University authorities.The traders said that they were opposed to the idea of online meeting with the Panjab University Committee and demanded offline meeting with all the 60 shopkeepers of the market. They apprehended the possibility of more tragedies such as that of Neeraj of Raj Eatery and asked the PU committee to resolve their issues at the earliest. In case of lease deed transfer, the rent be charged as per the lease deed instead of increasing the rent exorbitantly at the time of lease transfer in the name of legal heir, they said. Due to absence of students at the university due to Covid, they said they should get 50% rebate on the lines of other universities. During the Covid pandemic, GNDU and Kurukshetra University gave 50% to 75% rebate to their shopkeepers.

The planned portion is located near the border of the city and connects with the new Chandigarh area of Mohali district. The UT engineering department has already conducted its initial exercise.The project is also being called an elevated highway because as per plan, it will be a single road from where traffic will pass. Traffic will also pass under the road. The exact plan, criteria of the project, its length and related technical details will be finalised once the CMP report is in.“Since RITES has started the work on CMP, the UT recently officially wrote to RITES saying that the flyover project should also be considered in their plan so that all aspects are properly highlighted in a comprehensive plan related to transportation. As the project is already under the consideration of the UT engineering department, concrete action will be taken after the report is received,” a senior officer of the Chandigarh administration said.“The urban planning department of the UT administration is also in favour of this project, which is required due to increasing traffic congestion. As per internal assessment and study of the city, village traffic and heavy traffic coming from Punjab and Baddi area of Himachal Pradesh also passes through this road,” a senior official said. Sources in the Chandigarh administration said that the flyover on Madhya Marg, near Khuda Lahora village was the need of the hour, which is why the urban planning and engineering departments had agreed to it after a series of deliberations over the past several months. The engineering department had also conducted its initial exercise on it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mull-flyover-near-khuda-lahora-ut-tells-rites/articleshow/88939873.cms||Deepak Yadav

The construction of project is expected to start by December 2022 and will be completed in six years. The approximate employment of 13.14 lakh man days will be generated for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled youths of the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had virtually laid the foundation stone of Renukaji dam from Paddal Maidan in Mandi during his Himachal visit on December 27. It is a national project conceived as a storage project on Giri River in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh. The dam site is about 40 km away from Nahan, near famous Renukaji Shrine.To exploit the power potential of Giri river, initial investigation work was started by the then Punjab government in 1942. In 1964, Himachal Pradesh government started investigation on two projects and work on one of the projects namely Giri Hydroelectric Project was started in 1970s.The detailed project report (DPR) of the dam was accepted by the technical advisory committee (TAC) of water resources department in 2000, for total price of Rs 1,224.64 crore. The DPR was again accepted in 2015, with an estimated cost of Rs 4,596.76 crore. However, due to non-signing of interstate agreement between beneficiary states, the work on project could not be initiated.After pursuance by the Centre, the interstate agreement amongst six beneficiary states — Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh — was signed on January 9, 2019. After signing of the agreement, DPR was once again accepted the jal shakti ministry on December 9, 2019, for Rs 6,946.99 crore. In this, total cost of water component is Rs 6,647.46 crore and the Government of India will bear 90% of expenditure of this component that is Rs 5,982.72 crore.The project envisages construction of 148-meter-high rock fill dam, which will store the monsoon discharge leading to formation of a 24-km-long reservoir. The live storage of dam will be 498 million cubic meters which shall be used for supplying drinking water at 23 cubic meters per second to Delhi and it will fulfil about 40% of drinking water requirements of Delhi. It will also generate 200 million units of energy in a surface power house with 40 MW installed capacity, which shall be utilized by Himachal Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/to-be-ready-in-6-yrs-renuka-dam-to-boost-hp-tourism-also/articleshow/88939879.cms||---

Langer was interacting with the representatives of traders' associations here at a virtual meeting as “complete restriction on non-essential movement” during weekends brought life to a standstill across Jammu and Kashmir. The Union Territory on Sunday recorded 3,499 fresh COVID-19 cases, its highest single-day spike in infections so far this year, taking the virus tally to 3,59,373, while six related deaths during the past 24 hours pushed the death toll to 4,567. During the interaction, a healthy discussion was held on issues like enforcement of coronavirus guidelines and Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) in the public places and business establishments with joint efforts of administration and traders, an official spokesman said. The traders apprised the divisional commissioner about the issues which need to be resolved at the government level. The divisional commissioner urged the associations to strictly follow Covid guidelines like wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene during their business activities. He also asked them to ensure that the customers enter their shops with face masks and follow CAB. The traders demanded deployment of more testing teams in market areas and other prominent locations of bazar, engaging volunteers for better enforcement of Covid guidelines, and regular sanitization of market areas, the spokesman said. They also demanded that like previous year the triage centres of districts be activated timely and there should be no unnecessary referrals to Jammu. The traders requested that clarity should be given by the government regarding essential and non-essential services, the spokesman said. The traders said they support strict enforcement of CAB and representatives of market associations should also be made the part of enforcement teams, flying squads for assisting better implementation of the SOPs. pTI||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/support-in-enforcing-covid-guidelines-admin-to-traders/articleshow/88939882.cms||---

At the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), one of the state’s largest tertiary care centres, at least 30 people, including doctors, nurses, medical students, lab technicians etc., have tested Covid-19 positive, said hospital sources. Earlier, healthcare workers on Covid-19 duty at the hospital were given quarantine for up to seven days and tested, but now the state government is yet to take a call on implementing the system. As of now, post Covid-19 duty, doctors are getting quarantine for 3-5 days. Senior doctors at the GRH said that with the current manpower, it was not possible to have quarantine and screening like before and that if Covid-19 cases rise further, it would be even more difficult to allow quarantine. At the same time, those on non-Covid-19 duty have also tested Covid-19 positive as they are exposed to a large number of patients. Dr K Senthil, state president, Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA), suggested that steps can be taken to avoid administrative/academic meetings in hospitals or hold it only with not more than 10-15 people attending. “We urged doctors, medical students and other healthcare providers to avoid coming to duty if they have fever symptoms and isolate themselves. Medical colleges can try to ensure there are separate wings in hostels for isolating those who may have symptoms,” he said. In private hospitals too, Covid-19 cases are being reported among healthcare workers. Hospitals are trying to tighten measures to prevent spread between healthcare workers and patients. “We are continuing with the isolation system. Doctors and nurses on Covid-19 duty are isolated after duty at a quarantine centre we have set up on a rotational basis. They are screened and tested if they develop symptoms. We don’t allow mixing of staff on Covid-19 and non-Covid duty,” said J Adel, general manager – operations, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Center. He added that the hospital has deployed robots in Covid-19 wards to help prevent unnecessary exposure. In both government and private hospitals, efforts are also on to ensure all eligible healthcare workers get their precaution dose as soon as possible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hosps-wary-as-covid-cases-emerge-among-healthcare-workers/articleshow/88939884.cms||---
---||Madurai||Less adherence to total lockdown in Madurai||MADURAI: The adherence to the total lockdown this Sunday was less compared to last week as there was heavy traffic movement in the city and only closed shops proved that it was a lockdown. “We have come to the stage where the government cannot enforce lockdown rules strictly as but people are also unmindful and so not much can be done,” said S Asokan of Anna Nagar. As parcel service was allowed in hotels, many of them saw good crowds in the morning with people queuing up to buy food. “Delivery costs are high even for 2km and it is better to go out and buy the food from a nearby hotel,” said Santhakumar, of Ellis Nagar. Markets were closed on Saturday and buying vegetables was not easy. So this Sunday it was hotel lunch,” he added. Police sources said that though they had questioned some people, they were told they were going for functions, but many did not have any invitation cards with them. Medical shops were open, but did not have a much of a crowd. The movement of vehicles was more in the evening. Though the government had announced that places of worship would be closed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in view of the rising covid cases, many small temples in residential areas opened their doors partially and allowed people to offer worship. “It is just because they think the government is being strict and fail to realise the importance of following the norm,” said R Karthikeyan, a resident of Anna Nagar. Elderly people are also visiting churches in large groups on Mondays and Thursdays, as churches were closed on Sundays.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/less-adherence-to-total-lockdown-in-madurai/articleshow/88939885.cms||---

The Madurai Corporation is yet to start laying the new UGD system for extended wards in the northern part of the city, including Gomathypuram, where the old line constructed under the Namakku Naamae scheme has become overloaded.Stagnant sewage around manholes and along the road like Bharathi street has made it unbearable for residents, pedestrians and motorists alike. “This is because people who are constructing houses are also connecting their sewage to the already overloaded system and that leads to overflow in all the manholes,” said Kannan, a resident. Sabari street in the ward is another place where there is overflowing sewage. The situation is the same on Malligai street in Tahsildar Nagar.“As Covid is spreading and many cases have been reported in Gomathypuram, it is important that environmental hygiene is also given attention by the civic body,” said Sundaresan, a resident.During the monsoon also the area faces sewage problem. “We thought it would stop when the rains ceased, but that is not the case,” said Kumar, a resident.Corporation sources said that they had planned to clear the sewage outlet channel in the next two days and hoped it would provide a solution once it is done.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/overloaded-ugd-sewage-overflows-in-gomathypuram/articleshow/88939886.cms||---

A resident of Kharar, Manohar quit his government job and opened an office in Bassi Pathana about three months ago, evincing interest in contesting the seat reserved for Scheduled Castes. "MLA Gurpreet Singh GP is not a fit candidate for the seat. He has failed to remain in touch with the masses. Channi tried his best to get a Congress ticket for me, but won't be able to support me publicly," Manohar said. "I have been supporting Kisan Morcha and believe the local leadership will support me. I served as a doctor in Bassi Pathana from January to July 2019, but GP got me transferred by requesting the then health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu to shunt me out." On whether Channi had tried to persuade him to not contest elections against the Congress candidate, Manohar said his decision to take the electoral plunge was "as per public aspirations" and that the CM would have to convince the masses if he wanted his sibling to step aside. At a rally in Bassi Pathana on December 23, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had publicly supported GP and said there was no space for nepotism in the party while allotting tickets. "Nobody's brother or sister would get space as GP is here," he said. If he does enter the poll fray, Manohar will also be up against BSP's Shiv Kumar Kalyan, AAP's Rupinder Singh Happy and SAD's Dharam Singh Kalaud, among others. Sources said GP was open to talks with the CM's brother to try and convince him not to contest the seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/denied-congress-ticket-channi-doc-sibling-to-contest-as-ind/articleshow/88939999.cms||Bharat Khanna

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Students on the edge as schools shut||MADURAI: The announcement by the Tamil Nadu government declaring a holiday for Classes X to XII till January 31 has not gone down well with teachers and students, who are worried about the academic year resuming, especially after the revision exam scheduled from January 19 has also been postponed. “Such complete closure of schools again is a matter of concern as it is distressing for students and parents too. Schools are safer than most public places. With schools closed for Classes I to IX, there was no crowding at all. The state government must consider reopening of schools at the earliest as and when Covid-19 cases come down,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). The postponement of revision exam too has come as a setback as the students are worried about board exam preparations. “We were preparing for board exams by studying and practising writing exams in classrooms. Now, again we have to go back to online classes. It is already tough for students this year as we have never written board exams before, but now we are worried if we will even have enough time for revision exams before board exams are held,” said N Vidhya, a Class XII student. Teachers said that at least if the revision exam was held, it would have boosted the confidence of the students. “For government school students, this is a setback. Over the past few months, teachers put in their best efforts to complete the syllabus as soon as possible and ensure students do not develop the fear of board exams. Now, it leaves teachers worried as not all students will be keen to study from home even through video lessons,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. In case of private schools, online classes are to be continued. “Schools will be planning on holding online exams in the next few days. Depending on the completion of syllabus, schools have to plan online classes for students and also hold revision if the syllabus is completed. With only limited number of days left for the academic year, online classes are important to continue learning,” president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation, M Senthilnathan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/students-on-the-edge-as-schools-shut/articleshow/88939890.cms||---

The division bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravi Kumar upheld the Patna high court judgment. Former additional solicitor general (ASG) in the Patna high court, S D Sanjay, said Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta along with ASG Vikramjit Sen represented the state. A total of 2900 acres of land were acquired for the ordinance factory for which the statutory notifications and declarations were published under the old law in 1999. The land were taken under emergency provisions and compensation were announced on June 12, 2001. The amount was also deposited by the central government by mid 2002 to the Nalanda DM. Persuant to certain disputes related to the ownership of the acquired land, the matter went for adjudication which was finally decided in 2010 and all the eligible landowners were called officially under the provisions of old land acquisition law to receive the award. But the landowners challenged the compensation amount in the Patna high court in 2012. During the pendency of their cases, the old law was repealed and substituted by the new law. The Patna HC admitted the matter for fresh considerations under the new law. On the legal advice of the then ASG, S D Sanjay, the defence ministry filed letters patent appeal (LPA), which was allowed by the division bench on April 22, 2019, declaring the demands of landowners for enhanced compensation under the new law as illegal. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the farmers appealed in the Supreme Court, which dismissed it on January 4 this year but pronounced the order later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/sc-dismisses-rajgir-farmers-plea-for-more-compensation/articleshow/88939894.cms||---
---||Patna||No review of prohibition law in Bihar: Minister||PATNA: State education and parliamentary affairs minister and in-charge of Nalanda, Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, on Sunday expressed grief over the tragic death of 11 people due to consumption of spurious liquor in the district. Describing this incident as “unfortunate and shocking”, Chaudhary said people consume spurious liquor and end their lives due to sheer ignorance. “Knowing fully well that there is total prohibition in the state, some people do not refrain from consuming liquor at the cost of their own lives, leaving their family members in the lurch,” he said. The minister said the Nalanda incident has justified liquor ban in the state. He said the district administration should identify all the people involved in illegal liquor trade and take action against them. The minister wondered as to how some politicians demanded review of the prohibition law despite the fact that it has got wide support. “Would these people ever demand review of the laws against heinous crimes like murder, loot and rape? Talking of review of the prohibition policy of the state government almost equals to the demand for review of laws against murder and rape,” he said. Chaudhary called upon the people’s representatives to rise above party considerations and contribute their might in launching an awareness campaign.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/no-review-of-prohibition-law-in-state-min/articleshow/88939896.cms||---

Prabodhanand Giri, president of the 21-member core committee of seers which organised the event, said that the thin attendance was due to the fact that the event was being simultaneously observed at around a dozen places across the country, including Kashi, Prayagraj, Ballia, Azamgarh, Gazipur and Delhi. Around a week ago, the organisers had claimed that the ‘pratikar yagya’ would be a “grand event, attended by thousands.” However, most seers sought to distance themselves from the gathering. “We are neither for, nor against it,” said Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) general secretary and mahant of Juna Akhara Hari Giri, who was in Prayagraj for the Magh Mela. Meanwhile, Anand Swarup, convenor of the core committee of seers, said, “The yagya is meant to pray for buddhi shuddhi (cleansing of mind) of Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, at whose behest action is being taken against sadhus”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/revenge-meet-held-in-haridwar-to-protest-dharam-sansad-hate-speech-arrests-over-a-dozen-seers-turn-up/articleshow/88937681.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Tenders called for constructing bridge across Vellayani lake||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tenders are called for the construction of Vellayani bridge connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola. The authorities believe the bridge would resolve the traffic disruption along the bund road during monsoon. The estimated cost of the work is Rs 23 crores which will be funded by KIIFB. As per the bid document, the project envisages the construction of a bridge across Vellayani lake connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola areas of Kovalam constituency in the district. At present there is an earthen bund road connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola across the lake.  It has been found that the bund road is being settled over a long period. During monsoon season, lake water flows across the earthen bund road causing a flood like situation which interrupts the regular traffic and creates difficulties in commuting of local people. Due to the continuous passage of heavy vehicles, it is susceptible to further settlement which may topple the road eventually. Therefore, the construction of a bridge is very much necessary at this location, the document says. The government had accorded administrative sanction for an amount of Rs 25crores for the construction of Vellayani bridge in 2017. Accordingly the detailed survey and soil investigation works had been carried out and the tentative design drawing was obtained from the design wing of the PWD. Based on this the DPR for the bridge work had been prepared and submitted to the KIIFB and financial sanction was accorded. For the execution of the bridge work, the existing utilities of KWA, KSEB and BSNL passing through the alignment of the bridge will be shifted. In the DPR submitted to KIIFB for financial sanction, the provision for shifting the utilities of KWA, KSEB and BSNL had also been incorporated based on the estimates received from the respective departments. A pumping main station of KWA is also located near the existing bund road adjacent to the bridge alignment from where the water of Vellayani lake is pumped and carried to the nearby treatment plant and the treated water is carried back to different destinations through the pipe lines passing through the existing bund road connecting Poonkulam and Kakkamoola. For the construction of the new bridge, these pumping mainlines of KWA also need to be shifted. KWA has submitted an estimate for temporary shifting of these pipe lines for the commencement of the bridge work and for relaying the pipe through separate structure provided as per the requirement from KWA. A service road is also provided for accessing the pump house. Provision is given for relaying the 300mm DI pumping main line pipes by supporting an additional steel structure outside the bridge alignment by supporting on the extension of the pile cap of the new bridge. The construction of the bridge is expected to be completed in 18 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tenders-called-for-constructing-bridge-across-vellayani-lake/articleshow/88938294.cms||---

Police said Nishu, who was a named accused in an FIR lodged by her husband Vajesh around four years ago, was arrested from her residence in Deepnagar locality of Bhagalpur town on Saturday and produced before a court which sent her to jail. Nishu earlier used to run a social organization to help women, before formally joining the RJD two years back. Her husband Vajesh, who is the grandson of former minister Jageshwar Mandal, had lodged an FIR with Jogsar PS (Bhagalpur) on February 22, 2018, alleging that she attempted to kill him by mixing poison in his food. Mandal was cooperative, rural development, excise and prohibition minister in the Karpoori Thakur cabinet. “Police found the charges levelled against Nishu as true. One of the former SPs had also ordered for her arrest. But a former DIG of Bhagalpur verbally asked not to arrest Nishu. Then, one of the deputy SPs told me that charges against Nishu had been found true, but we did not arrest her because of the DIG’s verbal order,” Vajesh said. Vajesh said a sub-divisional court had issued a warrant of arrest against Nishu. But the police were reluctant to arrest her. “She was arrested after Babu Ram joined as Bhagalpur SP recently ,” Vajesh said. “Nishu was suspended from the post of women cell’s district president at the directive of the RJD state president Jagdanand Singh,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari told TOI on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bgalpur-rjd-women-cell-chief-held-for-bid-to-poison-husband/articleshow/88939900.cms||Madan Kumar

While some saffron party and HAMS functionaries reiterated the demand for review of prohibition law in the state, Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal alleged that Nalanda district administration and police were hand in glove with the liquor mafia. “If the state administration wants to enforce prohibition, it should first arrest the senior officer of Nalanda district administration who issued a wrong statement about the reason behind hooch deaths. The administration’s main job is to run the district and not to issue statements. It reveals that the administration is hand-in-glove with the liquor mafia,” read a social media post of Jaiswal on Sunday. “The second culprit of hooch deaths is police which allowed open sale of illicit liquor. The police officers should be jailed for 10 years as per the provisions of the prohibition law. The police officers should not be suspended only for two months and get fresh posting in another police station,” Jaiswal said. “The culprit is the liquor mafia as they ensure sale of illicit liquor at different places. Ensuring arrest of liquor mafias is an easy task. If police officers are questioned in police method, the names of liquor mafia will come out. If the state administration wants to uproot the illegal trade of liquor, it will have to destroy the illegitimate troika of administration, police and liquor mafia,” Jaiswal said. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) reiterated its demand for review of the prohibition law, while another BJP leader criticised CM Nitish Kumar for not listening to the allies’ demand of review of the prohibition law.“If you want your allies along with you to run the government, listen to them too. We asked the CM to review the prohibition law. Is that a wrong question to ask? He has double standards and it won't work,” state president of the BJP’s SC Morcha Ajit Choudhary told mediapersons on Sunday. JD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar criticised the BJP netas for their statements and wondered if the saffron party was not part of the coalition government in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hooch-deaths-bjp-questions-liquor-policy/articleshow/88939902.cms||Madan Kumar

The recovery rate is the percentage of cured patients of the total positive cases in a geographical area.According to the local media bulletin, the cured percentage of Ludhiana on January 15 evening was 91.01, which is the lowest after May 28, when it was recorded at 90.90%. This month’s data shows that the cured rate was around 97.46% on January 1; 97.04% on January 5; 94.43% on January 10 and 92.46% on January 13.The rate was 97.50% on December 31 last year; 97.57% on November 30 last; 97.58% on October 31 and September 30 last; 97.59% on August 31 last; 97.55% on July 31; 97.23% on June 30 last; 92.54% on May 31 last; 83.03% on April 25 last; and 94% on March 1 last.An official of the health department said, “As the number of cases has increased significantly and lesser patients are recovering, the cured rate has fallen.

---||Ludhiana||Colonies’ info on MC website hits font hurdle||Ludhiana: The municipal corporation has uploaded important information about authorised and unauthorised colonies of the city on its official website, but language barrier is hampering people from understanding it. Some of the information is in Punjabi fonts which are not readable for the devices that do not have those fonts. An RTI activist claimed that officials did this intentionally, so that actual information does not reach the masses. Recently, the state government had asked the MC officials about the legal and the illegal colonies of the city. A report was prepared and uploaded on the MC website. It contains information about authorised colonies as well as the new and the old ones which were transferred to the civic body through Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) and town planning schemes of the MC. Details about illegal colonies have also been mentioned along with their current status, that is, whether their developers have applied for regularization and completed the process. An official said information was culled from all the four zones and zone-wise lists were uploaded. Some prepared it in English and some in Punjabi and the persons who uploaded the data did not pay attention to the required fonts. Simply scanned documents could also have been uploaded to avoid confusion, he added. RTI activist Kuldeep Khaira, who has been fighting against illegal colonies, said, “It is good that officials brought information in public domain so that people can have knowledge before putting in their hard-earned money. But what’s the use if people are not able to read it. This has been done intentionally, as they do not want to share anything with people. Glada had been uploading lists of colonies on its website for the past so many years, and there has been no font or language issue.” Anoop Kumar, a Haibowal resident, said, “People do not have time to first download fonts and then check information. Authorities can at least upload the fonts along with the information.”Despite repeated attempts, senior town planner SS Bindra could not be contacted for comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/colonies-info-on-mc-website-hits-font-hurdle/articleshow/88939916.cms||---
---||Mumbai||11 flats, land worth Rs 410cr of Omkar Group attached||Mumbai: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached Omkar Group’s eleven flats collectively worth over Rs 330 crore in tower-C of Omkar-1973 building at Worli and land worth Rs 80 crore at Viram in Pune of actor-businessman Sachin Joshi in a money-laundering case.  Sources said each flat of Omkar-1973 is spread over more than 10,000 sqft and conservative estimate price of each is over Rs 30 crore. These unsold flats were in possession of Omkar Group. Omkar group had allegedly manipulated the total number of slum dwellers at its Wadala Slum Rehabilitation Authority scheme project which helped them to increase FSI on the plot. The Omkar group allegedly took Rs 410 crore loan from Yes Bank after creating a notional saleable area in the project and laundered the money through their other projects and Joshi. ED alleged Omkar group had used FSI of the Wadala project in their luxurious Worli building. Earlier, ED arrested Omkar group promoters Babulal Varma and Kamal Kishor Gupta and Sachin Joshi, promoter of JM Joshi group, in the case. Varma and Gupta are in jail custody while Joshi is out on conditional bail. A press note issued by ED on Saturday said, “During investigation, it was found that loan amount Rs 410 crore was fraudulently acquired by Surana Developers Wadala, a sister concern of Omkar group, through falsely increased slum dwellers numbers and FSI. Of Rs 410 crore, Rs 330 crore was laundered into the sale building of Omkar Group and Rs 80 crore was laundered through Sachin Joshi and his Viiking Group of companies under the guise of services and investment.” Last March, ED chargesheeted all accused with their associate companies. The chargesheet stated that total number of eligible slum-dwellers was manipulated in 2016 after Omkar group took over the Wadala project. Thus, FSI of the plot increased from 2.05 to 4. ED alleged that Omkar group had created a notional 3.5 lakh sq ft saleable component on the Wadala plot with manipulated documents and mortgaged it with Yes Bank for taking Rs 410 crore loan for the project. ED accused Omkar group of not using money for the Wadala project and diverting it to other group companies and associates. The chargesheet said FSI of a project can be transferred to another after construction of rehabilitation building. It said, “However by false representation in connivance with SRA officers, the accused got nod of SRA to club FSI of the Wadala project with Worli project.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/11-flats-land-worth-rs-410cr-of-omkar-group-attached/articleshow/88920851.cms||Vijay V Singh

He had told media persons in Sitapur that he would “contest the assembly elections and win.” In a video, Abdullah, who is likely to contest from Swar seat, can be heard saying, “See this is democracy here. People are stopped in the name of model code of conduct and Covid protocol.” Abdullah said, “This election will be people versus government. People are facing trouble due to inflation, unemployment, law and order situation; and they will vote against the ruling party as so much injustice was done to them. BJP is a sinking ship and this is why many people are deserting the party. They (BJP) even ill-treated their own people.” According to jail authorities, Abdullah’s release order was received earlier but there was a discrepancy in it. A fresh order was sent from a Rampur court paving the way for his release.  Sharing his experience in jail, Abdullah said, “We were kept in an 8x8 ft prison cell with a small toilet inside. I’m out, but my innocent father is still in prison. We have gone through ‘tortures’ in jail and have suffered so much pain that can’t be described. My father’s life is in danger in jail, and if anything happens to him, the government will be responsible.” Abdullah is facing charges in several cases, including forgery, and was in prison from February 2020. He was elected to the assembly from Swar in 2017, but the Allahabad HC in 2019 annulled his election as MLA after it was found that his age was less than 25 and was not qualified to contest the election. Abdullah’s father, Azam Khan, is still in jail, while his mother, Tanzeen, was granted bail in December 2020. Abdullah was booked in 43 cases, while Tanzeen in 34 cases, including forgery. Azam Khan has been booked in over 100 cases, and has been granted bail in most of these cases.

---||Nagpur||Futala to have garden like Butchart, revolving hotel||NAGPUR: “People say I am crazy, but that is how I work. The musical fountains at the Futala Lake could have come for Rs10 crore, but Rs150 crore are being spent, taking the total project cost to even Rs450 crore to make it world class,” said Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday. Gadkari said inspired by the Butchart Gardens in Vancouver, Canada, visited by millions annually, he wants to make the world’s top garden near Futala Lake. The minister was speaking at a function organized by Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) and Lemon School of Entrepreneurship, a startup mentoring company from the city. “I was told by the architect that Futala garden would pip the gardens in Dubai also,” he said. The minister presented his ideas that include a revolving restaurant at Futala Lake and an island in the middle. It would be a platform of around one acre where people can reach by boat and hold events like marriage functions etc, he said. A high-cost lake beautification project with musical fountains and a viewers’ gallery is already underway at the lake site. “There is Botanical Garden of the Panjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) near Futala. I have plan to make a convention centre in 100 acres of land there. The world class garden with different specifies of flowers would also be there,” he said. “I know nothing of engineering, yet there are three world records in my name. First is fastest construction of 40-km road; building 2-km four-lane concrete road in a day and laying bitumen in 22km track in mere 22 hours,” said Gadkari. The minister also provided food for thought for those with entrepreneurial acuity and advocated use of new age technologies to produce green hydrogen at the village level itself without huge investments. Gadkari spoke of producing green hydrogen out of waste water at villages by generating power through windmill installed right at the sewage treatment plant. “All you need is out of the box thinking along with acquiring proven technology and ensuring availability of raw material,” he said. Gadkari, who had earlier pushed the idea to operate cars using green hydrogen, also envisioned aeroplanes and trains being run on the green fuel. “Coal can be replaced by green hydrogen to operate cement and steel factories,” he said. “I have come across some youngsters from the US, who are making electrolyzers (system that uses electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen) in Bengaluru. However, 90% of the equipment are being sent to the US. I asked them to provide the electrolyzers to India,” he said, spelling out an entire scheme to produce green hydrogen with a rather low input cost. The minister said, “Dirty water in villages can be treated by solid waste and liquid waste management plants right at the spot. The sheds for solid waste management can have rooftop solar modules and also a small windmill. This will ensure (solar) power supply at Rs2 a unit, while water would be free. Power is the most important input in making green hydrogen for which electrolyzers can be used.” “Cement and steel factories, which presently use coal, can also be run on green hydrogen apart from aeroplanes, railway engines and even trucks and cars. This will not only reduce the dependence on import of fossil fuels, but also go a long way in reducing pollution,” said Gadkari, highlighting the situation in the national capital where pollution has become a major challenge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/futala-to-have-garden-like-butchart-revolving-hotel/articleshow/88938694.cms||Shishir Arya

On Sunday, former Congress councillor Parminder Mehta, who is also OSD to mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, conducted a press conference and requested the Congress leadership to reconsider the ticket to MLA Surinder Dawar in central constituency. He claimed that report of Dawar is not up to the mark. Mehta had also highlighted the corrupt practices of MLA earlier also. He claimed that he gave everything in writing to the senior leadership. But surprisingly party leaders did not conduct any inquiry and he has been given the ticket again. He said many names in the candidates’ list are of those against whom several complaints are going on. He alleged that Dawar’s acts have damaged the image of the party. He alleged that Dawar attack his opponents with fake police cases in which some of the party workers are also included. Mehta also alleged that party gave tickets to such MLAs fearing that they might go to Captain Amarinder Singh's party. “But such corrupt people can go even after winning elections,” he added.However, Dawar said allegations are baseless. “Mehta is an opportunist who left Congress for BJP.

Students of colleges strongly condemned the decision taken by the state government to close colleges and universities till January 25 and demanded reopening of educational institutions as it badly affected their studies. Jagjit Singh, a PAU student, said, “The students oppose the decision taken by the government to discontinue the offline education once again.” According to him, they have been taking the necessary precautions and are fully vaccinated. “We have already suffered a lot during last year’s lockdowns as online classes were not enough to finish the syllabus. On the one hand, there is no clarity on the schedule of the digital classes and on the other, there are many students who do not even have smartphones or internet packs to attend the classes,” he added. Moreover, he said other services, including multiplexes and transport services, are functioning. Only institutions of higher education have been kept closed, allege the students. “The government is creating an atmosphere of fear in the state by closing down educational institutions in the wake of the third wave. It is affecting our studies and our placements. It is being used as a means to keep students away from political activities,” said another student Mansi. Gagandeep Singh, student of SCD Government College, said, “If political rallies and meetings could be organised amid Covid, then why there is ban on educational institutions? The government should allow opening of colleges for at least limited hours and students should be called in a phased manner.” According to him, online education cannot be a substitute for education received in classes, as it is important for students to have access to classes, libraries, playgrounds and labs for the overall development. “However, instead of chalking out a plan on how to reopen the institutions, the government is running away from its responsibilities and boosting online education,” added Gagandeep. Principals of private schools are also against the government decision and want opening of schools with consent of parents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/students-demand-opening-of-colleges-for-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/88939921.cms||Mehak Jain

Of this, 622 (40 %) students have got their first dose only and 115 students are fully vaccinated. A principal of a CBSE school said, “Practice by self is really important, first parents have to get themselves vaccinated and then share about the experience with their children. Also, schools can demand certificates from such students. Even colleges and universities have made it compulsory to provide vaccine certification. In the end, we all have to convince them and educate them . If such students who are over 18 are not vaccinated, we have to push students who are above 15 really hard.” The number of students is really low in private schools so it would not be that difficult, states private school teachers.District education officer Secondary Lakhbir Singh Samra said, “We have a target to cover the students who are above 15 . Once schools are open, they will be asked to organise special vaccine drives through block nodal officers.” Dr Puneet Juneja, district immunisation officer, said, “Students have to motivate themselves to get the vaccination. Anyone above 15 can get themselves vaccinated so they should definitely avail the facility by visiting nearest centres.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/60-of-school-students-above-18-are-not-vaccinated/articleshow/88939922.cms||Mehak Jain

Most of them are eager to know whether they will get the ticket or not so that they could start campaigning. The high-level meetings among senior leadership are already going on and next screening committee is also going to meet for reaching conclusion. The BJP was waiting for the Congress to announce its candidates.

But the Congress did not displease the sitting MLAs and most candidates have been repeated. In Ludhiana district, BJP had only three seats earlier, but now they have to select candidates for all 14 seats, so it is proving a little difficult for them, said sources. The party has candidates on urban seats, but in rural areas they are struggling. The sources among BJP revealed that very shortly first list will be released by party leadership and before January 21, all tickets will be announced because then nomination process will start. District president of BJP, Pushpinder Singhal said, “The process is going on and will be finalised shortly.

Adolescent vaccination is making impressive strides across the country. A total of 3.31 crore children in the age bracket of 15 to 17 years have already received their first dose, accounting for almost 45% coverage, just 13 days into the drive on January 3 this year. “We aim to cover all the 7.4 crore adolescents in the 15-17 age bracket with the first dose by January-end so that we can start vaccinating them with the second dose from early February and finish the second dose by February-end. We want to start vaccinating children between 12 and 14 years from February-end or early March,” Dr Arora said. Children aged 12 to 17 are quite like adults, experts said. “So, the decision was mainly taken to protect the adolescents in the 15-17 group first. Once their full vaccination is done, the government will take up the policy decision to include the next age group, which is the 12-14 bracket,” he added. Experts hail move of jabs for 12-14 age group from FebruaryDr N K Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation on Sunday said that the drive is set to start for the 12-14 age group from February-end. Immunising adolescents is important as they are mobile. They go to schools, colleges, mingle and run a high risk of acquiring infection, particularly due to the fast-paced Omicron variant of the coronavirus. This is why the government prioritised this group from the under-18 category, experts said. “Expanding the ambit of children’s vaccination is a welcome step. The government should also consider prioritising vaccination of comorbid children in the 5-14 age group,” said Dr Pramod Jog, former national president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, being given to adolescents (15-18 group) has the Centre’s Emergency Use Approval for children in the 2-18 group. The vaccine has been found safe and effective in children’s trials in the 2-18 age bracket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/vax-for-12-14-group-likely-tostart-by-march-ntagi-chief/articleshow/88939924.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Growing Covid cases among elderly a worry, swift care must, say doctors||PUNE: The percentage of senior citizens falling sick with Covid has been increasing steadily in Maharashtra over the past 15 days, daily reports from the state’s Medical Education and Drug Department (MEDD) have shown. The trend, experts said, is worrying as the elderly are more likely to get the severe disease. They have called for increased focus on the healthcare needs of this age group, especially those with pre-existing conditions. “Despite having a relatively high younger population, Covid cases are steadily rising among the state's elderly, which might put strain on healthcare infrastructure if they are not treated in time,” a senior health official, who requested anonymity, said. Coronavirus live updatesGoing by the state's report, Covid has affected 17% of the state's total population in the 60-90 age bracket. But when we break down the 71.08 lakh Covid cases into age groups, about 42% of the total cases are in the 60-90 bracket, the report stated. “So, early monitoring of infected senior citizens, most of whom are in home isolation, is more important as they have higher chances of developing severe Covid due to conditions such as diabetes and hypertension,” said epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee. Read AlsoCovid-19: India reports 2.58 lakh new cases, 385 deaths; Omicron tally at 8,209India on Monday reported 2.58 lakh new Covid-19 cases, while the active cases rose to 16,56,341 according to the Union health ministry data. 8,209 cases of Omicron variant have been reported across 28 states and union territories. Maharashtra has most number of Omicron cases with 1,738 infectionsDr Banerjee said, “Covid continues to cause asymptomatic or mild disease in the young while elderly are likely to get more severe forms of the disease. While this factor (having a younger population) may cushion the ‘third wave’ to some extent compared to the West, we have a higher proportion of undetected diabetes and hypertension in our middle-aged population as these two conditions affect our population a decade earlier than their Caucasian counterparts due to genetic and racial determinants.” Read AlsoNewer targeted kits could help catch Omicron quickerThere is an urgent need to use new screening tests that can specifically detect the Omicron variant within the shortest possible time in order to check the rampant misuse of shots of monoclonal antibodies.Dr Rahul Pandit, director (critical care), Fortis Hospitals, Mumbai, and a member of the national Covid task force said, “Majority of the patients who are vulnerable to Covid are the ones whose immune systems are weak and those who also have a comorbidity, which formulates the population which is above 50-60 years of age. We need to protect them when the third wave is in progress.” Read AlsoCovid peak has been reached in Mumbai: Task force doctorWhile the number of Covid-19 cases continued to drop for the third consecutive day in Mumbai, the daily toll rose to double digits - 11 - after five months. On Saturday, 10,661 cases were registered in Mumbai as against 11,317 on Friday. On Sunday, the city is likely to cross the 10-lakh mark forMost hospitals treating patients in their ICUs also have a high number of elderly with comorbidities. “Of the eight patients in our ICU, six are above 60.

---||Pune||Pune: Over 9,000 pay Rs 45 lakh in fines for ignoring Covid norms||PUNE: Over 9,000 citizens were fined by the police and officials from the civic bodies of Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and in Pune rural for failing to follow Covid rules such as wearing of masks and not spitting in the public places. The special drives were conducted from January 6 to 12 and more are underway. Data from the district health office said that 95% of the action was taken by the police department, while the Pune civic body fined 300-odd citizens of the 9,267 people. A fine of Rs 45 lakh was collected from the violators. The data revealed that in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, around 312 actions were taken by the civic body, while the police department were stricter with around 5,491 actions. The PMC’s action yielded a fine of Rs 1.56 lakh, while the police department’s action yielded a fine of Rs 27.45 lakh. In the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits, where green marshals have been introduced now to strictly monitor Covid rule violators, saw least actions taken by the civic body or the police department. The PCMC took action against 69 people, while the police took action against 300 people. The district health office in the review meeting with the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar last week had suggested that the action against the errant citizens need to be increased further. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said that such rules are the need of the hour, but for everyone. “We can see common man getting caught for violating the rules, however, the government and the civic bodies must also answer about no action against politicians, their rallies and its participants. It needs to be aggressive on all the violators.” In Nashik, the rural police have started taking action against people moving about in public places without wearing masks or not following social distancing. The action was carried out mainly in areas under Malegaon, MIDC Sinnar and Yeola police. Superintendent of police Sachin Patil has instructed the rural police to set up check points and patrol various parts of the district especially those bordering other districts to check if people are following Covid norms. Those flouting the norms are being booked under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and other relevant sections of Disaster Management Act 2005.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/over-9k-pay-45l-in-fines-for-ignoring-covid-norms/articleshow/88939926.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Barely 0.9% of 1.13 lakh eligible beneficiaries in rural Pune have received the precautionary dose so far. The government started offering precautionary doses from January 10, but ZP officials said the response in these parts has not matched expectations. Dr Abhay Tidke, district immunisation officer, said response from the 60-plus group has been poor due to many reasons. He said, “One of the main reasons has been lack of awareness about the third booster dose. We have asked our officers at sub-centres and heads of primary health centres to contact everyone eligible in their limits." As per the ZP's records, Pune rural has 1.13 lakh expected beneficiaries. From this number, only 1,069 have been given the third dose so far. In PMC limits, 2,522 have been vaccinated out of 56,355 and in Pimpri Chinchwad, 796 have received their boosters out of 95,730. Lack of manpower has also been a problem, officials said. “Some of our staff are on active Covid duty. This has impacted vaccination coverage of this age group,” a senior doctor at a PHC said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/zp-plans-special-campaign-to-boost-third-shot-uptake/articleshow/88939927.cms||Sandip Dighe

Around 50,000 people out of them have come back and rejoined work and around 20,000 people are working on a temporary basis,” said Ganesh Shetty, the president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association. He added, “The rest either never came back or changed profession after the restaurant in which they worked never opened or were not hired back by the outlet. The number of patrons has already dropped by an average of 30%. In such a scenario, outlets will have to let go more people.” According to the revised restrictions, which came into effect after the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, restaurants have been asked to operate at 50% capacity and remain open till 10pm. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said a call on lockdown will be taken next week. “Before the pandemic, there were around 8,500 different kinds of hotels and eateries in both the corporation areas. At present, the number stands at 6,000. Many restaurants in Hinjewadi, Baner, Balewadi have not opened as they are IT hubs and most IT employees are still working from home. Restaurants in malls too are struggling with on and off restrictions of different kind,” Shetty said, adding that business may collapse if there’s another lockdown.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/restaurants-hotels-in-pune-pcmc-areas-may-see-5k-staff-cut-amid-curbs/articleshow/88939930.cms||Joy Sengupta

He then forced her into a physical relation, police said, citing her statement. An officer from the Hinjewadi police told TOI that the incident occurred between December 16 and December 22. “The woman did not tell anyone about it initially. When the man started harrassing her again, she informed her husband and came with him to the police station on Saturday and filed the complaint,” the officer said. The officer said that according to the complainant, on December 16, the suspect had gone to her home. He had recorded her clip without her knowledge. “On December 16, he again went to her house and demanded sexual favours from her. When the woman refused him, he beat her and raped her,” the officer said.

All proceeds from the Keeping Wildlife Wild calendar, published by RESQ Charitable Trust, a not-for-profit organization aiming to minimize human-animal conflict and provide relief to animals in distress, will go towards further rescue, rehabilitation, treatment and release work to be done this year. Sumedh Tarde, head of projects and communications, RESQ, said, “We undertook many rescue cases last year in collaboration with the forest departments of Pune, Solapur, Daund and other districts. It is our hope to carry on such operations and raise funds for the treatment and post-rescue care of more animals through proceeds from the sales of the calendar, which feature some touching rescue stories.” The calendar features 12 such accounts, one of which is that of a pangolin, a scaly-skinned mammal often mistaken as reptile, held in captivity by a poacher. “After members of Pune and Solapur forest departments seized the pangolin from the poacher, it was brought to our treatment center in a poor condition, both dehydrated and malnourished. We had to seek guidance from wildlife experts from South Africa on how to care for it. We put it on a feeding tube, and within 3-4 days, it regained strength. Pune forest department was swift in getting a release order from the court, which otherwise takes long, resulting in these animals staying in captivity. But, the pangolin was released into the forest as soon as it recovered,” he said. The leopard rescued from Hadapsar in November also made it onto the calendar, as did the herd of gaurs that wandered onto a highway in Shirur. The forest department will also focus on the leopard-human conflict, after witnessing many cases of leopards wandering into urban settlements, such as in Daund, over the last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/wildlife-rescued-around-pune-last-year-featured-in-2022-calendar/articleshow/88939935.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said it would ensure that the students from primary section are habituated to reading in English. Gaikwad said, “We are committed to the introduction of integrated and bilingual textbooks in all Marathi medium schools from the next academic year, Std I onwards. I have reviewed the preparedness of the initiative with senior department officials. I have already instructed Balbharti to come up with high quality textbooks that display English text alongside Marathi words and sentences, so that children can learn basic English vocabulary, grammar and syntax. A pilot is already running successfully in 488 model schools of the state.” Director of Balbharati, Dinkar Patil said, “In the future, these students will find it easier to pick up the English language. Hence, it was decided to integrate the textbooks.” Patil said the pilot project in the model schools has been doing well and the response from students is good. Balbharati is also trying to integrate the textbooks with four subjects into one textbook per semester. Students, instead of carrying each subject textbook separately, can carry only the integrated textbook, as per the semester. Zilla parishad school teacher Rashmi Sheth said, “Students will surely benefit from this scheme, but schools should begin offline and they should get the textbooks on time. The initiative is good for the long run.” Balbharati’s website has textbooks are uploaded in PDF format for online access to students who have not received them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/exposure-to-english-from-std-i-in-bilingual-textbooks-from-june/articleshow/88939940.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the Shivajinagar observatory, which covers a major part of the city, recorded a marginal drop in the night temperature at 12.1°C, from the 13.3°C recorded on Saturday. However, the chill factor in the air, particularly during the morning hours, gave a feeling of an even lower temperature. The day temperature of Shivajinagar was recorded at 26.5°C, which was below normal by 3.4 degrees Celsius. The Lohegaon observatory recorded 26.3°C, which was below normal by 3.7 degrees Celsius. The day temperatures for the last two weeks had mostly remained below normal due to the partially cloudy and cloudy conditions in the afternoon hours. As a result, the temperatures had mostly remained 3 to 4 degrees Celsius below normal, the officials added. “The western disturbances one after another are passing via the Western Himalyala region for the last few days. As a result, the western and northern parts of India had been under cold wave conditions. As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there is no strong weather system over the state,” a senior official from the India Meterological Department (IMD) said. “There is upper air circulation over South Konkan and the adjacent areas. The easterly south-easterly wind is bringing moisture over the state. That is why the cloudy amount is increasing in the afternoon hours,” added the official. The Madhya Maharashtra region, including the Pune district, will mostly experience clear sky conditions. In the afternoon hours, it was likely to experience cloudy conditions. Some areas of the city were likely to experience hazy conditions in the late night and early morning hours. “Due to these weather conditions, the city’s day temperatures would likely remain in the range of 27°C to 28°C, which is below normal by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius,” said the official. He also said that at the same time, the night temperatures would hover between the 14°C to 16°C bracket,” said the official. The extended range forecast between January 21 to January 27 revealed that the maximum temperatures would remain below normal due to the cloudy conditions and moisture incursion.

He had also won the MoM award in the Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka in Dubai on December 31. Ostwal has represented Maharashtra starting with U-14s and has not missed a season since.Though three of Ostwal’s five scalps on Saturday were of No. 7 and below, he also removed South Africa’s two top-order batsmen at crucial junctures with lovely deliveries (both caught behind): one was beaten in the air and the other was hurried into playing a cut shot. His coach Mohan Jadhav said the last few months have seen the rise-and-rise of 19-year-old Ostwal.“From a selection tournament to re-entry into the Maharashtra U-19 probables; from the Vinoo Mankad trophy to the BCCI Challenger team; and from the triangular tournament to the Asia Cup and World Cup, this has been a stunning season for Ostwal,” said Jadhav, who has seen the young man from age 10. “Once, he was not in the list of state probables earlier this season, his whole approach changed. He decided not to take things for granted and built his way up brick by brick. When cornered or put under pressure, he always bounces back.”MCA secretary Riyaz Bagwan said he was never ‘dropped’ from the probables list and it was just an ‘oversight’. But the player has turned that into a far-sighted decision.“Luckily, there was a selection tournament before the selection matches of the probables. And Ostwal scored runs in those matches, including a hundred,” said Jadhav. “We, as coaches, were always telling him to take his batting more seriously since he plays in the V and drives the ball like a proper batsman. He has been doing that only for the last two years or so. The performance in that tournament turned the tide and then there was no looking back.”Ostwal hails from Lonavla and used to train at Vengsarkar academy in Mumbai. “Soon, the family realised that he didn’t belong the Mumbai’s jurisdiction, he won’t be able to play for them. Hence they came here when he was 10,” said Jadhav. “He used to commute with his father by train from Lonavla to Chinchwad every day. After a couple of years, we suggested they needed to utilise the boy’s time and energy better. Hence they rented a place near our academy.” Satyen Lande, former Maharashtra off-spinner and chairman of selectors of the state team, said, “He has got the loop, dip and spin. He understands the game well. On the helpful pitches, he can be unplayable.“When he was dropped midway in the Cooch Behar Trophy of the 2019-20 season, he came to me and said, ‘Sir, I have done badly. When I get a chance next time, I will show the improved performance’. This attitude was excellent and should be followed by other young players too.”Maharashtra U-19s were runners-up to Haryana in the Vinoo Mankad one-dayers where Ostwal scored 232 runs (average 33, strike rate 86) and took seven wickets in eight games (average 22 and economy rate of less than three an over).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/how-pune-left-arm-spinner-ostwal-grabbed-his-chance-with-both-hands/articleshow/88939941.cms||Amit Karmarkar

According to cyber police, this is a new trend in which hackers are bullying individuals or companies and threatening them with deleting their important data through ransomware.  The hackers claim they have control of the servers of the companies or individuals.  They demand extortion in the form of cryptocurrencies to spare valuable data. “The extortion, if collected, is not done physically. The sender has to transfer the cryptocurrencies from one e-wallet to another e-wallet. It is an easy delivery, easy acceptance, and less risky,” said senior police inspector DS Hake of Cyber police. The police have registered three such cases in the last 12 months in which criminals have demanded extortion in form of cryptocurrencies. Hake said, “Many techies are working from home and they are using laptops and desktops. The techies are using their own internet networks to do the office work. In such a scenario, the suspects hack the laptops or desktops of the individuals using ransomware and unsecured network connections or by sending emails to the victims.” “In two cases, the suspects had taken over the control of the victim’s laptops and demanded extortion in form of cryptocurrencies to release the control over the laptops,” he said adding, “None of the techies or the company paid the ransom and they approached the police with their complaints.” Hake said, “Cyber extortionists compress important files/data stored on the server or computer using the encryption software and then they demand ransom to decrypt or decode. The companies or individuals must not open the suspicious emails having encrypted messages stored in them.” Hake said, “Such cases are hard to crack and techies must take precautions to preserve the data.” According to the police, the hackers are asking users to pay ransom in cryptocurrencies. If the user does not pay within the stipulated time set by the hacker, the amount is doubled. If payment is not made, files are deleted. Police said, the malware not only spreads itself rapidly, but it also evolves quickly to avoid any attempts at mitigation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/hackers-holding-data-hostage-demand-extortion-in-digi-coins/articleshow/88939944.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The revenue of the department was as high as Rs400 crore for December 2021. Many proposals were submitted by December end, as developers wanted to avail the discount.According to the notification of the state government, many people had submitted proposals to avail the discount but they could not make the payment till December 31. After that an additional time up to January 15 was given for payment. Even then many applicants were to pay the premium fees. Now, another extension has been given.

A forest officer identified the deceased as 45-year-old V Arumugam, a resident of Kozhikamuthi tribal settlement. He said it was the tusker named Ashok that attacked Arumugam. Aged 12 years, the tusker was brought to Kozhikamuthi elephant camp near Topslip in Anaimalai Tiger Reserve eight years ago from Arignar Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur in Chennai after it attacked a staffer there. “Arumugam and the tusker had developed a good rapport with each other over the years and he was the one feeding the elephant and taking it out for grazing in the reserve forest for the past eight years. While the tusker had attended the Pongal celebrations at the camp on Saturday, it was stationed away from tourists,” the office said. On Sunday morning, he said, Arumugam fed the tusker and tried to chain its front legs to take it out to the nearby reserve forest. “The tusker suddenly attacked Arumugam with its tusks, one of which pierced through his chest. Other mahouts rushed him to the Topslip primary health care centre, where doctors provided him first aid and referred him to the Pollachi government hospital.”According to the officer, Arumugam was declared brought dead at the Pollachi government hospital. After postmortem, the body of Arumugam was handed over to his family members. The forest department has handed over an initial solatium of 25,000 to Arumugam’s wife. “She had successfully participated in a contest during the Elephant Pongal celebrations at the camp on Saturday and won 500. Her husband’s death has come as a shock to her. We will take steps to provide a compensation of 10 lakh to the family of the deceased. Arumugam’s son has completed BBA and we will try our best to secure him a government job,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/tusker-in-musth-gores-to-death-assistant-mahout/articleshow/88939955.cms||A Subburaj

---||Nagpur||Bid adieu to all coronaviruses soon, says Dr Gangakhedkar||NAGPUR: A webinar on ‘Omicron and Beyond’ organized together by Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) and Indian Medical Association, Nagpur (IMA) on Sunday proved like a booster dose in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the highest authorities in public health in India expressed hope that together we can bid adieu of all types of coronaviruses soon. Padma Shri Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former Chief of ICMR who was the main speaker at the seminar, said that the present wave is likely to reach peak by February and even early because many cases are going unreported. He also said that March will see a sharp drop in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. “The year ahead will have several good developments like a pan-coronavirus vaccine and effective anti-viral drugs,” he said. “Zero Covid strategy doesn’t work. It will backfire if we try to stop virus. It’s most unaffordable too. We must ensure vaccination of majority of population and allow vaccinated population to work normally,” said Dr Gangakhedkar. Dr Sanjay Pujari, well-known infectious diseases specialist said that currently available monoclonal antibodies are not useful against Omicron. “Omicron will cause only mild illness in majority of people. In case of a few unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people, it may led to severe type of disease. Still, there is no point in using favipiravir, ivermectin, hydroxycholoquin, and most importantly steroids,” he said. Well-known specialists in Nagpur Dr Nikhil Balankhe and Dr Rajan Barokar also joined the discussion. Dr Balankhe called for symbiotic relationship with Covid-19 henceforth. Dr Barokar said that the hospitals in Nagpur have already adopted the strategy of 5-day quarantine for Covid-19 positive doctors and health workers. “Daily four or five HCWs are getting detected Covid-19 positive. We allow them to get back to work wearing masks after five days of quarantine,” he said. Dr Milind Bhrushundi, another well-known infectious diseases specialist in city, was convener of the programme. He quoted two recent international studies. “About 50% omicron patients came to hospitals for some non-Covid symptoms and then incidentally detected positive. Moreover, nine out of 10 patients admitted in ICU were unvaccinated,” he said. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, president of AMS, Dr Sanjay Deotale, IMA president, Dr Sachin Gathe, secretary IMA and Dr Nainesh Patel, Secretary AMS also participated in the seminar. More than 500 doctors from city and outside joined it virtually.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bid-adieu-to-all-coronaviruses-soon-says-dr-gangakhedkar/articleshow/88938736.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

This was proved on Sunday as a 28-year-old youth, who is paralysed from waist down after a road accident eight years back, attempted to enter the Guinness World Records by covering the maximum distance in a wheelchair in 24 hours.Though the confirmation is awaited, Kamal Kanta Nayak covered 213 km in 24 hours on a track between Master Canteen to Raj Mahal Square in the city in an attempt to break the previous record of 182 km. Starting at 4.30 pm on Saturday, Kamal continuously rode the wheelchair and took a break of two hours for food, hydration and other needs.“It is indeed a great moment as I could achieve the feat. I thank everyone who believed in my abilities and inspired me to give it a try. I hope this will surely motivate many other wheelchair-bound youths to achieve something in their lives. From this stage I want to promise you all that you are going to see me in the next Paralympics,” said Kamal.“The total event has been carefully documented with video footage of 24 hours, judged by 12 independent qualified witnesses and GPS log for the entire track using various devices,” said Sidharth Daga, member of the Better Life Foundation, a voluntary organisation that works with extremely disabled people. Head of the physiotherapy department of Swami Vivekananda National Institute of Rehabilitation Training and Research Dr P P Mohanty said, “Kamal is one of the miracle stories. After the accident, he was totally demoralised and attempted to commit suicide. But after motivating him, the boy could achieve the feat. He is also very good at sports and proved that disability cannot be a barrier.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/paralysed-youth-bids-to-enter-guinness-records/articleshow/88939965.cms||Minati Singha
---||Bhubaneswar||Dense fog in 17 dists for 3 days||Bhubaneswar: Dense fog is likely to prevail at isolated places in 17 districts over the next three days from Monday evening. The minimum temperature across the state is also likely to drop by three to four degrees Celsius during the period, the Met department said on Sunday. Umashankar Das, a weather scientist at the regional IMD centre in the city, said, “The condition will be favourable for the formation of fog in some districts, including the coastal and interior pockets.”The state government has asked the district collectors to issue an advisory for the police and transport department officials to take necessary steps in their areas for controlled plying of vehicles on the highways during dense fog to avoid any road accident.The office of the special relief commissioner sent a letter in this regard to the district collectors on Sunday.For Monday, there is a forecast of fog-like condition in eight districts spread in the interior pockets. These include Koraput, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Balangir, Boudh and Sonepur. The other districts, which may also witness fog-like condition over the next two days, include Cuttack, Angul, Dhenkanal, Gajapati, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Keonjhar, Nayagarh and Rayagada, the IMD report said.The latest IMD bulletin said the minimum temperature saw a drop at isolated places in the northern interior parts of the state in the last 24 hours.

---||Bhubaneswar||‘Daily caseload lower due to reluctance in Covid testing’||Bhubaneswar: Health officials and doctors said people with mild symptoms are avoiding Covid-19 testing which is reflected in the state’s daily infection graph despite the virulence of the Omicron variant. They said that the rise in daily confirmed cases is on the lower side contrary to the anticipated spike.After reporting 10,000-plus cases for three consecutive days, the state added 11,177 cases on Sunday, a rise of only 321 from 10,856 on Saturday. From 4,000-plus cases, the infections had jumped by more than 2,000 to 7000-plus cases on January 11. The next two days reported 8,000-plus cases. From 8,000-plus, the daily caseload jumped to 10,000 but there hasn’t been an alarming rise. Bijay Mohapatra, director of health services said in the past four days, there hasn’t been a significant jump in daily cases but a week is required to confirm the trend. “People may be a bit reluctant to come for test resulting in no major jump in 24 hours. We have opened testing facilities even at primary health centres for a walk-in test for villagers. In the second wave, we only had mobile van testing. If people’s reluctance is what is keeping the daily increase in cases on the lower side, then it will be known in some more days,” he said. The state tested 77,120 samples in the last 24 hours registering a test positivity rate of 14.49%, almost same as the day before. Dr Manoj Sahu, senior gastroenterologist at SUM Hospital, who oversees Covid management, said he is getting a lot of calls from people who complain about symptoms and ask for medicines. “When I ask them whether they have gone for a test, many are saying no although I invariably advise them to go for one. Given the new variant’s transmissibility, it is logical that daily caseload would have increased manifold. But that has not been the case,” he observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/daily-caseload-lower-due-to-reluctance-in-covid-testing/articleshow/88939969.cms||---

Reminding Dhami that he had himself resigned from post of Leader of Opposition, Phoolka said that biggest reason for his resignation was that Delhi high court had started hearing in Sajjan Kumar case and Bar Council had asked him not to appear in court while holding a Cabinet rank. “At that time, I had resigned without bothering for my political career as this case was my top priority and we also won the case finally and Sajjan Kumar was put behind bars,” he said in his letter to SGPC president. In a video statement Phoolka said that he was not participating in the election then why should he be dragged in the political battle field now. “Fight your political battles on your own,” he said. Phoolka also touched the other issue raised by Dhami that only a Sikh should be Punjab CM. He said that when this issue came up after the Congress wanted to replace chief minster Captain Amarinder Singh, Akal Takht Jathedar had said that it did not matter that who became CM. “Apparently, Akali Dal got this statement issued from the Jathedar and now he is being asked to withdraw his statement. When all parties have endorsed that Punjab should have a Sikh CM, why did the Jathedar take a contrarian on the issue,” Phoolka asked Dhami, while also stating that Akali Dal was shifting its stand on the issue for its political gains.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/phoolka-counters-sgpc-chief-over-aap-expulsion-remark/articleshow/88939973.cms||---

Ashwani Sharma, state party president, said that the bubble of deception by AAP and bitterness between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal will soon be out. Dubbing the exercise as a “devious ploy” to scuttle Mann, Sharma said the real truth would be out soon. “AAP is witnessing intense bickering between its state and central leadership.

Sharma said Kejriwal would not be able to project himself as the CM. Terming Congress’s Navjot Singh Sidhu and Arvind Kejriwal as “men in a hurry to become chief ministers”, Sharma said parties always stood taller over the individual, but the level of ethics in politics had touched a new nadir and ambitious politicians shamelessly and brazenly harped on becoming CM. The august office of CM is a crown of immense responsibility and a commitment towards the welfare of all, he said. “It is the dharma (religion) of every political party to work towards a better future and an equitable society.

---||---||Will create employment opportunities, stop youth migration trend, says AAP's Punjab president Bhagwant Mann||CHANDIGARH: AAP Punjab president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann on Sunday blamed lack of employment for the state’s youth falling victim to depression and drugs, or else immigrating abroad, calling joblessness the biggest hurdle in the state’s development. Mann said earlier, young people used to do jobs or their own business after getting degrees from college and university. But today, due to lack of employment, they are moving abroad, he said, adding that this was because of incompetent governments. He said for the all-around progress of Punjab, it was most important to stop such drain of talent and energy. Criticizing the Congress, Mann said in the last elections, Congress promised to give employment in every household of Punjab. After the formation of government, instead of giving jobs to unemployed youth with degrees, Congress started giving jobs to children and family members of their MLAs, ministers, and leaders, he said. Mann went on to claim that Canada had now become Punjab due to excessive immigration. “Today, there are more Punjabi MPs in Canada than in Punjab,” he claimed. “But all of them have gone there under compulsion. No one is fond of going away from their motherland and family. Lakhs of Punjabis were forced to leave Punjab due to unemployment and lack of security here.” Mann promised that the AAP, if it came to power, would stop this trend of immigration for greener pastures. “We will provide ample employment and business opportunities in Punjab. Employment and salary according to qualification, new opportunities to talented youth for start-ups, so that they can create jobs too. Our aim is not only to provide people with employment, but also to make them capable of creating employment opportunities,” said Mann.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/will-create-employment-opportunities-stop-youth-migration-trend-says-aaps-mann/articleshow/88943044.cms||---

After conducting a virtual hearing of the of the companies – Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) – on Wednesday, the regulator has reserved its order on the decision and tariff order for the financial year 2022-23.According to information, the two companies have projected the amount of Rs 32,334.24 crore by showing a revenue deficit of Rs 1,602.02 crore. As per precedence, this is just a projection but the deficit could be more than what has been projected. UHBVN has projected a revenue of Rs 13,885.75 against the projected ARR of Rs 14,761.63 crore. Similarly, DHBVN has projected revenue of Rs 18,448.52 crore against the ARR of Rs 17,841.90 crore. However, given the credit to fuel surcharge adjustments being charged by discoms and other levies, the distribution companies claim the surplus of around Rs 500 crore plus at the end of financial year 2023.Notably, during the current financial year, the two distribution companies have projected revised estimate of Rs 30,580.86 crore revenue against the ARR of Rs 31,809. 81 crore. Sources said that the projections can be increased by the end of March 2022.In their submission before the HERC, the two distribution companies have assured the regulator of bringing down the aggregate technical and line losses and to augment the system while claming to be revenue surplus at the end of financial years.The officers representing the two distribution companies also elaborated upon the surprise checks, raids conducted on the illegal connections, pilferage of power conducted in the state over the period of past one year and the impact of such raids on the power situation in the state.  Besides this, officials also informed about the status of replacement of smart meters in the state. Referring to Covid times, the two companies specifically elaborated upon the relaxations given to certain categories on levies along with the fall in revenue generation in the certain non domestic categories of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/herc-reserves-order-on-arr-of-two-state-discoms/articleshow/88939981.cms||Manvir Saini

The rule regarding 75% job reservation has been implemented from January 15, 2022. With the implementation of this system, new avenues for employment will open for lakhs of youth of the state in the private sector. In this regard, a dedicated portal has also been created by the labour department along with a helpline number. Companies will now have to reflect their vacancy on the portal, which will be continuously monitored by the government.The deputy chief minister said this while addressing the local Sirsa Club. He also inaugurated the newly constructed employees’ residence and a lounge, built at a cost of Rs 1.50 crore. He congratulated all the members of the Sirsa Club for new additions and said that the club is one of the oldest in the state. “Such clubs will also be formed in other districts of the state. In the future, all possible help will be given for the beautification of Sirsa Club when required,” the deputy CM said. The deputy chief minister said that the Haryana government has already released a tender for setting up a medical college in Sirsa and this work would be completed within the stipulated period. On the surge in Covid-19 cases, he said every possible effort is being made by the government and administration at their level, but it is the responsibility of every person to take special care in such a sensitive situation. He urged citizens to get both doses of the vaccination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/job-quota-dushyant-says-historic-day-for-haryana-youth/articleshow/88939982.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana power generation agency objects to PPAs||Chandigarh: It is not just Punjab, but questions are also being raised over the issue of long and short-term power purchase agreement done by the Haryana Power Purchase Committee through the two electricity distribution companies of the state. The objection has come from none other than Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (HPGCL), the firm responsible for production of electricity through thermal power stations across the state. Notably, Haryana has its own production capacity of 2,582.4MW through the thermal power plants in Yamnanangar, Panipat and Khedar of Hisar districts. This is in addition to the renewable and captive power production.It is alleged that instead of having sufficient arrangements in the state, the distribution companies are purchasing power from third parties. This has not just adversely impacted state owned power generation units but has also violated the directions issued by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) of prioritising state’s own production before going for national bidding, says HPGCL.It is also alleged that this has resulted in forced closure of certain units of thermal power plants to oblige the short or the spot power purchase agreement. “Such incidents not only impact the funcitoning of our units but also cause a loss of minimum Rs 15 lakh per hour to the state exchequer,” said a senior officer. “Besides raising these objections during the public hearing held on January 12, we shall move a fresh application before commission by Tuesday,” a senior functionary of HPGCL said. The matter came to light in the aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) petition filed by HPGCL for the year 2022-23. Notably, HPGCL is one of the four Haryana Power Utilities. HPGCL is responsible for power production while Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) is responsible for transmission and DHBVN and DHBVN are the electricity distribution companies. Surprisingly, the DHBVN and DHBVN have put together a projection of Rs 26,521.36 crore against the budget of 25,518.26 crore for the current year from 137 short term, long term, special purpose and spot power purchase agreements done largely with private players across the country.  Of the total projection of Rs 26,531.36 crore, Rs 10,196.74 crore would be cost of power while the remaining amount would be spent on bringing power to the state by paying the inter-state and intrastate transmission charges charged by various states. “The less scheduling of HPGCL units is primarily attributed to less demand placed by the beneficiary i.e. Haryana DISCOMs to HPGCL. The same is beyond control of HPGCL. HPGCL plants are facing frequent backing downs/ less scheduling due to the improper procedure of merit order dispatch being adopted by DISCOMs, which is primarily based on marginal cost savings and doesn’t reflect the true cost of power to consumers,’’ said HPGCL in its ARR report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-power-generation-agency-objects-to-ppas/articleshow/88939984.cms||Manvir Saini
---||---||Denied ticket, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s doctor brother to contest as independent candidate||PATIALA: A day after the Congress released its first list of candidates, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s brother Manohar Singh, who was denied nomination by the party for the February 14 assembly elections, on Sunday announced that he would contest as an independent candidate from Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib district, where the party has fielded sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP. A resident of Kharar, Manohar resigned as government doctor and opened his office in Bassi Pathana about three months ago, evincing interest in contesting polls from this seat reserved for Scheduled Castes. “I have been holding meetings with my brother Charanjit Singh Channi and decided to contest the elections from this segment as MLA Gurpreet Singh GP is not a fit candidate to win the seat.

---||Chandigarh||Denied ticket, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s doctor brother to contest as independent candidate||PATIALA: A day after the Congress released its first list of candidates, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s brother Manohar Singh, who was denied nomination by the party for the February 14 assembly elections, on Sunday announced that he would contest as an independent candidate from Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib district, where the party has fielded sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP. A resident of Kharar, Manohar resigned as government doctor and opened his office in Bassi Pathana about three months ago, evincing interest in contesting polls from this seat reserved for Scheduled Castes. “I have been holding meetings with my brother Charanjit Singh Channi and decided to contest the elections from this segment as MLA Gurpreet Singh GP is not a fit candidate to win the seat. Moreover, he failed to remain in touch with the masses. Channi tried his best to get a Congress ticket for me but would not be able to support me publicly.

NCR districts, including Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Palwal, Panipat, and districts of Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar and Panchkula have shown an alarming positivity rate of 25 to 28%, the sources said. Despite active cases nearing 50,000 mark, less than 5% hospital beds, including ICU and ventilator beds, are occupied so far. Notably, this growth is manifold if one compares the same with the fortnight ending December 31 where the state saw just 1,702 Covid cases when the third wave had just begun. Haryana witnessed 34 deaths over the past 15 days as compared to the second fortnight of December where only six deaths were reported. On January 15, Haryana’s cumulative Covid count had touched 8,37,998 cases, 10,098 deaths , 7,81,157 recoveries and 46,720 active cases, out of which over 6,450 were hospitalized, including 198 on oxygen ICU and ventilator support. IDSP director Dr Usha Gupta said the growth in Covid cases in unprecedented, but claimed that the situation is still very much under control as the death rate as well as hospitalization is low. “Our extensive vaccination has really worked well as we have achieved 100% of the first dose. Similarly, we are better placed in terms of hospital bed management as well. Lastly, we have even doubled up testing which will ultimately help us weed out this wave too from the state,” said Dr Usha Gupta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/in-new-year-hry-added-close-to-4-3k-cases-a-day/articleshow/88939988.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Guwahati||Covid cases doubling in Assam every three days: Officials||GUWAHATI: Active Covid cases in Assam are doubling every three days, making it a matter of concern for the health department in a state where home isolation is being widely endorsed as the policy in the third wave. Whether the spread is because of the transmission of the milder Omicron variant is not certain, but a huge number of patients in home isolation in capital Guwahati and much higher positivity rate here indicate that people may have flouted rules and the virus is spreading at a much faster rate, sources in the health department said. The health department officials, however, said that a large number of the infected patients this time are not needing hospitalisation or doctor’s monitoring at Covid care centres due to less severity of the disease this time. Nevertheless, the way in which the active caseload in the state is increasing, it can spurt in certain pockets, especially in capital Guwahati, they added. The active caseload in Assam, as reported by the National Health Mission (NHM), Assam on Saturday night (January 15), has climbed to 17,777 — almost double of the 9,253 active cases on January 11. One-fourth of the active cases of the state were in Kamrup (Metro) district under which Guwahati city area falls. Out of the 5,843 active case in Kamrup (Metro), home isolation has been allowed to 5,628 patients. “If the monitoring is not done sincerely, there is high chance of the virus spreading from the home isolation cases,” said a senior health official. Assam's positivity rate touches 9.87%Covid positivity rate is alarmingly spiking in Guwahati city areas as Kamrup (Metro) had a daily positivity rate as high as 16.96% on Sunday. Assam's positivity rate on Saturday was 9.87%. Health department sources said by the time the third wave reaches its peak in Assam or northeast, the spread is likely to be rapid. "The actual caseload perhaps has more than doubled in many places in just a couple of days. Because there have been inputs that many cases are yet to be reported due to low testing. Whereas daily testing was nearly one lakh on many occasions in the second wave, it has hardly crossed 40,000 in the third wave in Assam," the official said. Considering the surge in cases, the state health department has appealed to everyone, whose second dose is due or overdue, to get vaccinated at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/officials-cov-cases-doubling-in-assam-every-three-days/articleshow/88939991.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Assam police arrest 242 ‘unauthorised FIR writers’ after CM rap||Guwahati: Assam police arrested as many as 242 unauthorised “FIR writers” from outside the police stations across the state till Sunday from Saturday evening.The development has come after chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in November had directed the police department to arrest the unauthorised FIR writers.“After the CM’s direction, the superintendents of police of all districts have prepared a list of around 300 unauthorized professional FIR writers, who actually make a simple complaint complex in the FIR by adding whatever they want just for the sake of money. Based on the list, we have arrested the unauthorized FIR writers who will be sent to judicial custody,” said GP Singh, special DGP (law & order).He said, “In the last SP conference held in Duliajan, we have found that the people go with a different complaint and FIR writers reflect the complaints differently by adding words to make the case sensational, which we do not find during or after investigation.”According to reports, 37 such persons were arrested in Kamrup district followed by Goalpara (13), Bongaigaon (12), Nagaon (12), Guwahati (8), and from other districts. The number is expected to rise as the operation is still under way. Last year on November 4, the CM had said that “brokers” within the system need to be arrested to cleanse the system and directed officers-in-charge of all the police stations across the state to arrest unauthorized persons who roam around the police stations to write FIRs and complaints. He had also said such persons who are not authorized are seen in all police stations and they charge money for writing FIR copies which can “never be accepted”.In September last year, Assam police arrested over 500 land brokers in raids conducted across the state as part of the BJP-led government’s crackdown on brokers operating in land revenue and circle offices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-police-arrest-242-unauthorised-fir-writers-after-cm-rap/articleshow/88939992.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Assam: Kaziranga records lowest poaching figure in 21 years||GUWAHATI: The removal of encroachments in contiguous areas and adding those to the forest, round the clock vigilance by forest guards in poaching-prone zones and strict monitoring of the guards are some of the reasons that only one rhino was killed last year in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP), the lowest in 21 years. Park director P Sivakumar told TOI, “Different strategies, including making a few forest areas like Bandardubi in Nagaon encroachment-free and adding those to the park have helped in reducing poaching in the park. Suspected poachers used to take shelter in these areas. Therefore, evicting them was a major crackdown.” He further said round the clock strict vigilance by the Anti-Poaching Task Force (APTF), formed last year to patrol mainly poaching-prone zones, has successfully prevented entry of poachers into the park. He said the Agaratoli and Burhapahar ranges were the two zones with major poaching cases and not a single poaching was reported in Burhapahar. The lone poaching case was reported in the Agaratoli range last year. He, however, said that 300 out of 1,900 forest guard posts are vacant in the park. “Recruitment for these posts will be done soon. This will strengthen the security more,” he added. Moreover, he said a total of 15 forest guards were arrested in the last two years for their involvement in poaching. “Monitoring is being done of the forest guards also so that no one can help poachers or involve in poaching in other ways,” he added. The years 2013 and 2014 recorded highest rhino poaching in the park in the last 21 years. A total of 54 rhinos were poached during these two years. However, the trend gradually decreased.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/kaziranga-records-lowest-poaching-figure-in-21-years/articleshow/88939993.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Uncertainty over Assam tableau making Republic Day event cut||GUWAHATI: Uncertainty looms large whether the tableau of Assam — with the scene where young freedom fighter Kanaklata Barua is seen hoisting the Tricolor — will be selected for the Republic Day parade in New Delhi. With India celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, to commemorate 75 years of the country’s Independence, Assam had high hopes that Kanaklata’s valour will steal the limelight in the national capital. However, even after chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s letter to the defence minister, to help the teenage martyr’s bravery shine in the national capital, the state government is finding it difficult to get an apt answer from the Centre. “The Union government’s defence ministry takes the initiative to showcase glimpses of different states in the Republic Day event and it also appealed to us to select a tableau with the theme Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. Our state-level committee selected the scene where Kanaklata Barua was hoisting the Tricolor, as the tableau. The selection committee concerned told us to make certain corrections in the model we presented initially and we assured them that we would do that. However, there is no certainty yet whether it has been selected,” said state cultural affairs minister Bimal Bora at a news conference here on Sunday. Kanaklata Barua, born in Barangabari in 1924, joined a group of - fighters in 1942 at the call of the leaders of the Quit India Movement. One of the youngest martyrs of the Quit India Movement, Kanaklata, then 17, fell to the bullets of police as she marched towards Gohpur police station in northern Assam to hoist the Tricolour. After warning the brigade that she led from the front, police at the Gohpur station opened fire and Kanaklata was martyred. She has been an iconic figure in Assam — regarded in high esteem but the issue of her statue not being selected for for the Republic Day main event has disheartened many. Despite carrying out the corrections, as desired by the concerned committee in New Delhi, Bora said it is not mandatory that Assam will get a chance to present the tableau in the main event in New Delhi. “Every state of India does not get the opportunity to showcase its proposed tableau each year. It’s not mandatory that every state must be present there,” he clarified. Sources in the state government, however, said if the Assam tableau fails to make the cut for the event, the committee concerned may not even inform the state government. Meanwhile, Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah said, “It’s a big insult to Assam and northeast. Kanaklata Barua was a great freedom fighter and valiant leader at such a tender age. Perhaps, her case was not approved by the RSS and thus, we are most likely to miss her in the national capital.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/uncertainty-over-assam-tableau-making-republic-day-event-cut/articleshow/88939994.cms||Kangkan Kalita

He said the government would build an administrative building, guest house, approach road within one year with an approximate financial outlay of Rs 19 crore in the Batadrava Than. Sarma, as a part of his two-day visit to Nagaon district, took stock of the progress of the construction of the development and beautification project of Batadrava Than. The Batadrawa Than, also known as Bordowa Than, is the birthplace of neo-Vaishnavite saint and reformer, Srimanta Sankardeva. He asked the project engineer and project implementing agency to expeditiously complete the multi-crore project so that the first phase of the project can be showcased this year itself. Union home minister Amit Shah laid the foundation stone of the project in December 2020. Sarma made it clear that the project should be developed in such a way that Batadrava Than can be transformed into a world-class tourist and cultural centre. Earlier, the chief minister offered his prayers at Batadrawa Than and also took part in inaugurating the reconstructed Kirtan Ghar-cum-Monikut at the Than. The CM also visited Srimanta Sankardev Research Institute at Batadrava and took a look at the research materials like manuscripts written on sanchi leaf.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/sarma-as-promised-batadrava-thans-beautification-under-way/articleshow/88939995.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||---||Top Manipur Congress leader goes ‘missing’||IMPHAL: Learning lessons from the bunch of defections by its MLAs and top leaders, the state Congress leadership on Sunday termed BJP poachers and said it is changing strategy by “the day and hour” to rein in deserters. The move comes in the wake of a former MLA and veteran Congress from the valley going incommunicado for the last two days, senior PCC spokesperson Kh Debabrata told TOI. He termed Congress as a powerful party that will not be easily defeated by BJP’s moves. He, however, refused to divulge details of the strategy but said the grand old party’s tact is right on track. “The key to these strategies is understanding BJP’s intentions well enough and we know how to fight back and win with absolute majority and if not, emerge as the single largest party,” the Congress leader said. Admitting that Congress has been battered by the series of defections to BJP, Debabrata said, “What is more unfortunate is that BJP is encouraging the poaching of MLAs despite the anti-defection law being enforced.” He stressed, “We are battered but not disheartened. They (BJP) see us as the only powerful and deep-rooted party which will defeat them in the ensuing polls. Therefore, they plan to poach as many winnable leaders as they can.” Debabrata also predicted BJP’s downfall and said, “Their (BJP) downfall is imminent because they now have too many ticket seekers and they will trigger an infighting that will definitely pull down the saffron party.” He added, “Our target is to win an absolute majority in 60-member House. If not, we will emerge as the single largest party. We are fielding more than 50 candidates and will distribute the tickets soon We will not enter into pre-poll alliances. However, post-poll pacts with NPF and NPP after the election to form the next government are on the cards.” Political analysts assumed that the Congress strategies could include monitoring their leaders and keeping them at bay from BJP members, including those who switched sides earlier.

---||Imphal||Top Manipur Congress leader goes ‘missing’||IMPHAL: Learning lessons from the bunch of defections by its MLAs and top leaders, the state Congress leadership on Sunday termed BJP poachers and said it is changing strategy by “the day and hour” to rein in deserters. The move comes in the wake of a former MLA and veteran Congress from the valley going incommunicado for the last two days, senior PCC spokesperson Kh Debabrata told TOI. He termed Congress as a powerful party that will not be easily defeated by BJP’s moves. He, however, refused to divulge details of the strategy but said the grand old party’s tact is right on track. “The key to these strategies is understanding BJP’s intentions well enough and we know how to fight back and win with absolute majority and if not, emerge as the single largest party,” the Congress leader said. Admitting that Congress has been battered by the series of defections to BJP, Debabrata said, “What is more unfortunate is that BJP is encouraging the poaching of MLAs despite the anti-defection law being enforced.” He stressed, “We are battered but not disheartened. They (BJP) see us as the only powerful and deep-rooted party which will defeat them in the ensuing polls. Therefore, they plan to poach as many winnable leaders as they can.” Debabrata also predicted BJP’s downfall and said, “Their (BJP) downfall is imminent because they now have too many ticket seekers and they will trigger an infighting that will definitely pull down the saffron party.” He added, “Our target is to win an absolute majority in 60-member House. If not, we will emerge as the single largest party. We are fielding more than 50 candidates and will distribute the tickets soon We will not enter into pre-poll alliances. However, post-poll pacts with NPF and NPP after the election to form the next government are on the cards.” Political analysts assumed that the Congress strategies could include monitoring their leaders and keeping them at bay from BJP members, including those who switched sides earlier.

The government has shut down the schools due to rising Covid cases. However, the EMSA had announced that its members would start offline schools with 50% attendance from January 17. Several associations from across the state joined the chorus and announced to start offline classes without caring for any action from the government. Ganesh Naykude, the president of EMSA Kolhapur, said, “Both Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif have requested us to not defy the government order and assured us to hold a meeting with education minister Varsha Gaikwad and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding our demand. As per the government order, the schools will remain shut till February 15. We will wait till next Saturday.” The association has 410 schools under it with 72,000 students studying here. Naykude claimed that the schools conducted a survey of 2,300 parents, which has revealed that 91% of parents want offline classes as their kids are unable to study through online mode and they too are finding it difficult to manage the smartphones, network and data for online schooling. “We have found that online schooling is ineffective. The students are unable to concentrate on their studies and they are distracted by other things on the smartphone. We have therefore requested the ministers to let the parents’ committee of each school decide if they are in favour of online or offline classes, rather than imposing the decision,” said Naykude.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-eng-medium-schools-defer-offline-plan/articleshow/88940006.cms||---

The beat forest guards equipped with GPS-enabled mobile application are walking in forests and recording every animal species and geotagging them. At the end of the exercise, the data from each of the forest guards will be compiled and uploaded online.Samadhan Chavan, field director of Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, said, “The exercise is part of tiger estimation being carried out across India. Both carnivores and herbivores are being recorded in the survey. The survey will end by January 21 and data will be scrutinised before uploading on the website.”Increasing the population of the wild animals is the basic aim of the census. With the help of Wildlife Institute Dehradun, the initiative to enclose 16 hectare from Chandoli reserve forest is being carried out. The animals on which the tigers survive will be put in this enclosure and breeding will be carried out.“As per suggestion of the institute, the prey animals will be bred in the enclosure and excess population will be released into the Western Ghat section. We have spotted tiger in Sindhudurg section and pug marks were spotted in Ajara section.

They should use a helmet which has reflectors.Plans are afoot to ensure a cycle lane on highways and main state roads. The police report informed the commission that efforts are on to ensure the safety of students cycling to school.According to the report submitted by the transport commissioner, there were a total of 1,104 accidents involving cyclists in 2018 and 1,146 persons were injured, including 86 deaths.

The Syro-Malabar synod, which concluded on Saturday, yet again pointed out that 34 of 35 dioceses of the Church switched to the uniform mode of mass, while calling for the immediate unification in Ernakulam too. However, priests and a section of laity of the archdiocese insist on continuing Mass Versus Populum, celebrating Holy Mass where the priest faces the people. The post-synod circulate issued by Cardinal George Alencherry, head of Syro-Malabar Church, was made public on Sunday wherein he said that Mar Antony Kariyil, metropolitan vicar of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, informed the synod that he would issue a circular demanding implementation of unified mass in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese too on January 23. “Synod bishops are unhappy over some representatives of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese expressing their hesitation to make changes in mass facing the people, followed in the archdiocese for years, through methods which are against the discipline of the Church,” said Alencherry’s circular. Athiroopatha Samrakshana Samithi, the body of priests in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, said that the circular issued by the Cardinal which states that the metropolitan vicar will issue a circular on January 23 directing implementation of Synod Mass, was a pressure tactic. “Two priests and two laity members are on hunger strike at the bishop’s house. In over 200 parishes, the vicars and parishioners have taken an oath that they will only conduct mass versus populum. Priests and laity representatives have informed the metropolitan vicar about the situation, and he has promised to bring this to the attention of higher authorities,” said Fr Sebastian Thaliyan, convener of the priests’ organization. The priests reminded that the exemption from the Synod Mass was granted after the metropolitan vicar visited Pope Francis. Syro-Malabar Church however is citing letters from the Oriental Congregation in Rome which clarifies that an entire archdiocese could not be given exemption from implementing the liturgical rules approved by the synod. In the post-synod circular, all priests have been directed to make arrangements to implement the synod’s decision that the bishops of the synod should celebrate mass in the synod’s prescribed format irrespective of where they conduct the Holy Mass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/archdioceses-breach-of-discipline-upsets-synod/articleshow/88940011.cms||---

The film features Niha, a 15-year-old girl, who is tricked into sending her pictures to online predators who morph them and blackmail her for more images. “I know personally of a few cases of students becoming the target of online abuse. In a couple of cases, the victims themselves sent their pictures falling for fake online lovers. That’s when I decided to make a short film which could be seen by all,” said 16-year-old Sreehari who shot the film with his DSLR camera. The film revolves around Niha (played by Neha Saji) who gets a smartphone with the support of the PTA in her school and then gets hooked on to the social media. She gets calls from an online agency stating that they are taking special tuitions and she is added to a WhatsApp group. They request her to put her profile picture, which they morph and start blackmailing her. Sreehari said after hearing about the short film’s theme, the Christ King Convent High School in Ponnurunni agreed to support him and gave him permission to use their campus for shooting. He roped in family friends to play the supporting roles in the film. Sreehari’s first film, made in 2019, titled ‘Puka’–The Killing Smoke was aimed at spreading awareness against substance abuse among school students. The movie was launched by P Vijayan IPS and was screened at all police training camps and SPC camps in Kerala. ‘Hutch’, his next film made during the lockdown was about a kid stuck indoors, drawing comparison to a bird locked in a cage. While volunteering for the Nanma Foundation in distributing food during Covid lockdown, he made ‘Silent Roads’. While making movies is a passion, he prefers to focus on spreading awareness on social issues, said Sreehari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/short-film-sheds-light-on-online-abuse-of-children/articleshow/88940016.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Though the piling works of the project was completed in August last year, not even the foundation works have started yet. The deadline is April 29 and authorities said that it would take more time than that.Source with GCDA said that the steel frame work for the foundation of the buildings did not start after the completion of the piling works last year because the LIFE Mission allegedly did not pass the bill for the contractor, Thrissur District Labour Contract Cooperative Society (TDLC). The bills have been settled recently and works are likely to begin in the coming days. The project, which has missed multiple deadlines ever since it began in 2018, was scheduled to be completed within the deadline of August 14 last year. The deadline had to be extended multiple times again and as of now it is April 29.“All the 430 piles have been erected. The piles are erected at a depth of 10.6m based on the design and the soil test report. The Covid and rains have affected the work severely. But we hope to compensate for the lost time as the prefabricated construction method, which is less time-consuming, will be used.

While the region has about 38% Muslim voters spread across six constituencies in the district, surprisingly the alliance has not fielded a single Muslim so far. It has declared candidates on five seats - all Hindus. Now all eyes are fixed on the lone city seat, and sources claim that this too might see a Hindu candidate "to avoid polarization". This does not seem to have gone down well with some members of the community, who said "this is happening despite the fact that, in the last two years, RLD leaders have been promoting 'bhaichara ' committees, and speeches during anti-farm law agitation appealed for Jat-Muslim unity". Prominent Muslim leaders - Qadir Rana, Mursaleen Rana, Liyakat Ali, among others - who wanted to contest the elections now feel "neglected and disowned". A former SP leader Amir Alam, said: "It is not about whether Muslim politicians will get to fight the election in Muzaffarnagar or not, what matters most is how to defeat communal forces." But there were voices that differed. A young Muslim activist, Javed Abbas, said, "The initiative by SP will avoid polarisation. Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right decision of not giving tickets to Muslims..."SP leader Sudheer Panwar said, "SP never distributes tickets on the basis of religion...Enough tickets have been given to Muslims across UP." RLD's west UP's spokesperson Abhishek Chaudhry said, "Shamli and Muzaffarnagar are considered as one, and RLD has nominated two Muslim candidates in Shamli..." Opposition leader Ziaur Rahman, said, "SP claims it has a soft corner for Muslims, but when it came to electoral representation, not even a single seat was given to Muslims." BSP has announced Muslim candidates in two seats in Muzaffarnagar. AIMIM is also thinking of offering tickets to Muslim politicians. Local politician Faisal Saifi said, “The decision not to give tickets to Muslim leaders will result in a huge loss for SP. Muslim candidates from AIMIM and BSP might gain.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-sp-rld-ticket-for-muslim-hint-of-discontent-in-muzaffarnagar/articleshow/88940019.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Kochi||Kerala: Yet another traffic experiment to reduce congestion at Vyttila||Kochi: A year after the Vyttila flyover was inaugurated, a new traffic arrangement aimed at further reducing the congestion under the bridge and saving time came into place on Sunday. The effectiveness of the new arrangement being implemented on an experimental basis can be known in the coming days. On Sunday, due to lack of awareness many were made to take a detour by police after they reached no entry points. Senior officers said that once everyone is made to understand the new route, the traffic would be much smoother, and commuters can save precious time. The most important diversion that has come to place is for commuters from Palarivattom side trying to go to the city centre. These vehicles should now progress through the flyover and reach the U-turn system arranged in front of Decathlon, Vyttila. After taking the U-turn, the vehicles can take the free left at the junction to head towards city centre. Earlier, these vehicles coming from Palarivattom used to take the road on the left side of the flyover to reach the junction under the bridge and then take the right to go to the city centre. This is no longer possible. Signboards have been erected along the road indicating the same and the previous signboards have been painted over. On Sunday, commuters who didn’t know about the new diversion reached under the bridge. “We diverted these vehicles through the road opposite the KSEB substation along the Vyttila-Tripunithura route so that they can re-enter the highway. These vehicles will then have to take the Decathlon U-turn. Hence, it is imperative that vehicles should go above the flyover to avoid such a detour,” said an officer on duty at Vyttila Junction. Also, on Sunday some of the drivers were seen dangerously taking indiscriminate U-turns on the Vyttila-Tripunithura Road after being diverted on to this road. There was not much traffic on Sunday owing to the holiday, however this will not be the case Monday onwards. If drivers miss the signboard and reach under the bridge then the subsequent confusion can cause congestion. Officers said that these problems will get resolved once commuters get familiar with the new arrangement. “Our goal is for vehicles from Ernakulam to Tripunithura and vice versa to move on by waiting for the signal only once. With the new arrangement we will be able to give more time for vehicles to pass to and fro in the Tripunithura-Ernakulam route. There will be a smoother flow of vehicles from Palarivattom and Ponnurunni towards Tripunithura as well,” said ACP (Traffic East) Francis Shelby. He added that in the morning, the major inflow of vehicles into the junction is from Kaniyampuzha Road and Tripunithura. In the evening this changes and the flow of traffic is high in the Ernakulam-Tripunithura route. “In the evening, there used to be blocks sometimes even till Elamkulam due to vehicles waiting for the signal to go towards Tripunithura from Ernakulam. We expect to reduce this with the new arrangement,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/yet-another-traffic-experiment-to-reduce-congestion-at-vyttila/articleshow/88940020.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: He gave up his ‘jumbo’ idea to foster roosters||KOCHI: Feeding and caring for a pet are one of the most exciting activities for children. For Navaneeth P, a Malappuram native and Class XI student, owning an elephant as a pet was a dream since childhood but as it was unaffordable he looked for a ‘suitable’ alternative. However, he was not ready to settle for a dog or cat or even a parrot or lovebird, like most boys do, as a pet. Instead, he chose to pet roosters and has been doing it for the last five years. The latest among his pets is two-year-old Sivaram, a white leghorn breed rooster, whom he bought at the age of two months. Recently, he bought a hen named Bella as a pair for Sivaram and he has trained the birds to do many things like obeying his commands, riding with him on bicycle, jumping flying to his hands whenever he asks etc. The videos of Navaneeth training the birds and rearing them are doing rounds in social media. Navaneeth’s father Shinod Kumar P, an employee of Malabar Devaswom Board, said that the boy treats the rooster as elephant. He named the rooster Sivaram, a name common among captive elephants, and built a separate shed for him. He gives him a bathe once every week and after that sandal paste would be worn on his face like mahouts do on tuskers. Sivaram is a one-master rooster, similar to single-master dog breeds and obeys only Navaneeth. The rooster even attacks all others in the family, including Shinod. “It was never a plan to rear roosters as a pet but somehow it happened. It was difficult to train it and I made my own training methods by referring to dog and cat trainers’ videos from YouTube. I am now trying to give toilet training to Sivaram and Bella,” Navaneeth said. He said roosters too are loyal and intelligent pets and people should not hesitate to pet them. “After seeing the videos many told me they were amazed to see how well-trained Sivaram is. I even give some training tips to them as they said roosters at their house are a nuisance for them. I also have a beagle dog as a pet but Sivaram is special,” the boy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/he-gave-up-his-jumbo-idea-to-foster-roosters/articleshow/88940022.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Speaking to reporters in Kochi on Sunday, Satheesan said that the CPM was conducting its party conferences without following Covid protocol. “Despite the fact that one of the MLAs who attended the Thiruvananthapuram district conference of the CPM got infected with Covid-19, the party continues with the conference,” Satheesan said. Earlier, the LDF had termed the UDF the merchants of death. Now, who are the merchants of death in Kerala, Satheesan asked. With the DPR of the SilverLine project out, the apprehensions raised by the UDF have been proven right, Satheesan said. “The total length of the embankment of the SilverLine is 62%. Earlier, it was believed to be 52%. As per the DPR, a wall will be constructed along the 200-km stretch of the project. The DPR also says that there may be problems during the rainy season,” Satheesan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cpm-is-spreading-covid-satheesan/articleshow/88940023.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Cong in a fix over deciding on 20 seats||Dehradun: While opposition Congress has formed a consensus on 50 seats in poll-bound Uttarakhand, remaining 20 seats of the state are posing a problem, as per insiders. The camps of former CM Harish Rawat and leader of opposition Pritam Singh are pushing for different leaders for these seats, which include five from Dehradun: Raipur, Doiwala, Rishikesh, Mussoorie and Sahaspur, sources added. In Sahaspur, it was almost certain that Aarendra Sharma, considered a member of the Pritam Singh camp, would get the Congress ticket. That changed a few months ago, when the name of youth leader and zila panchayat member Rakesh Singh Negi, backed by Harish Rawat, cropped up. In Doiwala, Heera Singh Bisht, who had won the seat in 2014 by-poll, was speculated to get the ticket. Now, sources say, an “unexpected and surprise name” may get the Doiwala ticket and Bisht may be shifted to Raipur. In Raipur, Prabhu Lal Bahuguna and Mahendra Negi Guruji are in the race for Congress ticket. In Mussoorie, the Congress is likely to decide between Jot Singh Gunsola and Godavari Thapli. It is a similar situation in Rishikesh, where the party is yet to take a call between Shoorveer Sajwan and Rajpal Kharola. Congress general secretary (administration) Mathura Dutt Joshi told TOI that “it was a healthy competition for the party ticket.” Both Rawat and Singh also denied being at loggerheads. Harish Rawat said, "There are no differences.” Pritam Singh said, "Congress is contesting the elections unitedly and we are on course to form the government."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cong-in-a-fix-over-deciding-on-20-seats/articleshow/88940028.cms||Kautilya Singh

In Dehradun, most cases in the recent past have emerged from Chakrata army area and government and private hospitals. Bahuguna reiterated, “Omicron is not fatal and has mild symptoms. The best way to fight it is to stay vaccinated and follow the Covid norms.” Meanwhile, the number of patients admitted to the Doon hospital and other Covid-care facilities in the state continue to rise with 2,682 more cases.

The seer was apparently offended on being asked a certain question and threatened to have the journalist and his cameraman “beaten up”.

Joint teams of police of Varanasi and Prayagraj zones have been engaged to detect the mischievous elements behind the incident with the help of RPF and GRP.”High alert is being maintained in the zone in view of Republic Day, the ADG said while denying any connection of the incident with the recent recovery of explosives in Delhi and Punjab.Officials said that key-men Ashok Kumar and Santosh Kumar had first noticed the bomb-like object lying in the underpass on the Pali Hargadh railway line while checking the railway tracks on Sunday early morning and had promptly alerted the senior railway officers of Mirzapur.RPF and GRP personnel and cops from Jigna police station of Mirzapur and Manda of neighbouring Prayagraj district also rushed to the spot.North Central Railway Prayagraj division’s spokesman Amit Singh said that movement of trains was stopped on this line at 6.10am in view of the alert sounded by Mirzapur authorities.Around 12 express and passenger trains were stopped at different points, he said, adding that the track was cleared after necessary checking and train movement resumed at 9.15am.The ADG said that the bomb disposal squad was sent to the spot immediately and its crew after checking the object clarified that it was not an explosive but a mischief.The officials are taking this incident seriously as Mirzapur is one of the three Naxal-affected districts while connections of terror modules like Indian Mujahideen’s Tehseen Akhtar Monu with this district had also been detected by agencies like anti-terror squad and NIA in 2014.Many suppliers of explosives for mining in Mirzapur and adjoining areas like Shankargarh of Prayagraj had also remained on the radar of police and other agencies in the past.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/ied-like-object-in-rly-underpass-disrupts-train-traffic-for-3-hours/articleshow/88940041.cms||---

Consequently, there has been a rsharp ise in the sale of tickets, especially for Sugam Darshan due to high demand of pilgrims who did not want to stand in queue for long.KVT’s chief executive officer Sunil Verma said that rise in crowd at KVT led to rise in ticket seekers at a time when Covid third wave started so it was decided to stop sale of tickets to avoid gathering at the ticket centre, although online booking has not been stopped. The crowd inside KVD has also reduced, he said.Before stopping the offline sale of tickets for Sugam Darshan, rituals and aartis in KVT, he said, the entry inside sanctum sanctorum of KVT had already been stopped a week ago in view of Covid pandemic.Following the KVD opening by the PM the temple has been witnessing massive crowding and on January 1 a new record of footfall of devotees was set. As per police records, 3.35 lakh pilgrims entered KVT premises while district officials estimated presence of over five lakh people in and around KVD in a single day.As compared to all past records of crowd in a single day, which ranged between 2-2.50 lakh on special occasions like Mahashivratri or Mondays of Shrawan month, the number of devotees at KVT was maximum on January 1. As per the records, the average footfall of devotees at KVT in normal days remained around 10,000 while on special occasions it has gone above 1.50 lakh to two lakhs in past years except during the two previous waves of Covid-19.But, following the opening of KVD a massive increase in footfall of devotees was witnessed everyday following which the police introduced new traffic regulation and crowd management by restricting the vehicles including of officers of the district administration, police and VIPs between Maidagin and Godowlia crossings. Provision of barricading at Mandir Chowk inside KVD was also made for the formation of queues of pilgrims to minimise crowding on roads.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/sale-of-tickets-for-rituals-at-kvt-stopped/articleshow/88940042.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

While the screening facility has already been made available on the premise of five major malls located in different parts of the city, the civic administration has now decided to provide the free swab collection service at the premises of key government offices and courts. Dr Yashwant Gade, the secretary of the Indian Medical Association, Aurangabad chapter, said it is unscientific to set up swab collection centres at crowded places. “The health authorities should rectify their decision at the earliest. It could lead to more infections if proper care is not taken by different stakeholders,” he said. The offices of Aurangabad divisional commissioner and collector, along with Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court, district and sessions court, are the four newly-added establishments for Covid screening. Besides, the health centres at N-8 and Padampura along with AMC-run Meltron hospital, are other swab collection centres, said an official release. Health authorities ruled out fears associated with setting up swab collection centres at crowded places. “The health centres that were carrying out Covid testing in past invariably witnessed a rush for vaccination and considerable footfall of patients in OPD. Therefore, it will not be prudent to set up swab collection centres at these facilities,” Ravi Saware, in charge of the AMC-run health centre at N-11, said. The health authorities said the swab collection centres have been set up at the premises of malls, government offices and courts where there is no rush usually. For detailed information on swab collection centres and other Covid-related queries, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has asked the citizens to call the helpline number 8956306007. Aurangabad city reports 519 fresh casesThe Aurangabad city on Sunday reported 519 fresh Covid cases. Of these, a maximum of 359 patients are in the age group of 18 to 50 years, show official data.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/after-malls-aurangabad-civic-body-starts-testing-at-govt-offices/articleshow/88940043.cms||---

The justice Bora committee had cleared the appointment of Bamu registrar Jaishree Suryawanshi. Now, Suryawanshi is unlikely to face fresh inquiry which was sought by a section of members of the management council after they rejected the report of the Bora committee. She had filed a petition with the governor under section 9 of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act 2016, challenging the resolution passed by the management council of Bamu on January 18 last year to reject the report. A group of complainants including political activist Nagraj Gaikwad had raised doubts about the selection of Suryawanshi, especially her appointment in 1993-94 to the post of lecturer at a local college. It was alleged that she had obtained her first appointment as a lecturer by deceitful means and therefore she was not eligible for the post of registrar for want of experience. The university-level inquiry declared that both the appointments were in accordance with the law. However, after the request of complainants, the vice-chancellor appointed an inquiry committee under retired High Court justice P R Bora with approval from the management council. Koshyari, in his latest order, said after going through all facts and records available, he found that the resolution concerned passed was not in conformity with the Act. Gaikwad said he has written a letter to the President of India and Prime Minister to overturn this decision. “The appointment is illegal and therefore we demand a fresh probe,” he said. Meanwhile, the District Caste Verification Committee has summoned the registrar for inquiry on January 18. She had said her appointment was legal and she would submit her say before the panel in writing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/guv-suspends-resolution-passed-by-bamu-management-council/articleshow/88940044.cms||---

It will strive to ensure disease-free, good quality sweet lime saplings are planted. Farmers will also be trained in various agricultural techniques,” he said.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: AIMIM & Shiv Sena lock horns over Marathi signboard in shops||AURANGABAD: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s order for shops to compulsorily display signboards in Marathi has sparked a fresh war of words between the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Shiv Sena.  Local AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel has demanded government funding for shop owners to ensure the necessary compliance. “It is a poll gimmick by MVA government to enforce such an order on shop owners, who have already been struggling due to the pandemic. While BJP is hell-bent on renaming cities, the MVA government has an unnecessary interest in issuing such a diktat. Such a move will not ensure jobs for the youth,” Jaleel said. Local Shiv Sena functionary Rajy Vaidya said the city MP should release money from his MP funds to install the necessary signboards. “The MP fund is also a government fund. Instead of begging the government for money, Jaleel must shell out the money from his fund,” he said. The Sena leaders have also threatened that they would take an aggressive stand if shop owners fail to install the Marathi signboards. “The compulsory Marathi signboard is one of the efforts towards conserving and propagating the regional language. The move will inculcate necessary linguistic culture among children and young generation,” Vaidya said. In 2017, the state government had made it mandatory for all shops to have a signboard written in Marathi.While the decision failed to create the desired impact, the state cabinet recently approved a proposal wherein shops have been asked to prominently display a signboard in Marathi. The order concerned states that letters in Marathi-Devanagari script could not be kept shorter than letters in English or other scripts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aimim-sena-lock-horns-over-marathi-signboard-in-shops/articleshow/88940046.cms||---

Man makes small tractor||AURANGABAD: A man in Beed district has become a good example of the ingenuity that is powering start-ups in the country by building an 18 horsepower tractor to tide over the need for a pair of bullocks to help with farming. Speaking to PTI on National Start-up Day, Namdev Anerav (36) of Pimpalner, some 160 kilometres from here, said the idea of a tractor with a width of just 1.5 feet and length of 5 feet came to him in 2008 after the need for a pair of bullocks was stalling farming on his ancestral plot. “Big tractors cannot perform optimally on small plots. To overcome this limitation, I created this small tractor, which runs on petrol and diesel. After a long process of trial and error, I used my welding skills to build the first prototype in 2011-12. The final product can plough, remove grass, break clods of soil,” he said. “I need to deliver 40 such tractors in the next four months, for which I have employed seven people. I plan to start a full scale facility in Pimpalner to provide employment. I started with Rs 1.10 lakh of my own and 28 investors put in Rs 8 lakh. The investment is worth Rs 1.10 crore now,” he said. The manufacturing unit had to be shifted from Pimpalner to Shendra in Aurangabad due to electricity supply issues, he said, adding that his product got patented in July last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/no-bullocks-for-farming-man-makes-small-tractor/articleshow/88940047.cms||---

Yogi, who had been campaigning hard for BJP in the state, confirmed participation only after March 6 when polling for all phases would end. However, on March 10, Yogi was told that Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) returned his passport, saying he needs to be stationed in UP where counting was due on March 11. After BJP registered a mammoth victory, Yogi went to attend the parliamentary board meeting of BJP on March 16. The then BJP chief Amit Shah told Adityanath he wanted to meet him. BJP sources said Shah met Yogi at his residence, but did not reveal anything “special”. Yogi returned to Gorakhpur on March 17 when he again received a call from Shah, who asked him to reach Delhi immediately.

Following a fluid post-election situation, BJP and BSP joined hands to form a government under Mayawati, considered to be Mulayam’s biggest political rival in the state. The BJP pulled out of the government on August 25, 2003, and enough rebel legislators of the BSP left to allow Yadav to become the CM, with the support of independents and small parties in September 2003. BJP insiders said after the 2002 debacle, the party tried to prop leaders like Uma Bharti, Kalraj Mishra and Surya Pratap Shahi. “But the idea did not work and for next 14 years and BJP’s political space kept shrinking,” a party leader said. BJP’s tally reduced to 51 in 2007 and 47 in 2012 assembly elections.

In fact, Arun and Ram Bahadur add to the list of high-ranking officials to have joined the BJP which stormed to power in the politically crucial state with an overwhelming majority in 2017. Earlier, ex-IAS Arvind Kumar Sharma and former UP DGP Brij Lal had joined the BJP. Read AlsoAhead of UP assembly polls, former IPS officer Asim Arun joins BJP in LucknowLUCKNOW: Ahead of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, former IPS officer Asim Arun joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday in the presence of Union minister Anurag Thakur and other party leaders. Welcoming Asim Arun to the party, Anurag Thakur said, "A person who is experienced, honest andA Jatav, the Dalit sub-caste to which BSP chief Mayawati belongs, Arun had announced of taking a VRS on the day when notification for UP polls was announced on January 8. Since then, speculations have been rife that Arun might be fielded by BJP from an assembly seat from his native district of Kannauj. During his service period, Aseem is learnt to have won the confidence of CM Yogi Adityanath who picked him to be appointed as Kanpur's first police commissioner. His father, Sri Ram Arun was the UP DGP during the tenure of former CM late Kalyan Singh in 1997. Sri Ram, who passed away in August 2018, is said to have conceived the idea of the UP Special Task Force (STF).

He is said to have been a member of All India Backward (SC, ST, OBC) And Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF), the ideological fountainhead of BSP founded by Kanshiram. Ram Bahadur, in fact, contested as BSP candidate from Mohanlalganj in 2017 but lost. Like Arun, former IPS Brij Lal, too, had joined the BJP soon after it came to power in UP in 2017. In fact, Arun is learnt to have joined politics at the instance of Brij Lal, who is now a BJP Rajya Sabha member. A Pasi Dalit himself, Brij Lal was also UP DGP in 2010-12 during the tenure of BSP chief Mayawati. He held a reputation of a tough cop and an "encounter specialist". Sources said CM Yogi was in consistent touch with Brij Lal even as he launched a massive crackdown against criminals and mafia. Yogi's action drew opposition's criticism who criticized him for his "Thoko" (knock down) policy. Even as BJP projected an improved law and order situation, Brij Lal got appointed as chairman of state SC/ST commission -- a post equivalent to minister of state. And in 2020 he got a ticket to Rajya Sabha. So is the case with AK Sharma, a Gujarat cadre IAS officer of 1988 batch, who took VRS to join the BJP only last year. Considered close to PM Narendra Modi, Sharma had worked with him during his stint as Gujarat CM and then at the PMO. A resident of Mau in east UP, Sharma got a BJP ticket to UP legislative council. He was later appointed UP BJP vice-president. Sharma, who chooses to stay away from media glare, has been active in the east UP region including PM Modi's constituency of Varanasi. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded the then Mumbai police commissioner Satya Pal Singh from Baghpat. Singh defeated the then sitting MP and RLD chief Ajit Singh by well over 2 lakh votes. He was subsequently appointed as junior minister in the Union ministry for Human resources. Satya Pal again won Baghpat seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this time defeating Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary. Experts point out that bureaucrats getting para-dropped in the poll cauldron of UP is not new. The 1970 batch IAS officer, Panna Lal Punia, a Dalit, made Congress his political home after retiring from the services in 2005. A close confidant of BSP boss Mayawati -- he has been Mayawati's principal secretary in 1995, 1997 and 2002 -- contested from Fatehgarh but lost to BSP's Meeta Gautam. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Congress gave him a ticket to contest from Barabanki which he won. Punia, however, lost the seat to BJP's Prayanka Rawat in 2014. He was then routed to Rajya Sabha.

A close confidant of BSP boss Mayawati -- he has been Mayawati's principal secretary in 1995, 1997 and 2002 -- contested from Fatehgarh but lost to BSP's Meeta Gautam. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Congress gave him a ticket to contest from Barabanki which he won. Punia, however, lost the seat to BJP's Prayanka Rawat in 2014. He was then routed to Rajya Sabha. Retired IAS officer Kunwar Fateh Bahadur was also considered close to Mayawati too had joined the BSP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/in-up-politics-is-2nd-career-for-many-bureaucrats-cops/articleshow/88940049.cms||Pankaj Shah

He cannot create an atmosphere in his favour by intimidating people. They do not want SP goons again,” he said.“Akhilesh has accepted defeat after seeing the first list of BJP candidates, which is a symbol of social justice.
