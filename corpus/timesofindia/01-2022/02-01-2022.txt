This incident happened when a SpiceJet flight took off from Rajkot for Delhi without the mandatory nod on the penultimate day of 2021 — December 30. The directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) is probing this serious lapse. "A SpiceJet Q400 (VT-SUQ) operating Rajkot-Delhi as SJ-3703 on December 30, 2021, took off from Rajkot without ATC clearance. The pilots have been off-rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation," said people in the know. A senior DGCA official said “strict action” will be taken against those found responsible for the lapse based on the outcome of the probe. A SpiceJet spokesman said, "Pilots have been off rostered pending an inquiry." A senior pilot said, "A serious thing has happened, a plane taking off without ATC clearance. The probe will ascertain how this happened and who is at fault. Was it a communication gap, error or something else needs to be found as such a thing cannot be allowed to be repeated." ATC gives clearance for an aircraft to land or take off after ascertaining, among other things, that the runway is clear with no vehicle, other plane or person being there. "Pilots initiate push back of an aircraft after getting ATC nod. Then engine start-up is also done with their permission. The ATC then gives permission to line up (be absolutely ready to take off) and subsequently to take off. Confusion sometimes happens between clearance for line up and take off," said another senior commander. A number of runway incursions have happened due to the confusion between which of the two nods — line up or take off — have been given to the crew of an aircraft. For instance, about two years back the DGCA had suspended the flying licence of a captain of an Indian carrier whose domestic flight was preparing to depart from Mumbai when it mistakenly entered the active runway without clearance. Investigation had revealed that ATC had instructed the pilots to hold at holding point of the runway. While the co-pilot had read back ATC instructions correctly and briefed the same to pilot-in-command, the latter had breached the holding point of the runway.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spicejet-rajkot-delhi-flight-takes-off-without-atc-nod-dgca-probe-on-and-crew-derostered/articleshow/88639348.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Government data shows petrol sales rising more than 4% and diesel consumption, a key measure of economic activity, increasing 1.4% in December from the same period of 2020, reinforcing the trend since October last year. Sequentially, December petrol sales were 6.6% higher and diesel 13.6% more than in November. Jet fuel sales in December also grew more than 25% than the same month of 2020 but were still 26% short of the December 2019 figures. Sequentially too, December sales were nearly 10% higher than November as more flights took to the skies. But still, industry sources said sales were unlikely to reach the pre-pandemic level till regular international flights resume. LPG, as usual, continued on a growth path, exceeding December 2019 level by more than 5% but was 1% lower than December 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/december-petrol-sales-13-more-than-pre-pandemic-period-diesel-catching-up-fast/articleshow/88639390.cms||Sanjay Dutta

A new year with the same JK police illegally locking people in their homes and an administration so terrified of normal democratic activity,” National Conference vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted. “Trucks parked outside our gates to scuttle the peaceful @JKPAGD sit-in protest. Some things never change,” he said. Abdullah, whose father and veteran politician Farooq Abdullah heads the PAGD, claimed, “Talk about a lawless police state, the police have even locked the internal gate connecting my father's home to my sister's. Yet our leaders have the cheek to tell the world that India is the largest democracy, hah!!” Senior CPI (M) leader M Y Tarigami, who is the spokesperson of the alliance, said it was sad that the Jammu and Kashmir administration was “scared even to allow a peaceful protest”. “I was asked by police deployed at my premises not to leave the house on Saturday,” he claimed. “This is where the situation gets worse when people are not even allowed to express their opinion before the public,” he added. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had also been placed under detention. “A truck is parked outside my house too,” she added. The PAGD had proposed to hold a peaceful demonstration in Srinagar on Saturday against the proposal of the Delimitation Commission of increasing six seats in Jammu division and one in Kashmir. With this, the number of seats in Jammu would have gone up to 43 and Kashmir to 47.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-gupkar-alliance-leaders-detained-ahead-of-march-against-j-k-delimitation-commission/articleshow/88639441.cms||---

The identity of slain Jaish commander Samir Dar will be forensically confirmed through DNA profiling. The IGP said security forces knew they were onto something after noticing that the face of one of the three terrorists killed in the cordon-and-search operation at Nowgam Dooru in Anantnag last Thursday matched that of Samir in the police records. He had been initially identified as someone else. Closer scrutiny revealed he was the local Jaish commander who had dodged them for nearly three years since the Pulwama attack. Samir was part of the Jaish team that recruited and trained a suicide bomber, identified as Adil Ahmed Dar, to ram his explosives-laden vehicle into a bus ferrying CRPF personnel at Lethpora in Pulwama district on February 14, 2019, the police said. Of the three Jaish terrorists shot dead in Anantnag on Thursday, one was identified as a Pakistani. Another Pakistani was in a group of three other terrorists killed in a simultaneous operation by a joint team of the Army, police and CRPF in adjoining Kulgam. Lt Gen DP Pandey, general officer commanding of the Army's Chinar Corps, said Pakistan-based Jaish had tasked Samir with training recruits to make and plant improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to target mainly security forces. "He was also responsible for recruiting young locals for terror activities by radicalising them."

The tragedy happened “due to a scuffle between two groups of pilgrims”, the shrine’s board said in a statement without giving more details. Officials said authorities responded quickly, order within the crowd was restored and the pilgrimage resumed after nearly four hours of the early morning tragedy. Rescue teams evacuated the injured to various hospitals. Nine of them at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Superspecialty Hospital, Kakryal, were discharged during the day, while the rest are undergoing treatment and their condition is said to be stable. Of the 12 dead, the identity of four people were not known till the filing of this report. “The deceased were identified as Dheeraj Kumar, 26, of Nowshera in J&K’s Rajouri; Sheweta Singh, 35, of Ghaziabad, UP; Delhi residents Vinay Kumar and Sonu Pandey, both 24; Mamta, 38, of Jhajjar, Haryana; Dharamvir Singh, 35, of Saharanpur, UP; Vaneet Singh, 38, also of Saharanpur; and Arun Pratap of Gorakhpur, UP,” a spokesperson of shrine’s board said.Two bodies were sent by air and nine by road to their native places, while one will be airlifted on Sunday morning from Jammu. The shrine board spokesperson said Lt Governor Manoj Sinha has announced an immediate ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to families of the dead and Rs 2 lakh to the injured. "The treatment cost will be borne by the board.” The board can be approached at 01991234804 and 01991234053 for assistance. The Lt Governor, who chairs the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, ordered a high-level inquiry into the stampede that officials said occurred after a rush of devotees entering and exiting the temple converged near the narrow gate, leading to a suffocating crush as people tried to get away from the spot. According to eyewitnesses, several men and women fell and people walked over them to escape the melee. Most of the pilgrims have walked 12km through a steep, winding mountain trek from the base camp of Katra, a small town 50km from Jammu, early on Saturday to pray at the shrine. Officials said there was a heavy rush since it was New Year’s Day and more so as the train service to Katra resumed lately following its suspension because of the farmers’ protests in Punjab. A shrine board official said 35,000 pilgrims were allowed to proceed for the yatra on December 31 and January 1 as against the National Green Tribunal’s cap of 50,000 a day, keeping in view the pandemic. Pilgrims are allowed in a file inside the cave and there’s a constant flow to avoid overcrowding. ”But people probably stayed a bit too long at the temple, crowding the space. As more pilgrims entered, the place got congested and there was a rush to get out. That chaos soon turned into tragedy,” an eyewitness said. President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi led a shocked nation in offering condolences to the families of the dead and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured. "Extremely saddened by the loss of lives…” Modi wrote on Twitter and announced a compensation package. Junior minister in the PMO, Jitendra Singh, dashed to Katra to take stock of the situation. UP CM Yogi Adityanath and his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal also expressed grief over the tragedy.

There had been no customary exchange of sweets between the two armies for the past few years due to rising tension between India and Pakistan in the wake of continuous ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the LoC as well as the international border. After the renewal of the ceasefire agreement in February 2021, this is the first time that the soldiers of both countries have exchanged sweets. “The two armies exchanged sweets and greetings at Poonch-Rawalkot and Mendhar-Hotspring crossing points along the LoC in Poonch district to promote mutual trust and tranquillity,” Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, adding that all necessary Covid-19 protocols were followed during the exchange. “Considering the ongoing ceasefire along the Indo-Pak border, this gesture is aimed at further enhancing peace and harmony in Jammu and Kashmir,” the spokesperson said. The ceasefire has not only changed the situation along the LoC and international border but also improved the lives of those residing in villages along the border. The J&K admin and BSF authorities have helped farmers living in these places cultivate abandoned land near the international border in Kathua district’s Hiranagar sector. Farmers living along the LoC in Rajouri and Poonch districts have also begun farming activities after guns fell silent. The initiative has helped farmers return to their 150-acre land — which had to be abandoned in the wake of cross-border hostilities — for the first time in 20 years. More than 5,000 acres of fertile land along the international border, spread across 22 border villages from Paharpur to Londi in Hiranagar sector remained fallow for two decades because of the frequent firing and shelling by Pakistan. “Agricultural fields in our village are fertile but farmers were unable to work freely in the past. Things have changed now and they can farm without fear,” said Mohammad Aslam, resident of a forward area in Rajouri.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-pakistan-armies-usher-in-new-year-at-the-border-exchange-sweets/articleshow/88639531.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Talks on historic India-UK trade deal to begin with offer on UK visas: Report||LONDON: UK international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan is expected to travel to New Delhi this month to begin negotiations on a UK-India free trade deal where she is expected to open talks with a generous offer on UK visas for Indians. The easing of immigration rules for Indian citizens travelling to Britain has long been a demand of New Delhi, and with acute labour shortages in Britain, particular of doctors and nurses, it now offers a win-win situation for the UK which at the same time is keen to get access to the lucrative Indian market. The Times of London reported Saturday that the UK is now prepared to offer a generous deal on visas to secure the trade deal, citing UK government sources. Commenting on this, a senior Indian diplomat in London said: "Nothing unexpected in the news". Another source told TOI that the free trade agreement (FTA) is expected to be announced this year by UK PM Boris Johnson when in India and before any EU-India FTA is agreed. Relaxations could include lower visa fees for students and tourists, visas for young Indians to work and travel in Britain, a longer graduate route visa and visa-on-arrival for certain Indians. The benefits of a UK-India trade deal to Britain would be reduced tariffs on a range of goods, giving UK manufacturers more affordable access to the important Indian market. Post-Brexit the UK is in active pursuit of FTAs. India by contrast has been less inclined to signing preferential trade deals as seen by India’s withdrawal from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the eight-year stagnation of EU-India negotiations. India wants to protect its economy from foreign competitors and maximise domestic production. Analysis by the UK Department of International Trade (DIT) shows a trade agreement with India would boost the economies of all regions of the UK, as they already have substantial ties in India and stand to benefit from India’s economic growth. India currently charges huge import tariffs of up to 150% on some of the UK’s most important exports, such as cars and whisky. An FTA that removes or reduces these taxes would make UK goods more competitive in the Indian market. The trade deal would also provide an opportunity to deepen cooperation between the two countries’ respective services sectors. A DIT spokesperson said: "India is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2050 and a free trade agreement will open up huge opportunities for UK businesses to trade with India’s £2.25 trillion economy." Kevin McCole, UKIBC managing director, said: "From extensive UKIBC consultations it is clear that businesses in both countries, across all sectors, have high hopes for the FTA negotiations. Business want to see a reduction in tariffs, plus greater alignment of standards and of IP and data protection rules so as to realise the full potential of the India-UK partnership, particularly in the innovative, R&D-intensive sectors that will drive the partnership in the years to come. Businesses are also interested in an interim, or early harvest deal." Pratik Dattani, MD of market entry consultancy EPG, said: "The UK government seems to have signalled it is willing to offer much of what India wants, without India signalling it will provide much in return. The UK needs a big post-Brexit deal, so the stakes are higher for Britain than for India." Lord Karan Bilimoria, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was "excited by the prospect of FTA talks with India beginning in earnest this year". Exporting and growing international revenue needs to be a priority for the UK, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/talks-on-historic-india-uk-trade-deal-to-begin-with-offer-on-uk-visas-report/articleshow/88639538.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Despite severe production constraints and a long delivery backlog (estimated at 7 lakh units), car companies sent 30.82 lakh units to dealerships in calendar year 2021, against 24.33 lakh units in 2020. The rate of growth was strong due to a low base as 2020 was the first year to have been impacted by the pandemic leading to a period of tremendous uncertainty. Passenger vehicles sales had crossed the 30-lakh mark for the first time in 2017 where total sales stood at 32.3 lakh units. In 2018, the industry had closed at 33.95 lakh units, before slipping in 2019 to 29.62 lakh units. For Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker which was also impacted severely by the semiconductor crunch, sales stood at 13.65 lakh units in 2021, against 12.14 lakh units in 2020. However, this was far short of the 17.31 lakh units it had sold in 2018. Read AlsoMost affordable electric cars/ EVs in India: Price, range, battery and specsNEW DELHI: Electric vehicles have come a long way in India within a very short span of time and an EV launch is quickly becoming a regular affair in the country. With the government pushing for EV adoption India today offers a better environment than earlier for carmakers to enter the EV space.Maruti’s rival Hyundai, however, reported a 19% growth in its 2021 domestic numbers at 5 lakh units against 4.2 lakh units in 2020. The company has also been hit by the semiconductor shortage with the delivery backlog of vehicles such as Creta and Venue SUVs at over 1 lakh units. Shashank Srivastava, sales & marketing director at Maruti, said companies have initiated steps to tackle the semiconductor shortage, though the situation remains fluid. “From a low production level which was at 40% of capacity, we could scale up to 83% by November, and to 87% by December. We are hopeful that this progress will be maintained as we move ahead,” Srivastava told TOI. However, he added that demand too remains fluid. “It’s difficult to forecast. There are factors which still make the situation uncertain. These include availability of semiconductors, the growth of the economy, and how the Covid situation pans out,” he said. The industry is also grappling with high input costs, which has seen prices of vehicles go up over the past few months. Srivastava said a fresh round of price hikes will happen in the next few days. New models also led to the charge in 2020, and these included vehicles such as the XUV7OO and the Thar for Mahindra & Mahindra. The company is grappling with a deluge of bookings, which has seen a waiting list that runs into well over a year for some variants. “The issues around semiconductor-related parts continue to be a challenge for the industry and is a major focus area for us,” said Veejay Nakra, CEO of M&M’s automotive division.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/beating-all-bumps-car-sales-grow-27-in-2021/articleshow/88639871.cms||Pankaj Doval

Assam, where the legislation is due for renewal in March, will take a “pragmatic decision” in consultation with the ministry of home affairs when the time comes, he said. “Regarding AFSPA, finally Assam will see rationalisation of it in 2022. The Army has been virtually withdrawn from Assam, barring five to six districts. It is a dynamic situation.” Sarma’s statement in Guwahati comes on the heels of the Centre extending the legislation in Nagaland by another six months with effect from December 31. Sarma, who was part of the meeting that decided to constitute a panel to look into Nagaland’s demand, said PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah’s approach had been “very positive”. Sarma said tribal militancy in his state was over while a solution to the “conflict” with Paresh Baruah's Ulfa(I) was on the radar. “It is a very complicated situation. But I dare say that we are seeing the beginning of an end,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/positive-news-on-afspa-demand-in-45-days-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/88639919.cms||Prabin Kalita

His comments came as he released the 10th instalment of financial benefit, amounting to Rs 20,946 crore, to over 10 crore landholder farmer families, including 2.3 crore from Uttar Pradesh, under the Centre’s flagship income support scheme (called PM-Kisan), and equity grant of more than Rs 14 crore to 351 Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) which will benefit more than 1.2 lakh farmers. Addressing farmers on the New Year’s Day, the PM said, “Many economic indicators are looking better than the pre-Covid19 phase... Our forex reserves have reached record levels. Old recor-ds have also been surpassed in GST collection. We have also set new records in the matter of exports, especially in agriculture." He noted that 10,000 out of more than 50,000 start-ups, currently working in India, came up during the last six months. He also virtually interacted with FPOs of different states on the occasion and noted how the collective strength of farmers through these organisations would increase bargaining power, scale, innovation, risk management and adaptability to the market conditions. “Today our farmers are benefitting from the schemes like ‘One District One Product’ and markets, both nation and global, are opening up for them,” the PM said. The PM also recalled India’s effort in fighting the pandemic, initiating vaccination and making arrangements for the vulnerable sections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/many-economic-indicators-better-than-pre-covid-phase-pm/articleshow/88640009.cms||---

Preliminary reports suggested that over-exploitation of the mine beyond the permissible limit coupled with climatic conditions led to the cave-in. The Haryana government called in the Army from Hisar Cantt and a National Disaster Response Force team from Noida to conduct the rescue operation. The administration had pressed in earthmovers, cranes and other equipment to remove the debris. “It is difficult to say how many people are trapped. Some deaths could be confirmed as the local villagers had conducted rescue operations. Let the rescue and relief operation get over first,” said additional chief secretary, revenue and disaster management, P K Das. The landslide occurred within hours of the mining contractor setting off an explosion on the hill. Men and machines were at work and the vehicles had lined up to load the mined material when the landslide occurred. Besides DC Dr R S Dhillon and SP Ajit Singh, agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister Jai Parkash Dalal went to the spot. Three of the dead mining workers have been identified as Sanjay from Jind, Vijender from Tosham and Tufan Singh from Jharkhand. Sources said several people were travelling to another site when the landslide occurred and they got trapped in their vehicles. BJP Bhiwani MP Dharambir Singh alleged that the contractor of the mining zone did not permit the entry of outsiders and even officials on duty were never permitted access to the mining zone. He said he would speak to the CM for a thorough investigation. Expressing grief, Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Twitter, confirmed the death of four persons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-killed-in-landslide-at-bhiwani-mining-site/articleshow/88640161.cms||Manvir Saini

The revenues for December are 13% higher than the same month last year and 26% higher than the GST revenues in December 2019, according to data released by the finance ministry. During the month, revenues from import of goods was 36% higher and revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are 5% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year. The gross GST revenue collected in December totalled Rs 1,29,780 crore of which CGST is Rs 22,578 crore, SGST is Rs 28,658 crore, IGST is Rs 69,155 crore (including Rs 37,527 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 9,389 crore (including Rs 614 crore collected on import of goods). “Coupled with economic recovery, anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers have been contributing to the enhanced GST. The improvement in revenue has also been due to various rate rationalisation measures undertaken by the Council to correct inverted duty structure. It is expected that the positive trend in the revenues will continue in the last quarter as well,” according to the finance ministry. The GST collection in the month is close to Rs 1.30 lakh crore despite reduction of 17% in the number of e-way bills generated in November (6.1 crore) as compared to October, 2021 (7.4 crore) due to improved tax compliance and better tax administration by both central and state tax authorities. The average monthly gross GST collection for the third quarter of the current year has been Rs 1.30 lakh crore against the average monthly collection of Rs 1.10 lakh crore and Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the first and second quarters respectively. “GST collections for Dec 2021 are certainly impressive in absolute terms as well as the year-on-year growth, given the sequential drop in GST e-way bills that had been seen during the festive month of Nov 2021,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-rs-1-3-lakh-crore-december-gst-revenues-stay-over-rs-1-lakh-crore-for-6th-month/articleshow/88640200.cms||---

On New Year Day, India had reported 27,718 fresh cases by late night with data from two states awaited. This was over 5,000 more than the tally of 22,706 on Friday. Covid infections have exploded this week, coinciding with the rise in the Omicron variant of the virus, with cases increasing nearly 4.5-fold in just five days. While the 22% spurt in cases on Saturday was lower than the percentage growth recorded in the previous four days, this could be due to a fall in testing on New Year eve as the all-India test positivity rate increased to 4.4%, from 2.05% on the previous day. Maharashtra continued to post the highest number of new cases at 9,170, a rise of nearly 14% over Friday's total of 8,067. Of these, Mumbai alone accounted for 6,180 cases, continuing to report the highest number of infections among metros. Bengal reported 4,512 new cases, up from 3,451 on Friday, logging a 31% rise in a day. Kolkata posted 2,398 of these cases as big cities remained the main centres of the current Covid spike. The state's positivity rate rose to 12.02% from 8.46% on Friday as daily testing dipped. With 2,716 fresh cases, up 51% since Friday, Delhi reported the third highest case count among states, pushing Kerala (2,435 cases) to the fourth spot. Meanwhile, Bihar reported the highest daily percentage rise, reporting 281 new cases, up 78% from Friday's count of 158. CM Nitish Kumar had earlier in the week said a third corona wave had begun in the state. Gujarat logged 1,069 cases, up 64% from 654 on the previous day. Other states recording a single-day surge of over 50% include Madhya Pradesh (124 cases, up 61%) and Uttar Pradesh (383 cases, up 53%). The country reported 67 deaths from the virus on Friday. However, the overall Covid toll rose by 291 with the addition of old deaths, mainly from Kerala.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-27000-new-covid-cases-jump-22-in-a-day/articleshow/88640269.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The inquiry, headed by Air Marshal Manvendra Singh, has apparently ruled out any major structural failure or technical snag in the twin-engine Mi-17 V5 chopper that crashed. “Two-three elements are being re-checked before the inquiry report is formally submitted next week,” said a source on Saturday. The ill-fated Mi-17 V5, which had taken off from the Sulur airbase with Gen Rawat, his wife Madhulika, military advisor Brigadier L S Lidder and others, had crashed just seven minutes before its scheduled landing at the Wellington helipad. In technical terms, an accident that takes place when the pilot gets disorientated or “loses situational awareness” and unintentionally hits the ground, a mountain, tree, water body or any other obstacle despite being in full control of his helicopter or aircraft is called “controlled flight into terrain (C-FIT)”. “A C-FIT crash usually takes place in bad weather or in the landing phase of a flight when the pilot cannot recover his helicopter/aircraft in time to avoid the collision,” an official said. TOI had earlier reported that the combination of bad weather and the hilly terrain in the Nilgiri Hills was probably the main reason behind the Mi-17 V5 crash on December 8.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/foggy-weather-mayve-led-to-disorientation-of-pilots-in-bipin-rawat-copter/articleshow/88640338.cms||---

The sentences will run separately, said the court order. This is perhaps the first time that a driver in a fatal accident has got such a prison sentence. Driver Shamshuddin, 47, was convicted for culpable homicide and rash driving. The bus owner was also punished with 10 years’ imprisonment, said assistant public prosecutor officer Kapil Vyas. On May 4, 2015, a passenger bus carrying 65 people plunged into a dry canal and caught fire, killing 22 people and injuring a dozen. During the investigation, it was found that the emergency exit was blocked by iron rods and an additional seat was mounted in its place. Passengers were trapped in the inferno and those killed were burnt beyond recognition. Shamshuddin was accused of driving recklessly despite passengers’ requests to slow down. He and the bus owner are residents of Satna, where the bus was headed. The accused were booked under IPC sections 304 (a) (death due to negligence), 304 (culpable homicide), 279 and 337 (both for rash driving), and under section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The order, delivered on Friday, clearly says the 19 10-year sentences will run separately.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bus-driver-gets-190-years-in-jail-for-crash-that-killed-22-in-mp/articleshow/88640592.cms||---

District police have booked seven people under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the IPC. On December 29, pastor Akshaykumar Karaganvi was holding prayers at his residence when about seven members of a right-wing organisation barged into the house and asked them to stop the prayers. The accused said that the family was converting neighbours and beat them up. The pastor’s spouse, Kavita, said in a complaint that the accused splashed steaming hot curry and injured one of the attendees, besides outraging the modesty of another. Kavita said the prayer was an annual affair at her residence after Christmas celebrations and denied allegations of conversion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-pastor-family-attacked-over-allegations-of-conversion/articleshow/88640605.cms||---

The incident was caught on CCTV. The child has been hospitalised with severe injuries. The way the dogs were biting her in the head and face, she would have been killed but for a passerby who threw stones at the pack and chased them away. CCTV footage from a house shows the child running in panic, chased by five dogs. She tries to get away but the dogs yank at her dress, hurl her on the road and begin mauling her. Two of the dogs are seen biting her head and face so ferociously that she is dragged down the road even as the other dogs chew at her legs and hands. A young man runs to her rescue and throws stones at the pack.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/horror-on-cam-pack-of-strays-mauls-4-yr-old-girl-in-bhopal/articleshow/88640611.cms||---
---||India||IIT-D, Jamia, NMML among 6000 whose FCRA licence expires||NEW DELHI: The registration of 5,968 NGOs and associations under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010, is deemed to have ceased or expired on Saturday, as the FCRA licence renewal application of 179 NGOs was reje-cted by the home ministry and the remaining 5,789 did not apply during the window of September 30, 2020 to December 31, 2021. This has rendered the affected NGOs ineligible for receiving any foreign funding or utilising their receipts from foreign sources. Among the associations whose FCRA registration is deemed to have expired as on January 1, 2022 are IIT Delhi, Jamia Milia Islamia, Indian Medical Association, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, India Habitat Centre, Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, India Islamic Cultural Centre, Indian Institute of Public Administration, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, National Foundation for Communal Harmony, Delhi College of Engineering, Gere Foundation India Trust founded by Hollywood actor Richard Gere and Oxfam India. But institutions like IIT D, NMML, Jamia, IGNCA, IIPA and DCE possibly did not apply for renewal of FCRA licence as the government had in early 2020 ordered the exemption of all organisations set up by or under a central or state Act or by an administrative or executive order of such governments, wholly owned by respective governments and required to have accounts audited by CAG, from the operation of FCRA. While Oxfam India had reported around Rs 50 crore foreign receipts in 2020-21, other organisations like Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and India Islamic Cultural Centre showed zero foreign receipts in the same year. With the FCRA nod for nearly 5,968 NGOs deemed to have ceased or expired, the total number of active NGOs eligible to receive forei-gn funds as on January 1, 2022, has come down to 16,829 from around 22,800 on December 31, 2021. As on January 1, the cumulative figure of NGOs whose licence is deemed to have ceased or expired has gone up to 12,580. MHA sources said that of the total 18,778 NGOs whose FCRA registration was expiring between September 29, 2020 and December 31, 2021, 12,989 applied for renewal and 5,789 did not apply. The 179 NGOs whose FCRA renewal plea was rejected for not meeting requirements of the amended Act and rules, include Missionaries of Charity, associated with late Nobel Laureate Mother Teresa. The FCRA nod to around 20,675 NGOs has been cancelled as on date. As per the amended FCRA and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules, 2011, all NGOs and associations need to apply for renewal of their licence, valid for five years, before its expiry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-d-jamia-nmml-among-6000-whose-fcra-licence-expires/articleshow/88640627.cms||Bharti Jain

More than half of them, 2,565 to be precise, are deployed to guard political leaders. “The CM’s convoy at present comprises 22 vehicles. The cabinet has decided that this number will be brought down to seven or eight. We will continue to attempt to reduce it further to move towards an ideal situation when the chief minister can move without any security,” said CM Himanta Biswa Sarma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-cms-motorcade-to-be-halved/articleshow/88640672.cms||Prabin Kalita

While about 3,000 acres are land parcels in the range of 25 acres and 700 acres, the rest of the land is in small parcels between one acre and 25 acres. Officials said the land is spread across Serilingampally, Gandipet, Rajendranagar and Shamshabad mandals. Two years ago, the revenue department got a favourable order in the Supreme Court in a 190-acre evacuee property case in Puppalguda in the district worth about Rs 4,000 crore. "The state has been making every effort to retain government land, which is being claimed by private parties. Many cases have even gone up to the Supreme Court. The government is engaging private counsels to argue on behalf of the state in important cases. In Manchirevula case also, the government had engaged senior SC counsels," Rangareddy district collector D Amoy Kumar told STOI. Officials said the land records till a few decades ago were showing any land that was in litigation as government land. Of late, private persons started claiming the rights over the land as the land rates in the western part of the city have skyrocketed in the past two decades. "Even mutations were done and registrations were allowed earlier," a senior revenue official said. Rajendranagar revenue divisional officer K Chandrakala said huge extent of land parcels, which are caught in legal problems, pertain to a jagir land. "For instance, 545 acres of land in survey Nos. 100 and 101 in Miyapur, is claimed by private persons. But, our claims on jagir land are correct. Similarly, the government has been fighting in high court over 198 acres of land in survey No. 126," she told STOI. A few months ago, the revenue department compiled data on all the cases pending in various courts. According to officials, as many as 16,000 cases are pending in various courts. The highest number of cases are pending in Rangareddy, Medchal Malkajgiri and Hyderabad districts. About 3,000 cases, including special leave petitions, are pending. Writs are also pending both in the high court and the Supreme Court and of them, 1,100 cases relate to Rangareddy district, 740 cases pertain to Medchal Malkajgiri district and another 1,200 cases to Hyderabad. "Efforts are being made to protect the government land. Apart from fencing the land and installing ownership boards, we filed counters in all the cases with government pleaders, special government pleaders and even advocate general's office," Chandrakala said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-govt-sweats-it-out-in-courts-to-reclaim-9k-acres/articleshow/88640695.cms||Koride Mahesh

A government order on Saturday said all theatres and multiplexes, entertainment parks and exhibition venues would be closed effective January 2, while malls and markets would be allowed to operate till 5pm. Bars and restaurants can stay open for now but only at 50% capacity. The restrictions will for now be applicable for 10 days, till 5am on January 12. Government and private offices have been advised to function with 50% attendance, except for emergency and essential services. Schools, colleges, polytechnic institutes, coaching centres, anganwadis and creches in all districts, meanwhile, have been ordered to close (for physical classes). Most schools and colleges are now shut for winter vacations and this order essentially means the vacation will get extended, at least till January 12. Across the state, the number of people attending funerals has been capped at 50. For weddings, up to 100 people are permitted to gather. Other than Gurugram, the districts where these curbs will apply are Faridabad, Ambala, Panchkula and Sonipat, which together account for 1,684 of the 1,907 active cases in the state. All sports complexes, stadiums and swimming pools will also be closed except for participants of national and international events who need the training facilities. However, no spectators are allowed. In its earlier order on December 22, the government had allowed only fully vaccinated people at most public places and public transport from January 1. The night curfew from 11pm to 5am, which has been in force since the previous order, will continue. The government has asked district administrations to strictly implement the ‘no mask, no service’ policy and ordered a fine of Rs 500 on violators of Covid protocols and those who are eligible but have not taken their second dose of the Covid vaccine. Institutional violators, according to the order, will be fined Rs 5,000. “After almost two years, my company recently started recalling all employees. But now, it looks like restrictions will return for some time. This will affect productivity, but there isn’t anything one can do about it,” said Kartik Kaushik, a resident of 65 who works in the finance department of a private company. “People have become negligent about Covid protocols. So, some restrictions are bound to be imposed with the evolving situation. However, it is also the responsibility of the government to ensure effective implementation of restrictions on the ground so that there is complete compliance,” said Nihal Mandhotra, a resident of Ardee City.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/more-covid-curbs-malls-to-shut-at-5pm-extended-winter-break-for-hry-schools/articleshow/88640697.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||A chilly start: Gurugram sees season’s lowest min temp at 4.6°C||GURUGRAM: It was a chilly start as residents of the city ushered in the New Year in biting cold. The city recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday — two notches below normal. The previous low was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius on December 21. The daytime temperature has also witnessed a fall despite a clear sky. The maximum temperature settled at 18.8 degrees Celsius — two notches below the normal. On Friday, the minimum temperature stayed at 5 degrees Celsius while the maximum settled at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in the city has been witnessing a fall for the past four days, with icy cold winds blowing from the snow-clad mountains. However, some respite is in sight with another western disturbance impacting the region from January 4. “With the prevailing cold northwesterly winds, the minimum temperature is expected to stay below the normal for the next 24 hours. Thereafter, there will be a gradual rise in temperature by 3-5 degrees, with the minimum temperature likely to settle above the normal range from January 4. Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is likely over Haryana on January 5 and 7 due to the influence of western disturbance,” an IMD official said. Sunday is expected to remain clear during the day with the possibility of shallow to moderate fog in the morning hours. The minimum and maximum temperature is likely to hover around 5 and 21 degrees Celsius. With the dip in temperature, the city’s air quality turned fouler on Saturday. For the last two days, the air quality index (AQI) stayed in the very poor category with an overall AQI reading was at 340, up from Friday’s 302. “Low temperature causes thermal inversion trapping the pollutants and the prevailing low winds speed preventing the dispersal of pollutants. It is likely to remain in the same range for the next few days,” the official added. Three of the four monitoring stations, including Gwalpahari, Teri Gram and Vikas Sadan, recorded the AQI in very poor category with the readings at 348, 327, and 365, respectively. While it slipped into the severe zone at 406 in Sector 51.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/-a-chilly-start-city-sees-seasons-lowest-min-temp-at-4-6c/articleshow/88640698.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram malls restrict entry to fully jabbed, but no checks at markets, stations||GURUGRAM: Shopping centres and malls were largely out of bounds for the unvaccinated and the partially vaccinated on Saturday, with rules allowing access to public spaces to residents who have received both Covid shots coming into effect in Haryana on New Year’s Day. There were, however, no checks at markets, bus stations and railway stations, which saw usual crowds. Outside MGF Metropolis, Ambience Mall and MGF Metropolitan, there were long entry queues on Saturday afternoon as thousands of people stepped out to celebrate New Year with family and friends. The malls had banners and placards to inform people about the new rules and heavy security for checks of the Aarogya Setu app and the vaccination certificates. On December 24, the state government had made it mandatory for all to take both vaccine doses to gain entry into restaurants, banks, malls, offices, railways stations, bus stops, etc., from January 1, 2022. The district administration had released a circular on Friday, announcing that departmental heads would implement the same. However, at Gurugram railway station, people walked without masks, and there was no checking or objection from the cops. The authorities were found clueless. “All we know is that our staff and the vendors inside the station need to be fully vaccinated; we have ensured that. We haven’t received any direction to stop unvaccinated people from entering the station,” said station master S L Meena. The sole bus station in the city in Sector 12 was relatively less chaotic on Saturday, but nobody was following basic Covid-19 protocols there. Roadways officials claimed they were off to a slow start due to the weekend, but things would be different from Monday. “We will be releasing a notice, announcing that any staff member who is not fully vaccinated will not get any duty. We’ll be installing hoardings and banners to spread awareness. We’ll also form a team to check everyone at the entry gates. Over the weekend, we’ll streamline all these measures and start implementing them from Monday,” said Pawan Kumar, the bus station in charge. The scene was different at the city malls. “We have installed various teams at all the entry and exit gates and are thoroughly checking the vaccination certificates before allowing entry. We are now allowing entry to the people who have taken a single dose if their second dose is due in a couple of days. However, we are turning away those who have not taken a single dose or whose due date for the second dose got lapsed,” said Arvind Kapoor, the Ambience mall general manager. “We have also installed multiple banners, hoardings and posters to inform the people about the new rules,” he added. A section of mall owners turned away anybody who failed to produce documents for both doses. “We are allowing only those who have taken both the doses. Kids under 12 years of age are allowed entry after checking their IDs but, those in the 12 to 18 years range are not. For them, vaccination is ongoing, and we don’t want to risk non-compliance. We have also stationed our staff with placards to inform all visitors about the new rules,” said MGF Metropolis assistant general manager Lalit Singh Rawat. He claimed that the mall turned away nearly 50% of its visitors on Saturday. Auto-rickshaw drivers outside these malls saw increased business, with passengers taking rides home after being refused entry. Meanwhile, the city deputy commissioner and sub-divisional magistrate remained unavailable for their comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/malls-restrict-entry-to-fully-jabbed-but-no-checks-at-markets-stations/articleshow/88640699.cms||---

According to officials, in phase I, which targeted installing 1,200 cameras across the city, CCTV cameras of 4 megapixel were installed. In the next phase, however, officials are looking at upgrading the quality to 6 megapixel. This matter had also been discussed in a review meeting between the GMDA and commissioner of police in November, where the latter had admitted that there was "substantial improvement" in the performance of the CCTV cameras after these were “realigned and refocused” in consultation with DCP (east). He had revealed that the number of "automatic challans" has now reached more than 1,000 per day, but suggested that, for better results, the quality of the cameras may be further improved from 4 megapixel to 6 megapixel. Speaking to TOI, a senior GMDA official said, “At the time we started work on Phase I, when tenders were floated in 2018, 4 megapixel was the best camera available. Now, at present, if we go for Phase II and the megapixel of cameras has improved to say 6 or anything around that, we will try and take the latest at this stage. Whatever we did at that time was the best and whatever we will do now will also be the best.” Officials said that Phase I of the project is almost complete and they are now working with the police department to undertake Phase II. “Gurugram Police is identifying the locations where they would need cameras, and are also looking for locations that can be converted from a general surveillance site to a full surveillance site. The latter are the ones where we catch the number plates, do red light violations and issue other challans,” said the official. “In this phase, hence, there will be some sites that will be converted from general surveillance to full surveillance, and there will also be more addition of sites for tracking of crimes, surveillance, and all of that,” added the official. The Public Safety and Adaptive Traffic Management System of the GMDA was envisaged as a way of helping the police department curb traffic violations by enabling them to track down errant vehicles. In addition, it was expected to help bring about better surveillance across the city, which officials hoped would serve as a deterrent for anti-social elements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/traffic-plan-part-2-to-have-better-cams/articleshow/88640700.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Shruti Bhatia, a resident of DLF-1, was taking an evening stroll on Wednesday when someone tapped her on the shoulder, but by the time she turned around, two bike-borne criminals had snatched her mobile phone and ran away. “I tried to run after them, and a passerby made an effort to nab them, but it was a lost cause. The incident completely shocked me, and I have not stepped outside my home for two days because it happened just 100 metres away,” said Bhatia. She has filed a police complaint in the case.It is not the only snatching in recent times in DLF-1. Mobile phones, bags and chains are getting snatched in the area, which hardly sees any police patrolling, said residents.Sunil Goswami, another resident, managed to stop a chain-snatching bid a week ago. “We were going shopping at the nearby market through Arjun Marg when two people on a bike tried to snatch a chain from my sister-in-law. I was able to stop their bid, but luck cannot be on your side every time. The criminals are targeting people in the less crowded spots. Not just snatching, there was also a theft attempt in one of the houses a few days ago,” he said.Residents said that the police and the developer have taken no step to ensure their safety. “Since the announcement of the colony transfer to Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG), the number of security guards deployed by the developer has gone down. There is hardly any checking at the gates, giving free access to unverified people in the colony,” said Amardeep Singh, another resident. Dhruv Bansal, the spokesperson of the Qutub Enclave RWA, said, “Several snatching incidents have come to light in the past few days, which have raised serious security concerns among the residents. Many of these incidents have gone unreported as the police have been taking a lenient approach, treating them as petty. Police need to take proactive steps and prompt action to prevent such incidents. They should build trust and instil a sense of security among residents.”Meanwhile, Naresh Kumar, station house officer, DLF-1 police station, said that police have received a complaint and are working to catch the criminals. “We recently received a complaint from a resident, and we are investigating. As a preventive measure, our PCR vans and riders are patrolling the area regularly, but we can act only when someone files a complaint about the incident. However, we will soon have a meeting with the RWA members on preventing such incidents.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-checks-snatchings-on-the-rise-allege-residents-of-dlf-1/articleshow/88640701.cms||Akanksha Gupta

But what came as a pleasant surprise for the cops were a few calls that were made to wish them a ‘Happy New Year’.The control room personnel said that they received 78 calls between 10pm and 1am. The police also said that majority of the calls that they received between the aforementioned hours were of noise pollution, particularly the loud music played by the DJ. “We felt flattered by the New Year wishes. Given that we were vigilantly working all through the night in the backdrop of New Year and amid work, when we received such calls, it felt good,” said a police officer working at the control room.For the first time, the Gurgaon roads were also deserted on New Year and not a single incident of traffic jam or any unwanted activity was reported, as per the Gurgaon police.“There were 8 check points and no traffic jam was reported on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday given it was also the curfew hours. But we are more vigilant and kept a look out for incidents of drunken driving. However, no incident was reported and everything was peaceful,” said DCP Traffic, Ravinder Singh Tomar.With night curfew being imposed by the Haryana government from 11 pm to 5 am, clubs in the city had closed by 10.30 pm. Most people this year decided to celebrate at home rather than try and go out late at night. “Initially, we had planned to visit the clubs in Sector 29 but the thought that they would close as early as 11 am was disappointing. So, my friends and I decided to celebrate at home,” said Ronak, a resident of Sector 57.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/happy-new-yr-wishes-pour-in-amid-complaints/articleshow/88640703.cms||---
---||Noida||Amid protest, land acquisition process for Noida airport phase 2 to begin tomorrow||GREATER NOIDA: The district administration is gearing up for the next round of large scale land acquisition in Gautam Budh Nagar. From Monday, a team of senior officials will start finalising their strategy to convince landholders from six villages in Jewar to give a go-ahead for the expansion of Noida International Airport. Consent of at least 70% of the total 7,875 people to be affected by the second stage of the project will be required to go ahead with the acquisition process, officials said. However, villagers recently have decided against giving their consent for the acquisition of land for the second phase of the Noida airport project as the social impact assessment report approved by the government did not include many of their demands. With farmers adamant on their demands, officials said, securing approval from more than 5,500 individuals could be extremely challenging. A resident of Karauli Bangar village, Vijendra Singh said, “We all are upset with the way the social impact assessment report has been evaluated by the state government. Barring two, all other demands have been ignored by the government. We are going to oppose the project.” Better compensation for land, securing the future of the children and college students, employment opportunities for those into agricultural activity and dairy business are some of the key demands. The first camp is set to be held at Mundhera and Karauli Bangar villages on January 7. Six villages (Ranhera, Karauli Bangar, Kureb, Mundhera, Birampur and Dayanatpur) are set to be affected by the second phase of the project. Residents of Ranhera, the largest village, have already decided to register their protest. On Saturday, farmers of Birampur and Mundhera also organised a panchayat to chalk out a plan, while Karauli Bangar villagers will hold one on Sunday. Farmers to be affected in Kureb and Dayanatpur are also likely to make a decision collectively in the next few days. “We are not against the project as such. But the way the rehabilitation of the affected farmers who were displaced due to the first phase (of the airport project) has been done, has left all of us jittery. We do not want verbal assurance. We want everything in writing,” Kureb resident Subhash Sharma said. Meanwhile, additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Balram Singh said, “We are finalising the list of people who have to attend the camps and show documents. We can’t comment on any speculation and will wait for the outcome after holding the camps.” A list of 1,987 land chunks, officials said, will be examined and the names of their owners are being prepared. The land chunks will be aggregated for the second phase and handed over to Zurich AG’s subsidiary for developing the second stage of the project over 1,365-hectare land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/amid-protest-land-acquisition-process-for-airport-phase-2-to-begin-tomorrow/articleshow/88640704.cms||Shalabh
---||Noida||Noida: Lawyer objects, wrong-side driver pounds his car with liquor bottles||NOIDA: A Noida resident who objected to a fellow commuter driving on the wrong side found his car being pummelled with liquor bottles soon after in a New Year’s Eve road rage that left his children — aged 9 and 4 — so shocked that they didn’t stop crying for hours. Shonak Sharma, a resident of Sector 51 and a practising lawyer at Delhi high court, had left home with his family and parents in two cars for dinner at a restaurant. They were headed towards Sector 26 when a white Verna hurtled down the road on the wrong side and came dangerously close to colliding with his parents' car. This was around 9pm. “Instead of apologising, they abused my parents. When I objected to their behaviour, they abused me too. One of the occupants was coming out of the Verna when I stepped on the accelerator, sensing trouble. I was in the car with my wife and two children,” Sharma told TOI. A couple of minutes later, Sharma spotted the Verna in his rear view mirror of his car, an Audi. Its driver had taken a U-turn and started following him. The car followed him all the way from VDS market in Sector 51 to the Iskon temple, on the road below the Noida bypass flyover. “I started to drive a little faster. I took a right turn from the Hoshiyarpur signal and hoped they would give up. But they didn’t. They caught up with me and started hurling liquor bottles at my car. They threw at least 8-9 bottles,” recalled Sharma. Confused over which way would take them to safety, Sharma steered left towards the Iskcon temple. “They just wouldn’t give up. As liquor bottles kept flying at my car, one of them smashed the rear windscreen. This time, my kids in the rear seat got really scared. But after the glass had broken, they gave up the chase. They took a U-turn and fled,” Sharma said. According to him, there were 5-6 occupants in the Verna. Even on Saturday morning, the lawyer’s kids were in shock. “They are traumatised and have been crying since last night,” he told TOI. The entire incident, Sharma said, took place between 9.15pm and 9.45pm. “I was surprised that I did not find a single cop on the road. How are ordinary residents supposed to feel safe? I have filed a written complaint and urged police to take immediate action against the miscreants,” he added. In the run up to New Year’s Eve, the police had repeatedly claimed to have made adequate security arrangements to keep a check on uncontrolled revelry. On Saturday, they said they had started an investigation. “The man couldn’t note down the car’s number. We are scanning CCTV footage of nearby areas to identify the car. A case under relevant sections will be registered,” said Vinod Kumar Singh, the SHO of Sector 49 police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/lawyer-confronts-driver-on-wrong-side-his-car-wife-2-kids-in-it-pounded-with-liquor-bottles/articleshow/88640705.cms||---

The two men have been arrested and the pistol from which they had allegedly fired recovered. Kapil Rana, who was from Hapur, ran a small food joint named SR Food Service in Omaxe Arcade. “The two men arrived around 1.30am and ordered parathas. But Rana told them he was accepting only online orders as night curfew (11pm-5am) had already kicked in. He pleaded inability to accept their orders,” said Anil Kumar, the SHO of Beta 2 police station. When the two men started creating a ruckus, Rana dialed the 112 police helpline number. “A police patrol van reached the eatery, prompting the two accused to flee the spot. Around 3.30am, they returned with a gun and knocked on the door. When Rana opened it, they fired three shots at him. He was rushed to a hospital nearby, where he was declared dead on arrival,” the SHO said. The police said they received the second call around 3.30am, informing them that Rana had been shot dead. “Praveen Kumar, the cook at the eatery, identified one of the accused as Akash (30), a resident of Bulandshahr. He was a regular customer at the eatery. Akash was arrested from Greater Noida. During questioning, he revealed the whereabouts of Yogendra, who was with him when they shot dead Rana. He, too, was arrested,” Kumar said. A case has been registered against the two under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. They were produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/owner-of-eatery-doesnt-serve-food-during-night-curfew-shot/articleshow/88640706.cms||Advitya Bahl

The “incentive” was being charged by YEIDA for the 64.7% additional compensation it had to pay to convince the farmers who had parted with their land off the Yamuna Expressway to withdraw a court case and accept an “out-of-court” settlement. Being coaxed to pay up dues till December 31 last year, hundreds of allottees, who have been given land in Sectors 32 and 33, sent individual letters to the YEIDA to reconsider its decision of levying additional money on the land premium to pay up farmers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/allottees-want-yeida-to-roll-back-additional-land-premium/articleshow/88640707.cms||---

---||Mumbai||6,186 new cases in Mumbai, 9,170 in Maharashtra; growth dips to 14%||MUMBAI: The New Year day brought some cheer with Mumbai registering only a 14% rise in the daily Covid tally as against 40% to 50% rise over the last few days. On Saturday, the city registered 6,186 cases as against 5,428 cases on Friday (the Thursday-to-Friday rise was around 50%). The state tally correspondingly rose by 14% in the last 24 hours, registering 9,170 cases as against 8,067 on Friday. There were 47,978 tests conducted in the city on Saturday, compared to 47,472 on Friday. In the state, testing numbers stood at 1.2 lakh on both Saturday and Friday. The rapid surge in cases over the last 10 days had resulted in the state additional health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas issuing a statement on Friday about the beginning of the “third wave”. Deaths continued to remain low, with the state seeing seven, including one in Mumbai. The daily Covid update by the BMC stated that 89.9% of Saturday’s cases or 5,712 out of the 6347 were asymptomatic. “Only 389 patients were hospitalised,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He said only 9% of the 30,565 Covid beds are occupied in the city at the moment. A state official said the Omicron variant virus had led to a spurt in infections across the world. “We have seen in South Africa that the rise is sharp but the decline is equally quick too,’’ he said. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the pattern of Omicron infections need to be studied for another two weeks before trends emerge. “At the moment, there are more asymptomatic cases because we are actively doing contact tracing and testing,” he added. Dr Prince Surana said that 23 patients were admitted to his Chembur hospital in the last few days with Covid. “We were to two patients a week back. However, most patients have mild infection and are admitted only for extra caution,” he said. The Omicron-Covid wave is characterized by high transmissibility as compared to other strains. In Mumbai, the daily test positivity rate reached 13.22 % on Saturday, while the positivity rate on Friday was 11.86 %. The positivity rate was 4.84% on Wednesday and 7.91% on Thursday. The state update showed that the Mumbai circle contributed 8,077 of the 9,170 cases on Saturday. Pune circle was a distant second with 686 cases. The cases in Thane and Navi Mumbai climbed to three digits in recent days. Mumbai circle registered three deaths and Pune, one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/6186-new-cases-in-city-9170-in-state-growth-dips-to-14/articleshow/88640709.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine for children at jumbo centres from tomorrow||MUMBAI: The BMC’s nine jumbo facilities will double as vaccination centres for the 9.2 lakh children in the 15-18 age group from Monday. The centres, spread from Worli to Mulund, will attempt to vaccinate at least 500 children a day each. “We have decided to allow walk-in appointments as we found that people find it less cumbersome than booking slots,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. At present, only Covaxin is available for the paediatric drive, which begins almost a year after India’s mass Covid vaccination began on January 16, 2020. While the free public drive will be kicked off by state environment minister Aditya Thackeray at BKC’s jumbo Covid centre, not all private hospitals are likely to start paediatric vaccination on Monday. The private sector will offer the vaccine for up to Rs 1,200 per shot. “We will offer vaccines for the paediatric age group and hope to start as soon we get our supply of Covaxin,” said an official from a private hospital in south Mumbai. Regarding the public drive, Kakani said, “We are starting with the jumbo centres in the first week and, judging on the response, make vaccination available at colleges and schools.” He said if needed, the BMC would start the paediatric drive in all its vaccination centres as well. The city has over 400 vaccine centres in both private and public centres. The state immunisation officials said that 650 centres have been set up across the state to vaccinate the 60 lakh adolescents in the 15-18 age group. The nine BMC centres are: the jumbo facility at the Richardson Crudas factory in Byculla, the jumbo on the Somaiya Maidan in Sion, the one at NSCI Dome in Worli, the Nesco centre in Goregaon (East) and the other jumbos at the Bandra-Kurla Complex, Malad, and Mulund (West). The BMC has also arranged for free vaccination at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Railway Hospital in Parel where children of railway employees can get vaccinated. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has set up 25 vaccination teams that will cover schools and colleges. Initially, 50% municipality-run schools and 50% private schools will be chosen for the drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/vaccine-for-children-at-jumbo-centres-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88640710.cms||---

In December, Mumbai reported 21,581 cases compared to the 6,827 cases in November. About 83% of the total December cases occurred between December 21 and 31. In Maharashtra, where most districts still report cases in double digits, the Mumbai surge had resulted in 43,759 cases in December 2021. In November, the state had registered one of its lowest monthly tallies at 26,491 cases. Almost 64% (27,842) of the state’s total December tally occurred in the last 10 days of the year. The second wave, caused by the Delta variant of the Covid-causing SARS-COV-2 virus, peaked in April and started declined a couple of months thereafter. On Friday, the state additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the third wave has begun in Maharashtra and the number of active cases could climb to two lakh by the third week of January. A note signed by Dr Vyas said the third wave — most likely an Omicron-Covid one — could see more than 80 lakh cases and about 80,000 fatalities. On Saturday, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI that though cases have increased in the last 10 days, there has only been a marginal rise in hospitalisation. “We have found that almost 90% of those diagnosed are either asymptomatic or mild cases,’’ he said. However, as a caveat, he added that it’s still very early days of the wave. “We have to wait for another two weeks for a clear picture to emerge about severity and mortality,” Dr Awate added. So far, the fatalities in the state and the city have reported a decline. Mumbai added 48 deaths in December cmapared to the 89 deaths in November.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/citys-dec-count-21581-triple-the-nov-covid-tally/articleshow/88640711.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Health minister Rajesh Tope rules out lockdown in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Ruling out a lockdown, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that so far there has been no discussion on a lockdown, though there is need for more restrictions. Tope said that on Friday, CM Uddhav Thackeray held a two-hour meeting with the health department and the state Covid taskforce but there was no discussion for a lockdown. Tope said infections are doubling every two days. The positivity rate in urban areas such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik and Raigad is high. Mumbai’s weekly positivity rate is 5%, while daily it is now between 8-11%, he said. To ensure transmissions do not increase, the government decided to implement restrictions from December 31, and this needs to be implemented strictly, he said. “The day infections rise exponentially, bed occupancy rises and oxygen consumption (in hospitals) crosses 700 metric tonnes per day, that day in automode we go in for lockdown. It is correct that the number of infections are rising every day. I appeal to the media not to create lockdown anxiety. We certainly need more restrictions to prevent transmission,” he said. Tope said the government is working on a strategy to increase vaccination, pointing out that while restrictions had increased the government had still not touched restaurants, theatres, schools and colleges. Tope added that in two days, Thackeray would hold a meeting with district collectors, senior officials and police on the Covid situation in the state. The health minister also said there is a need for a genome sequencing lab in every district. Meanwhile, Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai island city, said, “In Mumbai, if cases grow rapidly, we may have to announce a lockdown for a few days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/health-min-rules-out-lockdown-in-state/articleshow/88640713.cms||Clara Lewis

A special Judge in Alibag had in 2013 convicted him for a 2009 case of alleged bribery and hafta demand.The HC bench of Justice Anuja Prabhudessai however after going through the record said the forensic laboratory report of the voice sample of the accused did not match with the alleged recorded conversation between him and the complainant, a scrap dealer, and the sim card numbers of the alleged phone were also not in the name of the accused. Proof of demand of illegal gratification is Sine Qua Non in a corruption case said the HC.The HC said that in the absence of proof of demand, mere acceptance of any amount by way of ‘illegal gratification’ or its recovery would not be sufficient to bring home the charge under the PC Act for criminal misconduct and illegal gratification. Presumption can be drawn for offence of illegal gratification by a public servant but “only on proof of acceptance of illegal gratification, which can follow only if there is proof of demand,’’ held the bench in its judgment.The policeman, had appealed against the conviction in 2013, his lawyer Rajeev Kumar, said the alleged demand of bribe to absolve the complainant, was not corroborated by any independent evidence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-proof-of-demand-hc-acquits-cop-in-alleged-bribery-case/articleshow/88640719.cms||---

The collection is Rs 800 crore higher than in November. The GST revenue had declined from Rs 19,355 crore in October to Rs 18, 656 crore in November. Collections in December show a significant improvement. GST is a consumption-based tax and is an indicator of economic activity. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country, and it is the main revenue earner for the state government. The state’s GST collections in the nine months of the financial year from April-December are a steep 38% higher than they were last year. Collections during this period are Rs 1.57 lakh crore this year compared to Rs 1.14 lakh crore last year. Officials say there were two reasons for the dip in GST collections in November. First, the purchases in the festive season of October were higher than in November. Secondly, GST filings are typically higher in October. “Collections in December reflect improved economic activity in the period after the lifting of restrictions,” said a senior official. The GST revenue for December is 9.9% higher than it was last December.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-gst-collection-up-by-800cr-in-december/articleshow/88640722.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Brothers con dozens on pretext of villa bookings||MUMBAI: Two brothers were arrested for allegedly duping several people across Maharashtra after collecting advance payments for the weekend villa bookings, claiming to be the owners. They had duped at least 12 people in 2021 with fake information after obtaining photos of the bungalows and villas with amenities from hotel booking websites and posted them on their Instagram page (luxury.villas.lonavala), police said. Mumbai cyber police arrested the duo — Avinash Jadhwani (26), a mass communications graduate, and his younger brother Aakash (21), trained in travel and hospitality management— from a star hotel at Viman Nagar in Pune on December 28. The duo had booked a room for 10 days to celebrate the New Year with the money they allegedly collected from people booking villas for New Year celebrations. A cyber police team nabbed the brothers with technical help and learned from them that they splurged on their stay at star hotels. They had never lived at their Ghatkopar home for the past one-and-a-half-year, the police said. “The two brothers have been running the villa booking fraud for past some time. They get active before the festival season when people are looking for villa bookings to spend time with their family and friends," said DCP (Cyber-Mumbai) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. She said that the brothers were wanted in a similar case at Virar. “If anyone has booked villas after calling the number 9653110750 or 8390864676, they should approach their respective local police station and lodge a complaint,” said Karandikar. The brothers ran short of luck when they duped a 39-year-old director of a foreign news media outlet of Rs72,000. She had transferred the money as an advance payment for booking a villa in Lonavla for two nights to celebrate the New Year with her family after coming across the ad on Instagram “luxury.villas.lonavala”. She got in touch with one Hardik over the phone and booked the villa after receiving more photos. “The fraud was committed between December 6 and 22, 2021. I paid Rs72,000 (50% advance) for a two-night stay. I received a confirmation mail from a mail address (Richfeel Hospitality) that my booking had been confirmed with Mawi Infinity villa.com. On December 19, I tried to call Hardik but the number was switched off. On December 22, I checked with Mawi Infinity villa.com and managed to get details of the bungalow owner (Dharmik Modi) and learned from him that he had never posted an ad and never received any payment from me,” she said. According to the fraud victim, Dharmik Modi informed her that he had received similar inquiries from another caller, too. Earlier, the duo was booked at Chunabhatti, Dadar, DB Marg, Malabar Hill, Mulund, Powai, Khandeshwar (Navi Mumbai), Thane Rural, Naya Nagar (Mira Road), and Pimpri-Chinchwad police stations. “Their bank statements are being examined to get details of the number of people they have duped,” said a police officer. They had taken payments for booking villas in Alibaug, Goa, and Lonavla for in Christmas and New Year celebrations, the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bros-con-dozens-on-pretext-of-villa-bookings/articleshow/88640723.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||At 6,186 cases, daily count in the city sees rise of 14%||Mumbai: The New Year day brought some cheer with Mumbai registering only a 14% rise in the daily Covid tally as against 40% to 50% rise over the last few days. On Saturday, the city registered 6,186 cases as against 5,428 cases on Friday (the Thursday-to-Friday rise was around 50%).The state tally correspondingly rose by 14% in the last 24 hours, registering 9,170 cases as against 8,067 on Friday. The rapid surge in Covid cases over the last 10 days had resulted in the state additional health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas issuing a statement on Friday about the beginning of the “third wave:” in the state.Deaths continued to remain low, with Maharashtra registering seven deaths, including one in Mumbai. The daily Covid update issued by the BMC stated that 89.9% of Saturday’s cases or 5,712 out of the 6347 were asymptomatic. “Only 389 patients were hospitalised,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani.He said only 9% of the 30,565 Covid beds are occupied in the city at the moment. A senior state government official said the Omicron variant of the Covid-causing SARS-COV-2 virus has been leading to spurt in infections across the world. “We have seen in South Africa that the rise is sharp but the decline is equally quick too,’’ he said. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that the pattern of Omicron infections need to be studied for another two weeks before trends emerge. “At the moment, there are more asymptomatic cases because we are actively doing contact tracing and testing,” he added.Dr Prince Surana said that 23 patients were admitted to his Chembur hospital in the last few days with Covid. “We were to two patients a week back. However, most patients have mild infection and are admitted only for extra caution,” he said.The Omicron-Covid wave is characterized by high transmissibility as compared to other strains. In Mumbai, the daily test positivity rate reached 13.22 % on Saturday, while the positivity rate on Friday was 11.86 %. The positivity rate was 4.84% on Wednesday and 7.91% on Thursday.The state Covid update showed that the Mumbai circle contributed 8,077 of the 9,170 cases on Saturday and Pune circle was a distant second with 686 cases. The cases in Thane and Navi Mumbai have climbed to three digits in recent days. The Mumbai circle registered three deaths, Pune had one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-6186-cases-daily-count-in-the-city-sees-rise-of-14/articleshow/88640724.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drugs worth Rs 3.18 crore seized during New Year's eve operation||MUMBAI: On the New Year's eve, the city Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) conducted an operation at Bandra and seized cocaine, mephedrone aka meow meow aka MD and MDMA, which was to be sold to customers in the night. During questioning of a South African national at Bandra, the police learnt about two more of his associates and laid a trap near Vashi toll naka. The duo was also arrested, and drugs were seized from them. The value of the total seizure in ANC’s first case of the New Year is estimated to be Rs 3.18 crore. The spot near Vashi toll naka, where cops arrested two accused, is the same place where a police team was attacked last year by drug peddlers. An ANC team comprising police inspector Sanjay Chavan and officers Wahid Pathan, Suresh Bhoye and Shrikant Karkar was patrolling in Bandra (East) when they found an African national loitering in a suspicious manner. The police team questioned him and checked the bag he was carrying. Police found cocaine and MD in the bag. He was identied as Ibey Mike (39), and placed under arrest. During interrogation, he led police to two others who, he said, had supplied drugs to him for selling in the city. The police laid a trap near Vashi toll naka and detained two Nigerian nationals while they were coming towards Mumbai. Police recovered cocaine and other drugs from them. The suspects, Odif B. (40) and Mandey Igwe (38), were arrested. In all, police recovered 225 grams of cocaine, 1.5 kg MD and 235 grams of MDMA, collectively valued at Rs 3.18 crore from the three accused. There is a previous case against Mike in Bengaluru. The cops are now examining the passports of the arrested persons. Two of them had entered India pretending to be garment dealers, police said. “We will be collecting details about their visa,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/drugs-worth-3-18cr-seized-during-nye-op/articleshow/88640725.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||No breathalyzers in Mumbai: Just 18 drunk drive cases on December 31||MUMBAI: The traffic department decision to disallow the use of breathalyzers and the ban on New Year’s Eve parties resulted in just 18 drunk driving cases being recorded in Mumbai on Friday. The figure is the lowest compared with checks carried out on New Year’s Eve in the previous four years; on December 31 of 2017, the city had recorded 615 drunk driving cases. In Navi Mumbai, 44 drunk drivers were booked on Friday. Thane traffic police, though, went ahead with the use of breathalyzers and made cases against 297 individuals. In stark contrast to the 359 cases of drunk driving recorded in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on Friday, more than 3,000 motorists had been booked in pre-pandemic times on December 31, 2019, when breathalyzers were commonplace. “Our campaign focused more on education and awareness. We gave out small gifts of appreciation to responsible drivers,” said a Mumbai traffic police officer. Sources said in the absence of breathalyzers, each suspect has to be taken to a hospital for a blood-alcohol test and if found inebriated, an FIR would be registered against him at the local police station. The process is cumbersome for a force facing a manpower crunch. Among the 18 cases recorded in Mumbai, the maximum were at Bhoiwada division (four cases). Around 2,800 traffic personnel fanned out on the streets to carry out checks. No fatal crash was reported. Over 1,800 other violations, including rash driving, dangerous driving, riding triple seat and not wearing helmets, were also recorded. The Ghatkopar division intercepted the highest number of riders without helmets (66).  Thane traffic police said they took prior permission from the commissioner before using breathalyzers. “Our personnel followed Covid-19 guidelines such as wearing PPE kits and using disposable nozzles on breathalyzers. Police action against all individuals has been videographed for evidence,” said DCP Balasaheb Patil. Apart from inebriated drivers, Thane police booked 131 co-passengers who were accompanying drunk drivers in the same vehicle and “abetting” the offence. Compared to 2020, police observed a lull on the streets with most citizens preferring to stay indoors perhaps due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. Cops deployed 56 fixed check-points and 36 mobile squads. Personnel were posted on intersections near restaurants, bars and markets to intercept drunk drivers before they could slip away to arterial roads. Navi Mumbai witnessed a marginal rise in the number of drunk drivers intercepted on New Year’s Eve. While 44 motorists were booked on Friday, the figure was 27 on December 31, 2020. A majority of Friday’s cases were at Taloja and Mahape. “We booked nine individuals—all motorcyclists—at Mahape and will produce them before the Vashi JMFC court. The law gives powers to the court to decide the quantum of punishment. Maximum fine is Rs 10,000 under the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act,” said Rajiv Shejwal, senior inspector of Mahape traffic unit. Over 1,600 other traffic violations were also recorded in Navi Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-breathalyzers-in-city-just-18-drunk-drive-cases-on-dec-31/articleshow/88640726.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shiv Sena kicks off its BMC poll campaign with tax sop||MUMBAI: Announcing full property tax waiver for homes measuring less than 500 square feet in Mumbai, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday sounded the Shiv Sena’s poll bugle for the BMC elections. Apart from making the key announcement which is expected to resonate with lakhs of middle- and lower-middle class families, which have for long been the Sena’s core voter base, Thackeray also made a push for the party ahead of the BMC polls, asking people to continue to bless it with their support. Thackeray took a veiled dig at the BJP and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, by saying they make promises before elections but back out later.  “Many leaders promise stars and the moon during elections and later forget about it and back out. When people ask that you had promised stars and the moon, they say that such things are talked about during elections,” Thackeray said. The CM also made a pitch for his son, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, ahead of the elections. “This is the fourth generation of the Thackeray family in public service...in Mumbai... It started with my grandfather Prabodhankar Thackeray, then my father Balasaheb who founded the Shiv Sena and now Aaditya is doing it. At nights he makes visits to check on the progress of road works and nullah cleaning. He has almost eased my burden as far as works in Mumbai are concerned,” Thackeray said. Political analysts said Aaditya could be the Sena’s main face for the BMC polls. With the state government increasing the seats in BMC from 227 to 236, and the lack of clarity over OBC reservation and the third Covid-19 wave, the BMC elections could get delayed, officials said. Interestingly, Congress minister Aslam Shaikh, who is the guardian minister for Mumbai city, was also part of the meeting where the tax waiver was announced, indicating that an understanding between the Sena and Congress could be on the cards. With city Congress president Bhai Jagtap saying the party will go solo in the BMC polls, Sena strategists have said instead of a formal alliance, the party may have an “understanding” with the Congress in key areas to defeat the BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-kicks-off-its-bmc-poll-campaign-with-tax-sop/articleshow/88640727.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Property tax waiver to cost BMC Rs 463 crore, says Iqbal Chahal||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced a complete waiver of property tax for all homes measuring less than 500 square feet in the city. “The property tax waiver will be applicable from January and this time it is a complete waiver,” BMC chief Iqbal Chahal told TOI. The BMC recently mopped up Rs 11,000 crore in premiums from the construction industry after the government announced a 50% waiver in premiums on account of the pandemic. Chahal said till December 31, the BMC had also collected Rs 3,450 crore in property tax when its target was only Rs 800 crore. “For 2021-22, the property tax target is Rs 5,000 crore and we shall easily cover it,” he said, adding the waiver would cost the BMC around Rs 463 crore. Thackeray had on Saturday called a meeting of Shiv Sena leaders from Mumbai, including urban development minister Eknath Shinde, his son and guardian minister for Mumbai suburbs Aaditya Thackeray, mayor Kishori Pednekar and Congress leader and island city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh. “Mumbai has been built with the sweat and hard work of ordinary citizens and it is for them we have taken this decision. Today, we, including the Congress, are working together... Shiv Sena makes a promise, it does not give mere assurances,” he said. The chief minister said the party had given a similar waiver in 2017, but this time it is a complete waiver and would come into effect immediately. Thackeray said the Shiv Sena was born in 1966 and has been the ruling party in Mumbai. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, reacting to CM Uddhav Thackeray’s announcement, tweeted: “To fulfill the promise made in 2017, finally 2022, the election year, has dawned.” He also shared the video of his speech in the recent legislative session where he had criticised the Shiv Sena for not fulfilling its 2017 promise. “The government only waived off a small component of the property tax. The people only got a “Bhopla” (pumpkin).....we hope the government will now fulfill its promise,” he said.  BMC officials say property tax comprises eight components, including general tax, water tax, sewerage tax, education cess, tree cess and water benefit tax, among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/property-tax-waiver-to-cost-bmc-463cr-says-chahal/articleshow/88640728.cms||Clara Lewis

The total value of transactions in December was also a new record at Rs 8.27 lakh crore.According to bankers, the surge in transactions is a reflection of increasing adoption as well the rise in economic activity in December following the sharp drop in second wave cases. UPI transactions had hit a record in October driven by festival season purchases and online sales by e-commerce companies. However, after the festival peak, there was a marginal dip in November. December marks a 9% in the number of transactions and a 7.6% increase in value.Compared to transactions in December 2020, the use of UPI in December 2021 has doubled both in value and volume.In calendar 2021, there were 3800 crore UPI transactions amounting to Rs 73 lakh crore. The National Payments Corporation of India, which runs UPI, expects the volume to hit one billion a day when the Reserve Bank of India operationalises the use of UPI wallet for low-value offline transactions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/upi-transactions-hit-new-record-in-dec/articleshow/88640729.cms||---
---||Mumbai||MCA postpones all its tournaments due to rising Covid-19 cases||Mumbai: The Mumbai Cricket Association on Saturday decided to postpone all its local cricket tournaments due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city, reports Gaurav Gupta. “Due to increasing Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Kanga & Tournament Committee decided to postpone all MCA Tournaments including U-25 Shalini Bhalekar and Madhav Mantri E,F & G Div matches till further notice,” stated MCA secretary Sanjay Naik and Jt. secretary Shahalam Shaikh on the MCA website. Mumbai has seen a steep jump in covid cases, with the number being 6347 positive cases on Saturday. This has resulted in the government imposing several restrictions in the past few days. On Thursday, the BCCI had announced that it was postponing the Vijay Merchant Under-16 Trophy due to rising covid cases in India. The MCA’s decision to postpone all its local cricket is a big blow to the city’s budding cricketers, but is sensible and expected given the worsening situation and the rapid spread of covid cases. This is the third time in the past two years that the MCA has been forced to postpone all local cricket due to Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mca-postpones-all-its-tournaments-due-to-rising-covid-19-cases/articleshow/88640730.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Selectors have not paid attention to building Mumbai’s bench strength’||Mumbai: Former Mumbai wicketkeeper Sulakshan Kulkarni, who coached the team to the Ranji Trophy title in the 2012-13 season, has questioned the omission of certain “quality” fast bowlers, particularly pacer Minad Manjrekar, from the Mumbai squad which has been picked by the Salil Ankola-led selection panel for the first two matches of the 2021-22 Ranji Trophy.From 2017 to 2020, Manjrekar picked as many as 120 wickets while playing for the Mumbai Under-19 and Under-23 teams. For the Mumbai U-23 team, he took 83 wickets in two seasons besides scoring 500 runs. The 25-year-old picked 34 wickets in six games in the 2018-19 season, and then scalped 49 wickets in 10 matches in the following season.In October, Manjrekar took 4-14, including a hat-trick for Parkophene Cricketers against Sind SC in the Padmakar Talim Shield T20 Tournament .“Manjrekar is a victim of injustice. He’s an outstanding pacer. He is someone who can play for India in the future. He has quality pace— bowls at around 135 kmph and swings the ball. However, how can he ever make it the India ‘A’ team or the Indian team if the Mumbai selectors continue to ignore him,” said Kulkarni.In 2016, as a teenager, he travelled to Australia along the likes of Prasidh Krishna, David Mathias and Tushar Desphande as part of the IDBI Federal Bowling Foundation to train under Jeff Thomson. “When he went to Australia, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz had both praised him and Krishna. Two years back, he took six for 114 on a flat Wankhede wicket against Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy. I remember he bowled more than 250 overs in that (19-20) season in BCCI tournaments. In Tushar Deshpande’s absence, he should’ve been your frontline pacer,” stressed the 54-year-old.He also named three other pacers who he felt deserved a chance this time. “Krutik Hanagavadi, Anjdeep Lad and Saksham Jha are the other pacers who should have been given an opportunity. These bowlers would have helped make the bench strength strong, which is what the Mumbai team needs right now. If India is doing well in Tests this team, it’s because our bench strength is good. Sadly, that’s not been the case with Mumbai. For the last two-three years, we’ve not paid attention to building our bench strength. Why have those who’ve done well in the U-19 and U-23 teams for Mumbai have not been considered?,” he questioned.Kulkarni said that pacer Atif Attarwala — who didn’t get a game in the Vijay Hazare Trophy despite being a part of the squad — was unlucky to miss out. The 29-year-old, playing for Payyade SC, won the ‘Best Bowler award’ in the Talim Shield T20, Madhav Mantri one-day tournament, and then the Police Shield semifinal (4-50) and final (2-50 & 4-39) this season. “Injustice has been done on him too. If he was picked because of consistently good performances in local cricket, why was he dropped without getting a single opportunity?” he wondered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/selectors-have-not-paid-attention-to-building-mumbais-bench-strength/articleshow/88640731.cms||---

The last time the state witnessed such a spike was on September 16. With 810 new infections, Bengaluru accounted for 78% of the cases. Bengaluru’s daily case count is the highest in 185 days. The city had seen 813 fresh cases on June 30 during the second wave. Spike is also seen in Dakshina Kannada that logged 48 cases on the day, followed by Mysuru 29, Udupi 28 and Mandya 23. The active cases jumped to 9,386 in the state and Bengaluru has 84% (or 7,876) of the total. Admitting an increase in cases in Bengaluru, similar to Mumbai and Delhi, the state government is ramping up infrastructure in dedicated Covid hospitals. For the past one week, Kodagu is the only district with 1% average test positivity rate, while Bengaluru Urban has now crossed 0.9%. Having conducted 1.2 lakh tests in 24 hours, the state’s daily positivity rate was closer to 0.9% on Saturday. The cases are increasing. As of now, the level of hospitalisation has not been high. Currently, it is not worrisome," TK Anil Kumar, principal secretary, health and family welfare department, told STOI. He said Charaka hospital on Broadway Road and the 180-bed hospital built with CSR funds at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases will be used for Covid admissions. "CV Raman Nagar general hospital is now a Covid hospital," he said. The state reported five deaths on Saturday. This included the death of a 45-year-old woman in May 2021 in Tumakuru. The data reconciled also included the names of two women aged 60 years, one each from Mandya and Uttara Kannada districts, who had succumbed to Covid in July and August 2021, respectively. Two victims - from Bengaluru - died last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/1k-new-covid-cases-in-ktaka-bengalurus-810-a-6-mth-high/articleshow/88640736.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Property guidance value cut by 10% for 3 months||BENGALURU: In a boost to the real estate sector and relief for home buyers, the Karnataka government on Saturday decided to cut property guidance value by 10% for three months effective January 1. Guidance value is the base price of properties fixed by the government, and property registrations cannot go below the threshold. Karnataka collects a duty of 5.65%, including cess and surcharge, on transaction value and 1% registration fee on guidance value. Guidance value cut a New Year gift: MinisterRevenue minister R Ashoka announced the concession, calling it a gift for the people of Karnataka on New Year. He urged the public to utilise the opportunity and get their properties registered at the earliest. Ashoka said this has been a long-standing demand and the announcement has been made after several rounds of discussions between the finance and revenue departments, IGR (inspector-general of registration) and the chief minister Basavaraj Bommai for the past one month. "This is an offer for those who are biding time with the general power of attorney (GPA) and agreements on properties. Also, it is for those who are planning property registrations. With this move, we may have some impact on our revenue, but it will benefit common people,'' he added IGR officials said the move will help in giving a boost to home sales and the economy amid a rise in Covid-19 cases. They said the AAP government in Delhi was the first to announce a similar measure last year and it helped revive the real estate sector hit by the pandemic. Against the expectations of many, the state decided to offer a 10% cut only for three months. "Housing sales saw a good recovery over the past six months supported by the stamp-duty cuts, low home loan rates and attractive schemes offered by developers. Although we appreciate the government's decision, the cut should have been offered for at least a year as it would have helped in sustaining the sales momentum," said a real-estate developer. With the second wave impacting economic recovery and a third wave staring the state in the face, real estate observers said the sector needs continued support from the government and they may be pushed to extend the offer by another three months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/property-guidance-value-cut-by-10-for-3-months/articleshow/88640737.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||New Year resolutions are passe as Bengalureans set realistic goals||BENGALURU: A question that popularly accompanies ‘Happy New Year’ wish is: “What is your resolution this year?” This might soon fade into oblivion as more and more youngsters are ditching the trend of setting resolutions and aiming for a mentally stable and practical approach to start the year. For instance, Sandeep Raja, a software developer, said under the current circumstances, the most a person can wish for is to stay alive and remain sane. “I think resolutions will not make any sense as our mental capacity has been overloaded because of the pandemic. We should prioritise mental health and just stay safe. If we make it through another year, that’s a big achievement in itself,” he said. Mohamed Zeeshan, a policy analyst and foreign affairs columnist, believes New Year’s resolutions do not work because accomplishing or doing something needn’t have to wait for a change in the calendar. “If someone was going to do those things, they would already have begun working on them,” he said. Parsa, a teacher, said the disillusionment with the tradition of New Year’s resolutions is a result of awareness among youngsters that self-care and practical goal-setting is better than struggling for perfectionism. “People have been setting new resolutions forever and they almost always give up within a week or two. The only people benefiting were gyms selling long-term memberships,” he said. “People now understand that change doesn’t happen overnight. So they don’t aim too high to set themselves up for failure. When people begin to be nicer to themselves, they won’t need January 1 to be the day of their redemption.” Karthik Keramalu, a writer, said there is too much pressure on NY resolutions. “Some people are great at coming up with a list of things to do. But I am not. I pick up what I want along the way and discard useless habits and rituals while I am at it. I cannot wait for a particular occasion to set myself on the path I want to walk on. And with the pandemic stretching uncertainty longer than usual, I feel it is pointless to put goals on paper. That said, we need to motivate ourselves and if resolutions are the light at the end of the tunnel, so be it,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ny-resolutions-are-passe-as-blureans-set-realistic-goals/articleshow/88640738.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Homestay owner held for curfew violations in Ramanagara||BENGALURU: Cops on Friday night raided a homestay near Kanva reservoir in MK Doddi, Ramanagara district, for violating night curfew rules during New Year celebrations. The man, identified as Swamy, 32, has been arrested under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020. Police were tipped by villagers about the homestay which had revellers playing music and dancing outside detachable tents. Ramanagara district SP S Girish said there were more than 500 revellers, most of whom were from Bengaluru, Mandya and Mysuru. “There were families among them, so we allowed them to leave. We seized alcohol bottles and detachable tents used during the celebrations,” he said. The homestay owner claimed to have accepted online bookings for the celebrations around two months ago, but hadn’t taken police permission. Swamy was informed about the latest government guidelines and night curfew rules. Prima facie, he violated them, the SP said. In another incident in Chikkaballapur district, cops stopped a New Year party organised at a resort after drunk revellers got into an argument and refused to stop public celebrations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/homestay-owner-held-for-curfew-violations/articleshow/88640739.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Ahead of assembly polls, 2022 to be make-or-break year for parties in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The year 2022 is important for all parties in the state as they need to set the stage to face assembly elections in early 2023. The major ones — BJP, Congress, and JD(S) — have started gearing up for the challenge. With speculation on leadership change put to rest, BJP has already hinted at restructuring the cabinet and the party’s organisational setup with new faces ahead of the assembly polls. While the party has set a goal of winning more than 150 seats, it will be easier said than done as since 1989, no ruling party has managed to beat anti-incumbency and retain power in the state. BJP is trying to break this “myth” with Basavaraj Bommai at the helm and it appears to have fallen back on its old election plank— Hindutva. After enacting the anti-cattle slaughter law in 2020, the party this year will look to complete some unfinished tasks — pushing an anti-conversion bill, which is yet to get legislative council clearance, and bringing in a bill to provide autonomy to temples under the muzrai department. “There can’t be any complacency in the government or party. In fact, the Hangal bypoll debacle and the recent urban local body polls were a warning signal for the cadres and leaders, and also a lesson. We have to work hard, be aggressive, and remain focused on ‘Mission Repeat’ to showcase our best performance,” said a senior party MLA. The party brass will also face the challenge of handling veteran leader BS Yediyurappa, who is looking for the slightest opportunity to return to active politics for the sake of his younger son BY Vijayendra. Social-engineering formula Congress faces the challenge of finding a successful social-engineering formula to counter BJP’s Hindutva plank. With DK Shivakumar at the helm, the party is hoping that Vokkaligas will back it, but it is too early to write off JD(S) that enjoys the community’s support. The regional party has always done well in the assembly polls, especially in the Vokkaliga heartland. The 170km padayatra beginning January 9, initiated by Shivakumar from Mekedatu in Kanakapura to Bengaluru to press for the Mekedatu project, is seen as an attempt to woo the Vokkaliga community since Cauvery is the lifeline of Old Mysore region. In doing so, Shivakumar is also trying to revive the party’s old social-engineering formula of combining ‘SC-Muslim-Kuruba-Vokkaliga’ voters to return to power. But it’s an uphill task, considering he faces competition from senior colleague Siddaramaiah, who hopes to become chief minister again before hanging up his boots. JD(S), on the other hand, has a bigger challenge considering it is turning out to be a sinking ship faced with desertions. It will be a challenging year as the party has to deal with an existential crisis while trying to stay relevant in the assembly polls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ahead-of-assembly-polls-2022-to-be-make-or-break-year-for-parties/articleshow/88640740.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda

We can’t just sit back imposing restrictions. We need to face challenges with various strategies, work with greater vigour to tackle them,” Bommai said.He wanted officials to work on making revenue-generating departments more efficient to improve the state’s finances.“Face these challenges with a positive attitude; work according to your conscience. Let your experience help poor,” he told officials. Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar, DG-IGP Praveen Sood and other senior officials participated in the meeting.

YL Devaraju, a resident of Tumakuru, was sentenced to four years’ simple imprisonment and fined Rs 10,000. The order was passed by judge S Sudhindranath, who directed Devaraju to undergo simple imprisonment of another two months if he fails to pay the fine. The doctor, who was out on bail, has been taken to Tumakuru district prison. He was trapped by ACB sleuths while accepting the bribe on June 6, 2018. “A farmer from Mavinakere in Tumakuru district had lost his cow to a disease in February 2018. He had insured the animal and approached Devaraju for a death certificate. As a rule, insurance companies hand over the compensation cheque to the doctor who certifies the death and issues the certificate,” public prosecutor N Basavaraju said. Devaraju allegedly demanded a bribe from the farmer and took Rs 12,000 in instalments. “By then, the insurance company released a cheque for Rs 50,000. It was handed over to Devaraju, who again demanded Rs 3,000 to pass it on. Not willing to pay the bribe, the farmer filed a complaint with the Tumakuru ACB unit. The doctor was trapped while accepting Rs 3,000,” Basavaraju said. This is the fourth conviction order passed by special court judge Sudhindranath since August.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/vet-gets-four-years-in-jail-for-taking-bribe-from-farmer/articleshow/88640742.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Fake cops rob family of Rs 19 lakh cash, gold||BENGALURU: Three miscreants, two of them posing as cops, robbed a civil engineer of Rs 19 lakh cash and 500 grams of gold ornaments from his residence at Mahalakshmi Layout on Friday. The victim, Samya Naika, 50, said the incident occurred when he was at home with his wife and daughter. Naika said three men visited his house around 2pm. Two of them introduced themselves as cops from Tiptur police station in Tumakuru district and told Naika the third man was a robber. They said the robber had claimed to have handed over a gun, cash and some gold ornaments to Naika's son-in-law. “We have come to recover them now,” they said. “I replied that we had no idea of what they were referring to. They became furious and pulled a gun and threatened us. Snatching our phones, they made us to sit in a room and ransacked the house. They took Rs 19 lakh cash and 500 grams of gold,” Naika stated in his complaint. Then, the suspects, using Naika’s mobile, called his son Manohar, a photographer. When Manohar arrived, the miscreants bundled him and Naika into the latter’s car and drove away. “They told us we would be taken to Tiptur police station. However, they said they would free us if we gave them Rs 20 lakh. I said I didn’t have that much cash. They told me to hand over the money and gold given to me by my son-in-law Jaya Naika. They stopped the car eventually and left with the cash and gold stolen,” Naika said. “We have some concrete evidence about the suspects, who were aware of the cash and gold in Naika’s house. We will nab them soon,” an investigating officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fake-cops-rob-family-of-19l-cash-gold/articleshow/88640743.cms||---

Papanna alias Reddy, 40, a resident of Sulibele in Nandagudi, fled the town two months ago with investments from around 150 people. He was traced to a hideout in Madanapalle, near AP. “He would accept monthly investments of Rs 2,000 each. After 30 months, the investor would get back Rs 70,000 — an extra Rs 10,000 on the investment made. Papanna had been returning the promised money, but after lockdowns began in early 2020, he faced a financial crisis,” an officer said. “As per the complaints, he was irregular in payments from mid-2021.” TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bizman-held-for-duping-investors/articleshow/88640744.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Cases for defective number plates jump from 2.5 lakh to 4.1 lakh in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The number of cases booked against vehicles having defective number plates in the city increased from 2.5 lakh in 2020 to 4.1 lakh (till November) in 2021. Bengaluru traffic police say they have intensified special drives focusing on vehicles with defective number plates. However, some motorists allege cops are now stopping them for not having high-security registration plates (HSRPs). Arun K, a motorist, tweeted: “Why is our traffic police asking for a fine for HSRP number plates for older vehicles when the rule is not applicable. Today I was stopped at two places and paid a fine of Rs 500 for not having HSRP number plate (sic).” Alok, another motorist, tweeted, “I was fined for not having HSRP. But when I asked where I would get them, I got no answer. RTO says they have no process to issue for old cars, there is no information online... citizens have no idea how to get these! But still, we are getting fined.” Transport officials clarified that HSRP is mandatory only for vehicles registered after April 2019. “Vehicles registered post April 1, 2019, already have HSRP. For old vehicles, we will soon issue a notification, so till then it is not mandatory for them,” said L Narendra Holkar, additional commissioner of transport (enforcement). He said the authorities floated a tender to select an agency to provide HSRP to over 1.7 crore old vehicles across the state in the next three years. “We have already conducted a pre-bid meeting with firms. We will soon finalise the tender and issue a notification,” he said. A senior traffic police officer said registration plates as per Motor Vehicles Act regulations are required for contactless enforcement. “It will be difficult to identify vehicles on CCTV if the number plates are of different sizes. We have intensified raids on defective number plates after a high court order,” he said, adding that most vehicles in the city have fancy number plates. “This is in violation of Central Motor Vehicle Rules.” The Union ministry of road transport and highways has already made it mandatory for all vehicle owners to fix HSRP and colour-coded plates on their vehicles. However, implementation in Karnataka has been delayed. HSRP is not easy to tamper with and cannot be misused, thus it also helps to identify stolen vehicles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cases-for-defective-number-plates-jump-from-2-5l-to-4-1l/articleshow/88640745.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru Metro will have 170km network, 17 lakh ridership by 2024: BMRCL MD||BENGALURU: Namma Metro’s network will be extended from 56km to 170km and its daily ridership is expected to increase to 17 lakh by 2024, said BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez. Currently, daily Metro ridership is 3.3-3.5 lakh. Before the pandemic, it was around 5 lakh. Asked about the status of the Metro corridors, Parwez said: “Challaghatta station (2km Kengeri-Challaghatta extension) will be ready by September 2022 and the 3km stretch of Nagasandra-Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (Madavara) will be operational by October-November 2022”. The deadline for two corridors —Byappanahalli-Whitefield (15km) and RV Road-Bommasandra (Electronics City) (19km) — is December 2022. “Work on the entire 21km Kalena Agrahara-Nagawara corridor will be over by 2024,” he added. “Both Whitefield Metro and Electronics City Metro are progressing fast. In fact, we have resolved all land acquisition and tree felling issues between Byappanahalli and KR Puram,” he said. Parwez said the Outer Ring Road (Central Silk Board- KR Puram) and airport (KR Puram-Kempegowda International Airport) lines are also on track. “We are confident of meeting the 2024 deadline for these two corridors”. He said completion of Byappanahalli-Whitefield and ORR-Airport Metro will substantially increase daily ridership to more than17 lakh by 2024. No obstacles for ORR-Airport Line In May 2021, BMRCL awarded the work order to Afcons Infrastructure Ltd to construct Central Silk board – Kodibeesanahalli (package 1), Shankaranarayana Constructions (SNC) received the contract for the remaining Kodibeesanahalli- KR Puram (package 2). In November, BMRCL awarded the contract to Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC) in November for all three civil construction packages from KR Puram to KIA. For BMRCL, normally it will take an average five years to complete a Metro corridor. For instance, 3Km Nagasandra-BIEC section work which began in 2017 and was supposed to be completed by mid-2019 is yet to be over mainly due to land acquisition issues. “There is no question of delay of the ORR-airport corridor. We have no land acquisition issues. A majority of the land is acquired and handed over to the contractors. We received a favourable order from the high court on felling trees. We also managed to get an NoC from the Government Flying Training School, Jakkur, for the work,” Parwez said. He said they will be using 'U-girders' for constructing the viaduct on ORR-Airport Metro section. "These are readied in the casting yards and brought to the site. Track laying on these girders can be done immediately unlike box-girders or I-girders,” said Parwez. “For other Metro corridors, delays were due to land acquisition issues. Till two weeks ago, SNC completed 125 piles while Afcons completed piling at 118 locations on ORR sections. Work is progressing really fast on ORR and construction for the airport line will also gain pace in the next few weeks” said Parwez.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/metro-ridership-will-rise-to-17l-by-2024/articleshow/88640746.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru-Kanakapura highway gives bumpy ride to motorists||BENGALURU: Driving down Bengaluru-Kanakapura Road National Highway-948 (previously NH-209), which connects south Bengaluru and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, has been a back-breaking experience for motorists for the past five years. Residents and regular motorists said they filed several complaints to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to repair the road but no action has been taken so far. Peaceful India Trust, an NGO, recently put up a warning board on the roadside, which reads: “This Kanakapura Road condition is very bad. Drive safely.” Nadeem Pasha, secretary of the trust, said: “Owner of the construction firm passed away a few months ago, so there has been no work in the last six months. This stretch is full of potholes and is prone to accidents. We requested NHAI to at least fill the potholes as an interim relief but they are not bothered.” NHAI officials were unavailable for comments. K Shivakumar, a passenger, said: “It’s dangerous, especially for two-wheeler riders, to use this road, particularly at night. NHAI should fix the stretch at the earliest instead of waiting for accidents to happen. In fact, many people travelling to and from Harohalli are using this road every day but it is a deathtrap.” “The contractor appears to have abandoned the work. NHAI should take steps to cancel this tender and float a fresh one. It’s a nightmare to use this road since there are no dividers, streetlights and reflectors, especially from NICE Road junction to Harohalli,” said Hemant Kumar, another motorist. As per NHAI’s plan, the highway from NICE junction to Kanakapura was to be four-laned and Kanakapura to Karnataka border near Chamarajanagar was to be a two-lane road. This road could be developed as an alternative route to Mysuru as the existing one through Channapatna is now congested. This road will also reduce travel time to Coimbatore compared to the existing one via Krishnagiri. Many people travelling from Bengaluru to Kozhikode in Kerala depend on this route. “This is an important road which also connects tourist spots like Cauvery Sangam, Mekedatu, MM Hills, BR Hills and Chamarajanagar. But work has stopped midway due to various reasons. This should be expedited,” said R Tejaswi, a commuter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bluru-kanakapura-highway-gives-bumpy-ride-to-motorists/articleshow/88640749.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Show us certificate confirming Omicron infection, patients tell private hospitals||BENGALURU: Those who tested positive for Omicron in the state face a peculiar problem: They haven’t been given any official document stating they have been infected with the new variant. As many as 66 cases (42 still in hospitals, 24 discharged) have been reported in the state since December 2. Lack of documentation has caused friction between patients and the hospitals where they are being treated. At present, district authorities inform the hospitals through phone calls. “Private hospitals do not receive a copy of the reports. BBMP informs us through phone calls and we communicate the same to the patients. All those have been are detected with the variant now are international travellers who demand reports, which we don’t have,” said the authorities of a private hospital. That’s one of the six private hospitals designated for admitting international passengers testing positive for Covid on arrival. The hospital has also taken up the matter with the Covid Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). Another hospital has been counselling patients as and when they get information from BBMP about genomic sequencing detecting the Omicron variant. Most of them have come to Bengaluru for a purpose, either personal or professional. “They are already in a state of ‘why me’ during admission and they suspect the RT-PCR positive report itself. They wait for a minimum 5-6 days to know the genomic sequencing reports. When it turns out to be the variant of concern, they feel a sense of anxiety and denial owing to stigma and isolation. We need to tackle this with scientific evidence like genomic sequencing reports shown to them,” said the head of a hospital in west Bengaluru. In another case, a young woman tested positive for Covid on arrival and got admitted to a private hospital in the third week of December. The hospital authorities said her father was upset with the new regulations for international travellers which pushed her for institutional isolation despite having no symptoms. “The father kept calling demanding her discharge from hospital, and would yell at us. But suddenly he went silent after the 6th day. We checked with the family and learnt they had received a call from BBMP stating that the woman was infected with the new variant. But we don’t get the same information from the Palike at all,” they added. “Omicron detection through genomic sequencing does not come in the form of an RT-PCR certificate. But the state surveillance wing gets the report which has details of the patients,” said BBMP officials, admitting that there has been a communication gap. A TAC member said it’s a tricky situation where patients older than 18 years must be explained about why they are in hospital and the family also has to be communicated. “Having proper communication channels along with maintaining patient’s confidentiality is the need of the hour. We suggested to the government to have one dedicated officer for communicating between the labs, hospitals and patients,” said the member.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/show-us-certificate-confirming-omicron-infection-patients-tell-private-hospitals/articleshow/88640752.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Mask rule violators paid Rs 9.5 crore penalty last year||BENGALURU: The drive against those moving around in public places without wearing masks had evoked terse reactions, but there is a positive side to it: The crackdown helped the authorities in breaking the chain of Covid-19 transmission. “We hope those penalised by our marshals do no repeat the mistake again; they will become more cautious in public places and wear masks,” a senior BBMP official said. Those caught not wearing masks are liable to pay penalty of Rs 250. According to data compiled by BBMP, around 3.9 lakh persons were penalised for not wearing masks in 2021 and fine collected added up to Rs 9.5 crore. The highest collection was in January with 67,615 people being penalised followed by February (36,887). The least number of persons penalised was in June (5,092) and May (7,545). BBMP has deputed 240 marshals to ensure guidelines are followed. The marshals focused on apartments, markets, shopping complexes, hotels, bus stops and other places to enforce the mask rule. Though the priority was to create awareness about the importance of masks after the first wave, the marshals went after violators when complacency set in among the public after vaccination. Chief marshal Colonel Rajbhir Singh (retired) said with increase in cases during the second wave, people became more vigilant and followed Covid-19 protocols. By February 2021, the violators had declined by 50% (the number was 36,887) and soon it came down to 7,545 in May and 5,092 in June. “With lockdown easing, the number of violators rose. People tend to become complacent, which again leads to spike in cases,” he said. “In Bengaluru, levying penalty against social distancing is challenging. There are so many occasions where people come together,” he added. Min Nagesh tests positivePrimary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh on Saturday said he tested positive for Covid with mild symptoms. “I have quarantined myself and taking all necessary precautions and medication required,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mask-rule-violators-paid-9-5cr-penalty-last-year/articleshow/88640753.cms||Nithya Mandyam

As per the revised curriculum, engineering students will have an entire semester devoted to project work in their final year.The new rule will come into force when the present second year students move to final year.“We are planning to allow 50% of students to do the industrial projects in the seventh semester and the rest will be allowed to take up the projects in the eighth semester so that the industry will have students working throughout the year trying to find solutions for their problems,” Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj told TOI.The university also plans to create a database in collaboration with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on industry requirements. Students can select any industrial problem and work on it. “Students will be exposed to the industrial environment and the companies will get a chance to assess students and absorb them,” he said.In the existing curriculum, students have to do at least two elective courses in their final semester. However, the revised curriculum will give a full semester in their final year to do projects.Colleges welcome the move saying it would improve the industry connect. “It will help rural colleges which lack industry connect get exposure,” said P Deiva Sundari, principal of KCG College of Technology. Ideally, students need to do projects based on industrial problems, research-oriented projects and in-house problem statements, she said. “If the university implements it successfully, it will improve interaction with the industry. Students also will get to work on a wider range of problems,” said D Valavan, principal of Saranathan College of Engineering in Trichy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/anna-univ-engg-students-to-work-on-practical-projects/articleshow/88640755.cms||---

At least 10 summons were issued by the GST chennai zonal unit from 2016 till 2018 and since he did not appear for inquiry, they moved the court for the offence. After perusing the submissions, the magistrate noted that the non appearance showsthe malafide intention to disrupt the on going investigation and escape from the clutches of law. Vishal had subsequently complied after filing of this case, the magistrate noted and said that lenient punishment is enough and imposed a fine of 500. While the actor was found guilty and imposed a lenient fine of 500, the additional chief metropolitan magistrate had strong words of condemnation for the actor for delaying proceedings. “It may be true that he is a very busy person involved in very many activities but at the same time he has a bounden duty to comply with the summons issued by the authorities under the judicial proceedings and to cooperate with them. The circumstances show that but for the issuance of summons in this complaint he would not have attempted to appear before the complainant for the enquiry,” the magistrate stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/actor-vishal-chided-by-local-court-over-delays/articleshow/88640757.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Two bus terminals to be solar powered||CHENNAI: The two mofussil bus terminuses coming up at Kuthambakkam and Kilambakkam will be hubs for generating solar power, which will also be used to recharge e-vehicles there. They are likely to be the first public buildings in Chennai to be near net zero, using renewable energy generated on campus. The two bus terminuses are to be completed by the year-end. Moreover, the 12KW solar panel at the Madhavaram mofussil bus terminus that generates just 40 units, will be upgraded to 300KW to generate about 1,000 units a day. The three bus terminuses will collectively have 10 MW of solar panels generating about 30,500 units dailys. At Kilambakkam, the 60-acre terminus for buses to the southern districts can produce 19,200 units a day. Kuthambakkam can produce nearly 10,400 units a day. Kilambakkam and Kuthambakkam can produce 80 to 90 per cent of the electricity they need from solar energy. There are also plans to set up recharge stations for e-buses and e-cars to use the excess power they produce. If the entire renewable energy is used for charging e-vehicles, 40 buses or 800 cars can be recharged at Kilambakkam. According to sources with CMDA, which is constructing the bus terminuses, there may be a tie-up with Tangedco to share the solar power generated. While the solar panels can effectively generate power only for four and half hours in a day, it will not be stored in batteries to avoid 20% wastage. It would be transferred to the Tangedco grid for supply in the neighbouring areas. In turn, Tangedco will provide power for 19 hours a day and during the rains, when solar power cannot be generated. CMDA member-secretary Anshul Mishra told TOI that steps are being taken to achieve net zero in Madhavaram bus terminus too. “The two public buildings at Kuthambakkam and Kilambakkam could be the first to approach near zero,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/2-bus-terminals-to-be-solar-powered/articleshow/88640758.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: At Rs 147.7 crore, December 31 liquor sale dips by Rs 12 crore||CHENNAI: Sale of liquor on the New Year's eve in the state was down by 12 crore when compared to the corresponding day the previous year. According to the Tasmac sources, alcohol marketed through the state-owned outlets generated 147.7 crore revenue on Friday against 160 crore fetched during the same day in 2020. Of this, Chennai region comprising the city, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts accounted for 28%. This is the second dip in sales during the New Year's eve after 2020. Restrictions in view of the Omicron outbreak is cited as a major reason for the fall in sales figures on Friday. Chennai zone witnessed the highest sale of 41.4 crore in the state followed by Madurai region at 27.4 crore, the sources said. Sales of liquor in Coimbatore, Salem and Trichy zones ranged from 25.4 crore to 26.8 crore.  The dip in sale in the Chennai region is about 8.5 crore when compared to the same in 2020. The other regions recorded a marginal drop. Sale of beer reported 5.6% fall and IMFL by around 1.7% when compared to the sales figures the previous year, sources said. The New Year's eve sale was on par with the per day weekend sale that ranges between 145 crore and 150 crore.  "Restrictions for vehicular movements on December 31 as part of the Covid protocol is one of reasons for reduction in sale. Sale of beer which is usually in high demand registered a significant drop during the New Year's Eve," a Tasmac official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/at-147-7cr-dec-31-liquor-sale-dips-by-12cr/articleshow/88640761.cms||---

Braving waterlogged streets due to the recent high-intensity rain, devotees thronged the temples on Saturday. The city police deployed around 600 personnel for crowd management there. Additional personnel were deployed at Mylapore Kapaleeshwarar temple and Shri Parthasarathi temple at Triplicane to control crowd of devotees. Footfalls at the temples were less in the morning. Several devotees chose to visit the temples in the evening. In the Parthasarathi temple at Triplicane, around 50 police personnel were deployed in and outside to regulate the devotees. Police installed wooden barricades to regulate the people in queues to enter the temple. Police and Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) board officials carried out thermal scanning and provided sanitisers to the devotees at the entrances of the temples in Mylapore and Triplican. The Mylapore district commissioner of police Disha Mittal said, “We are providing face masks to those visiting temples without wearing one. We have also installed temporary CCTV cameras and given instructions to the visitors through the public addressing systems.” “As the state government has not issued any restrictions for those visiting religious places, people are happy and the chief minister is happy too,” HR&CE minister PK Sekar Babu told TOI. The minister visited a temple at Thiru Kuvazhai in Thiruvarur district to inquire about the Maragatha Lingam idol which was recovered a few days ago from a bank locker in Thanjavur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/footfalls-at-temples-down-by-half/articleshow/88640763.cms||---

India Meteorological Department has forecast light to moderate rainfall in the city and the suburbs. Private forecasters and bloggers said there will be a significant drop in rain activities by January 3 as the city will head for a dry spell. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast thunderstorms with light to moderate rain to occur over some areas of the city and the suburbs with the skies remaining partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures may hover at 30°C and 23°C. “There may be on and off moderate spells till Sunday. By Monday, we can expect rain to reduce significantly or almost stop,” an official said. Like Friday, Saturday too saw some sharp spells over some different of the city.

Vehicles crawled on Raja Mannar Salai, P T Rajan Salai and Ramasamy Salai in K K Nagar. Mahalingapuram’s 40-Feet Scheme Road, North Usman Road, G N Chetty Road, Kodambakkam’s Aziz Nagar, continued to face water stagnation. In many areas such as L B road in Thiruvanmiyur and T Nagar, sewage overflow and stagnation were a health hazard. Encroachments on some streets by shops and vendors were preventing rainwater from flowing into the storm water drains. N Vishwanathan, a resident of K K Nagar, told TOI that on Kamarajar Salai about three shops had placed bricks and sand on the road blocking all inlets of the drains. “How will the water enter the drains if shops block them. On Ramasamy Salai, a temple has blocked the drain,” he said.  He had raised many complaints with the GCC but there was no action. “Such encroachments hinder desilting activities as well as in the case of MGR market where several shops constructed on the drains have rendered them useless,” he said. Greater Chennai Corporation officials said they were removing encroachments, but most cases were stuck in litigation. “We are removing the encroachments that we can. However, we will proceed legally,” said an official. Regarding sewage stagnation, the residents have raised complaints with Metrowater and the civic body. Mahesh R, a resident of Thiruvanmiyur, told TOI that the stench from the sewage on the road was unbearable. In T Nagar, as rainwater slowly receded by evening, sewage stagnation was a major issue. Civic officials said they have been working with Metrowater and have passed on the complaints to them. “We have have appointed at least four officials for every zone to monitor flood control work. If it doesn’t rain tomorrow, all streets will be free of inundation,” said an official. The civic body continued to use pumps at 270 locations. “We will station the pumps for a week and are hopeful that rainfall will reduce,” said an official. At least15 trees have fallen in the past two days and two subways continued to be under water. The civic body has sheltered about 167 people including 28 children and 200 packets of food were distributed. Of the 2,500 complaints of water logging received in the past two days, about 600 have been cleared.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/encroachments-add-to-prolonged-flooding/articleshow/88640769.cms||---

We have, however, noted that the IMD is unable to predict red alert situations sufficiently in advance,” Stalin said in a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, a copy of which was made available to media. Incidentally, Union minister of science and technology Jitendra Singh had recently written to Madurai MP Su Venkatesan that the quality of weather forecasting in Tamil Nadu was not compromised.The bulletin from the IMD on Thursday noon predicted thunderstorm with moderate rainfall at a few places over coastal Tamil Nadu and thunderstorm with moderate rain in Villupuram, Cuddalore and delta districts, while predicting thunderstorm with light to moderate rain over some areas of Chennai.The IMD issued a nowcast-warning at 3.40pm, stating that thunderstorm with light to moderate rain would occur in isolated places over a few districts including Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpet for one or two hours. But heavy downpour soaked Chennai for hours, starting on Thursday afternoon and continuing till late in the night.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/stalin-bats-for-met-revamp-to-fight-disasters/articleshow/88640774.cms||---
---||Chennai||Centre gives Rs 3,000 crore NDRF fund to 6 states, Tamil Nadu ignored||CHENNAI: Even as the Centre approved on Thursday additional assistance of over 3,000 crore under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to six states that were affected by floods, landslides and cyclones last year, Tamil Nadu has been left out despite chief minister M K Stalin sending several memoranda seeking assistance of 6,230 crore towards relief and restoration in the aftermath of the devastating floods in several parts of the state. An all-party delegation, predominantly comprising MPs from the DMK and its allies, besides the main opposition AIADMK and led by DMK parliamentary party leader T R Baalu could not meet President Ram Nath Kovind or Union home minister Amit Shah last week. The objective of the delegation was to seek directions to governor R N Ravi to forward The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021 (popularly known as NEET Bill seeking exemption for Tamil Nadu) to President to grant assent to the Bill. Instead, the delegation submitted the representation to the President's secretariat, which forwarded it to Amit Shah’s office for action. The NEET Bill was passed unanimously in the assembly in September. The delegation was expected to meet Amit Shah the following day, but the meeting did not happen. Even Baalu’s messages to the minister via WhatsApp and SMS seeking time went unanswered until Thursday. “As I now learn that you are busy with meetings in Uttar Pradesh, it may be futile to wait further. Since the matter we need to discuss is of public importance, we request your good self to provide an appointment probably on January 3 or 4,” Baalu said in his latest letter to Amit Shah. The DMK camp said that there was no legal impediment or any bar on states enacting laws which conflict with the Central laws. They cite the bill enacted to grant exemption for jallikattu as an example. DMK leaders say the treatment of the Union government was on expected lines given their strained relations with the BJP. “The six states (Assam, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal) for which NDRF funds have been approved are either ruled by the BJP or where it is the main opposition. The BJP may have reservations that the DMK, which is under financial stress, would garner huge public support by distributing the Central relief as Pongal cash to the PDS cardholders ahead of the urban local body polls,” said a senior DMK leader. Baalu told reporters in Delhi that Amit Shah was an effective administrator and not a political novice and expressed hope of getting an appointment soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/centre-gives-3000cr-ndrf-fund-to-6-states-tn-ignored/articleshow/88640775.cms||Julie Mariappan

He said the state would have received adequate funds had the DMK MPs visited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah during the winter session of the Parliament to exert pressure. He alleged that the chief minister’s announcement in November about agricultural input subsidy of 6,038 per hectare for damaged samba crop and compensation of 20,000 per hectare for fully damaged paddy crop remained a mere announcement. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ops-asks-cm-to-disburse-flood-relief/articleshow/88640777.cms||---

The report revealed that the boys in the home were forced to work in cowsheds and attend to the inmates of the home for the elderly run by the same management in the vicinity. The report has also highlighted the inaction of the authorities on the complaint submitted by former member of district child welfare committee Glory Annie regarding the issue. Following this, district child protection officer M Mathiazhagan conducted an inquiry in New Life Charitable Trust in Eraiyur and shifted three boys from the home to another government-approved facility. He issued a show-cause notice to the management of the home, seeking an explanation. However, the explanation was not satisfactory as they stated that boys had gone to work without their knowledge. “After getting the consent from the district collector, we have sent a report to the director of social defence recommending to withdraw the license for the home,” Mathiazhagan told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/childrens-home-uses-inmates-as-labourers-licence-to-be-revoked/articleshow/88640778.cms||---

The accident happened during the early hours of February 20, 2018. The truck was heading from Vandalur to Madhavaram. When the truck was nearing the tollgate, the driver lost control and the vehicle rammed the two counters, dragging tollgate employees along for several metres before coming to a stop. Two contract staff- Nilamadhab Sahu and Rakeshkumar Dakua from Ganjam district, Odisha, who were manning one of the counters were killed in the accident. The families of the victims moved the tribunal seeking compensation pointing out that the accident took place due to the negligence of the driver and the families were dependent on the income of the deceased. After perusing all documents, special sub judge -II, B Thangamani Ganesh held that the insurer of the truck is liable to pay compensation and after computing various factors.

The stretch is considered challenging due to its rocky soil condition. The first tender floated for the stretch in January 2021 was one among six construction tenders cancelled as they either did not find many takers or quoted more than the actual estimate. The 118.9km phase-2 is expected to be ready by 2025.According to officials, the 5.8km line from Kolathur to Nathamuni is the only underground stretch on corridor 5 from Madhavaram to Sholinganallur. CMRL has invited bids to construct the underground line with twin tunnels for the upline and downline and link it with five underground stations at Kolathur junction, Srinivasa Nagar, Villivakkam suburban station, Villivakkam bus-terminus and Nathamuni. Deadline for completion of the line is 3.8 years.During the initial soil investigation, CMRL identified the line from Kolathur to Nathamuni as one of the two toughest stretches in phase-2 due to its soil conditions. The soil type is primarily hard rock like black granite or a mix of quartz or charnockite. The rock soil condition could pose an engineering challenge as the tunnel boring machines will have to be operated at an appropriate speed — even as slow as below 8m a day — to keep the vibrations while drilling to a minimum because it may otherwise affect nearby buildings. Tunnels on this stretch are going to be built at a depth of 15m to 21m.In January 2021, only one firm bid for the construction of this stretch when CMRL floated tender for the line for the first time. Officials said the bidder also quoted more than CMRL’s estimate. Hence the bid had to be cancelled. “The bidder’s quote was nearly 60% more than our estimate. So, we had to cancel the tender,” an official said. Meanwhile, towards the end of December a first test pile (foundation pillars for elevated corridor) was bored on the 11.6km Puzhuthivakkam-Sholinganallur stretch on corridor-5 from Madhavaram to Sholinganallur. The stretch will have 11 elevated stations. The stretch connects localities like Madipakkam, Kovilambakkam, Medavakkam and Perumbakkam that are otherwise poorly linked by public transport. CMRL officials said this stretch will be part of the elevated corridor which they are expecting to be ready by 2025. Construction of an elevated line started on the Porur-Poonamallee stretch last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cmrl-floats-tender-again-for-tough-5-8km-undergound-stretch/articleshow/88640783.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Emaar scam accused moves HC, seeks halt to ED framing charges||HYDERABAD: An accused in the Emaar scam case, Tummala Ranga Rao, who later turned an approver, has approached the high court questioning the action of the ED. Though the CBI made Ranga Rao an accused in the Emaar case and also arrayed his firm, Stylish Homes, as the accused entity, he had turned an approver for the CBI. He deposed before the CBI and also before a magistrate under section 164 of CrPC and narrated all that he knew about the sale of villas, money transactions, etc. Later, the trial court deleted his name and also his firm’s name from the list of accused. Now, the ED has made Ranga Rao an accused in the case. He filed a petition challenging the action of the ED and contended that the CBI case was the basis for the ED case. The high court may hear the matter next week. “When the CBI itself has removed the case against me, the ED cannot continue the same,” he said. “After I turned as an approver, the CBI has made me its witness. I am no more an accused. It would be ok if the ED also makes me a witness. But it made me an accused without any basis,” Ranga Rao said. The CBI court, which is also hearing the ED cases, has already granted Ranga Rao a pardon. “A tender of pardon would discharge me of all existing charges,” he added. Urging the court to stop the proceedings before the ED court which is all set to frame charges against him and his firm in the chargesheet filed by the ED against them, Ranga Rao filed the plea before the high court. “It has already passed a cognisance order against me and my firm which is not in tune with the law,” he said urging the court to stay the process before the trial court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/emaar-scam-accused-moves-hc-seeks-halt-to-ed-framing-charges/articleshow/88640786.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

As compared to 75 donors in 2020, there was 162 donors in 2021, accounting for 616 organs donated. In fact, in the last two months of the year, maximum donations were made. Last year also saw the maximum lung donations — 83. The second highest number of lung donations were recorded during the pandemic year 2020 when there were 20 donations made. In previous years, lung donations ranged between zero and nine only. Meanwhile, the total number of registered recipients currently awaiting organs is 7,523, which is much higher than donations. Officials are hoping to increase number of donations further. In 2013, when the Jeevandan cadaver transplantation programme was launched, there were 41 organ donations. Donations rose in 2018 to 160 and took a hit in 2020 due to the pandemic. However, after the first wave, improvement in ritical care set-up in government hospitals fuelled better opportunity for organ donations. Speaking about improved infrastructure, Dr G Swarnalatha, in-charge Jeevandan programme, said, “The drastic improvement in the critical care infrastructure across the state, especially in remote districts allowed us to harvest more organs. Previously, it was difficult to get organs in remote areas where the ICU and ventilator facilities were not there. It made it impossible to keep critical patients, and hence such patients were taken to bigger centres mostly in Hyderabad.” Swarnalatha said, “We regularly conducted donorcondolence programmes, awareness programmes, CME programmes, held donor pledge stalls, donor felicitation programmes to improve donations.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/after-infra-boost-2021-saw-max-organ-donations/articleshow/88640800.cms||Amrita Didyala

Be it the Birla Mandir, Peddamma Gudi or the Chilkur Balaji, majority of these places of worship had long queues outside the premises right from the early hours of the day. Many also had police personnel posted around them to manage the crowds that started to swell as the day progressed. “I wanted to start the New Year by offering prayers to Lord Venkateshwara Swamy and seeking his blessings,” said A Srinivas, a resident of Secunderabad, who visited the Birla Mandir. He said that it took him almost two hours for darshan as there was a heavy rush at the temple. Another denizen V Prakash said: “It’s been a tradition for us to visit Peddamma Gudi on the first day of the New Year. Even this year, all our family members visited the temple and took the blessings of the goddess.” While people who visited temples early in the morning did not take much time to complete the darshan as long queues started only at around 9am, others who visited the temples a little late were seen patiently waiting in long queues for the darshan of deities. “We went to Yadgirigutta on Friday night to have early darshan and return to the city by afternoon. As planned we managed to return by1 pm,” said K Sainath, a resident of Uppal. Even temples located inside colonies witnessed a slew of devotees visiting the temple. C S Rangarajan, head priest of the Chilkur Balaji temple, said that about a lakh devotees visited the temple on Saturday. “ During the pandemic, we allowed devotees to do pradarshanas outside the temple, but we had to even stop that today as there was a heavy rush,” said Rangarajan adding that no physical distancing could be followed at the temple today. He said that about 70% to 80% of devotees wore masks and followed all Covid-19 norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/temples-witness-rush-of-devotees-on-day-1-of-2022/articleshow/88640803.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Jagga Reddy demands action against A Revanth Reddy for Shashi Tharoor remarks||HYDERABAD: Infighting in Telangana Congress refuses to die with working president and party MLA T Jagga Reddy firing a fresh salvo at state party president A Revanth Reddy by demanding that the disciplinary action committee first take action against Revanth for using unparliamentary language against senior MP Shashi Tharoor. Jagga Reddy even sent the video clip of Revanth calling Shashi Tharoor by names and demanded that the state DAC first serve a show-cause notice on Revanth before seeking an explanation from him for his letter to AICC president Sonia Gandhi being leaked to the media in which he sought removal of Revanth from the TPCC chief’s post. The much-awaited political affairs committee meeting headed by AICC in-charge of Telangana Manickam Tagore to be held on January 5 is likely to witness fireworks between the senior leaders. Some of the senior leaders are unhappy with Revanth’s style of functioning alleging that the party president neither consults them nor informs them about any agitational programme being organised in their home town or district. Leaders close to Revanth said that there was no intentional strategy on the part of the TPCC chief to ignore anyone. Sooner or later, someone in the party would be given the responsibility of coordinating with every one about the programmes being planned by Revanth. Though the DAC has issued a veiled warning to the party leaders not to go to media about internal differences within the party, a stringent action is unlikely to be taken by it against working president and party MLA Jagga Reddy and other leaders till January-end. The committee is planning to go slow on complaints of indiscipline until the Congress digital membership drive comes to an end. While the AICC has fixed March 31 as the last date, Revanth has set a target of enrolling 30 lakh members before January 26. The party leadership fears that any serious action against senior leaders may have an impact on membership enrolment drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/jagga-demands-action-against-revanth-for-tharoor-remarks/articleshow/88640809.cms||Roushan Ali

All India Congress Committee general secretary and spokesperson Mohan Prakash along with TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy, AICC secretary G Chinna Reddy and other leaders on Saturday said the Modi government became synonymous with inflation. Even booking auto rides online would cost more, cement and steel prices were rising, prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed, hitting the middle class and poorer sections of society, he said. The AICC leader from Rajasthan sought to ask the people, have they ever thought about what the Modi government was giving them on New Year Day for their happiness and prosperity? “What is Modi and his government wishing for us? Like for the last seven years, this year too, the gift given to the people of the country by the Modi government is — Gift of Mehangai — Price Rise and Inflation,” he said. Stating that on the first day of 2022, the Modi government gave a New Year gift to all the countrymen in the form of Inflation 2022, he said this new inflation was coupled with a consistently high unemployment rate of above 7.5% during the most part of 2021. “Should we thank PM Modi for this?” he asked. The Modi government’s decision to withdraw its proposed hike on textiles and handlooms was only with an eye on the ensuing elections to five state assemblies. “There is every possibility that the BJP government will bring back its proposal to hike GST on textiles and handlooms once the elections are over,” Mohan Prakash alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/modi-govt-synonymous-with-inflation-says-cong/articleshow/88640810.cms||Roushan Ali

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who visited the village in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district on June 22 this year, later adopted it to ensure its all-round development. The village is just 56 km away from Hyderabad. Village sarpanch Pogula Anjaiah told TOI that while some individuals have chosen what they would like to do with the amount sanctioned for them, the all-round development of the village was of paramount importance to them. Various departments have even prepared estimates. “According to rough estimates, Rs 100 crore to Rs 120 crore will be needed for all the works that have been planned for the village. We are hopeful that these works will begin soon,” he said. For the Dalit Bandhu scheme, 75 families were selected as beneficiaries. As many as 12 families chose to buy buffaloes to set up dairy units, 13 families set up poultry farms, seven families got into providing centring for construction work, seven brought tractors, two bought bulldozers and seven families bought sheep. Others are also in the process of grounding their own chosen units. According to the district authorities, 12 women beneficiaries bought 28 buffaloes with assistance provide by the SC Corporation. They went to Kankipadu village in Krishna district and bought the buffaloes. The officials did a health check-up for the buffaloes at the time of purchasing and also after they were brought to Vasalamarri. “While individual beneficiaries have got what they wanted, we are now looking forward to the overall development of the village. There are 450 families which need new double bedroom houses which are being planned to be constructed in the village,” the sarpanch said. In addition, plans have been made for laying of concrete roads, fencing of the forest area as the village has a problem of wild boars straying into the agricultural fields, a health centre and a new building for the zilla parishad high school. A survey has also been undertaken wherein the villages mentioned what type of training they would require for their own employment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dalit-bandhu-funds-put-to-use-for-variety-of-units/articleshow/88640811.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

There will be year-long agitational programmes in 2022, activating the party cadre and leaders from the grassroots in rural and urban areas with an eye on 2023 assembly polls followed by 2024 Parliament elections. With the BJP and YSRTP too planning a series of programmes against the ruling TRS, the year 2022 is expected to generate much political heat. The Congress leadership has also decided to revive its “students and unemployed jung siren” against the failure of BJP government to give two crore jobs every year and TRS government dragging its feet on filling up 1.91 lakh vacancies in the government sector. Top Congress leaders, members of Youth Congress and National Students Union of India will visit colleges and university campuses seeking the support of students and unemployed youth to hold seminars and public meetings demanding filling up of vacancies in government sector, start giving Rs 3,016 unemployment allowance and reimbursement of fees among other demands.  Congress is also planning a huge public meeting in the city by mobilising students from Osmania, Kakatiya and other universities. Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy had launched the jung siren on October 2 and a huge public meeting was also held at Mahbubnagar. A rally as part of jung siren from Dilsukhnagar to the statue of Telangana martyr Srikantha Chary was foiled by the police. Though the jung siren was supposed to continue up to December 9, it was stopped mid-way to hold agitations and dharnas on other important issues demanding withdrawal of three farm laws, protests against rising prices of gas, diesel and petrol on the directions of the All India Congress Committee. Telangana Congress spokesperson B Ayodhya Reddy confirmed to TOI that party will launch agitational programmes throughout the state in 2022. Assembly constituency-wise local issues would be identified, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cong-to-go-big-with-protests-in-every-assembly-seat/articleshow/88640812.cms||Roushan Ali

However, there is a hitch: they have no slates. Last year, womenfolk of Suddala village in Konaraopet mandal had decided that they would turn themselves literate. They are part of more than 20 self-help groups. Those who are educated in the group had volunteered to spare their time teaching the others – beginning with Telugu language alphabets to taking them to helping them read. In addition to the problems that Covid-19 brought with it, the question was also about getting slates. “Some women volunteered to buy their own slates but most wanted slates to be bought for them. The decision got put off as we wanted that all of them should have quality slates as it would be a 100-day programme for them to learn in what would be a classroom atmosphere,” said Prakruti Prakash, who has inspired the women to take up learning. As part of Telangana cultural team, he spoke to all SHGs and convinced women who had no schooling to at least learn how to read and write. Learning programme did not take off last year due to pandemic.  Prakash sorted out matters pertaining to slates and assured them he would take try to organise slates. “In addition to the slates, they also need white boards and pens. If these can be arranged for the women, they can take their interest forward to become literates,” Prakash said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/500-illiterate-women-to-start-with-clean-slate/articleshow/88640813.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The woman had lodged a plaint at Narayanguda police station against a 58-year-old executive director and in-charge MD of a state-run corporation. She approached the high court after Narayanguda police refused to register a case on July 31, 2018 and after failing to get a favourable verdict from Telangana State SC & ST Commission and the internal department. However, Narayanguda police informed the high court that on the direction of the SC/ST commission, the Nalgonda SP conducted an inquiry in 2017 and submitted a report to the secretary of the commission on November 7, 2017. The complaint was closed based on the findings of the report. “This court is of the opinion that no further orders are necessary to be passed in this writ petition. The writ petition is disposed of giving liberty to the petitioner to lodge a fresh complaint by following the procedure under Section 154 of CrPC. On receipt of such complaint, the police shall conduct preliminary enquiry and proceed further in the matter by following the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in Lalitha Kumari vs Government of UP,” the high court said in its verdict. Following this, the woman lodged a fresh complaint with Narayanguda police on the charge of outraging modesty and a case was booked under the violation of SC&ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. When contacted, the suspect said that he was given a clean chit in the last two investigations and called the complaint ‘motivated’. “An internal committee of women and a DSP rank officer who had earlier conducted a probe on the instructions of the SC/ST commission found that the allegations of sexual harassment made against me were incorrect. Some retired employee with vested interests has been using the complainant and filing cases against me,” the executive director claimed. Meanwhile, the complainant said that she wants justice.

One among the petitioners did his SSC and Intermediate through regular mode but did his BA degree through external or distance mode from Osmania University in 1999. He wrote Telangana Lawcet in 2019 and was qualified. But the OU authorities denied him a seat in any of the law colleges in the state because his BA external mode degree is not acceptable to them. The aggrieved student approached the high court. A single judge issued an interim order directing the authorities to provide admission to the student. Following an appeal against the single judge order, the case has come up before a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji. The bench dismissed the plea of the petitioner and a few other similar pleas on the ground that Bar Council Rules do not approve distance mode degrees. However, the candidate completed his law degree in the meantime as the authorities provided him a seat in a law college in tune with the order of the single judge.

On Saturday, KTR and Kishan Reddy attended inauguration of a six-lane two-way flyover at Shaikpet. Speaking on the occasion, KTR said, “The state government is making an effort to reduce traffic congestion in GHMC area by building flyovers and link roads. Eight National Highways (NHs), which connect the city, are also being widened. Works on a skyway at Uppal, connecting NH, are prgressing at a brisk pace.” “In the last six years, several representations were given to four defence ministers, including Rajnath Singh, stating that the state is ready to build two skyways (Patny-Kompally and JBS-Turkapally), but unfortunately inordinate delays are occurring as MoD could not hand over defence land to us,” he added. In Lucknow (UP) and other areas, MoD has parted with defence land, but in Hyderabad’s case, there was no response. “I urge Kishan Reddy to pursue the issue with MoD,” he said. KTR, who recently tweeted about reopening 21 cantonment roads, said, “As raksha mantri Rajnath Singh is your colleague, please ensure MoD issues the necessary instructions to LMA, Secunderabad, to reopen all closed roads.” A new flyover has been proposed at Rasoolpura junction. “For this, we require a portion of home ministry land. Kishan Reddy must ensure that MHA allots the land to the state,” the minister said. Later, Kishan Reddy said the central government was committed to the development of Hyderabad and would extend cooperation to the state. Reddy also said that recently he had represented to chief minister K Chadrasekhar Rao to set up Science City for the benefit of students and entrepreneurs. “The Centre is ready to fund it,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/help-reopen-cantt-roads-ktr-to-kishan/articleshow/88640820.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: 10-fold rise in Bengal cases in 6 days, govt weighs strict curbs||KOLKATA: Bengal’s daily Covid count zoomed to 4,512 on the first day of the New Year, prompting the state top brass to actively consider stricter restrictions from next week to combat the spread of the virus. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has convened a Covid review meeting on Monday, following which the curbs are likely to be announced. In a hint that strict measures are to follow, the Bengal government has cancelled a programme at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday in which the CM was scheduled to distribute student credit cards. It has also suspended the popular Duare Sarkar camps to prevent crowding. Besides, local authorities have been empowered to declare containment zones. Senior bureaucrats said bringing back the restrictions have become imperative to rein in the runaway Covid numbers. The daily case count in Bengal has jumped 10 times in the past six days — from 439 on Monday to 4,512 on Saturday — with Kolkata accounting for 50% of the state’s caseload. The city on Saturday recorded 2,398 Covid infections, its highest since May 26. On Monday, it had recorded just 204 cases. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has already announced 11 containment zones in the city and several more micro-containment zones are likely to be declared in the next few days. On Saturday, top civic officials and police officers met to chalk out the modalities for reintroducing and maintaining containment zones. Among the curbs that may be reimposed are shutting down schools and colleges, reducing operational hours for restaurant and malls, 50% office attendance, curtailing local train and metro services and extending night-restriction hours, sources said. The 11pm to 5am restriction on movement, that was lifted for nine days, will be back from Sunday. 'Most parents will be unwilling to send kids'Heads of several schools and colleges said they are expecting a shutdown to be announced on Monday. "Most parents will be unwilling to send their children to school under the current circumstances. We are refocusing on online classes till the situation improves," principal of a city school said. Government and private offices, too, are expecting a return to 50% manpower in the workplace with the rest working from home. The Calcutta High Court on Saturday announced a shift to virtual hearings. Only the public prosecutor may appear in court in matters related to bail petitions to produce documents. Officials who are weighing reduction in transport services, including local trains and Metro, acknowledged it would have to be a calibrated move so that there is no overcrowding in services that remain. The state has announced a temporary ban on flights from the UK to stop the spread of the Omicron variant. The last AI flight of the London-Kolkata leg will operate on Sunday. The CM, however, has indicated that there cannot be blanket restrictions because it can cripple the economy. Various fairs that are scheduled in January could also be cancelled, the sources said. The fate of Kolkata Book Fair that is scheduled from December 31 to February 13 also hangs in the balance. The State Election Commission that has notified civic elections in four corporations, including Bidhannagar, is expected to announce a stricter Covid protocol during campaigns. Sources said large gatherings will be restricted and candidates will be encouraged to do door-to-door campaign with fewer number of people than usual.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/10-fold-rise-in-bengal-cases-in-6-days-govt-weighs-strict-curbs/articleshow/88640823.cms||---

Cops said compliance dipped as the night progressed on New Year’s Eve. While 464 people were prosecuted till 8pm on Friday, 743 were prosecuted after 8pm. Among the violators were several selfie-obsessed youths who refused to wear mask because it would hide their expression with the lit-up Park Street in the backdrop. Police also arrested 537 persons for creating nuisance and not adhering to Covid protocol. Police commissioner Vineet Goyal had on Friday asked his force to crack down on revellers if they refused to fall in line and abide by Covid SOPs. Checks were also conducted across 50 traffic nakas post 10pm on New Year’s Eve that led to a record 160 prosecutions for drink driving. The checks continued till 5am with total prosecutions for various offences including rash driving, triple riding and riding without helmet at 1,223. New party zones and the cheaper pubbing hubs reported the highest number of drunk cases.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Safety rules at business hubs to check Covid spread||KOLKATA: Markets in the city’s central business district have started imposing restrictions on traders and customers to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent spike in cases and temporary closure. Several market committees in Burrabazar, Posta, Canning Street, Esplanade, Chandni and New Market held meetings with their members to discuss implementation of safety measures in the markets. Market authorities have insisted all to wear masks and avoid crowding in shops. Even cops from local police stations are instructing people on loudhailers. During the first and second waves, markets had to be shut down for days as several traders and their employees tested Covid positive. The Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations, an apex body of trade associations in Kolkata, on Friday issued an advisory for members to take all possible measures to protect lives and livelihoods. “We have seen what the pandemic has done during the first two waves. We lost so many of our traders. Others suffered huge losses due to lockdowns and restrictions. We don’t want that to be repeated. So, it is important to take guard against the virus and conduct business responsibly. We have already written to our members to implement all safety guidelines recommended by the government,” said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations. Markets like Bagree, Satyanarayan AC, Rajakatra, Posta, Nandaramand Chandni have already started sanitising their premises. “Ours is a very busy market and it is not possible to check every individual. But we are regularly sensitising the shop owners and customers,” said Jamuna lal Agarwal, member of the traders’ association in Nandaram Market. Cops have started patrolling the Burrabazar and Posta streets. “We are making regular announcements and even distributing masks. We will penalise if they don’t follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” said an officer of Burrabazar police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/safety-rules-at-biz-hub-to-check-covid-spread/articleshow/88640825.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Bidhannagar records more than 7-fold jump in fresh Covid cases in just 4 days||KOLKATA: The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area covering Salt Lake and a huge part of Rajarhat witnessed a massive single-day spike in fresh Covid cases, with 172 fresh cases being reported on Saturday, compared to 124 on Friday, 41 on Thursday and 23 on Wednesday. With this the active Covid cases reached 502. Civic officials said that the surge in fresh cases is expected to continue in the next few days as the trend is showing. The North 24 Parganas district administration is identifying new clusters across the district, including Salt Lake, New Town and Rajarhat where multiple fresh Covid cases are getting reported, to set up fresh containment zones, in an attempt to contain the surge. Active Covid cases in BMC area had come down drastically a few months ago when only 10 to 12 daily new cases were getting reported. The numbers increased only marginally after puja but daily new cases did not go beyond 20 to 22. With the sudden spike, total Covid cases in BMC area since March 2020 have now crossed 43,390 with 360 Covid deaths. The number of active cases is around 502. With BMC to go to the polls on January 22, civic officials are worried over the sudden surge in cases. “As the trend and prediction shows, numbers are expected to increase drastically in the next few days. A majority of people have let their guard down during the last few weeks in following the Covid safety protocols,” said a civic official. “The data is being gathered as to which cluster and specific localities are reporting most number of fresh Covid cases. Fresh containment zones will be announced in a day or two,” said a district official. Earlier, standalone houses in Salt Lake where multiple cases were getting reported, were being demarcated as micro containment zones.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bidhannagar-records-more-than-7-fold-jump-in-fresh-covid-cases-in-just-4-days/articleshow/88640826.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||21 addresses set to be Kolkata's first micro containment zones this phase||KOLKATA: With Covid infection spreading fast in several city wards, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the Kolkata Police are considering micro-containment zones in 21 addresses, up from the initial 11 suggested by the state health department. According to a KMC health department official, they were particularly worried over a spike in Covid cases in several neighbourhoods in central and northern parts of the city that fall under boroughs V and VI. “Our tele-callers are working round-the-clock talking to Covid positive patients in large areas of S N Banerjee Road, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Bowbazar, Taltala, Park Street and areas located around the civic headquarters. In fact, going by a plan by the KMC health brass in consultation with mayor Firhad Hakim, any spot which will be reporting more than five cases will be declared a micro-containment zone. The KMC headquarters that reported more than five cases in the recent past is also under watch. The numbers might also go up as we except the number evaluations to go on over the next two days. Once we get the total numbers, we will work out the final number of containment zones,” said a KMC health department officer. The KMC officials are also anxious about some areas of Bhowanipore, Alipore and Port areas which have been reporting more than five cases from housing complexes, high-rises or apartment buildings. According to police sources, the fresh set of containment zones is a mixture of colonies, complexes and stand-alone buildings. With most cases concentrated in five boroughs, some of the worst-hit pockets during the Covid first and second waves have again begun reporting high Covid numbers. These include pockets in Tollygunge, Ballygunge, Old Ballygunge, Alipore and New Alipore in the south, a section of Jadavpur in south suburban, a section of Taltala-Janbazar and Girish Park-Sovabazar in central Kolkata and Kankurgachhi in east suburban. Though both KMC and Kolkata Police refused to share figures right away, sources claimed Borough 9 with south and port areas is one of the worst hit. Boroughs 4,6, 8 and 12 are also witnessing high numbers. Boroughs 7 and 10 are also under watch, claimed KMC officials Sources said parts of Ballygunge and Kankurgachhi are back under KMC lens. “Earlier, when the area witnessed a surge in cases, we contained the numbers only when we could restrict the entry of outsiders here. There are busy stations here and once the local train movements get curtailed, it is bound to have an impact,” said an official. The police stated that they will not be putting up any barricades in front of the micro-containment zones. Instead, cops will mount surveillance that no one from these blocks step out without following any Covid safety protocol. In addition, cops will be providing any assistance, especially if the elderlies stay inside them. “We are now putting equal stress on both slums and apartments. Specific targeted testing for those having fever and sore throat is important and we are passing this information to building associations. Awareness drives are being carried out in complexes with more than 30 families and slums. We have requested KMC for regular sanitization of the area once specific addresses are brought under the list,” said a senior officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/21-addresses-set-to-be-citys-first-micro-c-zones-this-phase/articleshow/88640827.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Covid-19 vaccination: Kolkata schools ask parents for kids’ Aadhaar, other documents||KOLKATA: Several schools in the city have asked parents of students aged 15 to 18 to submit photocopies of Aadhaar and other documents to authorities so that they can register them for vaccination that begins on Monday. Students can also register with unique student ID cards issued by schools. Though the registration for administering Covaxin to children aged 15 to 18 opened on the Co-Win portal on Saturday, few utilized the window with many preferring to wait and see how the initial vaccinations pan out before registering their wards. The reaction was similar to the hesitation witnessed in March when vaccination for senior citizens and those with co-morbidity aged 45 and above had got off to a lukewarm start. Various private schools have sought consent from the parents to administer the vaccine to students in their schools. Some have already tied up with hospitals to set up immunization camps in the premises. Heritage School has asked parents to submit consent letters from the parents and tied-up with two private hospitals to organize vaccination camps at school premises. Modern High School and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy are in talks with private hospitals. Parents have to enrol for the vaccine and choose a slot. Most of the government and aided schools are collecting data for the vaccination drives that will start from January 3. KMC has decided to start with vaccination centres at 16 schools, one in each borough. Thereafter, the numbers will be ramped up. Shri Shikshayatan School is in talks with a private organization and KMC has asked it to submit the data of eligible students in the age group. Alipore Multipurpose Girls High School has given a list of eligible students to KMC. Bethune Collegiate School has given 548 eligible student’s list to the health officials. Town School Boys and Girls have been informed to start vaccination from Monday onwards. “We have been informed by the KMC officials that our school may be used as a centre,” said Town School headmistress Arpita Banerjee. The father of a Class-X student of Scottish Church Collegiate School, Supriyo Bhattacharya, said, “The school has asked us to submit Aadhaar documents and we have submitted it. We are waiting for date of vaccination to start.” Parent of Class X student Anindita Dutta said, “I have spoken to the nearest health centre and registered my daughter’s name.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kol-schools-ask-parents-for-kids-aadhaar-other-docus/articleshow/88640828.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Kolkata airport orders RAT kits in bulk to test international flyers||Kolkata: The Kolkata airport has placed a bulk order for Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits following the state government order to test every international passenger on arrival at the city airport from this Monday — January 3. Prior to this week, only RT-PCR and Rapid PCR testing was available at the airport, which is being conducted by Hindlabs — a government of India enterprise — but owing to the revised notification, the agency is buying bulk kits on regular basis to test around 550 odd passengers on a daily basis starting from Monday. According to the order, 90% of passengers need to undergo RAT and the rest to be tested with RT-PCR and those tested positive with RAT need to undergo RT-PCR again. “At present, there are around four international flights arriving at the airport regularly, which means that around 600 passengers would need to take the test daily. As per the order, around 540 of them would take the RAT and the rest would have to go for RT-PCR or Rapid PCR tests. We have made necessary arrangements and instructed the agency to keep test kits stock ready for 10 days,” said C Pattabhi, airport director. The authorities have fixed Rs 490 for the mandatory RAT tests, whose report will be available within 20-30 minutes. The cost of RT-PCR and Rapid PCR test at the airport is Rs 600 and Rs 2,900, respectively. The reports will be available within 6 hours and 45 minutes, respectively. “Samples will be collected from passengers before immigration. By the time they finish the immigration procedures, they are likely to get the report. Our focus is to expedite the process and ensure there is no crowding or unnecessary waiting period for the test reports,” said Pattabhi. To speed up the process further, the authorities are adding two extra sample collection booths in addition to the existing eight, which will attend to international flyers. “Additional manpower has also been sought to operate the booths to collect swab samples and conduct the test process,” an official said. The state government on December 30, had written to the civil aviation ministry to implement mandatory testing of all international passengers in wake of Omicron scare and an overall spurt in Covid cases in the state. “With effect from January 3, all passengers coming to West Bengal from other non-at-risk countries by international flights, will have to undergo a test on arrival at their cost. The airlines will randomly select 10% of the passengers for the RT-PCR test and the balance 90% shall undergo the RAT test. Those found positive in the Rapid Antigen Test will have to further undergo RT-PCR tests as may be required and instructed by the health authorities,” the letter stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/airport-orders-rat-kits-in-bulk-to-test-intl-flyers/articleshow/88640829.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The new guideline also included two new therapies/drugs — monoclonal antibody cocktail and Molnupiravir — for the asymptomatic but high risk patients and symptomatic patients with certain co-morbidities to prevent the disease from progressing towards severe infection. “Monoclonal antibody cocktail no doubt is very effective in preventing hospitalisation. We have used it on about 70 patients and found it more effective on the elderly with co-morbidities than younger patients with no co-morbidity,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI. Other doctors in the city, who have been using monoclonal antibody cocktail, also vouched for this cocktail therapy which is a mix of two drugs — casirimivab and imdevimab. The health department, too, had used about 300 vials of this on patients, including about 40 at state-run ID&BG Hospital, and found it effective. New protocol from the health department however has a rider mentioning the cocktail not much effective against Omicron. The guideline has specified distinct protocol for three categories of the infected — asymptomatic, symptomatic with certain co-morbidities and symptomatically infected patients with certain clinical conditions irrespective of co-morbid conditions. “We apprehend the number of patients needing treatment is going to shoot up. That is why the treatment and care protocol has been issued much in advance,” said a senior health official. In addition to medications, dosages and category of patients who should get these medicines, the protocol also prescribes how to categorise patients for each category, how to monitor them and mentions about red flag warnings, kind of oxygen therapy depending on certain markers, investigative tests and other therapies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/new-therapies-drugs-as-govt-changes-treatment-protocol/articleshow/88640830.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

His injuries were minor. But we have now decided to catch it,” said Sunderbans Tiger Reserve field director Tapas Das. Sixty forest staffers are involved in the operation. The tiger on Saturday moved from Chargheri village to a mangrove thicket on the banks of a river at 4 No. Mitra Bari in Glasskhali area. “We have identified where it is hiding and surrounded it with two layers of nylon net fencing. We have placed two trap cages with bait. Our teams are also ready to tranquillize it,” said deputy field director Justine Jones.“Also, we have deployed eight boats to find out whether it is taking the river route to reach the forest,” Jones added.

According to sources, Mario has already got his visa and he is expected to join the team in Goa after completing the mandatory quarantine upon reaching there, during which Renedy Singh will serve the side as the interim head coach.Mario’s latest return to the side bears a similarity to the way he took the reins last time. Having served the red-and-gold brigade as a deputy to Alejandro Menendez in the 2018-2019 season, Rivera was appointed as the head coach the following season when the former resigned following three consecutive defeats in the I-League. Although he managed to take the team to the second spot, Mohun Bagan emerged the runaway winners when the season was abruptly cut short because of the pandemic. Rivera was subsequently picked by the club officials as the head coach for the next season but the move didn’t materialize once investor Shree Cement took control of the club’s sporting rights in September in 2020 and facilitated the team’s debut in the ISLThis time, Rivera has a tougher job on hand as he is preparing to make his debut in the country’s newly promoted top league. SC East Bengal are lying at the bottom of the 11-team table with just 4 points, having failed to win any of their eight games so far. They will face former champions Bengaluru FC in their next match on Tuesday. According to ISL rules, a participating team must have a pro-license coach and an exception can be made only for an emergency and interim period. Renedy Singh doesn’t possess a pro-license coaching degree.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mario-returns-as-sceb-coach/articleshow/88640835.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Patients’ proximity makes docs vulnerable||Kolkata: Covid infections have started spreading in clusters among medical professionals, especially dental surgeons, ENT specialists and head and neck specialists, who are at a higher risk as they have to come in close physical proximity with patients. As a majority of these healthcare workers had received both their Covid vaccine doses eight to nine months ago, their waning immunity is becoming a matter of concern. Most of them are keenly looking forward to the rollout of the precautionary dose of vaccine on January 10.“A patient cannot wear a mask when we examine his or her oral cavity. Even if we put on a mask for protection, it still leaves us vulnerable to infection,” said Raju Biswas, state secretary of Indian Dental Association (IDA). The dental surgeon is among at least 25 people attached to R Ahmed Dental College who have tested positive to Covid together. The dental college at Moulali has an OPD footfall of close to 1,000 per day. Doctors said some patients might cough up during examination of the oral region, while the virus could travel from an infected patient to the doctors during a surgical procedure, including that of dental.The scene is not much different for the ENT department at IPGMER, which clocks an OPD footfall of about 900 people per day and also treats admitted patients. It, too, has had its share of cluster infections, with 12 post-graduate trainee doctors being detected with Covid during the past few weeks. “The virus is found in the nasopharyngeal area of patients. Our work involves examining this region from close proximity of a patient, who cannot put on a mask. That is why we are more prone to infection. It has been more than 10 months since my second dose was administered. I am eagerly looking forward to taking my third dose that should boost my antibody level,” said Arunabha Ghosh, ENT head at IPGMER.The professor of ENT was among the first doctors to be infected with Covid during the first wave and survived a severe bout. He had to be admitted to ICU.While the number of doctors currently affected is big, most are either asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, unlike those infected during the first and second waves. This mild infection, they said, was due to vaccine protection. “I got completely vaccinated in March. With the waning immunity, I have higher chances of infection. I would be taking the precautionary dose at the earliest,” said Medica Hospital head and neck surgeon Sourav Datta. He, too, had landed in the ICU after Covid infection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/patients-proximity-makes-docs-vulnerable/articleshow/88640836.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Rush to get hitched: Over 1.8 lakh marriages recorded in Bengal in 2021, highest in recent past||KOLKATA: More than 1.8 lakh weddings were solemnized in Bengal in 2021, recording highest number of marriages in a single year in the recent past. Sources said the number might be even higher as many couples apply for registration after a few weeks or even months of their social weddings. “The year 2021 was a pandemic year, which witnessed the deadly second wave that wreaked havoc on people’s lives and livelihoods for over four months. Despite that, more than 1.8 lakh marriages were registered with the government. The figure is the highest in a year in the recent past,” said an official at the registrar general of marriages. Most of the weddings in Bengal registered in 2021 took place in November and December, after the second wave receded, and a majority of them took place in Kolkata and South and North 24 Parganas. According to officials, several couples had planned to get hitched in 2020 but had to postpone their plans owing to various pandemic-related reasons, such as Covid infection in the family, restriction on the number of guests, travel curbs and financial distress. “Many couples, who had initially planned their weddings in 2020, postponed it and solemnized it in 2021,” said Bikash Dey, a marriage registrar in Kolkata. There were others who had brought their wedding dates forward, rushing to beat the third wave of Covid infections predicted by health experts. “Some couples told us that they were planning to get married in 2022. But they brought the dates forward, fearing a third wave, which was predicted by experts last year. Also, those working in other states and countries were in Kolkata as part of their offices’ work-from-home policy and they wanted to utilize the convenience of already being here,” said another marriage registrar. The newly weds said tying the knot in a pandemic year added a different dimension to their marriages. “Our wedding date was postponed twice due to the second wave and it will always be etched in our memory,” said Sucheta Ghosh, who finally got married in November last year. In fact, a record number of weddings took place in November and December last year, when Kolkata saw several hundreds of marriages on single days. The government had, by then, eased restrictions, allowing the hosts to invite more guests. If that was last year, even 2022 began with a similar trend. The office of the registrar general of marriages issued 173 marriage certificates on the very first day of the new year. “But with Covid cases spiralling up, we do not know whether the weddings will be postponed or not. There is an auspicious period in January for wedding,” said another marriage registrar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rush-to-get-hitched-over-1-8l-marriages-recorded-in-2021-highest-in-recent-past/articleshow/88640837.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Third wave scare: Kolkata's holidaymakers cancel plans||Kolkata: A tsunami of Omicron cases in Europe and the US and warnings that India, too, has begun the climb to a cliff-like third wave has flattened the travel curve. “Revenge travel is coming to an abrupt halt. Unlike the second wave when one had ample warning of where the situation was heading and travel had gradually tapered off, it has happened all too suddenly this time with bulk cancellations post December 25. International leisure travel has ceased. No one is travelling to Europe, even on business. We have even had to cancel a chartered flight to Phuket on January 6,” said Gainwell Travel & Leisure managing director Manoj Saraf. Holiday travel to Dubai, which had emerged as a popular holiday destination, has also ground to a halt. The only destination that has not witnessed much cancellation yet is Maldives. Raktim Ray of Dolphin Travels, who returned to Kolkata on Friday after conducting a 11-day Egypt tour with 20 travellers, is shell-shocked at the dramatic and abrupt change in scenario. “My Indian number was inaccessible during the trip. So I wasn’t aware that the situation had evolved so much. When I had left, travel plans were soaring with people wanting to book holidays and travel immediately and I put some of them off because flights weren’t available. And now ever since I have landed and switched on my phone, the only calls I am getting are for cancellation,” he said. Not just leisure travel, even people intending to travel abroad to visit friends and relatives are backing off fearing that they could get stranded if India suddenly seals the international borders or puts curbs on flights. Some are also wary of medical expenses should they contract Omicron abroad despite purchasing a fat medical insurance coverage prior to foreign travel. The real impact, says Manav Soni of Exclusive Travels, will be felt after mid-January when the student traffic ceases. “Unless we are able to rein in Covid numbers, there will be two to three months of pain for the entire travel industry,” he said. The sharp rise in Covid cases in India is also impacting domestic travel. Vijay Bhurani, a store owner in Metro Plaza, who was to travel to Kashmir with his wife and son, has cancelled the trip owing to the surge. “I have elderly parents at home. Safety comes first,” he reasoned. Abhijit Manna, owner of Panchet Residency, a popular resort in Garh Panchakot in Purulia, says inquiries for rooms during Saraswati Puja holidays as well as the January 23 to 26 break combining Netaji’s birth anniversary with Republic Day have dried up. “Generally we are flooded with queries for the January holiday period and even Holi during this time of the year. But there are no fresh enquiries this time,” he said. AR-ES Travels managing director Anil Punjabi says the mass cancellations, the third time owing to the pandemic, is pounding the already battered tourism industry. “We have to rise again like the phoenix. But there will be some with their backs broken who will be unable to revive,” he rued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/3rd-wave-scare-holidaymakers-cancel-plans/articleshow/88640838.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Non-Covid treatment stares at crunch as hospitals boost Covid infrastructure||KOLKATA: A sudden surge in Covid admissions has forced several private hospitals in Kolkata to ramp up their coronavirus-treatment units, but that may soon lead to a corresponding reduction in the number of non-Covid beds and surgeries. While some hospitals have already started adding Covid beds, some plan to expand their units next week. Yet others have started using monoclonal cocktail therapy to treat and release Covid patients in a day, reducing the occupancy period of beds. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has started restricting planned admissions and surgeries even as it gets ready to add 100 Covid beds to its existing 47 over the next seven days. It has started using monoclonal cocktail therapy to treat and discharge patients the same day. “So far, we had been carrying out a large number of surgeries but that will get reduced now, with more Covid beds. Simultaneously, we have started using the cocktail therapy on patients eligible for the treatment as it reduces bed occupancy. This has allowed us to keep treating non-Covid patients,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. All the 88 Covid beds at Belle Vue Clinic are now occupied and the hospital plans to add 97 more, taking the total count to 185 over the next few days. This would lead to an “automatic reduction” in non-Covid admissions and beds, said CEO P Tondon. “Our planned surgeries have got reduced by 20% and as we go on increasing Covid beds, other admissions will have to be curtailed, too,” he said. Belle Vue, too, is using the cocktail therapy to discharge patients within four-six hours. “We are using it on patients who qualify for it. It has helped us slow down the pace of conversion to Covid beds,” said Tondon. Peerless Hospital will add 50 beds to its 42-bed Covid ward next week. Once that fills up, the hospital plans to add another ward. “Thirty-eight of our 42 beds are now occupied. But fortunately, most patients are mildly affected and the stays have been short. Despite the sharp spurt in infection, we are yet to see a rush for beds like we had witnessed in the second wave. But we are ready for it,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. Peerless will not restrict non-Covid admissions now. “We are committed to our non-Covid patients and have several surgeries lined up on Monday. So, all admissions and surgeries will continue till a restriction turns inevitable. It may happen by next week and so, we are trying to strike a balance between Covid and non-Covid patients,” added Mitra. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) now has 47 beds for Covid, of which 34 are occupied. The positivity rate at RTIICS has gone up from 3% a few days ago to 22% on Saturday. “With the increasing numbers, we plan to increase the bed strength to 103, including 49 critical care beds, 49 ward beds and five isolation beds. This will be planned and executed by early next week, depending on the case load during this weekend,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Woodlands Hospital has just scaled up its Covid ward to 49 beds. It is set to introduce a satellite Covid care centre in a week which will have 30 beds more,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. She added the hospital has conducted 30 cocktail therapies in the last three days and 80% of the patients were released the same day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/non-covid-treatment-stares-at-crunch-as-hosps-boost-cov-infra/articleshow/88640841.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Kolkata woman recalls Vaishno Devi trauma||KOLKATA: Thousands of pilgrims walked up the hill to reach the sanctum sanctorum at Vaishno Devi in the early hours of Saturday, clueless about a stampede that reportedly killed 12 people. Salt Lake resident Barnali Saha was among those who went to offer prayers at Vaishno Devi shrine and had to stop barely 500 metres from the temple, minutes after the situation turned worse. “I have never been so scared in my life. There was none from the administration or police to look after the pilgrims. Thousands were still walking up the hill without any clue about what had just happened,” she recounted to TOI over phone. Saha took her nine-year-old son to a corner and wrapped her arms around him to protect him from any possible danger from the swelling crowd. This continued for some time before her family members managed to reach them and rescue them from the spot. Saha and her family, including husband Ajay and her son, left Srinagar and reached Katra on Saturday morning. They hired a horse and Saha and her son rode it up the hill. “The four other members of the team were walking up the hill. Horse owners had already started to ask for a premium and we had to agree to that for the one horse we took. There are two roads from Adhkuari leading to the Vaishno Devi shrine area. The road that is in a better condition, however, was kept closed for the pilgrims,” she said. Barely 500 metres from the shrine area, Saha stopped the horse when she saw a sea of pilgrims in front. It was around 2.30am. When she started asking about the reason, someone informed her that there had been a stampede a few minutes earlier and a few people had died. “We were told that chaos had started and it would not be safe to go up the hill. There were thousands in front of me and more pilgrims were coming up. Covid protocols had gone for a toss and there was utter mismanagement,” she said. “I desperately tried to look for anyone from the administration or police to seek help. My phone was not working and I could not even contact my family members. But there was nobody like that around. I got scared for my son, who could also figure out there was danger from the swelling crowd. If that crowd had got restive, there was no way we could have been saved,” Saha said. She managed to borrow a phone from a stranger and called up her husband. “I had decided not to advance any more. We went to a corner of the road and waited for our family. Each minute seemed like an hour,” she said. Saha’s family members finally managed to rescue the duo and they came down the hill to Katra. By late morning, the family headed back to Jammu by car.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-woman-recalls-vaishno-devi-trauma/articleshow/88640843.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||26-year-old protester crushed under truck during scuffle with drunk bikers||Kolkata: A New Year celebration ended in tragedy after a 26-year-old youth, who protested against reckless biking, was deliberately pushed by drunken bikers in front of a speeding truck and was run over in Baranagar in the early hours of Saturday. The victim, Mrinmoy Bose, was taken to the Baranagar State General Hospital where he was declared brought dead. The two accused bikers — Ravinder Singh and Sujay Das — were arrested on Saturday night. According to sources, the incident took place around 2.30am on Saturday when a group of members of Raja Ram Mohan Roy Smriti Sangha were celebrating New Year’s Eve on Bonhooghly Lakeview Road adjacent to BT Road. Two youths on a motobike recklessly rode into the area. “The bike was going at breakneck speed and was about to hit some club members celebrating the New Year’s Eve near the road-side club. The club members, including Bose, however, managed to stop the bike and Bose protested against their reckless riding. However, the biker and the pillion rider, both heavily drunk, argued with him and even got into a scuffle,” said Rupa Roy, a local woman. The locals said that during the altercation, the drunk bikers shoved Bose on to the road, just as a BT Road-bound truck sped through the area and ran over him. “The drunk bikers pushed him hard and Bose couldn’t even react to save himself. He came in front of the speeding truck all of a sudden and was run over. The bikers rode off and the truck driver fled the spot without his vehicle,” said Tapan Chatterjee, a club member. The locals damaged the truck, which was later seized by the Baranagar police. “A preliminary probe led us to suspect the youth suddenly came in front of the speeding vehicle during a scuffle and was run over. A case under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) has been registered,” said Ajoy Prasad, DCP, South Zone, Barrackpore Commissionerate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/26-year-old-protester-crushed-under-truck-during-scuffle-with-drunk-bikers/articleshow/88640844.cms||---
---||Kolkata||In oath-taking ceremony on 18th birthday, baton passes on to Rashid Khan’s son||Kolkata: It was New Year as well as a birthday celebration with a difference at Ustad Rashid Khan’s south Kolkata residence on Saturday. In the presence of Talat Aziz, Ustad Sabir Khan, Vidushi Shubhra Guha, Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar, Pt Tarun Bhattacharya, danseuse Sanchita Bhattacharya, vocalist Manasi Majumdar, vocalist Dibyendu Mukherjee and poet Srijato, Khan passed on his legacy to son Armaan — weeks ahead of the 18-year-old’s solo performance at the Dover Lane Music Conference. According to Khan, the elaborate ceremony had not even been organized for him. “It was done during my great-grandfather Inayat Hussain Khan’s life. He was the founder of our gharana (Rampur-Sahaswan). I am happy that apart from my musician friends, both Muslim and Hindu spiritual gurus attended the programme. Bairelly’s Mehdi Mian, Budaun’s Iman Abdul Rasul Qadri and the Mahantaji of the Sankatmochan temple came down to bless Armaan,” he said. The ritual started with Shahi Snan. Encircled by his father, mother Joyeeta, sisters Suha and Suhana, and others, Armaan sat in a big urn as well-wishers poured a mix of milk, water, turmeric, honey and sandalwood on him while qawal Danish Khan performed in the background. The Ganda Bandhan ceremony began later with Bairelly’s Mehdi Mian and Sankatmochan temple’s Mahanta tying strings on Armaan’s wrist. This was followed by Khan tying a thread and accepting Armaan as a permanent disciple. The guru and shishya then performed ‘Sudh Sarang’ bandish in teental and drut ektal. For many musicians, this ritual held a lot of significance. Dibyendu, who attended the ceremony with his wife, designer Chandrani Singh Flora, said, “It was a privilege to witness it for the first time in my musical career. Armaan is a versatile singer who can perform both classical and progressive music with equal ease. Besides, he is a fantastic guitar player.” “This is significant because very few these days actually know the rituals and the real meaning of this oath-taking ceremony. The significance of this tradition should never get lost in today’s cacophony,” Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar said. “Despite trying to carve out my identity, I am aware of the comparisons people make with my father. I am waiting for my solo performance at Dover Lane,” Armaan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-oath-taking-ceremony-on-18th-birthday-baton-passes-on-to-rashid-khans-son/articleshow/88640846.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

While the students have long recovered from Covid and were eager to sit for the tests, the sharp rise in Covid cases has put a question mark on whether schools will be able to conduct the exams on campus.CISCE issued a notice recently for the reassessment scheduled to start from January 10. Around 50 students who had missed the Term I exams are due to sit for them now. Most institutions said they were waiting for the state review team’s announcement on Covid safety measures on Monday before reaching out to the board. Some principals opine that since the number of students due to appear for the exams is very low, safety may not be a big challenge to conducting the reassessment. “There are multiple centres identified for the reassessment. Very few students will take the offline reassessment in each centre where Covid protocols will be maintained perfectly,” a convenor said.Three students were unwell during the Semester 1 exams at La Martiniere for Boys, two are Class X students and one Class XII student had missed only the physics exam. These three students will take the reassessment in January. “If the government put restrictions we can’t help it. At present we will go ahead as per plan. We are waiting for the government’s directives after which we will decide or the council will act accordingly,” said La Martiniere for Boys acting principal John Stephen.A Class XII student of Calcutta Boys’ School and many from other city schools who had missed the Semester I exams due to health reasons or participating in national/international sporting events were allowed for the reassessment. The increasing Covid graph has become a fresh headache for them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/uncertainty-over-cisce-term-i-reassessment/articleshow/88640847.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Guard killed in factory fire next to airport||Kolkata: A fire broke out at a factory — then spread to another — in Kaikhali, very close to the perimeter wall of Kolkata airport, on Saturday morning. A security guard trapped inside one of them was killed. Airport authorities had to keep spraying foam and water from the other side of the wall to stop the blaze from spreading. The incident was reported around 11am from a paint manufacturing unit in the Karkhana Gully locality. Twenty fire tenders, including three from the Kolkata airport, and three fire pumps managed to control the fire in three-and-a-half hours. However, firemen continued the cooling process till late on Saturday.The fire started near the gates and started burning barrels of chemicals stacked near the back door. Cops said there were three security guards in that area. While two of them were rescued by locals, the third — Kanai Chandra Santra (64) — couldn’t be brought out. His body was dug out from under debris around 5pm. “We could hear cries for help from inside the factory, but the drums of chemicals were bursting one after another and there was no way anyone could get inside,” said Raju Bhuinya, a local. Witnesses said some of the exploding barrels fell on the adjacent hosiery unit, setting it on fire as well. Flyers landing or taking off from the airport could see the flames, though flight movement was not hampered. The ATC and airport officials kept a close watch on the ascent of the fire, which, at one point, was progressing fast towards the airport’s perimeter wall.“Three of our tenders sprayed foam in the path of the fire to ensure the airport was saved. Our fire tenders helped dousing the blaze from the other end,” said a senior airport official.Fire officials said they struggled to go closer to the factories because of narrow lanes and said the factories had no fire-safety measures. Fire minister Sujit Bose said, “We will organize a fire audit at factories in this area and if anyone is found guilty of not following fire department stipulations, legal action will be initiated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/guard-killed-in-factory-fire-next-to-airport/articleshow/88640849.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Heartbreak & anguish as ex-candidates count panchayat poll losses||BHOPAL: Termination of panchayat elections, midway, has come as a bolt — both on the heart and pockets — of thousands of candidates who had not only filed nominations for the polls but had already been assigned their symbols. On December 26, the state government withdrew an ordinance regarding panchayat polls, and two days later, the state election commission (SEC) issued orders terminating the polls. The first phase of voting was only nine days away and the deadline for withdrawal of candidature for the first two phases had passed on December 23 — five days before the polls were terminated. “Who will compensate the loss we have suffered physical, mental as well as financial?” asked Ramlal Tawar, 45, a candidate in Ramgarh village panchayat in Rajgarh district. “I know several others who were in the fray for the first time and had spent large sums of money. How will they manage now?” Sources said that several candidates had spent lakhs to persuade opponents into withdrawing their candidature so that they could have an easy win. Many panchayats had a single candidate each, who was assured of uncontested victory after having done all they could to convince competitors to step aside. “This is absolutely wrong. Only we know what we have suffered. What was the need to announce the elections?” asked another candidate, Gangadhar Tawar, of Nesri panchayat in Rajgarh. A candidate for zilla panchayat member post from Berasia tehsil of Bhopal, Dayaram Mehar, said, “Preparing a single campaign CD costs Rs 10,000. Then there are pamphlets, posters, travel expenses. Each candidate spends at least Rs 50,000. Now, the posters, banners and leaflets are of no use. Majority of the candidates are village people. Both parties have caused them huge losses.” Some of the candidates even registered their protest before local officials but in vain. “If this (termination of polls) was to done and it was imminent, then it should have been done before the election symbols were given to candidates. Voting was on January 6. With only nine days to go, they terminated the election. We had published posters-banners and already hit the ground to campaign,” said Mahendra Goswami, whose wife was a candidate for zilla panchayat member from Bamhori of Raisen district. “There are 125 villages in my area. There was no chance we’d sit at home after getting the symbols. I had protested before SDM, tehsildar and other officials too. This is unjust,” he fumed. There are heartbreaks among preparing for the third phase. Nominations were yet to begin. Bhatauli village in Chanderi tehsil of Ashok Nagar district was in news earlier this month after reports that the villagers have decided their sarpanch candidate on the basis of the highest donation announced by prospective candidates for the village temple. It was said that Saubhagya Singh Yadav had turned out to be the highest donor, and potentially would win unopposed. The district administration says it investigated this claim and found it couldn’t be substantiated. “No one in the village gave statements in this regard. They only said that they had a meeting regarding the development of the village,” Ashok Nagar collector Uma Maheshwari said. When TOI contacted Saubhagya, he said: “Arey chhoro baat, na chunav lad raha, na kachhu. Chunav hoygene tab dekhenge. Apan nahi lad paa rahe hain chunav (Leave all these talk. Neither I am contesting elections, nor am I doing anything. Will see when elections are held).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/heartbreak-anguish-as-ex-candidates-count-panchayat-poll-losses/articleshow/88640862.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Protesting doctors launch non-cooperation strike||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the government not willing to hold talks with the agitating health service doctors even 25 days after the launch of their standing strike before the Secretariat, they launched an indefinite non-cooperation strike from Saturday. The Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) has also decided to go for a total strike on January 18 by taking mass casual leave. The doctors have been agitating demanding the rectification of the anomalies that occurred in the pay revision. The association had decided to intensify the agitation from January 1 as the government has not come forward for any talks with them. On January 18, all services in government hospitals in the state will be affected as all doctors will be staying away from work. On Saturday, the protesting doctors organised a medical check-up camp outside the secretariat. They set up a temporary camp on the roadside and provided free check-ups to the people, as a mark of protest. “We have decided to intensify the agitation since the government has turned a blind eye towards the strike before the secretariat for the last two weeks. The government has not even convened a discussion to settle our issues,” said Dr G S Vijayakrishnan, state president of KGMOA. When the revision in salary payment happened last time, we had to take a salary cut of Rs 8,000 and other allowances, which we were entitled to, were also removed from our salary. We want the restoration of the same, said KGMOA leader Dr Balachandran. We have been pointing out these anomalies for the last one year and the government has been giving assurances. But nothing concrete has happened till now, said Dr T N Suresh, secretary of KGMOA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/protesting-docs-launch-non-cooperation-strike/articleshow/88640887.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Governor has no right to suggest names for DLitt, says VD Satheesan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a departure from the point of debate raised by senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala in connection with Kerala University’s alleged refusal to confer honorary DLitt on President Ram Nath Kovind, opposition leader V D Satheesan here on Saturday said the governor tried to misuse his position if he had given any such directive to the university. “What authority does the governor hold to recommend the university to give honorary DLitt to someone? If the allegations are true, he breached all limits by doing so,” Satheesan told reporters. The governor was trying to hoodwink the public by offering to relinquish the chancellorship of universities in the state, Satheesan added. “The governor earlier told the high court that the appointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor was in order. Now, he has received notice from the high court division bench on the same issue. As per his current stand, he will have to file an affidavit saying that the appointment was not in order. Naturally, contradictory affidavits on the issue would bring him embarrassment. His offer to relinquish the chancellorship is his guile to get rid of this embarrassment,” he said. On Friday, a day after the governor made a loaded statement regarding the differences of opinion he had with the government, Chennithala hinted that it was Kerala University’s refusal to confer DLitt on the President is what the governor was suggesting when he said about many things that “sullied the grace of the country” owing to the government’s indifference. Among other things, Chennithala wanted the authorities to clarify whether the governor’s DLitt suggestion was rejected by the university authorities after government intervention. As the discord between Chennithala and Satheesan in the approach and emphasis of issues raised many eyebrows in the Congress camp, BJP seized the opportunity. BJP state president K Surendran, who accused the opposition of siding with the government in dishonouring the President, alleged hidden motives behind Satheesan’s reaction. “Opposition leader is speaking like a member of the state cabinet. It’s plain that Satheesan is the shield of Pinarayi Vijayan. People doubt whether Satheesan is paid from the AKG Centre,” he said. Meanwhile, a section of Congress insiders claim that the opposition leader purposefully deflected the attack in connection with the DLitt issue for fear of attracting criticisms for being soft on BJP-RSS forces. Many in the A and I groups consider it a deliberate attempt to show Chennithala his place, given the new power equations in the party. Sources in the university clarify that the governor had indeed suggested this to the university authorities. But, instead of placing the matter in the syndicate, the proposal was discussed with the government and was eventually turned down.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/guv-has-no-right-to-suggest-names-for-dlitt-satheesan/articleshow/88640888.cms||---

The flood deprived them of the raw materials, including bamboo. It was out of this situation that the bamboo products company Fibrent was born. This initiative is now helping these women to regain their livelihood. The raw materials will be provided by the company and the profit is also given to the women.The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has now provided an opportunity for them to exhibit and sell their products which were made by around 50 women. The exhibition is being held at Putharikandam ground. The expo aims at educating people about the harmful effects of plastic and introducing plastic alternative products.The plastic alternative products, including paper bags, cloth bags, paper pen, paper straw, terracotta products, plates and other kitchen utensils made with areca leaf are being exhibited here at the expo. The value-added products of plastics like plant pots are also for sale. The expo started on Friday and will end on January 2. There are a total of 43 stalls.At the expo the team ´Orma Eco-bricks´ is also featuring their innovative product that is a solution to manage the contamination of nature by the plastic waste. The team members said that eco bricks can be made by putting plastic bags and other plastic covers tightly inside the bottle. This can be used as a basement for constructions at home and public places. Through this waste materials can be converted into a valuable materia, they said.“When we asked the small retailers to switch to alternative products, they were not even aware of the products. So, we decided to introduce such products to them. We also aim at creating awareness about the dangers of plastic and to make value-added products from existing one-time use plastic materials,” said Biju B P, corporation health inspector.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/plastic-alternative-mela-tells-tales-of-survival/articleshow/88640889.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Detailed flood mitigation project set to begin soon||Thiruvananthapuram: The flood mitigation project involving various works in nine major water bodies in the city is set to begin soon with many projects being tendered. The project will be a joint initiative of the minor irrigation, major irrigation and inland navigation department.Chief engineer, irrigation and administration had furnished a proposal for the `flood mitigation works in Trivandrum city` at a cost of Rs 8.05 crores for which the government gave administrative sanction which will cover nine water bodies in the first week of December. The first phase will cover Pazhavangadi thodu, Ulloor thodu, Kariyil thodu, Karimadom pond, Thekkanakara canal, Killi river, Karamana river, Parvathy Puthanar and Thettiyar thodu at Rs 3.81 crores.In the second phase, Killi river, Karamana river, Pazhavangadi thodu will be covered at Rs 4.24 crores. Following the flooding in the city in 2021, the Irrigation department prepared an initial study report on flood mitigation. The team identified around 500 vulnerable points in the water bodies which required immediate attention. A data bank was created on these vulnerable points and is being reviewed. Additional Chief Secretary (water resources) had directed that each water body has to be assigned to an officer to identify the bottleneck points, including waste dumping spots, delta formation areas, and areas with shrubs and trees which block the smooth flow of water.The report noted that the most severe and frequent flooding in the city occurs at Thampanoor, East Fort area, Uppidamoodu and Kannammoola. The flooding in this area occurs three to six times during monsoon. The average water depth is 0.6 to 1.2m and persists for 2 to 24 hours in the central part and three to four days in the southern part of the city. The drainage network of the city consists of two major rivers namely Karamana and Killi, a few canals, their feeders and lakes, the project report notes. As per the report, timely and frequent cleaning to avoid delta formation inside the water bodies, identifying waste dumping areas for regular cleaning, steps to be taken by the Municipal Corporation to prevent further dumping of wastes into the water bodies, preventing growth of vegetation inside the water body, CCTVs , fencing and installation of notice boards along the vulnerable points in the water body were proposed as steps to be taken on a war footing.The phase 1 covering various water bodies is expected to be completed in three months. Emergency side protection works will be undertaken in phase 2. Karamana river covers the longest distance (21 km through the city). The project summary on Karamana river shows that the low bund height at various locations along the river causes flooding in nearby areas during monsoon. The damaged bunds which are about to breach may cause bund failure and destruction to life and property of public living nearby and the formation of deltas due to siltation at various points affects the smooth flow of river course, the report notes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/detailed-flood-mitigation-project-set-to-begin-soon/articleshow/88640890.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Jincy, 27, is the deceased. The police have arrested her husband, Deepu, 28, following the incident.According to the police, the alleged crime took place around 5 pm at their new house, ‘Ayodhya’, at Mevanakonam under Kadakkal police station limits on Saturday. The house was under Jincy’s ownership and it was only six months since they started living here. The couple had been living separately for the past one month owing to marital problems. While Jincy remained to live in the new house along with their elder son, Deepu lived in his ancestral house at Cherukulam with their younger daughter, aged four.Kadakkal station house officer inspector V S Rajesh said that Deepu surrendered before the police after committing the crime. He told the police that Jincy suspected him of infidelity and this had often made way for quarrels between the couple. He left home one month ago following a similar squabble. On Saturday, he visited Jincy’s house. They soon broke into a quarrel during which he hacked her with a machete he was carrying with him. ‘’He told us that he brought the machete along with him just to scare her, but he used it to attack her when his rage took over,’’ the inspector said, adding that the police have not ruled out the possibility of the murder being premeditated. Deepu was a tipper lorry driver. Jincy was working at a cashew factory under Cashew Development Board at Parippally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/wife-hacked-to-death-during-domestic-dispute/articleshow/88640892.cms||---

Speaking at a public protest staged in front of the Secretariat here on Saturday, Satheesan said that the government should prioritise development projects which are essential to people.“The state government is mulling the Silver Line project while many other essential and beneficial projects are stuck. It would take generations to complete 525 kilometres of K-Rail in a state where 10 km development happens in 11 years,” the opposition leader said.The protest was staged by the Karamana-Kaliyikkavila action council. Action council president A S Mohan Kumar, representatives of various political parties and other members of the action council spoke at the occasion.It was in 2019 that ULCCS had won the agreement for widening of the 5.5 km stretch from Pravachambalam to Kodinada under the second phase of road development project. The work was awarded at an estimate of Rs 112 crore. Owing to various reasons like delay in shifting of utilities, lockdown induced by Covid, differences which arose out of fixing of compensation, the work has been delayed. The land was handed over after acquisition procedures were completed for the Old Rajapatha at Pravachambalam.The first phase of Karamana-Kaliyikkavila road widening project was commissioned in 2016 by PWD National Highways wing. It included road widening from Neeramankara to Pravachambalam. It covered a distance of 5.5 km.The stretch from Pravachambalam to Vazhimukku was originally envisaged to be covered under phase 1; however, the stretch was dropped after land acquisition had been delayed at Balaramapuram. The original project involves widening from Neeramankara to Kaliyikkavila to 30 metres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/action-council-demands-completion-of-road-work/articleshow/88640894.cms||---

Dr Patel unsuccessfully sought anticipatory bail from all courts, including the Supreme Court, but had to withdraw his pleas.The deputy municipal health officer claimed innocence, but special judge J A Thakkar accepted submissions made by government district pleader P M Trivedi, that Dr Patel’s prima facie involvement was reflected in the evidence gathered by the anti-corruption bureau.In refusing bail to Dr Patel, the court said, “Considering the fact of corruption connected with the issue of medical treatment bills relating to the Covid-19 patients which is public money, this court is of the opinion that this is not a fit case to exercise discretionary power…” The court said, “n such a time when millions of people have been thrown out of work and don’t have enough money to feed their families, therefore this kind of act of the present applicant-accused cannot be taken lightly.

---||Ahmedabad||Gold, silver imports surpass pre-Covid levels in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Backed by good sales fuelled by pent-up demand, improving incomes, weddings, and investment requirements gold and silver imports have surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the calendar year 2021. According to the data released by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC), about 42.1 metric tonnes (MT) of gold was imported into Gujarat in 2021, up 123% against 18.8 MT in 2020 and marginally higher than 41.79 MT in 2019. Showing an even more bullish trend, silver imports stood at 319.4 MT in 2021, up sevenfold against 2020 and 1.5-fold against 2019. The demand for both the precious metals remained buoyant through the year. “Despite the handsome gains from equity markets, a section of investors kept their faith in gold as a safe haven,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Acharya added: “This propelled the demand for both bullion and jewellery. Several people invested in sovereign gold bonds and gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) as well which is not accounted for in the physical imports of gold.” He went on to say: “That apart, jewellery demand remained bullish too.” The gold price touched Rs 49,700 per 10 gram on Saturday in the Ahmedabad market. Acharya attributed the surge in demand to the gold prices which remained stable through the year. Moreover, a reduction in import duty of gold from 12.5% to 7.5% announced in the Union budget in February 2021 also boosted sales, he said. Industry players said that investors were diverted to gold due to the lowered interest rates in banks as well. With several weddings taking place, the pent-up demand for jewellery also worked well. Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA), said: “A lot of customers who had pending or deferred occasions organized them last year which propelled fresh purchases of gold.” He added: “People realized the importance of gold as a haven and therefore continued to invest in the form of jewellery during festival muhurats as well.” As for silver, the demand was powered by investors. The silver price stood at Rs 64,300 per kg on Saturday in the Ahmedabad market. “Many invested in silver anticipating better returns. Silver prices are expected to go past the Rs 70,000 per kg level,” said Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. “Even lightweight silver jewellery sales grew during the festive season along with those of artefacts. As a result, silver demand shot up further.” With higher demand for gold and silver, employment in the gems and jewellery sector has improved significantly as scores of artisans returned from their home states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gold-silver-imports-surpass-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/88640907.cms||Niyati Parikh

In 2021, the traffic offences declined to 3.67 lakh and Rs 18.54 crore in fines were imposed on the offenders. According to the figures of the city traffic police, there has been a decline of 2.43 lakh cases of various traffic offences. The main reason behind the deceased traffic cases, according to the police, is that the cops gave relaxation to the traffic offenders. Another reason was that the people cultivated the habit of following the traffic norms which took them nearly one-and-a-half year after the increased traffic fines were implemented from September 2019. If the figures of the traffic offences in 2021 are compared with the figures of 2019, then it shows a huge decline in the offence. In 2019, the city traffic police registered 15.36 lakh cases of traffic offences which kept decreasing for past two years. From 2019 to 2021, there was a decline of nearly five times in the traffic offences. A city traffic police officers said, “The year 2021 was deadlier than 2020 in terms of Covid-19 pandemic due to which the police personnel were focusing on implementing the Covid norms rather than registering the traffic offences.” He added, “Apart from that, we have focused more on clearing roads rather than charging people in the times of the deadly Covid wave between March and May this year.” Another police officer said that though people also began following traffic norms to avoid hefty fines but still there are offences like not wearing helmet, not wearing seatbelt by car drivers or illegal parking which remained in top offences. Apart from that people continued to show negligence by using cellphone while driving their vehicle. In some cases, people gave excuse that they had some medical emergency but in most of the time, people cannot change their habit of using cellphone while driving so that they were fines, added another police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cops-waived-fines-during-covid-wave/articleshow/88640912.cms||---

The collapse occurred only weeks before the flyover’s opening. The flyover is supposed to offer smooth passage to South Bopal residents.Also, the five-member committee set up to investigate the collapse had hit a wall for over a week. The committee was initially headed by the secretary housing and Nirmal Gujarat, Lochan Sehra. But then within days of the committee’s formation, Sehra was appointed Ahmedabad municipal commissioner and AUDA chairman.The state government has now appointed secretary planning at GAD, Rakesh Shankar, as the head of the committee in Sehra’s place. The committee has a senior engineer from Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI), another from the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar, and three engineers from the state roads and buildings department.The experts will examine whether the concrete was strong enough or ready to undergo post-tensioning. They will probe if any of the 24 steel tendons running through the hardened concrete snapped while the pressure gauge pulled the tendons. The quality of various parts of the devices used in the post-tensioning or concrete-stressing activity will be assessed. The components include bearing plate, locker plate, extra collar, tension jack, master/pulling plate, and master grip. Even the quality of the steel strand or tendons used in the girders will be gauged. “Material samples from the site will be tested at our state roads and buildings department labs to ascertain whether the quality of the raw material was maintained,” said a senior AUDA engineer.Ranjit Buildcon has been awarded contracts of several bridge and highway structures. A similar bridge structure collapse in Surat involving the same company had occurred in 2007 and a labourer was killed on the spot when a flyover span collapsed between Udhna Darwaza, Majuragate, and Athwalines. Another structure failure was reported in the company’s 2016 flyover project in Anuvratdwar. When the incident occurred, the Unjha-based Ranjit Buildcon, which had been assigned the construction work, was post-tensioning the 114th and the last box girder. When the bridge fell, there were 90 persons on the scene. None was injured.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bridge-collapse-load-bearing-tests-ordered/articleshow/88640915.cms||---

Ford Motor Company, while announcing its India exit had hinted that car manufacturing plant at Sanand, Gujarat, will stop production by December-end whereas the engine plant will continue operating. Company spokespersons confirmed that while car production will continue only to fulfil existing export orders, the plant will mainly function to manufacture spares for automobile parts for their existing customers. “We intend to fulfil all our order commitments before winding up the plant operations completely. To achieve this, we have extended the plant operations by another quarter. While cars will be assembled only for prevalent orders, spares and components are also being manufactured for our existing customers, whom we have promised to support for a period of ten years,” said Kapil Sharma, a Ford India spokesperson. Sources at the plant however claim that car manufacturing has already stopped and the focus is on manufacturing spares. “A target of manufacturing some 5 lakh different kinds of spares has been set by the company. At this point, the plant is operating on all three shifts, with Shift A and B spread over eight hours and the Shift C being the night shift panning over six hours,” said a source. The company has some 10 lakh unique customers across the country. Ford India has invested Rs 4,000 crore at its Sanand plant. However, the company has accumulated operating losses of around US$ 2 billion in India in the last decade, according to the company spokespersons. The decision to shut down is expected to impact over 4,000 employees across both the plants in addition to some 150 dealers who operate over 300 outlets. “We have decided to retain the network of our service outlets across some 248 out of 253 locations in India,” Sharma further added. An estimated 1,200 employees including white collar and blue-collar workers are expected to be affected by the plant’s shutting down. “Most workers employed at Ford have applied for jobs at several other locations. However, none of them have yet got any confirmed appointments,” said Vijay Bapodara, president, Karnavati Kamdar Ekta Sangh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fords-sanand-plant-to-continue-operations-till-march-end/articleshow/88640917.cms||Niyati Parikh

The resident doctors put up posters and banners about the ‘harassment’ meted out to them by the head of the department for ENT, Dr Ila Upadhyay. “Despite complaints to the college authorities, Dr Upadhyay continued to mentally torment us on Friday. As a result, we have decided to stage a protest while continuing to treat patients outside the ENT OPD,” said a resident doctor in the ENT department. In a letter to the faculty dean, Gujarat University, the Junior Doctors’ Association recently alleged that Dr Upadhyay asked one of her students, resident doctor Saurabh Banerjee to gift her a micro-meter drill set. The association demanded immediate action against the faculty failing which they had threatened to stage a protest.

These aspiring rasikas at the Saptak venue stop surfing social media at the sound of Mudgal’s notes. It appears an awakening has occurred for which “likes” and heart icons, the standard expressions of delight, are too imprecise and weak — even for those who usually hail both the Taj Mahal and samosas with the same thumbs up sign. That’s the force of Mudgal. Purists and the curious mute their vocabularies and signs of appreciation and hear her truths till their sensibilities find honest words. “I hope 2022 brings us some hope of freedom from the dreadful coronavirus and the terrible captivity it has held the world in,” Mudgal told TOI. Her programme will be a special commemoration on Sunday. Viraj Amar Bhatt, who will open the evening session on Sunday, is an Ahmedabad disciple of the Banaras Gharana notables, Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Her recital will be a eulogy for Pandit Rajan Mishra who lost his life to Covid in April last year. Viraj Amar’s presence on the stage, at any rate, is always a stream of light, not scattering at the galleries but guiding the audience towards the redemption of saadhana. Even her fast passages give the impression of containing themselves in antique China vases. Her mastery of her gharana’s hallmarks — long beat cycles and breath management — is presented not as an act of genius but as a poised striving of a seeker. So her recital promises to be a dignified tribute to her guru and a stately affirmation of the Banaras Gharana legacy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/eulogy-ragas-eternal-perfection-of-classical/articleshow/88640923.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

---||Ahmedabad||Not even treated effluent in sewers: HC||Ahmedabad: To requests from industrial units that they be permitted to discharge treated effluent into sewage lines, the Gujarat high court expressed its scepticism on continuing this arrangement, after drainage connections of 393 units in the city were severed over pollution caused in the Sabarmati river.A major textile unit, Ashima Ltd, and various industrial units in Naroda were requesting the high court to permit them to release treated waste water into sewage lines on certain conditions. However, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati refused and said, “At any cost, we do not want industrial effluent to get into sewage lines of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Even if the industrial effluent is treated at ETPs of the industries themselves, it would be hazardous in all respects to permit such industrial effluent to be discharged into sewage lines.”The refusal of the HC was based on it being “virtually not possible” to keep continuous watch and monitor the functioning of ETPs. The HC was in favour of finding a solution for the release of wastewater from these industrial units into the mega pipeline, which carries trade effluents from CETPs to the Sabarmati river. The high court is against the discharge of trade effluents into sewage lines because sewage treatment plants (STPs) get damaged because of the mixing of trade effluent with sewage, and this leads to improper treatment of sewage at STPs, from where improperly treated water reaches the Sabarmati.Another proposal was mooted by Arvind Ltd of Naroda, Ankur Textiles of Raipur and Anup Industries of Odhav, which have also had their drainage connections snapped. These units proposed that they would install RO treatment systems to achieve zero liquid discharge (ZLD) by using buffer capacity available in the multiple effect evaporator (MEE). The wastewater from the RO would be transferred through tankers to their Santej unit located about 28km from the unit.The judges asked the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), the joint task force and amicus curiae to discuss the proposal with the unit managements and come out with a solution. A further hearing is posted for January 7.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/not-even-treated-effluent-in-sewers-hc/articleshow/88640926.cms||---

Even for patients with the disease, the condition often turned fatal with clots travelling to the brain, heart or vital organs. An umbrella study by state-based researchers found that across the globe, prevalence of thrombosis in Covid patients was found to be 38.8%, or nearly four of every 10 patients developing blood clots.The study, ‘Venous thromboembolism in hospitalised Covid patients- An umbrella review’ has been selected for presentation at a conference organized by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) next year. The study was recently uploaded online for peer review. The authors include Komal Shah, V P Varna and Radhika Nimkar from IIPH Gandhinagar; Dr Kamal Sharma, an Ahmedabad-based cardiologist; and Hasmukh Shah from Pramukh Swami Medical College in Karamsad.The review considered 25 peer-reviewed papers published on PubMed between December 2019 (pre-Covid) and August 2021 (after the second wave of Covid) to assess prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The study found that VTE prevalence was 16.5%, DVT 10.8% and PE was 11.5%.Komal Shah, assistant professor at IIPH-G, said the study is the first of its kind to look into the specifics of blood clotting in existing and recovered Covid patients. “Its findings have implications for both clinicians and post-recovery patient management. VTE is often silent in Covid patients, but as it takes the infection to extremely advanced levels, it poses greater risk of mortality,” she said.Dr Shah added that early detection and treatment such as administering anti-coagulants can save lives at a time when the number of Covid cases is again on the rise in Gujarat and elsewhere.Prof Dileep Mavalankar, director of IIPH-G, said thromboembolic complications in Covid were found to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients. “In one case – in the early phase of the pandemic – a man developed DVT and gangrene. As he was an active Covid patient, nobody was ready to perform the leg amputation. When he finally managed to get one, he could not survive,” he said, adding that the medical fraternity’s understanding is much better now than it was in the early phase.Dr Kamal Sharma, a city-based cardiologist, said compared to international evidences, cases in Ahmedabad have shown a relatively lower number of embolisms. “I believe that this is due to data management and not paying attention to the issue, especially when the number of cases was very high,” he said. “However, blood clotting in the aftermath of Covid-19 is a major issue and should not be ignored.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/4-in-10-covid-patients-developed-blood-clots-study/articleshow/88640932.cms||Parth Shastri

The mass inoculation drive would be rolled out on January 3. According to the preliminary estimates, there are about 24.4 lakh adolescents in this age bracket. The health department wants to inoculate the majority of the beneficiaries in this group in about a week by giving the jabs at their doorstep. In the next phase, the drives may be extended to school premises to cover the leftover children. Andhra Pradesh has got about 40 lakh Covaxin doses for this drive as only Covaxin will be administered to this population category. Commissioner, department of medical, health and family welfare, Katamneni Bhaskar, said the ANMs (auxiliary nursing midwives) would visit the households of the children in this category to administer the doses. “We have decided to conduct the drive at homes as we can cover all the eligible population either in the morning or evening. If the same drives are conducted at schools, we may miss the absentees,” said Bhaskar. Bhaskar said no Omicron case in the state presented severe symptoms such as breathlessness or others. “About 40,000 foreign returnees have arrived in the state in the last one month. We are conducting tests on all the foreign travellers. The state has so far detected 17 Omicron cases,” said Bhaskar. The precaution doses for the elderly with comorbidities and healthcare workers will be given from January 10. As per the preliminary estimates, about 50 lakh people would become eligible for the precaution doses. With regard to the administration of the precautionary dose, 9 months (39 weeks) must have elapsed since the administration of the second dose to make the beneficiary eligible. Bhaskar said about 90% of total eligible beneficiaries, including the 15-18 age group, will be inoculated with both doses by February. “As the gap is only 28 days between the two doses of Covaxin, the 15-18 group would also be given both the doses by February. The genome sequencing lab being set up at Siddhartha Medical College, Vijayawada, would come into operation in the next few days. “A trial run is currently being conducted,” said Bhaskar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/door-to-door-vax-for-15-18-age-group-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88640933.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Ranchi||Doctors fear new institutional quarantine order may overburden state’s health infra||Ranchi: The state government’s order on December 29 for giving preference to institutional quarantine of Covid patients is set to paralyse the available health infrastructure given the pace at which the infection is spreading.Experts have sounded an alert on the matter and said the decision of quarantine — home or institution — should not be left with incident commanders or administrative officials but stressed that a protocol must be issued at the level of the health department.As on Saturday, Covid wards at the state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (Rims) and the sadar hospital were almost full to the capacity with the majority of patients being asymptomatic.“The virulence of the new Omicron strain is less though the transmissibility is high. Currently, our wards are filled up and most of the patients are asymptomatic,” said Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, the head of the state Covid centre at Rims. He cautioned that if the medical experts and the staff are engaged with the asymptomatic patients, they would be exhausted and not be able to serve at a time when actual medical care is needed for serious patients. Out of the total patients admitted at Rims, only four are on oxygen support. “Even the four patients do not require high-flow oxygen and are expected to recover soon,” he said.ENT expert and specialist in neck and skull surgery, Dr Abhishek Kumar Ramadhin, said he had attended to several Covid patients in the last couple of days. “There is no doubt that the infection is spreading very fast but in the absence of genome sequencing, we cannot say with surety whether they are the Omicron variant,” he said, stressing that within a few days, institutional quarantine would prove burdensome because the number of patients is going to increase manifold.“Most of the patients are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, which is often noticed during the end of any pandemic but we have to remember that even if 0.1% of the patients get serious and need ICU treatment, our health infrastructure is going to be inadequate in the wake of the quick spread of the infection,” he said, suggesting that the government should take a decision on home quarantine for asymptomatic patients as soon as possible.Officials in the state health department said that they are closely monitoring the situation and the incident commanders have been directed to take a call about a home or institutional quarantine. The order for quarantine is based on a directive from the Centre, they said. However, the doctors claimed that the incident commanders are not ready to take the onus of allowing home quarantine, fearing the spread of the virus.“Our hospitals — comprising both government and private — do not have an unlimited infrastructure to quarantine each and every patient and when we know that the new variant is highly infectious, we have to accept the fact that the majority of the population is going to be infected. Therefore, the health infrastructure should be kept ready for those who genuinely require treatment,” said Jogesh Gambhir, president of the Jharkhand chapter of Association of Healthcare Providers India.He said apart from the compulsory institutional quarantine, patients out of panic are also coming to hospitals but they should understand that the present variant is causing mild symptoms which are getting over within 48 to 72 hours without much intervention.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/doctors-fear-new-institutional-quarantine-order-may-overburden-states-health-infra/articleshow/88640953.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

There are 60 lakh ration card holding families (under the Centre’s NFSA scheme), but the government is failing to provide them with ration. Now, the government wants to create chaos in the state by providing subsidy on petrol to only 20 lakh families (who own motorcycles),” Prakash said in a statement. He added: “If the government is genuinely concerned about providing relief, then it should have slashed the price of diesel.”On the occasion of the second anniversary of his swearing in, chief minister Hemant Soren announced the subsidy from January 26. His government has since then remained silent on how will the announcement be fructified.While senior officials have said a dedicated website is being developed where beneficiaries can upload the sreceipt of the petrol they purchased from the pumps to claim the subsidy through direct benefit transfer, the government has claimed that means of implementation are still being worked out.Talking to TOI, a senior leader of the ruling JMM laid out another way forward. “Beneficiary families will need to purchase petrol at the current rates from petrol pumps and produce the cash memo with their PDS dealers. The dealers will then initiate the DBT into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries which are linked with Aadhaar cards. Benefits will be extended to every bike which belongs to the beneficiary family,” the leader said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/petrol-subsidy-a-publicity-stunt-claims-bjp-state-prez/articleshow/88640954.cms||---

Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is going to make roof top rainwater harvesting mandatory in all buildings constructed on a minimum of 1000 sq ft of area. Corporation officials said that it will be made mandatory by amending bylaws, and the process of the same is on. “We have proposed amendments to the IMC’s building permission bylaws and invited claims and objections to make roof top rain harvesting system mandatory in all buildings constructed in municipal limits of Indore. We hope to make it compulsory within a month or so,” IMC commissioner Pratibha Pal told TOI. The commissioner said that it will be mandatory for both new and old buildings having a plot size of 1000 sq ft or more and the initiative has also been included in the vision plan of the year 2022. IMC is also considering giving a rebate in property tax for building owners if they install a rainwater harvesting system in their building. IMC will also give free technical advice and consultancy to those who would want to install the system. “We are targeting to cover at least 50,000 buildings and equip them with rainwater harvesting systems before the next monsoon season,” said Pal. Civic body officials believe that rainwater harvesting is the only way to arrest the depleting ground water level, and said that rainwater harvesting is mandatory for only G+3 structures or above with a minimum of 250 sq meter of construction area under Madhya Pradesh Bhumi Vikas Rules, 1984. A one time rebate of 6 per cent on property tax is also given to the building owner for implementing rainwater harvesting systems.There are around 18000 buildings including private and government ones which already have a rainwater harvesting system. If a 100 sq meter building installs a rooftop rainwater harvesting system, it conserves around 50,000 litres of rainwater.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/imc-to-make-rainwater-harvesting-compulsory/articleshow/88640958.cms||Ashok Kumar

The divisional review meeting was held in the last week of December. The records showed that as many as 10 of those 23 delivery points in eight districts under the division remained non-functional for the eight months period from April last year. Of those 10 non-functional delivery points, eight were Community health centres (CHC) and two were district hospitals in Alirajpur and Jhabua, showed records. Regional director (health services) Indore division Dr Ashok Dagaria said, “These delivery points are shown in non-functional category because of less C-sec deliveries there in accordance with guidelines.” The guidelines suggested that there should be at least ten C-sec deliveries in a district hospital in a month and five in community health centres every month. These facilities failed to achieve these targets, said Dr Dagaria. “These facilities have performed some of the C-sec but that remained very low”, said Dr Dagaria. The records however showed that all those eight CHCs together performed only 70C-sec deliveries in that eight months’ time last year. There were four CHCs including in Sendhwa, Mundi, Jobat, and Tandla, which performed zero C-sec deliveries.

In a bid to mitigate the impact of the ecological concerns, the State Biodiversity Board has proposed a green touch to the maiden budget of chief minister Basavaraja Bommai for the financial year 2022-23. A group of experts led by board chairman Ananth Hegde Ashisara has made 22 recommendations to the CM in this regard. The experts suggested addressing ecological concerns while the plans and sub-plans are prepared at the departmental level, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The major recommendations include arresting the landslides, conservation of deemed forests, cow grazing land, devara kaadu, growing fruit-bearing trees, and local variety trees instead of monoculture plantation through revenue and forest departments jointly. Strengthening of the biodiversity committees and protecting the biodiversity through rural development and panchayat raj department. Strengthening of the village level forest committees, forming the Medicinal Plants Conservation Area, green walls across the coast to stop the sea erosion etc have been proposed through the forest department. Biogas production units have been proposed through urban development department. The experts suggested the government to engage the horticulture department to promote beekeeping, sambar plants promotion among others. They also suggested solar power units for the lights and geyser for 5 lakh families through the energy department, besides implementing tree-based farming, and a ban on harmful pesticides through the agriculture department. They also requested the CM to hold a meeting with experts to implement green ideas in his budget. The expert team includes TV Ramachandra and other scientists from IISc, Bengaluru, Dr Vamana Acharya, former chairman of the state pollution control board, Keshava H Korse, conservation biologist etc. “We submitted a proposal to the CM in the second week of December. It is aimed at addressing the ecological concerns through department-wise planning,” informed Ananth Hegde Ashisara. Sahadev, an activist from Koppa in Chikkamagalur said, the challenge is implementing the suggestions. “The initiative is good. But whether the government will seriously implement the suggestions is the question. Ashisara’s report on landslides in the western ghats is not implemented till now. So, I don’t think, the government will take anything seriously,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/thrust-on-green-recovery-in-bommais-maiden-budget/articleshow/88640967.cms||Shrinivasa M

However, the biggest headache faced by the high school and PU college principals is convincing the students to get vaccinated. The health department has made elaborate plans to inoculate students, including creating awareness against vaccine hesitancy, by organising parent-teacher meetings. According to parents, school heads, and principals from Mysuru, even though the health department officials visited the institutes, the response from the students was not encouraging, and many parents are not agreeing to allow their children to get vaccinated. “The vaccine hesitancy which was found among the public in the initial days of the drive, is now reported among the students also. When we held a meeting with the students, they said that they will decide on whether to get inoculated against Covid-19, after taking permission from their parents,” said a PU college principal from the city. “Many students are not convinced about the importance of getting vaccinated, and there is also a lot of fear in this regard,” he said. Parents have decided to wait for some time, before taking a call. “In my son’s school, teachers asked for permission for him to get vaccinated, but I am yet to make a decision. I will prefer to wait for a few days, to know whether vaccination is actually helpful or not,” said Subramanya K H, a parent of a Class X student from the city. Santosh Kumar, Mysuru district representative of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools (KAMS), said that counselling is key to convince children to get inoculated against Covid-19. “In many houses, parents and grandparents of students have not got vaccinated. This is a challenge. We are requesting students to convince their parents to get vaccinated,” he said. “The actual scenario will come to light, only when the health department staff administer the vaccines,” he said. State PU Federation president Kadnur Shivegowda informed that teachers are working towards convincing students to get vaccinated. D Shashikumar, the general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools, said that negativity should not be spread about vaccination. “The health department has a plan for vaccination. We are holding counselling for the children to get inoculated. Vaccination is in the interest of all,” he said. According to health department commissioner D Randeep, the department launched several initiatives to create awareness among students and their parents, about the importance of getting vaccinated. “Schools and colleges will conduct parent-teacher meetings before the vaccination programme begins. Awareness will also be created through other modes, at the local level, to stress upon vaccinating this vulnerable group. Vaccination protocol laid down by the government of India will be followed. Efforts will be made to explain the benefits of vaccination in this time of pandemic. Any parental concern or apprehension will be addressed by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), who will be invited to clear any doubts. Audio messages and radio talks by well-known paediatricians are being planned, to convince students and their parents about the importance of getting vaccinated,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/hesitation-among-students-could-hamper-vaccination-drive-fears-health-department/articleshow/88640969.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Mysuru||Mysuru: Wall constructed with construction debris||MYSURU: The city corporation has shown the way to address challenges associated with the management of construction debris after the city dropped to 12th position in the Swachh Survekshan Survey recently. The Mysuru City Corporation has successfully built a compound wall using construction debris at the solid waste management unit located in the burial ground near Jodi Tengina Mara at Bannimantap Highway Circle. The civic agency reused at least 50% of the construction and demolition waste by constructing the compound wall. As the existing compound wall, which was constructed several years ago, was in a dilapidated condition, the corporation authorities had approached the Public Works Department (PWD) to provide an estimate for the construction of the compound wall. Based on the request, the PWD authorities estimated the construction cost to Rs 4 lakh. Meanwhile, MCC environmental engineer Sridevi approached Regional Low Energy Environment Friendly (RLEEF) founder Rajesh Kumar Jain, who had constructed structures using construction debris, to build a sustainable and zero waste wall at the unit. Speaking to TOI, Rajesh Kumar Jain said when the MCC engineer approached him for the construction of the compound wall, he agreed to take up the work. “It was like a pilot project. We constructed the 100 feet long wall with 10 feet height with debris provided by the MCC. The wall, which was constructed 10 days back, was built at minimum cost. We have also given presentations to the officials regarding the construction of buildings using C and D waste. Discussions are being held with MCC officials to construct houses for pourakarmikas and school classrooms using a similar method,” he said. Sridevi said the construction was completed in a month. “The company has constructed the wall with a cost of Rs 2 lakh using 10 loads of debris,” she said. Mayor Sunanda Palanetra told TOI that the C and D waste generated will be used for the construction of structures. “We are also requesting the public to use the construction debris for the construction of buildings which will reduce the construction cost,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/wall-constructed-with-construction-debris/articleshow/88640970.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

The senior BJP leader argued that this would ensure that the temples were administered more efficiently.“If the revenue generated by the temples is utilised for the development of the shrine, and the surrounding region, it will benefit everyone,” he said.Ramadas pointed out that, while the state government was keen on deregulation of temples, it would not entrust the management of the shrines to private entities. Accusing the Congress of misleading the public, he added, “Congress will not return to power, which means that the very question of repealing the anti-conversion bill or reversing the BJP government’s decision on deregulation of temples does not arise.”Admitting that there would be changes in the BJP machinery after Sankranti, Ramadas reiterated that he was not keen on a berth in Basavaraj Bommai’s cabinet. The former minister said that the BJP’s defeat in the Mysuru-Chamarajanagar local authorities’ seat in the legislative council was a lesson the local workers and functionaries would do well to heed. “Overconfidence and lack of awareness on the first and second preferential votes may have been the reasons for the loss,” Ramadas added.Govt not privatising temples, says EshwarappaSpeaking to reporters in Shivamogga, RDPR minister K S Eshwarappa said the government is not trying to privatise Hindu temples, “but will manage them effectively”.Referring to state Congress president D K Shivakumar’s assertion that the state government is seeking to rehabilitate Hindu leaders by privatising Hindu temples, he said: “Shivakumar should convert himself to other religion as he is always upset with pro-Hindu policies because he is into appeasement politics. Congress has always taken anti-Hindu stand,” he claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/ramadas-bats-for-deregulation-of-temples/articleshow/88640971.cms||---

We believe that Siddaramaiah is behind the protests against Cariappa.

The police must give security to Cariappa who has been appointed by the government,” he said.“Cariappa has not been involved in any corruption activities and it is unfair to demand for his suspension. Noted personalities Chakravarthy Sulibele and Malavika Avinash are not anti-nationals nor Pakistanis for Rangayana to not invite them as chief guests for Bahuroopi,” he said.Meanwhile, the activists of Rangayana Ulisi Horata Samiti continued their protest against director Cariappa. The protesters, who gathered near the DC office, demanded that Cariappa be suspended. Protestors said the government must immediately suspend Cariappa, accusing him of sowing the seeds of communalism in the institution.“Although a memorandum has been submitted to the government, no action has been initiated against Cariappa. We are denied permission to hold a protest at Rangayana” they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/siddaramaiah-is-conniving-with-left-wing-activists/articleshow/88640972.cms||---

Had there been massive conversion, the number of minorities should have increased, Hanumanthaiah argued. Speaking to reporters, he said issues like conversion and increasing the age of marriage of girls are being brought to limelight to avoid bad press. “RSS has hidden agendas behind these issues,” he stated. Asserting that there is a need to focus on issues that affect the common man, he said the BJP-led NDA and the state governments should explain about inflation and farmers issues. “But they are trying to deflect the attention by bringing in Anti-Conversion Law and the age at which a girl can marry. The Union government has not consulted experts and with NGOs before increasing the age of marriage for girls. The new age limit will affect people, not help them,” he stated. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cong-mp-provide-data-on-conversion-in-ktaka/articleshow/88640973.cms||---

Following necessary approval from both the Centre and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in July, which was delayed due to the pandemic, now forest department sources claim the state government may notify the wildlife sanctuary as a tiger reserve anytime soon. As a formal notification from the state government is needed to get more funds for protection of tigers as well as for conservation, to avoid poaching and man animal conflict in the tiger reserve, the forest department is expecting the notification from the state government soon. The state board for wildlife has approved the proposal. The sactuary is spread over 90,618.75 hectares with a core of 670.95 sq km and a buffer zone of 235.19 sq km. Becoming a tiger reserve will help the forest department get an additional Rs 25 crore to Rs 30 crore annually which can be used to mitigate man animal conflict, set up anti-poaching camps and install more camera traps. Once upgraded, Chamarajanagar will have the rare distinction of having three tiger reserves, including Bandipur and BRT reserves. MM Hills Wildlife sanctuary will be the sixth tiger reserve in the state. MM Hills forest has 20 tigers and cubs according to various camera trap images. Karnataka has tiger reserves at Nagarahole in Mysuru and Kodagu districts, Bhadra in Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts and Dandeli in Uttara Kannada. Speaking to TOI, Deputy director of conservator of forests, MM Hills wildlife sanctuary, V Edukondalu said the official notification from the state government is an administrative formality as the state board for wildlife, NTCA, the Union ministry of environment and forest have the cleared decks for declaring the sanctuary as a tiger reserve by giving all necessary approvals. The prey density in MM Hills is pegged at 5.05 animals per sq km with the presence of species like Indian elephants, gaur, dhole, spotted deer, sambar, four horned antelope. The reserve has sufficient space for tiger population to thrive, he said. The forest also has leopards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mm-hills-sanctuary-all-set-to-become-a-tiger-reserve/articleshow/88640975.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to hire 81,000 teachers||JAIPUR: The state government has announced to recruit a total of 81,000 teachers in the coming months. The move is being seen as an attempt to pacify the anger of youths demanding government jobs. Following the announcement of 49,000 more teaching posts, the government on Friday night announced 32,000 teaching posts for primary and upper primary levels. Both jobs are likely to invite 20 lakh applications and have evoked a mixed response from the youths’ and teacher’s associations. Prakash Mishra, spokesperson of Rajasthan Teachers’ Association (Shekhawat), called the number of recruitments low as compared to the actual requirement. "The state has 82,000 government schools and every school haS a vacancy of level I and II teachers. I didn’t come across any survey by the state to access the actual number of vacant teaching posts. The figure will neither serve schools nor provide any relief to the large chunk of eligible unemployed youths," said Mishra. Rajasthan Berozgar Akikrit Sangh president Upen Yadav said the announcement was fine, but the government had to announce the complete time frame right from the exam date to the first day of the job. "I would like to remind the government that they should bring a stringent law for cheaters/cheating rackets before the next recruitment exam," said Yadav. The Congress government in its manifesto had promised 3 lakh jobs annually and so far, they have delivered only one lakh jobs. "This year, we will recruit another one lakh youths, including 52,000 teachers.Also, the provision of filling the vacant job in the same financial year will expedite the hiring process in the state," said Swarnim Chaturvedi, spokesperson of state Congress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-to-hire-81k-teachers/articleshow/88640997.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Cong makes 10 dist presidents as V-P of 20-point programme||Jaipur: Congress in the state seems to have rescinded the principle of one person one post in the organization. The state government on Friday issued orders appointing 10 Congress district presidents as district vice-presidents of the twenty-point programme implementation committee.Incidentally it is on the same principle PCC chief Dotasra had relinquished his ministership. Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasara said this post is a means of coordinating the district president of the ruling party with the administration. A guideline has been made that the Congress district president of all the districts will also become the vice-chairman of the district committee of the Twenty Point Programme. However, in the districts where there are two or three district presidents, not all district presidents could become vice-presidents. For them, a separate way out will be found. Dotasra said, “There is nothing inappropriate in the appointment. Party district presidents meeting district collectors in capacity of vice-chairman would rather help district administration to get feedback and address grievances effectively. If district president is from the party in government, he will be in a better position to put public matters before the administration.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cong-makes-10-dist-presidents-as-v-p-of-20-point-programme/articleshow/88641000.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to frame policy on hoardings soon||JAIPUR: The state government will frame a policy on display of billboards and hoardings in cities. The indiscriminate display of hoardings spoils the beauty of the city skyline. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot directed the local bodies to frame the policy at the earliest. He also directed the municipal corporation to remove the display boards put up on junctions as it is a distraction to traffic causing accidents and is also in violation of the supreme court order. The policy should enumerate the spots in the cities where display boards could be allowed and also prescribe the size. Besides no hoarding or bills boards could be displayed without the permission of the respective municipal administration. Though there were rules to put up billboards, a trend has gained currency that people put up billboards and hoardings at every possible location in the city even on birthdays of leaders and any social events. These billboards are not only a hazard to the citizens but spoil the city skyline. Rajasthan being a tourist destination, the government thinks that such wanton display of hoardings would mar the heritage look of the city and there is need to regulate the system. A streamlined system would also help to generate revenue to the local bodies. Recently the Jaipur-Greater Mayor Sheel Dhabai faced objection from locals in Jhotwara when she ordered the removal of illegal hoardings. So, a clear cut policy on hoardings and billboards would remove the chances of such incidents in future, said officials in the local bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-to-frame-policy-on-hoardings-soon/articleshow/88641007.cms||---

From the new academic session, the state textbooks will include special modules on local languages, traffic rules, environment, climate change and stories with local characters. The SCF will submit the first draft to the ministry of education for the review. The Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training (RSCERT), Udaipur, is developing the curriculum framework for the state. It has organized 12 workshops with over 500 resource persons to develop the completely new SCF. It was in 2012, when the last changes were done to the SCF. Once the first draft is approved, the RSCERT will work on the final draft for final approval from the education ministry. “Children aged 3-4 for the first time will study the concept about family, their routine, Janmashtami festival and use of water in the class to enhance their learning outcomes,” said Priyanka Jodhawat, director of RSCERT. In the next pre-primary classes, the modules on traffic rules along with good and bad touch have also been included with the aim to educate children on these two subjects early in life. “The concept of good and bad touch has also been explained to children through a picture of a boy and a girl. A special training manual has also been prescribed for teachers to impart the subject,” said Kamlendra Ranawat, assistant professor at RSCERT. SCF has given an equal focus on pre-primary classes, primary classes and higher classes. The RSCERT will revise the textbook ‘Hamara Rajasthan’ which was introduced last year in every class from VI-XII. Chapters will include contents on state businessmen, social thinkers, artists and freedom fighters. “For the first time, freedom fighters from the state and works of well-known Rajasthani social reformers and poets, Kanhaiyalal Sethia and Bavji Chatur Singhji will be added in the textbooks. Topics concerning the state like climate change, desertification, skill-training, and importance of water will also be included,” said Ranawat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/localised-activity-based-new-state-curriculum-draft-ready/articleshow/88641009.cms||---

It is being attempted to provide better transport facilities to boost the economy,” said Jardosh. At the event BJP state chief and Navsari MP, C R Paatil, who made a brief visit said, “Earlier it took eight to 12 hours to reach a destination in Saurashtra but now it will take just an hour.” “It was the wish of mentors of the airline Govind Dholakiya, Savji Dholakiya and Lavji Daliya Badshah to provide a chance of air travel to those who can’t afford it hence lowest possible ticket prices are offered,” said Dholakiya. The airline was launched by Dholakiyas, who are running two leading diamond manufacturing units, along with Daliya, a developer. Both families belong to Saurashtra and have migrated to the city four decades ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/intra-state-air-services-launched-from-surat/articleshow/88641011.cms||---

The tunnel has been proposed for a distance of 23.6km between Dakshina Kannada and Sakleshpur, connecting Mangaluru with Bengaluru. A senior officer of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said the government has sent three tunnel experts, including two from the ministry, to study the area, and based on their report, a decision will be taken. The team was on a two-day visit. In the first week of December, several road users took to social media, raising concerns about the pathetic condition of the Mangaluru-Bengaluru road stretch, especially near Marenahalli on the Shiradi Ghat road. Many tweeted, urging Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari to ensure a permanent fix on the prominent NH stretch that connects the port city and Bengaluru. The NHAI official said repair works have commenced at Marenahalli, and that it is expected to be completed soon. There has been a mixed response to the Shiradi Ghat tunnel road project. While environmentalists have been opposing the project, fearing further destruction of the sensitive Western Ghats, industry is in favour of it. An environmentalist said, “There is already a railway track and a road, and the government has implemented the Yettinahole project. Will the government guarantee in its detailed project report for the tunnel project, that there will be no damage to the dams built as part of the Yettinahole project, during the construction of the tunnel? Building a tunnel next to the dam when the project is near completion, may only increase chances of more landslides.” However, the industry body is in favour of the project. The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) wrote to Union minister Nithin Gadkari on the need to expedite the project. Recently, they also urged the government to develop the Mangaluru- Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/shiradi-ghat-tunnel-expert-team-visits-project-site/articleshow/88641019.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The earmarked area is located in and around surrounding villages of Buvanahalli where the airport project is being executed. About 1,700 farmers are parting with their farm land to Huda’s new layout project. According to the Huda sources, it is estimated to get 15,000 sites tentatively in 1,060 acres area.

Nearly 10% of the total sites will be considered as corner and commercial sites. Rest of the sites will be distributed to the applicants category wise. Lottery system is applied to pick applicants (beneficiaries) from every category when the number of applications exceeds the number of available sites.

The civic agency reused at least 50% of the construction and demolition waste by constructing the compound wall. As the existing compound wall, which was constructed several years ago, was in a dilapidated condition, the corporation authorities had approached the Public Works Department (PWD) to provide an estimate for the construction of the compound wall. Based on the request, the PWD authorities estimated the construction cost to Rs 4 lakh. Meanwhile, MCC environmental engineer Sridevi approached Regional Low Energy Environment Friendly (RLEEF) founder Rajesh Kumar Jain, who had constructed structures using construction debris, to build a sustainable and zero waste wall at the unit. Speaking to TOI, Rajesh Kumar Jain said when the MCC engineer approached him for the construction of the compound wall, he agreed to take up the work. “It was like a pilot project. We constructed the 100 feet long wall with 10 feet height with debris provided by the MCC. The wall, which was constructed 10 days back, was built at minimum cost. We have also given presentations to the officials regarding the construction of buildings using C and D waste. Discussions are being held with MCC officials to construct houses for pourakarmikas and school classrooms using a similar method,” he said. Sridevi said the construction was completed in a month. “The company has constructed the wall with a cost of Rs 2 lakh using 10 loads of debris,” she said. Mayor Sunanda Palanetra told TOI that the C and D waste generated will be used for the construction of structures. “We are also requesting the public to use the construction debris for the construction of buildings which will reduce the construction cost,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mcc-constructs-compound-wall-with-construction-debris/articleshow/88639106.cms||---

---||Goa||Over 3 sqkm sand dunes found across Goa’s coast||PANAJI: During verification to prepare the final draft of the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa, a total of 3.07sqkm area of sand dunes were found to be existing on beach stretches across the state.  A majority of the sand dunes covering a total area of 2.4sqkm have been found along the South Goa coastline, with only 0.67sqkm is on the North Goa coastal stretch. During the ground truthing and verification process for the CZMP, it was found that the area in Goa under sand dune had earlier been grossly under reported in the draft prepared by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM). While the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority’s (GCZMA) expert committee identified sand dunes covering a total area of 75.42 lakh sqm, the NCSCM had demarcated only 29.35 lakh sqm area earlier. “The authority noted that NCSCM is one of the experienced scientific institution notified in the CRZ notification, 2011, for preparation of the CZMP. Hence, NCSCM may consider the recommendation of the expert members and with their expert knowledge, decide,” GCZMA said, before forwarding the expert committee’s report to the NCSCM. The final draft of the CZMP is presently with the Union environment ministry and is awaiting its approval before it is finalised and notified. Sand dunes are an important ecosystem, which protects inland areas from coastal flooding caused by storms, wind and waves. They are also home to local flora and fauna that is only found in sand dunes. The GCZMA’s expert committee found over 10 lakh sqm of additional sand dunes in Cavelossim, which were not figuring in the NCSCM’s data, which is the biggest discrepancy in the case of any coastal area. In 2018, the NCSCM conducted a survey of the sand dunes in Goa to prepare the draft CZMP for the state, but the survey appeared to mostly reflect the sand dunes that had been earlier demarcated by the NCSCM during a survey it had carried out in 2015. The GCZMA expert committee members found sand dunes in Paliem, Agonda, Palolem and Loliem coastal stretches, which the NCSCM had failed to demarcate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/over-3-sqkm-sand-dunes-found-across-goas-coast-during-czmp-verification/articleshow/88640251.cms||---

Physical classes would resume for Class I to XII as well as undergraduate and postgraduate courses as per 50:50 formula. The administration has allowed 50% of total students to attend in-person classes, while rest can be present in online session. Amid the rising cases in the city, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) as well as schools have decided to wait and watch how the Covid situation pans out. Civic chief Radhakrishnan B told TOI a review of the permission would be done in the coming week. Collector R Vimala ruled out any review of the existing permission to hold physical classes. Last month, some educational institutes were undecided about resuming physical classes mainly because of reluctance from parents. Some of them had put off the plan for January 3 resumption, but are still undecided. However, the vaccination programme for 15 to 18 would ensure schools call their Class X to XII students. Rachna Singh, principal, St Ursula Girls High School, said the plan to restart physical classes for Std 5 to 7 is being held back. “We would be calling Std X to XII in batches of 100 for the vaccination programme and start classes. Anyway, these students had to come for offline activities ahead of the board exams. For rest, we shall wait and watch this week. We have over 4,000 girl students to deal with,” she said. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal, Adarsh Vidya Mandir High School & Jr College, said parents have been informed and regular schooling shall go on with strict adherence to the Covid guidelines. “Class I to XII students would attend physical class on alternate days,” he added. Two CBSE schools had shut for 10 days after some students tested positive in December.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpur-schools-colleges-reopen-on-jan-3-as-per-dec-order/articleshow/88650313.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

In fact, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had plans to develop the stretch through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). However, no progress was seen for the proposal. If it were taken up through NHAI, people would have been forced to pay a toll. Since the road is being developed through the PWD, people are relieved,” he said.Govt not keen on decentralisationMLA UT Khader lashed out at the BJP government for not holding an election to the Someshwar Town Municipality in his constituency. Though the largest gram panchayat in Dakshina Kannada district was upgraded into a Town Municipality after a cabinet nod in 2018, the election was not held for the newly formed urban local body, Khader said.“The government has not held an election in Someshwar Municipality as they are not keen on decentralisation.

Expressing concern over the rise in the number of cases, the collector said that it would not be long before Nashik district sees an exponential jump in cases. Hence, it is advisable to cut down the spread with all possible means and limiting attendees at social gathering is one of them, he said. Collector has directed all the implementing agencies to ensure control over gathering of people for any cause. The state government norms about attendees will be strictly followed and there can be no relaxation in it as of now till the threat of third wave and omicron variant ends. This has not gone well with the people whose plans for social gatherings have gone for a toss. With the new norms setting in, they have been forced to cancel their programmes or cut down the number of invitees. “It is a very painful exercise to chop off the numbers. After having urged the guests to come, we now have to do the exercise of requesting them ‘not to come’ to the programme. We had 93 guests as per govt norms. But due to revised norms, we will have to cancel the Jan 3 programme,” said Prachi Sonawane, who has sent invitations about her marriage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-max-50-people-at-any-social-gathering/articleshow/88641034.cms||---

As per data made available by the state power utility, the zone witnessed payment of Rs 340 crore which was 73.3% of the total bill generated (Rs 463.84 crore) in both the districts. MSEDCL public relations officer Vikas Adhe said in terms of percentage of consumers opting for online payment Aurangabad zone topped the chart with 84.4% — around Rs 307 crore out of the total Rs 364 crore bill generated. It was followed by Bhandup zone with 84% (Rs 834 crore) of the bills realized though online payment in the month of November. This was closely followed by Pune zone (80%) on the fourth spot. The response to online payments is encouraging and increasing as well. “We have been carrying out campaigns for increasing participation of the people as it is rewarding for them during the pandemic as many restrictions have imposed on movement of people,” Adhe said. The high tension (HT) consumers compulsorily need to pay their bills through the internet banking facility given the value of their bill is over Rs 10,000 per month. All other consumers — residential, commercial and industrial — have other options. “The interesting factor is that the low tension consumers — residential, commercial or even industrial — who pay their bills online are eligible for 0.25% discount, up to Rs 500, that is reflected in the next month’s bill,” Adhe said. He also pointed out that all bill payments, excluding the ones made through credit card, are free from any kind of service charges. “Since this is as good as paying the bills and getting discounts, we urge the people to follow the system and go for online payment,” said Adhe. The online payment mode is being welcomed by the citizens, especially those who are working, as it is difficult for them to find time to visit the bill collection centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/73-bill-payments-in-nashik-zone-for-nov-were-online/articleshow/88641036.cms||---

The Cantonment Board hospital now has three dialysis units. Chief executive officer of Deolali Cantonment Board Rahul Gajbhiye has appealed to people to take benefit of the facility set in the cantonment board’s hospital, considering that charges for dialysis will be nominal compared to the charges taken in private hospitals. These machines in the Dr B J Pandit dialysis unit of the hospital will be operated by Mumbai based trust Quality Kidney Care. A good Samaritan had donated a sonography and dialysis machines to the Deolali cantonment hospital about a year back. However, owing to the spread of Covid -19, for most of the time of 2020 and 2021, the hospital was operating as a dedicated covid health centre, the new machines were not made operational. On October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti last year, the sonography machine was made operational, while on the occasion of the New Year, the dialysis facility has been thrown open. Both the machines are extremely useful for the hospital considering that it caters to the medical needs of not only the residents of Deolali Camp but a large number of people in various villages around it.The dialysis unit was inaugurated by Subodh Pandit and Asha Pandit. Present at the inauguration were Brig A Ragesh, CEO Rahul Gajbhiye, nominated member of the cantonment board Pritam Avhad and former vice president of the board Bhagwan Kataria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/dialysis-unit-starts-at-cantt-board-hospital/articleshow/88641039.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Three people lose Rs 2.4 lakh to cybercriminals in Haveri||HAVERI: It appears as though cybercriminals are making merry at the expense of gullible citizens. For instance, in the past three days, three cases have been reported with people cumulatively losing Rs 2.49 lakh. Interestingly, all the three people who were duped were under 30. While one was a vegetable vendor, one was a daily wage labourer and the third victim a merchant involved in wholesale trade of surgical instruments. Byadagi resident Rashida Inayathmulla, a daily wage labourer, lost Rs 41,000 after she received information on WhatsApp, informing her of a lottery she had won. Firuzkhan Pathan, a dealer in surgical instruments, was cheated of Rs 98,000 by an unknown person who called him up for a supposed business deal. Vegetable vendor Sayyadgoud Shankaranahalli lost the highest amount of money amoing the three — Rs 1.1 lakh — to someone who posed as a tomato supplier. Rashida said that she received a message on WhatsApp that had a lottery coupon for Rs 25 lakh on it. “I then received a phone call asking me to pay the service charge for claiming the money. I was asked to credit Rs 41,000, and following the instructions, I credited sums of Rs 16,000, Rs 18,000 and Rs 7,000 in three deposits,” a rueful Rashida said. It was not after several failed attempts to contact the individual that Rashida realised she had been duped. “I subsequently filed a complaint with the Haveri cybercrime, economics and narcotic (CEN) offences wing,” she said. Pathan said that he received a call from a man (phone no.: 9630362774), who claimed to be a representative of a pharmaceutical firm. “He told me that he could get me a good deal on surgical instruments, but asked me to credit at least 50% of the amount in advance. Believing him, I credited Rs 98,000 in multiple instalments. But the number has been switched off ever since,” he said. Sayyadgoud Shankaranahalli, a vegetable vendor from Tippunagar in Rattihalli, was contacted by Mohanbai on Facebook, who offered to supply tomatoes. “I ordered 400 boxes of tomato for Rs 1.9 lakh. I was asked to credit a sum of Rs 1.1 lakh in advance to various accounts. But I have not been able to reach him since I credited the money,” said Sayyadgoud. Haveri CEN police station inspector Santosh Pawar confirmed the receipt of three complaints. “Many people credit money to accounts without verifying the credentials of the person. People must be wary of such fraudsters,” Pawar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/three-people-lose-2-4-lakh-to-cybercriminals-in-haveri/articleshow/88641044.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

We will inform the people about how the BJP has failed both at the Centre and in the state. Of the 17 assembly seats in the three districts, the Congress will win 14 constituencies,” said the KPCC working president.Questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on allegations of corruption levelled against ministers in the Karnataka government, Ahmed said, “PM Modi often says ‘na khaoonga, na khaane doonga (won’t accept bribe, nor will allow it)’. But he is mum about allegations of contractors being asked to pay 40% in commission to ministers. Urban development minister Byrati Basavaraj is among those who is alleged to be involved in the land scam, but the BJP refused to allow any discussion on this issue in the legislature.”On the lack of initiatives undertaken by the Congress to exert pressure on the government to implement the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project in contrast to the efforts being made vis-à-vis Mekedatu drinking water project, Ahmed said, “I will propose launching a padayatra demanding the implementation of the Mahadayi project during the party meeting. We have been fighting for the implementation of projects in North Karnataka, and doing all we can to realise them when in power.”The MLC added that the Congress was holding a three and five-day training session for the party workers in Ghataprabha. On the BJP’s ‘Mission 150’ for the 2023 assembly elections, Ahmed said the Congress was aiming to win more than 150 seats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/cong-mlc-sees-bjp-vote-erosion/articleshow/88641046.cms||---

M Nandhini, a Class VII student and L Manoj Kumar, a Class VIII student, of the Panchayat Union Middle School at Kalappanaickenpalayam, were worried over plight of people in coastal districts whose lives are turned upside down by floods every year. “It is a Himalayan task to arrange shelters and camps for flood victims. It is a challenge to shift and relocate them. Moreover, it leads to stress and anxiety among victims, and worse, loss of life and damage to property,” said Nandhini. “We gathered information about floods around the world in the last five years and analysed the damage caused to men and material,” she told TOI. The project offers a common solution with a one-time investment, said Manoj. “We have suggested prefabricated houses that stand on four pillars. The structures can be elevated using hydraulic screw jacks at the time of flood. This technique can also save cattle,” he said. Science teacher R Anand Kumar guided the duo. “They studied structure of houses in coastal Tamil Nadu and drew inspiration from flood-resistant houses in Kerala,” the teacher said. The state-level science exhibition concluded at the Forest College and Research Institute in Mettupalayam on December 29.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/students-house-raising-tech-to-survive-floods-goes-places/articleshow/88639747.cms||Sampath Kumar

Police sources said this was the fifth attempt to search for treasure believed to be hidden by erstwhile kingdoms. Police have launched a probe into the incident after registering an FIR and are looking for the miscreants. According to police, the alleged treasure hunters entered the sanctum sanctorum of Ramalingeshwara shrine at Honidibba village in Nippani taluk on the night of December 26. The temple, built by Kadamba dynasty, was later nurtured by Kittur kingdom. Ahead of their search for gold and silver treasures, the hunters allegedly performed black magic. The miscreants reportedly restored the idol before making good their escape. Temple priest Rudrappa Mattikoppa found something amiss when he arrived at the temple to offer puja the next morning. The priest informed the villagers, who, in turn, filed a complaint with the Kittur police station. Police said there are no CCTV cameras at the shrine or in the vicinity. Hence, they are focusing on mobile tower network to narrow down their search for the miscreants. An officer working with the Archaeological Survey of India in Belagavi said the temple is an unprotected monument and his office has submitted a report to the regional office on the incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/800-yr-old-shiva-temple-dug-up-for-treasure/articleshow/88641058.cms||---

Babla them along with his wife Harpreet Kaur Babla, a newly-elected councillor, and son moved out of the MC building. Later, Chawla came out and left.Babla told TOI, “Chawla was not taking my calls despite repeated attempts for past many days.

The administration had recently filed a review petition before the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) for implementation of Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for solar plant installation in the city. Recently, the power regulatory commission had turned down UT administration’s plea of implementing Resco model. The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), had moved JERC for implementing Resco model in the city. Crest, the project's nodal agency, had proposed this model after the approval of former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. The ministry of new and renewable energy has enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69 MW, to be achieved by 2022. Till date, the UT has achieved generation of around 46 MW. Last year, the UT administration extended the solar plant installation deadline till March 31, 2021 but the UT had not extended the deadline. The deadline was extended as lockdown was in force. At the time, UT administration had decided not to impose any penalty on residents till the lockdown ended. The administration, in a notification issued on May 18, 2016, made installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory in houses .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-seeks-progress-report-on-solar-plants/articleshow/88641069.cms||---

He said the safety of people was priority as the new year could be celebrated again.However, Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee president Kuldeep Singh Rathore described the move to vacate the Ridge and Mall Road as a “failure of intelligence agencies and state government”. He said if government had information of a bomb blast, people should have been informed in advance. He said the last-minute decision to vacate the Ridge and Mall Road had dealt a blow to the tourism sector and ruined the state’s image.Thakur, while interacting with media, said there was a specific input that an attempt was being made to sabotage the New Year celebrations at the Ridge. He said the input was specifically for the Ridge. He added people were requested to celebrate the New Year where they were staying and people understood and immediately vacated the place.Thakur said the state government had contacted the Army Command at Chandimandir and requested for the assistance of a bomb disposal squad. “Army’s bomb disposal squad from Chandimandir had arrived and checked the Ridge and Mall Road to be sure,” he added.He said an alert had been sounded across the state, especially in areas having large influx of tourists.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/shimla-ridge-vacated-due-to-alert/articleshow/88641082.cms||---

Being chased by stray dogs, the spotted cat had climbed up a tree to save itself. The leopard’s sighting, however, created panic in the residential area and people informed the forest department, which rescued the feline and sent it to the Tutikandi Rescue Centre. After receiving information around 8am, a team of the forest and wildlife Department arrived at the spot and rescued the leopard after using a tranquilizer gun to sedate it. People said the leopard was injured in the attack by stray dogs. A local woman was the first person to see the leopard around 7.15am. She informed others about it. She said they then called up the forest department. She said a couple of year ago, it was heard that a leopard was moving in the area, but this was the first time it had been seen and rescued. Another resident said she saw the leopard climb up a tree around 7.30am and informed her husband and neighbours about it. She said when she came out of her house, she saw dogs barking. When she carefully looked in the direction where the dogs were barking, she saw the leopard, who was also trying scare away the dogs.Two years ago, a leopard had killed two children in separate incidents in Shimla.

She said that some big announcement for Himachal Pradesh were expected but the Prime Minister went without announcing anything significant for the hill state. The MP added that Modi has unsuccessfully attempted to please the people by speaking in local dialect during his Mandi visit. “We expected that the Prime Minister would give some relief package for the development of state, but nothing like this happened. The PM unsuccessfully tried to please the people by speaking the dialects of Mandi and Kullu. Inflation and unemployment are two of our biggest issues, but the PM never touched those topics,” Pratibha Singh said. Speaking on the upcoming Parliament session, the Mandi MP said that she would raise the issues of rising inflation, unemployment and public interest of the state, and added that there is a need to construct big airports in the state for tourism development.Congratulating the state Congress president and the entire Congress team for the party's resounding victory in all the four by-elections in the state, Pratibha Singh said that Congress is moving ahead strongly in the state and will also win the assembly elections to be held this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/pm-skipped-key-issues-during-his-mandi-rally/articleshow/88641085.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Pvt schools may switch back to online classes||Coimbatore: With offline classes deferred for students up to Class VIII due to spread of new Omicron variant, private schools are once again planning to switch to online mode to ensure that the learning process is not affected. According to private school managements, resuming offline classes will be pivotal if Omicron stays longer. School education department will rely on the recently-launched Illam Thedi Kalvi scheme to bridge the learning gap among students of Classes I to VIII. Even though online classes were yielding limited results, students in the lower classes were kept engaged in academic activity until offline classes resumed in November. This was unlike in the government schools where students had to rely on textbooks and Kalvi Tholaikatchi scheme. Students in lower classes in government schools are facing serious learning gaps. For instance, a child who was in Class 1 in 2019-20 is now in Class III after half of the class I and the entire Class II spent at home due to the lockdown. “But the last two months have been useful for teachers to forge a bond with the students, thanks to offline classes,” said a government schoolteacher from Ukkadam. Many students could not recognise their teachers when offline classes resumed in November. “But the gap has been filled. This is likely to help us in the coming days even if there are no offline classes. But only offline classes can help government school students to learn effectively,” said the teacher. Chief education officer N Geetha said that the department is relying on the Illam Thedi Kalvi programme for government school students to keep track of academic activity. While selection of volunteers for the scheme is in the final stage in many places, it will be streamlined in the coming weeks. President of Tamil Nadu Private School Association R Visalakshi said it would be too early to predict prolonged lockdown as restrictions are announced only till January 10. “We need to wait at least till the end of January. We can resume classes if Omicron subsides and even otherwise, we can restart online classes to keep track of academic activity for students in the lower classes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pvt-schools-may-switch-back-to-online-classes/articleshow/88639750.cms||TNN

Over 30 industry bodies in the district have written to railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw demanding a circular train service in Coimbatore. With the existing infrastructure, a circular mainline electric multiple unit (Memu) train service can be started in the district, which has a population of about 20 lakh. While the proposal has been pending for over a decade, stakeholders are pressing it as an essential need of the growing city. They want the railways to restore the five trips between Mettupalayam and Coimbatore from the existing one trip. They also demand restoration of the overnight daily express train service from Coimbatore to Rameswaram via Pollachi, Palani, Dindigul and Madurai, besides extension of Tiruchendur - Pollachi – Palakkad express train up to Mettupalayam via Kinathukadavu in Coimbatore. The overnight daily express train service from Coimbatore to Rameswaram will also facilitate convenient movement of goods. The train should ply via Pollachi, Palani, Dindigul and Madurai. “We have been requesting authorities for restoration of train services from Coimbatore to south Tamil Nadu via Pollachi, which were discontinued due to gauge conversion 10 years ago. But railway authorities are yet to restore all trains,” said B Mohan Raj, secretary of the Pollachi Train Passengers Welfare Association. “We plan to bind all the representations and hand it over to the members of Parliament, railways minister, chairman of railway board and general manager of Southern Railways,” said J Sathish, coordinator of the Coimbatore Development Council.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/boost-rail-infra-say-industry-bodies/articleshow/88639751.cms||TNN

It is not an accident but a man-made tragedy because those at the helm of the affairs are responsible for the first-ever stampede at the holy cave shrine."The leaders, including PDP vice president Choudhary Hamid and general secretary Amrik Singh Reen, demanded a high-level probe into the stampede to fix responsibility of officers who were "responsible for the deaths of 12 pilgrims".The statement alleged that over the last few years, common pilgrims have been facing hardship due to VIP culture at the shrine."Rooms at the Bhawan and en route are usually occupied by relatives, family friends, neighbours and knowns of bureaucrats," it claimed.Instead of providing facilities to pilgrims, the higher-ups of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board are usually busy attending to the family members of officers, it alleged.The PDP leaders asked how a large number of devotees were allowed to visit the shrine."Authorities claimed to have convened several meetings regarding the Covid crisis in J&K but it has to be seen as to how the administration fixes responsibility for crowding at the place, leading to a stampede," they said.Later, the PDP said, a party delegation led by Hamid visited Katra and enquired about the condition of those injured in the stampede.

There had been no customary exchange of sweets between the two armies along the LoC in past years due to the rising tensions. Col Anand said that all the necessary Covid-19 protocols were followed during the exchange of sweets by the two sides. "Considering the ongoing ceasefire along the India-Pakistan border, this gesture is aimed at further enhancing peace and harmony in Jammu & Kashmir," he added.The two countries had renewed the ceasefire agreement on February 25 last year, following which the situation along the international border and the LoC had changed a bit and even farmers having land in the border areas started cultivation. Over 5,000 acres of fertile land along the international border, spread across 22 border villages from Paharpur to Londi in Hiranagar sector, had remained fallow for two decades due to frequent firing and shelling from the Pakistani side.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/india-pak-armies-resume-exchange-of-sweets-on-ny/articleshow/88641089.cms||---

The exhibition saw good response from the public on Saturday, but stall keepers and buyers were seen without masks. Ensuring social distancing was a challenge as it was held in a closed enclosure. “People do not seem to be taking the pandemic seriously even after the entry of Omicron. It is time they allowed exhibitions of this kind to be organised only in open air places,” said K Sugumar, who decided not to see the crowds.Though organisers asked the visitors to the exhibition to wear masks they did not ensure it was followed, said S Santhi, a visitor. Similarly, Rajaji Park near Gandhi Museum was packed with people who brought their children along on Saturday evening. Almost all of them were seen without masks. Hand sanitizers were not to be seen anywhere on the premises. “When the government is even cancelling physical classes, shouldn’t people be more cautious about exposing their children,’’ said a doctor who was shocked to see the crowds in parks.Theatres and shopping malls too had good crowds on Saturday evening. “It is not possible for the government to monitor the entire place, but people can’t be so careless,” says A Ananth of K K Nagar.Social activist V P Manikandan said monitoring was not seen in parks or exhibitions to check if people had their vaccination certificates. “It is like a ticking bomb, if the same continues Madurai is going to see an explosion of Covid cases in the next week. The government can impose the restriction till after the Pongal festival,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/crowds-at-expo-parks-sans-mask-expose-govt-curbs/articleshow/88641091.cms||---

He said it is unfair that other activities and establishments that cause crowds remain unaffected while school for Class I to VIII students has been banned due to the threat of Omicron.The association said that with fee collection being restricted to 50% and 75% over the past two years, private schools are facing debts and their survival is at risk. “When government school teachers are paid irrespective of classes being held or not, private schools need at least minimal financial support especially as we strive to hold online classes for students to not miss out on studies,” added Arumugam. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/pvt-schools-write-to-cm-for-aid/articleshow/88641092.cms||---

Keelakuyilkudi, near Nagamalai Pudukottai in Madurai district, has a statue of a bull owned by a man named Sukkuru Devan who lived in the village about four hundred years ago. The bull is said to have been iconic and an animal that won many games and brought pride to the entire family.The bull had been so lucky, that descendants of the owner erected a statue of it. People believe that making offerings to this statue would bring prosperity and good health for the new year.On Saturday, the statue of the bull was grandly decorated with flowers, and people made offerings and the entire area was decorated with kolams and other decorations.Thangam from the village said that the people from the village worship the statue whenever they go out on any auspicious occasions and special prayers are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. “We believe that some omens like the falling of a flower is a sign that he is blessing us,” he said. They also celebrate a grand festival for the animal, on the day of ‘Maatu Pongal’.In Anupapatti village near Thirumangalam, men only participated in a festival at the Karumparai Muthiahswamy temple. They sacrificed hundreds of goats and prepared a meal and offered it to the deity. The feast was attended only by men from nearly ten villages in the neighbourhood.From small boys to elderly men participated in the festival.

However, the present government was never ready to hear anything. Our ulemas conducted three meetings but we never called it Dharam Sansad. The kind of language used at the recent Dharam Sansad can never be used by our ulemas. Our ulemas show the path of peace, patriotism and love to disciples."The religious scholar further said, “It is really shameful that such a situation exists in our country now. They want to kill 20 lakh Muslims. So, we decided that we are ready for it. I urge the government that they can send their people to kill us. On January 7, at least 20,000 Muslims will surrender before them. The best way is that Muslims sacrifice their lives to ensure peace in the country."He added, "From now on, we will gather in large numbers every Friday. Let the world see what India’s Muslims are going through at the moment.”Meanwhile, police have refused to grant permission to hold such a protest gathering in Bareilly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/20-lakh-muslims-will-sacrifice-their-lives-for-peace-in-india/articleshow/88641097.cms||---

You should apologise to the people.”Yogi said that his party is "working continuously" for the welfare of the poor, "who were earlier bereft of government scheme benefits under the SP rule." He claimed that now every poor person has a roof over his head. He added that his government has allotted 45 lakh houses in the state and 18,000 in Rampur, and "ensured that electricity reaches all 75 districts of the state."The CM took a swipe at the SP and said, "Before 2017, those behind the Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar riots were honoured at the former CM’s residence. After we came to power, farmers were felicitated and Guru Baani was played at the same residence. This is the difference between the previous government and ours.”“Babua also said that if he was in power, he would have also made the Ram Temple but he never had time off from building graveyards,” the CM said.Taking another swipe at SP, the CM said, “When we were looking for a product from Rampur to promote our 'One District, One Product' scheme, we could not find a single such item. All we could find was the Rampur knife. When I delved deep to know about this knife, I got to know that good people use the weapon to save the country while anti-social elements used it for land grabbing, robbery, and other crimes.”Yogi said that the Rampur knife, which was once used as a protection tool, was wielded at the poor and Dalits to rob them of their landholdings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/people-paid-bills-despite-no-power-supply-during-sp-rule/articleshow/88641099.cms||---

Sources said the state election office recently sent a recommendation to the Election Commission for holding the polls for the 24 council seats, which have been vacant since July 16, 2021 as the previously elected MLCs completed their six years’ term. The election could not be held on time because of non-completion of the electoral college due to the delay in the panchayat elections. Ideally, election for these 24 seats should have been held before July last year. The elected members of panchayats, urban local bodies and the cantonment boards cast votes to elect the MLCs from the local authorities’ constituencies. Sources said as the members of the electoral college have already been finalized following the publication of panchayat poll results, the prospective candidates for the local authorities’ constituencies have already begun campaigning in their respective areas. Most of those whose six years’ term was completed on July 16, 2021, are trying their best to get candidature from any of the leading political parties, namely BJP, RJD and JD(U), to re-enter the Upper House of the state legislature. Similarly, those who lost the 2015 polls are trying to get the symbol of their respective party to contest the council polls. “As the state election office has sent its recommendation, the EC may notify the election by the third or fourth week of January and, most probably, the elections will be held in February or March,” an election official told TOI on Saturday. As per the rules, the elected panchayat representatives like mukhiyas, ward members, panchayat samiti members, district board members, ward members of different urban local bodies like municipal corporation, nagar parishad and nagar panchayat as well as the elected members of the cantonment board cast votes in the council’s local authorities’ constituencies. In the last election for the 24 seats held in July 2015, there were 1,38,904 electors. The last elections were held at 534 polling stations across the state. There are 51 MLCs against the total strength of 75 in the Upper House.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/council-polls-for-24-seats-likely-in-feb-march/articleshow/88641101.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘It will take a long time to achieve dowry-free status’||PATNA: Patnaites have lauded chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar’s appeal to dissuade people from associating with dowry-based marriages. The ongoing ‘Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan’, led by the CM, includes an anti-dowry campaign. He is pleading with people to print on invitation cards that their weddings are free of dowry and liquor. He has also stated that he will attend only those weddings in which no dowry has been taken. Ragini Keshri, a government schoolteacher, told this newspaper that she desired an educated bride for her two sons, not dowry. “Everyone is aware that dowry is a bad thing, but the groom’s family still demands it. It is a sort of tradition now,” she claimed. While the majority of people are opposed to the dowry system, some claim that it is now being offered or accepted under the guise of “gifts”, which is virtually synonymous with dowry. They state that there is still a long way to go before the system is completely eradicated from marriages. Sweta Kumari, a Malsalami resident, pointed out that dowry had evolved into a form of ritual in the form of gifts. “Marriage is an expensive affair, and the bride’s family typically presents the groom with gifts worth at least Rs 5-6 lakh,” she said, adding that it would take time to achieve dowry-free status. Hare Krishna Prasad (89), a resident of Patna City, stated that he was forced to sell land in his village to finance the marriages of his three daughters. He continued, “Dowry is a wrong practice, but our society is still very conservative. It will take a few more generations to break free.” Adarsh, an undergraduate student, said, “Despite the fact that dowry is illegal, people continue to engage in it. Even though girls are financially independent, dowry is still demanded in the form of expensive gifts such as cars, apartments, or pieces of land. There is an urgent need to speak out against this trend.” Deepak Kumar, another student, admitted that dowry was still prevalent in society. He said, “When a father gives dowry through a loan, he believes he has the right to demand dowry at his son’s wedding. We yearn for change, but when we are in debt, these desires are stifled.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/it-will-take-a-long-time-to-achieve-dowry-free-status/articleshow/88641102.cms||---

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ltd (DMRC), the technical consultant for Patna Metro Rail Corporation (PMRC), issued the letter of acceptance to the two companies on December 29. The work on both the networks and stations is likely to begin in February 2022 as the PMRC may get loan from the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) by January-end. A 7.9-km-long six underground stations, underground ramp and twin tunnels, from Akashvani to Rajendra Nagar, will be constructed by utilising Rs1,989 crore. The project was awarded to L&T Construction. The underground construction work on Corridor II involves design and construction of twin tunnels, underground ramp at Rajendra Nagar and six underground metro stations at Rajendra Nagar (interchangeable station), Moinul Haq Stadium, Patna University, PMCH, Gandhi Maidan and Akashvani. Another company, the YFC – MCL JV, will have to design and construct the elevated viaduct, elevated ramp at Mithapur and Patliputra and seven stations. These elevated stations are scheduled at Danapur, Saguna Mor, RPS Mor, Patliputra, Ramkrishna Nagar and Jaganpura in Corridor I. The 7.39-km-long project is to cost Rs553 crore. The Corridor I will have 17.9-km-long network from Danapur to Khemnichack via Meethapur, of which 10.5km stretch will be underground. The PMRC plans to take up the work at many locations simultaneously, by allotting work to different firms in order to avoid delays. It wants to first start operations on priority corridor between Malahi Pakri and Patliputra bus stand. It includes six stations at Malahi Pakri, Khemnichak (interchangeable station), Bhootnath Road, Zero Mile and Patliputra bus stand. According to officials, 112 pillars have been erected from Malahi Pakri to Bhootnath Road while altogether 210 pillars will be developed for elevated network for Corridor II. Piling work has also commenced from Zero Mile to ISBT. For Patna ISBT metro depot and ISBT station, the process is on to acquire 76 acres of land at Ranipur and Pahadi. The state has provided Rs 1,000 crore to the Patna district administration for land acquisition. The estimated cost of Patna metro project is Rs 13,365.77 crore (excluding land acquisition cost, which is to be borne by the state government).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-metro-underground-and-elevatedconstruction-work-likely-to-begin-in-feb/articleshow/88641103.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Patna civic body to identify land to set up hospital for stray dogs||PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) is identifying a place in the city to set up a hospital as a part of measures for population control of stray dogs. “We have to give anti-rabies shots and conduct birth control on stray dogs simultaneously. As per the norm, after healing they are left from where they were caught,” PMC’s public relations officer Harshita said. “We are planning to go for an Animal Birth Control Programme. We are working on it. One hospital was almost ready, but the Gardanibagh residents protested as dogs howled and barked, causing disturbances to them,” she said and added: “The anti-rabies vaccination and birth control programme could not be started yet due to protest by the Gardanibagh residents. We are exploring land for the hospital. This project has been in the pipeline for quite some time.” When asked if the ‘City of Patna’ mobile application can be used for filing complaints against stray dogs menace, Harshita said: “The residents facing dog menace can file a complaint using the app also, but we are promoting ‘SWACHHATA app’ for sanitation issues. For dog-related issues, people can call on PMC toll free number.” Veterinary experts say stray dogs biting cases increase during their breeding season. “During this period, the dogs quit eating, resulting in aggressive behaviour, irritable and biting temperament,” said former director Institute of Animal Health and Production, Dr Ajeet Kumar. “If the animal birth control programme for stray dogs runs well, their population can be curbed,” he added. Bikash Kumar, a businessman, while sharing his ‘stray dog attack’ experience, said: “The major concern is rabies, bleeding and wounds. Three years back, a stray dog lunged over me and mauled my leg when I was returning returning from Sultanganj one night. It took one and a half months for the wound to heal. PMC should monitor their population and control it, for accident reasons are also associated with them.” Renu Singh, director of a school at Bailey Road, said: “Parents should teach their kids how to tackle stray dogs barking at them. Kids should not get frightened and run, as it might provoke them to bite.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/city-civic-body-to-identify-land-to-set-up-hospital-for-stray-dogs/articleshow/88641104.cms||---

Nishad made the proposal during Monday’s meeting of the Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee.Nand Kishore Prasad, the general secretary of the BDPA, stated that the association had already lodged a protest with senior officials of the East Central Railway (ECR) in this regard. “After the Rajdhani Express (12309/12310), the Sampoorna Kranti Express is an important superfast train connecting Patna and its adjacent areas to New Delhi. Besides, former railway minister and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had gifted this train to the people of Patna in February 2002 to enable them to travel comfortably and in less time to the national capital,” he said.According to Shoaib Quraishi, the secretary of the BDPA, the Patna-New Delhi route is the busiest, with thousands of passengers passing through the state capital daily. Due to safety concerns, a large number of students, including females, prefer to travel alone from Patna to Delhi via the Rajdhani Express or Sampoorna Kranti Express.Meanwhile, the association had objected to the Railway Board’s proposed future diversion of the Patna-New Delhi Rajdhani Express via Varanasi. “Given that the Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express (20505/20506) already passes through Varanasi, there is no reason to divert the Patna-New Delhi Rajdhani Express via Varanasi rather than the original Patna-Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction-Prayagraj-Kanpur mainline route,” Prasad stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bdpa-protests-demand-to-extend-run-of-sampoorna-kranti-express/articleshow/88641105.cms||---

The project will be a joint initiative of the minor irrigation, major irrigation and inland navigation department. Chief engineer, irrigation and administration had furnished a proposal for the `flood mitigation works in Trivandrum city` at a cost of Rs 8.05 crores for which the government gave administrative sanction which will cover nine water bodies in the first week of December. The first phase will cover Pazhavangadi thodu, Ulloor thodu, Kariyil thodu, Karimadom pond, Thekkanakara canal, Killi river, Karamana river, Parvathy Puthanar and Thettiyar thodu at Rs 3.81 crores. In the second phase, Killi river, Karamana river, Pazhavangadi thodu will be covered at Rs 4.24 crores. Following the flooding in the city in 2021, the Irrigation department prepared an initial study report on flood mitigation. The team identified around 500 vulnerable points in the water bodies which required immediate attention. A data bank was created on these vulnerable points and is being reviewed. Additional Chief Secretary (water resources) had directed that each water body has to be assigned to an officer to identify the bottleneck points, including waste dumping spots, delta formation areas, and areas with shrubs and trees which block the smooth flow of water. The report noted that the most severe and frequent flooding in the city occurs at Thampanoor, East Fort area, Uppidamoodu and Kannammoola. The flooding in this area occurs three to six times during monsoon. The average water depth is 0.6 to 1.2m and persists for 2 to 24 hours in the central part and three to four days in the southern part of the city. The drainage network of the city consists of two major rivers namely Karamana and Killi, a few canals, their feeders and lakes, the project report notes. As per the report, timely and frequent cleaning to avoid delta formation inside the water bodies, identifying waste dumping areas for regular cleaning, steps to be taken by the Municipal Corporation to prevent further dumping of wastes into the water bodies, preventing growth of vegetation inside the water body, CCTVs , fencing and installation of notice boards along the vulnerable points in the water body were proposed as steps to be taken on a war footing. The phase 1 covering various water bodies is expected to be completed in three months. Emergency side protection works will be undertaken in phase 2. Karamana river covers the longest distance (21 km through the city). The project summary on Karamana river shows that the low bund height at various locations along the river causes flooding in nearby areas during monsoon. The damaged bunds which are about to breach may cause bund failure and destruction to life and property of public living nearby and the formation of deltas due to siltation at various points affects the smooth flow of river course, the report notes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/detailed-flood-mitigation-project-set-to-begin-soon/articleshow/88639317.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Goa||Goa: Citing infighting, BJP’s Margao aspirant backs out of contest||MARGAO: BJP in Margao is in complete disarray. Less than a week after it opened the election office of its prospective candidate Jagannath ‘Desh’ Prabhudessai, the real estate professional has called it quits citing lack of support from the local party unit owing largely to intense factionalism in it. “I am no longer in the fray. I have intimated my decision to the party leadership,” Prabhudessai confirmed to TOI on Saturday. While it is common knowledge that factions in the Margao mandal of the party have deprived BJP of a victory over the years, the dissension became quite pronounced after the party finalised Prabhudessai’s candidature pending approval from BJP central leadership. This was evident as several senior party functionaries of Margao mandal, including its president Rupesh Mahatme, stayed away from the office inauguration ceremony on December 26, that had union minister Shripad Naik in attendance. Source said that though the failure of the local leadership to put up a united front at the event was brought to the notice of the state leadership, there were no immediate attempts by the party brass to stem the signs of dissension. To make matters worse, a senior party functionary, Pandurang “Bhai” Naik, openly declared his support to Congress’ Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and GFP’s Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, making known his disapproval over the party not taking him into confidence before finalizing Prabhudessai’s candidature. “In this situation, it was becoming increasingly difficult for me to carry on with my campaign work. Apart from the damage that it (dissension) was causing to the party, I had my personal reputation also at stake. Though the state leadership was very supportive of me, support from the local unit is crucial, and that was, sadly, missing,” Prabhudessai explained. The latest development has left the BJP karyakartas perplexed. Just when they had thought that the selection of a “fresh face” would neutralize the existing factions within the party, Prabhudessai’s exit from the fray has only served to accentuate the differences, much to the opposition camp’s glee. BJP has failed to wrest the Margao seat from Congress ever since Digambar Kamat defected from BJP to Congress in 2005. Kamat has represented Margao for seven consecutive terms since 1994.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/citing-infighting-bjps-margao-aspirant-backs-out-of-contest/articleshow/88639758.cms||---

---||Patna||Patna varsity campus likely to get a facelift||PATNA: With the state government having sanctioned liberal grants for the construction of new buildings, the 104-year-old Patna University (PU) campus is likely to get a facelift this year. Patna Uiversity vice-chancellor (VC) Girish Kumar Choudhary told this newspaper on Saturday that the state education department has already approved the university’s proposal for the construction of its new administrative and academic buildings and sanctioned necessary funds for the same. “It has also sanctioned grants for the development and removal of some of the existing facilities,” the vice-chancellor said. A multi-storied (G+9) administrative block would be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 58 crore which would replace the existing office of PU. “Another multi-storied (G+11) academic block will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 88 crore,” Chaudhary said, adding that both these blocks would be constructed on a plot of five acres of land lying between VC’s lodge at Patna College and Krishna Ghat. He added, the new academic block is supposed to accommodate all the postgraduate departments of social sciences and humanities which are all presently located in the congested Darbhanga House complex. The Darbhanga House complex would then accommodate the postgraduate department of applied economics and commerce as well as Vanijya Mahavidyalaya of PU. In due course, Vanijya Mahavidyalaya will get its full-fledged independent campus at Saidpur. PU development officer Parimal Kumar Khan said that the university will also get an advanced research centre as well as an international hostel on its campus soon. “The state government has sanctioned a sum of Rs 5.5 crore for the construction of a G+2 building in an area of 10,812 sq.ft. at Patna Science College grounds at an estimated cost of Rs 5.5 crore,” Khan said and added the the centre would have sufficient accommodation for laboratories, data centre, conference halls, faculty rooms, store, and cafeteria. It would get a sum of Rs 2.5 crore for the purchase of equipment needed for the labs. “The hostel meant for the scholars coming from overseas will be constructed in an area of 15,742 sq.ft. at an estimated cost of Rs four crore (sanctioned under RUSA grants). The hostel will have a G+3 structure with a common room and dining hall on the ground floor and 21 rooms on the above three floors. All the rooms will have attached toilets and kitchens and will be fully furnished. Besides these two centres, PU has also received funds for the construction of a library building for postgraduate law department on Patna Law College campus. A sum of Rs 37.33 lakh has been sanctioned for the purpose by RUSA, he added. The education department has also sanctioned a sum of Rs 2.5 crore to PU for the renovation and modernization of its historic Wheeler Senate House. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar is likely to lay the foundation stones of these new buildings of PU sometime in February this year,” Khan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-varsity-campus-likely-to-get-a-facelift/articleshow/88641107.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: Minimum temperature likely to dip over next 2 days||PATNA: The year 2022 began on a foggy note in most parts of Bihar. The residents were unable to see the Sun God on Saturday, the first day of the new year, as skies remained covered with fog throughout the day. As a result, the maximum temperature dropped sharply to 16.1 degrees Celsius at Patna, six notches below the corresponding normal. The daytime or maximum temperature dropped significantly in the majority of the state due to the fog cover. Gaya in south Bihar recorded a maximum temperature of 17.4 degrees C, five degrees below the corresponding normal. Besides, Bhagalpur in north Bihar recorded a maximum temperature of 17.6 degrees C, five degrees lower than the corresponding normal. On the other hand, the state’s average minimum temperature was between 10 and 12 degrees C and its average maximum temperature was between 20 and 22 degrees C. Forbesganj had the coldest morning in the state on Saturday, with a minimum temperature of 9 degrees C. Patna and Gaya recorded minimum temperatures of 12 degrees C and 10.2 degrees C, respectively. Mohd Zeeshan Ansari, a Met official, said the minimum temperature is likely to fall by two to three degrees over the next two days due to the cold westerly winds blowing in the region. The minimum temperature is expected to hover between 8-12 degrees C in north Bihar over the next three days, while it is likely to hover between 8-10 degrees C in the majority of places in south Bihar. On the other hand, the maximum temperature is expected to hover between 20 and 24 degrees C. Additionally, light to moderate fog is expected in a few locations across the state over the next two days during the morning hours. Weather forecasters are also closely monitoring the progress of a western disturbance and its associated cyclonic circulation, which is expected to affect the weather over northwest India beginning January 3. Between December 15 and January 15, the western disturbances bring rainfall or snowfall to the Himalayan region and rainy conditions followed by a sharp temperature drop in the northern plains, including Bihar. On December 28 and 29, numerous locations throughout the state experienced rainy conditions as a result of a western disturbance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/met-minimum-temperature-likely-to-dip-over-next-2-days/articleshow/88641108.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Bihar: UP poll results may impact political scene||PATNA: The New Year has begun on a suspenseful note for Bihar, its political parties and class and it might linger all through the first quarter of the 2022, as workers of ten of the 11 political parties having representatives in the Bihar legislature will be associated with the coming Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly elections one way or the other. The major national and state parties active in Bihar with eyes set on UP are BJP, JD(U), Congress, RJD, CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), AIMIM and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas). However, barring the RJD, the workers of the remaining political parties will root for and also hope to go to UP to campaign for their candidates. From the NDA side, the BJP and JD(U) have already decided to be in alliance in UP also, even as the number of assembly seats to be allotted to the JD(U) has not yet been decided. However, they have left the HAM(S) and the VIP to test their fate in UP on their own steam. The VIP has announced to contest 165 assembly seats there. Its leader Mukesh Sahani, who is a minister in the NDA government in Bihar led by Nitish Kumar, has been hopping between UP and Bihar. HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, on the other hand, is bracing to claim the political turf in UP on the Dalit card shorn of any sign of religious trappings and has also been trying to forge alliance outside the NDA there. While the BJP, Congress and the Left parties have been processing the profiles of their functionaries who could be sent to UP to do the campaigning for the party candidates, the JD(U) is yet to decide whether Nitish will get actively involved in the campaigning work there as he himself has already embarked on social reforms campaign against liquor consumption, dowry and child marriage in Bihar, overlooking even the inauspicious ‘kharmas’ period that will end with the Makar Sankranti (January 14). It started on December 22 from East Champaran and will end with the Nalanda rally on January 15, by which time Nitish would have addressed 12 meetings. Observers feel that he has been repositioning himself in Bihar amid the lurking uncertain situation as the BJP and JD(U) have differences over various issues in the state. While this aspect is under the carpet as at present, the outcome of the UP assembly elections in February-March will impact Bihar, it is being felt. Given the backdrop, while the RJD is unlikely to contest the assembly elections in UP, its leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who got married last month, will also embark on the statewide tour and rallies after January 15. It has been called ‘Dhanyvad Yatra’ (thanksgiving tour) to thank people to make the RJD the largest political party in the state and also ‘Berojgari Yatra’ to focus on the NDA government’s failure to give jobs or create work opportunities for the youths of the state. However, obliquely, the aim seems to be to be in a state of readiness if there is any political flux as a fallout of the UP assembly elections, observers feel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/up-poll-results-may-impact-political-scene/articleshow/88641109.cms||Abhay Singh

During a meeting with officials, the district magistrate stated that in addition to slot booking, an on-spot registration facility for immunising teens with Covaxin shots will be available. DM formed 87 teams, 53 of which would be assigned to rural schools and 20 to urban schools. Additionally, 14 teams would be deputed at government and private medical colleges, as well as vaccination centres operating 24 hours a day. There are 720 high schools in Patna district, with a total enrolment of 4.93 lakh children who are eligible for vaccination. The DM asked the district education officer to convene meetings with government and private schools and direct all institutions to organise parent-teacher meetings in order to ensure that the Covid vaccination drive is a success. Singh said, “Because Covid infections are being discovered in a dispersed manner rather than in any particular location, there is no need to declare containment zones at the time. However, the administration is closely monitoring the scenario in the district and will take all necessary measures to halt the spread of the virus.” He advised people not to delay and seek immediate medical attention if they experience fever, dry cough, or headache-like symptoms. According to sources, the administration has already established a telemedicine facility (6287590551 and 6287590552) and a control room (0612-2219090 and 2219033) for assisting people in need. Additionally, a massive mask-checking drive has been launched, for which the district magistrate has formed 10 teams. While three teams conduct the drive on buses, autorickshaws, and other vehicles, two teams conduct checks on customers and dealers in stores.  The remaining teams conduct the drive exclusively in crowded areas such as vegetable and fruit markets. Chandrashekhar stated, “In response to the rising trend of Covid infections, a total of 289 beds have been prepared for patient isolation and treatment. There are 112 beds at Patliputra Sports Complex, 152 at Ashoka Hotel, and 25 at Khanqah Mujibia. After ‘Prakash Parv’, an additional 200 beds will be made available at Kangan Ghat.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-dm-forms-87-teams-for-vaccinating-teens-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88641111.cms||VK Tripathi

Dissatisfied with the sections of the FIR, teachers staged a protest outside the DC office complex demanding addition of more sections in the FIR. The FIR was originally lodged under Sections 451 (trespassing), 506 (criminal intimidation), 294 (obscene acts or songs) of the IPC. However, after the teachers’ protest, the police added two more Sections 186 (obstructing public functions in discharge of public functions) and 120-B (Criminal conspiracy) of IPC. In his complaint, the DEO said around 12 noon on Friday, the representatives of Ludhiana Parents’ Association met him in his office at DC office complex with Rajinder Ghai saying that they wanted to honour him. When he gave approval, the accused first put a flower garland on him and then made Ghai wear a shoe garland which he realized later.

---||Ludhiana||Market association tweets corrective measures to CM||Ludhiana: Taking note of the major fire incident at Feroze Gandhi market which gutted three shops, its market association has asked the authorities to carry out some changes and take corrective measures to prevent major mishaps in the future. The association members said had the incident happened during rush hours, it would have resulted in very dangerous situation as the market remains jam packed and vehicles are parked everywhere. They claimed that despite Punjab and Haryana high court directions to ensure designated fire lane in the market, the parking contractor encroaches the lane with haphazard parking of vehicles. Association members requested the authorities to implement hourly parking facility in order to decongest the market. Members of the market association also tweeted these suggestions to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.Chairman of Feroze Gandhi market association Col Harjap Singh (retd) said, “The shops which were gutted were located at the very beginning of the market, so it was quite easy for the fire brigade to access them, but during the day, the market remains choked from both sides.” He said they have requested the civic authorities to impose hourly parking in the market because people park their vehicles here in the parking lots and go for shopping to nearby markets or take buses to go to Moga and Ferozepur, but nobody has listened to them. He said they have now requested the same to CM Charanjit Singh Channi, requesting him to implement the HC orders. He said, “We are planning to file a contempt of court orders in the HC in case their demands are not fulfilled.”MC zonal commissioner Neeraj Jain said, “We had implemented the orders of HC as fire lane is designated, but we will check if it has been encroached. Other changes were also made in the market.” The Feroze Gandhi market, which is one of the busiest markets of the city, had been developed by Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) and was handed over to MC for maintenance purpose. The MC had proposed a multi-level parking lot in the market under the Smart City Mission to curb haphazard parking on roadsides, but the idea never materialised.Meanwhile, Saurav, one of the shopkeepers who shop was gutted, alleged that they will file a complaint against the owner of the shop where the fire started in the first place. He said he had opened his shop on Christmas and now he does not know what to do as the shop was taken on rent. He said another shop had also opened a few months back. He alleged that even PSPCL’s delay in switching off the electricity caused more damage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/market-association-tweets-corrective-measures-to-cm/articleshow/88641121.cms||---

The positivity rate is the number of samples that test positive out of the total tested.According to the state health department’s data, the daily positivity rate of district was 0.91% on Friday.

A health official said positivity rate has increased because of the surge in cases recently. He said if the present trend continues, the positivity rate might increase further in coming time. Health officials said as less number of people are being tested for Covid in Ludhiana, the positivity must be much higher.

Former Ludhiana IMA President Dr Narottam Dewan said as the cases and positivity rate are rising, people should take all precautions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/daily-positivity-rate-cases-touch-6-month-high-in-dist/articleshow/88641122.cms||Shariq Majeed

Three eatery shops in the market perished in the incident. The blast caused panic in the area, reminding people of the recent explosion in the Ludhiana courts complex. The exact reason behind the fire was not known. Flames were first reported inside a shop and then sound of the explosion of LPG cylinders was heard. When the incident took place, the shops were closed and somebody from the market informed the fire brigade. It took some time for the fire brigade to begin work because electricity connection was not disconnected till it arrived at the spot. But the fire was controlled in an hour. High flames were first noticed in one of eateries around 2am on Saturday and gradually the fire reached adjoining shops. The firemen claimed that they had reached the spot, but they could not spray water on the fire as electricity supply had not been snapped. In the meantime, the LPG cylinders kept in a shop exploded one after the other. But once they started controlling the fire, it came under control in just an hour. Firemen claimed that though they had brought three fire tenders, two fire tenders were enough to douse the flames. Fire station officer Maninder Singh said, “One after other two blasts happened in the shop and smoke engulfed adjoining two more shops.” He said as the incident happened at night, they controlled it without any problem. But in case, it had happened during the day, it could have proved difficult to reach here due to traffic and haphazard parking. Meanwhile, panic gripped the market in early hours as well as in the morning when the market opened.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/2-cylinders-go-off-at-dead-of-night-trigger-panic-in-posh-city-market/articleshow/88641125.cms||---

---||Goa||Churchill Alemao wants to destroy Goa’s sand dunes, says Congress||PANAJI: Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao is trying to derive political gains by misleading locals and shack operators about the importance of sand dunes, said Congress on Saturday. The party said that the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) does not identify and demarcate all the sand dunes in the state and Alemao is trying to further dilute the demarcation of sand dunes. It has also demanded that the state and the Centre must denotify Mormugao Port Trust’s (MPT) port limits. Congress has threatened to start a fresh agitation if the sand dunes are not completely demarcated and if MPT’s port limits are not de-notified. “The Benaulim MLA is silent about the MPT’s port limits but wants the sand dunes to be wiped out,” said state Congress general secretary Royla Fernandes. A few days back, Alemao had said that sand dunes should not be demarcated on the CZMP as it would affect shack operators and fishermen. In a written letter, Alemao has said that the Chennai-based National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management has wrongly defined sand dunes on the entire coastal belt from Velsao to Cavelossim. Congress said that Alemao is trying to create undue panic among shack owners and fishermen about depiction of sand dunes. “Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority has not wrongly depicted sand dunes along the coast. But they know the importance of these sand dunes, and are qualified to speak in that regard,” Fernandes said. Congress spokesperson Olencio Simoes said the sand dunes are for the protection of the coastal area from strong surge, high waves and coastal flooding. He said that port limits should be denotified and sand dunes should be demarcated for the welfare of the fishing community. “If government fails to do this, then we will intensify our agitation to get justice,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/churchill-wants-to-destroy-states-sand-dunes-congress/articleshow/88640255.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh’s sops: 300 units free power to all, free electricity for irrigation||Lucknow: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said if voted to power in 2022 assembly polls, the SP government would give 300 units of free power to all households in UP every month and free electricity to farmers for irrigation. The announcement came while the former UP CM was addressing party workers who had gathered at SP headquarters in large numbers to wish Akhilesh on the New Year.  “These are the first two promises that will figure in the party manifesto and the people of UP know that SP fulfills all the promises it makes unlike the BJP which has failed to fulfill even the first few promises of their Sankalp Patra,” Akhilesh said.  He also condoled the death of pilgrims who died in a stampede at Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu and wished speedy recovery to the injured. He said the year 2021 was painful with people losing their loved ones to Corona. “Business and trade which suffered losses due to the pandemic failed to recover as the government failed to help them get back on track,” he said.  He said the calendar date has changed but for the Samajwadi Party and its workers, the New Year will be from the day the government in UP is replaced and SP forms the government after the assembly elections. “The ruling BJP has tried to make life difficult for all sections of the society due to its misrule. Let us leave the negativity generated by the BJP government behind and move ahead with the hope that the new year will bring happiness, health and prosperity for all,” he said.  The announcement comes on the basis of feedback from party workers that was sought to incorporate demands of the people at the grassroots level. Sources in SP said the party had launched a massive campaign in July in which party workers were asked to suggest what all should the party include in the manifesto. The most common demand was that either per unit rates of power be reduced or limited free power should be provided to domestic consumers across the state and free electricity to farmers for irrigation.  Thereafter, the SP chief discussed the issue with economic experts to determine the viability of such a demand keeping in view the fiscal aspects of the power department. Finally, a decision was taken to announce 300 units of free electricity to all households in UP after SP formed the government. In July 2021, TOI had carried a news report on how SP was contemplating announcing 300 units of free electricity per month to consumers in UP as an election promise.  Targeting the ruling BJP for Income Tax department raids on the premises of SP MLC Pushparaj Jain, Akhilesh said it was merely a face-saving exercise after ‘Digital India’ faux pas ended up in IT sleuths raiding a BJP man from whose residence trunks full of bundles of currency notes were found stacked inside the walls of the house. He was hinting at the GST intelligence and I-T raids conducted on Kanpur perfume trader Piyush Jain.  “BJP leaders from Delhi, Lucknow and those on television debates kept saying that the cash was recovered from the trader who was associated with SP and had launched Samajwadi Perfume. When they realized that they were wrong, they raided the premises of SP MLC who launched Samajwadi Perfume,” he said.  Usually on new year people go for new year resolutions and as a political party, his resolution is to honour all those who believe in Ram Manohar Lohia and Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, he said, adding “we want to honour poor farmers, laborers and job youths.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhileshs-sops-300-units-free-power-to-all-free-electricity-for-irrigation/articleshow/88640202.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

In a letter on Friday, the socio-Islamic organisation stated that matters related to this category should be "investigated under the watchful eye of the court". In his plea, Madani has made three main observations. Referring to an earlier court order where it had been stated that the HC should seek a report from the government on the action taken in relation to hate speech, particularly against the religious symbols, he asked "what action has been taken now?" Madani then suggested an independent panel to compile all the complaints. Further he said, a court-monitored probe against hate crimes should be initiated."The application has exposed the discrimination of the government and administration in hurting the honour and dignity of Muslims," the letter stated, adding that "no action under criminal law has been initiated with respect to any such instance of hate speech." The petition also cited the recent inflammatory speeches by Yati Narsinghanand, priest of Dasna temple, at a religious conclave in Haridwar; the anti-Muslim slogans raised at a Jantar Mantar rally in August this year; the campaign against Friday 'namaz' in Gurugram; and anti-Muslim rallies held in Tripura, among many other cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/jamiat-ulema-i-hind-petitions-sc-to-seek-details-of-action-taken-on-cases-against-hate-speeches/articleshow/88638837.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Pune||August-September expiry date of vaccines for govt sites in Maharashtra||PUNE: The expiry date of the vaccine stock available for the government sites in Maharashtra was the third quarter of the year and suitable for use in the new vaccination programme for the 15-18 years’ category from January 3, the health department officials said on Saturday. “The vaccine stock available for the government sites can be used till mid-2022 and there is no issue about its expiry,” said a senior health department official. The opening stock available with the state on January 1 was 1.8 crore doses. Of them, 1.4 crore were Covishield doses with an expiry date of August-September. The Covaxin stock is of 40 lakh doses with October expiry date. The vaccines’ expiry date is a concern for many private hospitals, though. “Several private hospitals have said their vaccine stock will expire soon. But there is no policy from the Centre to take over their stock and use it at government sites,” said the senior health official. The Centre instructed the state government to direct all private hospitals that vaccines should not be utilised beyond the expiry date mentioned on the label of each vial. The Maharashtra government has informed the private health facilities about it. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, IMA, Pune, told TOI that many private hospital vaccination sites were left with pending vaccine stocks, which would expire within two months. “The Centre should devise a policy, whereby these vaccines can be utilised at government sites or exchanged among the private sites so that the vials are used before the expiry date. Two months ago, private sites had nearly four lakh stock that would expire in February. There should be a mechanism to utilise these doses and prevent wastage,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/aug-sept-expiry-date-of-vaccines-for-govt-sites/articleshow/88641129.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Maharashtra to boost monitoring of home isolation for mild Omicron cases||PUNE: The state health department on Saturday directed the local authorities to strengthen the home isolation module in the wake of rising Omicron cases — mostly mild and asymptomatic — in the state, stressing on the need to strengthen the monitoring of such patients. “Special teams may be constituted to monitor all home isolation cases. Call centres and control rooms must aid outbound calling for monitoring such patients, besides ensuring that they can be shifted to an appropriate health facility in dedicated ambulances in case of deterioration in their condition,” said an official of the state health department, after the Centre on Saturday said a large number of Covid positive patients might be eligible for home isolation. The Centre suggested that the states should monitor the home isolation protocols’ implementation at the field-level. Many states have rolled out home isolation modules with mild Omicron cases on the rise. The state Covid task force members stated that all local authorities should strictly implement the home isolation protocols with focus on any cluster outbreaks. They also stressed on special attention to Covid patients with comorbidities. Public health expert Dr Shashank Joshi said, “The cases are expected to rise, and we have to focus on three parameters — death, hospitalisation and oxygen requirement. As long as these parameters are under control, we only need to identify the vulnerable people whose condition may deteriorate.” He said, “The transition time to separate Delta and Omicron patients will be critical. The role of the S-deletion test will continue to be crucial. Those who have a common cold should connect with their doctors. Home management of patients will remain the key. Vigilance and caution should continue.” Another health expert said the transmission rate of Omicron was much higher than the Delta variant, but hospitalisation of patients infected with the new variant would be less compared to Delta infection. “Within weeks, Omicron will replace Delta in 80-90% of the patients. But the severity of the disease will be low, which will lessen the need for hospitalisation,” he said. “It is believed that the healthcare facilities won’t get overwhelmed despite the surge in Omicron cases as most of the patients are expected to have mild symptoms,” said a senior health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-to-augment-home-care-module-as-mild-cases-surge/articleshow/88641130.cms||Nisha Nambiar

In terms of the second dose coverage, Mumbai and Pune are at 85% and 76%, respectively. State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that efforts were on to reach out to these beneficiaries through SMS, phone calls or home visits by health workers to ensure that they did not miss out on the second dose. “There should be no delay in taking both the doses. We want to achieve a higher percentage of both the doses in all districts,” he said.Both, active and daily cases, have increased in the state this week. “Scaling up of vaccination has to be enforced in all districts. The adult vaccination programme should not receive any setback even as the new programme commences,” an official said.Despite growing evidence that the Omicron variant can cause breakthrough infections, experts believe that vaccination would be the single most-effective tool in curbing hospitalisation and deaths.Health expert Dr R Jotkar said vaccination was “very important”, and it had to be scaled up. “There should be no delay in the second dose. Vaccination reduces the severity and prevents deaths,” he said.Health officials said people were not turning up for vaccination. “Citizens seem to be in a vacation mood. Many are out of station and some are being lethargic,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/around-1cr-people-skipped-second-dose-health-dept/articleshow/88641131.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||6 more found infected with Omicron variant in Pune||PUNE: Random positive samples for Covid-19 sent for genomic sequencing from Pune district led to the detection of six cases of the Omicron variant in the state on Saturday. Of them, Pune rural accounted for three cases, while 2 were from Pimpri Chinchwad and one from the Pune municipal limits. With this, the state’s total Omicron case count has increased to 460, while 180 patients have been discharged. As many as 4,000 samples were sent from Pune and Mumbai from December 21-31 to ensure early detection of community outbreaks. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI that though cases have increased in the last 10 days, there has only been a marginal rise in hospitalisation. While Mumbai samples were sent to Kasturba Central laboratory, Pune’s PMC and PCMC samples were sent to BJ Medical college. The National Centre for Disease Control had directed the state to carry out community surveillance in the wake of increasing Covid cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/6-more-found-infected-with-omicron-variant/articleshow/88641133.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune on verge of Omicron community spread: Officials||PUNE: State public health officials on Saturday indicated that Pune was on the verge of Omicron’s community transmission after six of nearly 96 samples genome-sequenced from the district were detected with the new variant of Covid. “The remaining 90 samples had Delta and its sub-lineages,” an official told TOI. A health department bulletin issued on Saturday stated that the genome sequencing results were from the community surveillance exercise conducted by B J Medical College, Pune, to find the community transmission of Omicron in the city. A health department official said, “There are indications that community transmission of Omicron may have already started in Mumbai. Among the 96 community samples analysed from Pune, the presence of Delta and its sub-lineages is in a majority ofthem. Omicron was found in six. But these six cases did not have international travel history.” The official added, “The six cases with Omicron also did not have any contact with international travellers, a factor that points to the presence of the variant in the community. Nevertheless, the presence of Omicron in Pune does not seem to be at the same scale as Mumbai, from where a large number of samples have so far been detected with the variant.” The state public health department had a couple of days ago released details of 38 Omicron cases reported by IISER from its community surveillance exercise. As per preliminary information, all the 38 cases from the state did not have history of any international travel. As many as 19 cases, or a majority of the 38 infections, were from Mumbai, five from Kalyan Dombivali, three each from Navi Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad, two each from Vasai Virar and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and one each from Pune Rural, Bhiwandi Nizampur, Panvel and the Thane Municipal Corporation areas. This means that six of the 38 Omicron cases in the community surveillance exercise were found to be from Pune district. Another public health department official said, “If people are being detected Omicron positive among community samples in various civic areas, including Mumbai and Pune, then it indicates that the new variant’s transmission in the community may have begun.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-on-verge-of-omicron-community-spread-officials/articleshow/88641134.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune administration cancels bullock cart races amid Covid case rise||PUNE: The district administration has cancelled bullock cart races owing to the rising Covid cases. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh took the decision on Friday night and issued two separate orders for Nanoli village in Maval tehsil and Chinchwodi village in Ambegaon tehsil. The races were to be held in these villages for the first time after the Supreme Court ruling last month. “Hundreds of farmers had registered their names for the event. It would have been difficult for the organisers to manage social distancing and adhere to social distancing norms. Besides, Covid positive cases are rising since December 26. Considering these aspects, we had to cancel the races till further notice,” Deshmukh told TOI on Saturday. The decision did not go down well with organisers, villagers and enthusiasts of bullock cart races. Former MP Shivaji Adhalraon Patil, the key organiser of Chinchwadi village race, alleged that the decision was taken politically. “On Friday till 8 pm, officials from the district administration took all details of the arrangements and permitted us to go ahead with the race. However, around 11 pm, we were told to cancel the event. Why did the administration take the decision abruptly?” said former MP Adhalrao Patil. The villagers claimed that food stall vendors would incur huge financial loss because of the cancellation of the race. A Supreme Court bench recently allowed the resumption of bullock cart racing in Maharashtra, which was banned by the Bombay high court in 2017, as it observed that the tradition sport was going on in other states across the country. The bench’s remarks came after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the state, pointed out that the sport was allowed in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under similar laws passed by the respective state governments. The law was stalled by the Bombay high court in October 2017 on the basis of a 2014 Supreme Court judgment which prohibited the use of bulls for any sport or race.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/district-cancels-bullock-cart-races-amid-covid-case-rise/articleshow/88641135.cms||---

About four lakh visitors paid homage at the “Vijaystambh” (victory pillar), said the superintendent of police, Abhinav Deshmukh. “We had taken all security measures and installed cameras at the vantage points to cover the areas in and around the pillar to keep a watch on activities. There were no untoward incidents or movement at the site. Our personnel ensured people kept moving at the pillar site to prevent mass gathering. Eventually, we could move the crowd quickly from the site,” Deshmukh said. On Saturday afternoon, collector Deshmukh, who had numerous meetings with various agencies and departments in the last fortnight, took stock of the situation. The collector, along with other senior officials, even travelled in a PMPML bus on Saturday afternoon and interacted with fellow passengers to get their feedback on the arrangements at the village. Deshmukh said, “Considering the large gathering, we had made all possible arrangements at the site. We have received positive feedback from the people on it. We had paid extra attention to the parking for vehicles and transportation services from the parking areas to the pillar site. Also, we ensured to move out visitors from the place to prevent gathering.

The directorate of technical education recently declared the new teaching and examination scheme, the ‘J scheme’ for the new syllabus, which includes details about how the teachers should teach various topics to the students, how the examination structure is designed, credits for each course, among others. With increased focus on healthcare and allied fields because of Covid-19, educationists in the field hailed the much-needed change in the syllabus, which will focus on practicals, documentation, modern techniques, among others.Ramdas Zol, president of the Association of the Management of Unaided Institutes in Rural Areas, said that admissions to both diploma and degree courses in pharmacy have been increasing and the field would remain in demand for the next couple of years due to the world’s focus on healthcare. “Hence, we need the syllabus to be revised every four or five years because technology is changing every year and we need our students to be adept at the most modern techniques so that they are able to get jobs after completion of their course. As for diploma students, most of them work in medical stores and the new syllabus change has a lot of content on software and documentation, which is useful. The old syllabus did not have this,”said Zol.Atmaram Pawar, the principal of Poona College of Pharmacy, said that the new syllabus focused more on patient care. “We do not go to a doctor for everything, but get medicines from the local pharmacy. However, a pharmacist’s job is not just that of a retailer. The pharmacist must ask relevant questions to ensure the drugs prescribed or the drugs being given are not harmful to the patient and also explain the side effects. For example, many antacids that we drink without thought should not be taken when one has hypertension or high sodium levels. The pharmacist should inquire about the person’s medical history first. The new syllabus gives importance to patient care,” Pawar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pharma-course-syllabus-changes-after-30-years/articleshow/88641138.cms||Ardhra Nair

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “Mostly two-wheeler riders were found driving in an inebriated condition. We have prepared reports against them and have impounded their driving licences. The reports will be submitted before the court for further legal action against them.” “The 24 motorists were found driving in different parts of the city,” he said. The city traffic police used 22 calibrated breath analysers on people involved in drink-driving on New Year’s Eve. Shrirame said, “There was a strong police bandobast on city roads owing to Covid restrictions. Eateries, hotels, restaurants and bars did not operate beyond the 11pm deadline. These were the few reasons behind fewer people being caught on December 31 for driving under the influence of alcohol.” The deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, “Also, many people, who went to parties, hired cabs to return to their homes, instead of driving themselves.” Last year, owing to the spread of Covid infection, the city traffic police did not conduct a drive against drink-driving. “Generally, the city traffic police book between 800 and 900 people for drink-driving on New Year’s Eve in Pune city. This year, very few people defied the law,” Shrirame said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/24-motorists-booked-for-drunk-driving-on-new-years-eve-bars-stick-to-deadline/articleshow/88641141.cms||---

It is a challenge to shift and relocate them. Moreover, it leads to stress and anxiety among victims, and worse, loss of life and damage to property,” said Nandhini. “We gathered information about floods around the world in the last five years and analysed the damage caused to men and material,” she told TOI.The project offers a common solution with a one-time investment, said Manoj. “We have suggested prefabricated houses that stand on four pillars. The structures can be elevated using hydraulic screw jacks at the time of flood. This technique can also save cattle,” he said.Science teacher R Anand Kumar guided the duo. “They studied structure of houses in coastal Tamil Nadu and drew inspiration from flood-resistant houses in Kerala,” the teacher said.The state-level science exhibition concluded at the Forest College and Research Institute in Mettupalayam on December 29.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/students-house-raising-tech-to-survive-floods-goes-places/articleshow/88641143.cms||Sampath Kumar

It is their responsibility to ensure compliance to the guidelines,” a TNSTC official said.Buses were less crowded on Saturday as most of the educational institutions and commercial establishments were closed due to the New Year. “However, it would be a challenge to implement the restriction on Monday, when more people are expected to travel. We plan to deploy additional buses to meet the demand,” the official added.Shops, hotels and commercial establishments have also started to impose Covid restrictions. While a large number of people thronged restaurants and movie halls to celebrate the New Year, the establishments enforced 50% occupancy rule.“We received good crowds due to the festival season and the weekend, but operated with 50% capacity and strictly followed all the restrictions.

---||Goa||Goa may see 10,000 active Covid cases by mid-January: State epidemiologist||PANAJI: With Goa throwing all Covid precautions to the wind and failing to enforce Covid-19 norms for the New Year when it welcomed hordes of tourists, the small state is already in the midst of a third wave. By mid-January Goa could have between 5,000 to 10,000 active cases, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. On Sunday, active cases rose to 1,671 and case positivity rate shot up to an all-time high of 10.77%.  “The third wave has definitely begun. We’ve already seen a big rise over the last 6 days. The doubling rate is higher than that of the last wave. Until early last week, 60 new infections was a big number for us. Since then, there has been a 500% rise in daily infections with more than 300 cases being reported each day,” he said. Despite the huge spike in infections, hospitalisations haven’t begun to rise but that could change in the coming days. “We don’t know how big the peak will be or when it will come, but if we continue with this trend, we could see around 10,000 active cases in the next 15 days. Hospitalisations could increase when we have the full wave with maximum cases, and when people with comorbidities start getting affected. That’s why we need to take precautions right now,” Dr Betodkar said.  The prevalent variant continues to be Delta as only one sample of an international traveller has tested positive for Omicron after genome sequencing while other samples randomly tested via an indirect method in Goa have all tested negative for Omicron. Samples sent to the national centre for cell science (NCCS) Pune for genomesequencing also generally arrive weeks later.  Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida says Omicron has not taken a foothold in Goa yet. “This is a Delta wave. It takes a week after the first rise, before hospitalisations begin to increase,” she said. “The Delta variant already prevalent is showing a sudden rise in cases because of gatherings and that’s why they need to be stopped,” Dr Betodkar said. People must take precautions in the interest of protecting those with comorbidities as well as be responsible enough not to be part of spreading the infection. “Bigger gatherings especially those that have less of social distancing must be avoided,” he said. Majority of the cases are asymptomatic while the symptomatic are coming in with fever, cough, sore throat etc.  It is very important for children- 15-18 for whom vaccination begins on Monday, to get vaccinated, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-may-see-10000-active-cases-by-mid-jan-state-epidemiologist/articleshow/88654016.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The flood deprived them of the raw materials, including bamboo. It was out of this situation that the bamboo products company Fibrent was born. This initiative is now helping these women to regain their livelihood. The raw materials will be provided by the company and the profit is also given to the women. The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has now provided an opportunity for them to exhibit and sell their products which were made by around 50 women. The exhibition is being held at Putharikandam ground. The expo aims at educating people about the harmful effects of plastic and introducing plastic alternative products. The plastic alternative products, including paper bags, cloth bags, paper pen, paper straw, terracotta products, plates and other kitchen utensils made with areca leaf are being exhibited here at the expo. The value-added products of plastics like plant pots are also for sale. The expo started on Friday and will end on January 2. There are a total of 43 stalls. At the expo the team ´Orma Eco-bricks´ is also featuring their innovative product that is a solution to manage the contamination of nature by the plastic waste. The team members said that eco bricks can be made by putting plastic bags and other plastic covers tightly inside the bottle. This can be used as a basement for constructions at home and public places. Through this waste materials can be converted into a valuable materia, they said. “When we asked the small retailers to switch to alternative products, they were not even aware of the products.

School education department will rely on the recently-launched Illam Thedi Kalvi scheme to bridge the learning gap among students of Classes I to VIII.Even though online classes were yielding limited results, students in the lower classes were kept engaged in academic activity until offline classes resumed in November. This was unlike in the government schools where students had to rely on textbooks and Kalvi Tholaikatchi scheme.Students in lower classes in government schools are facing serious learning gaps. For instance, a child who was in Class 1 in 2019-20 is now in Class III after half of the class I and the entire Class II spent at home due to the lockdown. “But the last two months have been useful for teachers to forge a bond with the students, thanks to offline classes,” said a government schoolteacher from Ukkadam.Many students could not recognise their teachers when offline classes resumed in November. “But the gap has been filled. This is likely to help us in the coming days even if there are no offline classes. But only offline classes can help government school students to learn effectively,” said the teacher.Chief education officer N Geetha said that the department is relying on the Illam Thedi Kalvi programme for government school students to keep track of academic activity. While selection of volunteers for the scheme is in the final stage in many places, it will be streamlined in the coming weeks.President of Tamil Nadu Private School Association R Visalakshi said it would be too early to predict prolonged lockdown as restrictions are announced only till January 10. “We need to wait at least till the end of January. We can resume classes if Omicron subsides and even otherwise, we can restart online classes to keep track of academic activity for students in the lower classes,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pvt-schools-may-switch-back-to-online-classes/articleshow/88641148.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Balangir cop steals goat for grand feast on New Year Eve, suspended||BHUBANESWAR: Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Suman Mallick had hoped for a grand feast on Friday midnight to welcome New Year’s day. He wanted mutton to be part of the menu. But instead of buying it from the market, he decided to grab a goat straying near the police station at Sindhekela in Balangir district. What he didn’t bargain for is getting seen stealing one and subsequently getting suspended by an embarassed district police brass. Superintendent of police (Balangir) Nitin Kusalkar said ASI Mallick has been placed under suspension for misbehaving with the owner of the goat and stealing one for a feast. “Based on an internal investigation, we suspended the ASI. Our investigation found that the ASI stole the goat, slaughtered it and ate the meat. No other police personnel was involved in the act,” Kusalkar said. He said the owner of the goat, Sankirtan Guru, hasn’t lodged a written complaint so far against Mallick. “Law will take its own course once the goat owner lodges a complain against him. Then, the policeman will be booked for theft,” the SP added. SDPO S N Satapathy said Guru’s daughter saw Mallick steal the goat on Friday afternoon and informed his father. “The villagers claimed they saw the ASI slaughtering the goat,” Satapathy said. Sources said on learning that the goat had been slaughtered, the owner took the help of villagers to lodge protest. The villagers then led seige to the police station, resulting in Mallick’s suspension. “After we entered the police station, we saw bloodstains and some meat in the backyard, where the ASI’s quarter is located,” Guru said, adding that Mallick had managed to escape fearing reprisal from the villagers. Guru is a small farmer who rears goats to supplement his income. He told the police he could have got Rs 12,000 by selling the goat and Mallick’s action robbed him of that chance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/balangir-cop-steals-goat-for-grand-feast-on-new-year-eve-suspended/articleshow/88641152.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

This 142-km project will connect Nrusinghanath temple and other important places of Bargarh district. The Odisha Rail Infrastructure Development Limited (ORIDL), a joint venture company of the Odisha government (51%), and the ministry of railways (49%), had requested the Indian Railways to process the project’s proposal. The Railway Board, in a letter to ORIDL issued on Friday, said, “The proposal of ORIDL has been examined by the ministry of railways and the competent authority has accorded in-principle approval for taking up pre-investment activities for this project.” The Board has also said the cost of land must be borne fully by the state government and the project’s execution should not commence without financial closure.On July 30 last year, Union railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had told the Rajya Sabha that the survey for a new line between Bargarh Road and Nawapara Road via Padampur was completed in 2018-19. The project was operationally unjustified, as such, it could not be taken forward, read the reply.However, ORIDL had identified the project for development. The Odisha government had given their consent to bear the cost of land. The minister had told the Upper house that the proposal was taken up for examination. “At present, there is no rail connectivity to Nrusinghanath temple. If this project sees the light of the day, it can cover the tourist place while connecting Bargarh to Nuapada. After the rail communication is launched, this place will get more tourists and devotees,” said a local.People from Bargarh can save more than two hours if they travel to Raipur via Nuapada. They can save time while travelling to Bhubaneswar as well. Some places like Bijepur, Padampur, Gaisilet and Paikmal will also get rail connectivity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bargarh-nuapada-rail-link-plan-gets-in-principle-nod/articleshow/88641157.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

The groups have stated that it turned out to be another jumla of this government, just like the promise of depositing Rs 15 lakh in every account. To protest against false promises, the farmers have now decided to burn effigies across villages from January 2 at DC and SDM offices. The decisions were taken during a BKU Ekta Sidhupur emergency meeting.Farm group BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said that the promise of doubling farmer income by 2022 has proved to be hollow. “This government is not serious for farmers and if it is for welfare of farmers, the government should give legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) on all crops to all farmers. We will protest against Narendra Modi in villages and on January 5,” said an activist. Farmer group BKU Ekta Sidhupur president Jagjit Singh Dallewal said that in the meeting, the group has decided to burn effigies in villages on January 2 and from 12 noon to 2pm at DC, SDM offices across Punjab because at this time Modi will be in Punjab.BKU Ekta Dakaunda general secretary Jagmohan Singh said that farmers even earlier were not beleiving in the promise as the MSP is not being fixed as per C2+50% formula but on A2+50% formula with which the farmer income could not be enhanced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/promise-to-double-income-just-a-jumla-ugrahan/articleshow/88641166.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Three held on theft charges||Thiruvananthapuram: Kazhakootam police have arrested three men on charges of stealing construction materials from the work site of the Kazhakootam elevated highway. The police identified the accused as Pradeep, 39, of Alamcode near Kariavattom, Maniyan alias Njandu Maniyan, 42, of Kalpana Ward near Menamkulam and Subair alias Kundru, 44, of Vadakkumbhagam near Kazhakootam. Their arrests were recorded on Friday. The police said that the alleged crime occurred on Tuesday afternoon. The three men allegedly stole around 70 kilograms of iron brackets that are used for concreting works from the work site. The iron brackets were piled between the pillars that are part of the elevated highway opposite to the Kazhakootam police station. The police registered a case after the construction company officials noticed that the materials were missing. The suspects were identified after examining surveillance camera footage. Kazhakootam station house officer inspector J S Praveen said that among the accused, Maniyan and Subair were involved in similar crimes in the past and hence it was easy to identify them. They are suspected to have stolen more materials from the construction site in the past too. They had sold off the iron brackets at a scrap shop and used the money to purchase liquor, the inspector said. It is not the first time construction materials are being stolen from the work site of the elevated highway. A few weeks ago, the police had arrested a father-son duo hailing from Varkala on charges of stealing large amounts of iron construction materials from the same work site in a pickup van.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/three-held-on-theft-charges/articleshow/88639330.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Resignation of BJP’s Manjinder Singh Sirsa ‘accepted’ after withdrawal||JALANDHAR: A day after BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa withdrew his resignation from the post of president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, executive of the DSGMC called by general secretary Harmeet Singh Kalka “accepted” his resignation and gave the charge of working to junior president Kulwant Singh Baath. But Sirsa held a separate meeting of the executive and read out the clarifications sought from the director of gurdwara elections, Government of Delhi, which stated that the resignation could not be accepted after withdrawal. It has also become clear that since December 1 that Sirsa has been acting as president despite his resignation. Both he and Kalka have accepted that Sirsa was in fact signing papers as president. Sirsa had sent his resignation a couple of hours before joining BJP, to everybody’s shock in political circles. He remained Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s pointsman in Delhi and his switching sides was the first major shock given by BJP to the Badals. Parallel meetings were held – one in the conference hall of the DSGMC by Sirsa and another in the general secretary’s office. Kalka had called a meeting of the executive on December 29 and on Sirsa withdrew his resignation on December 31. While nine of the 13 members participated in a meeting held in the general secretary’s office, three members joined Sirsa in DSGMC’s conference hall. The executive meeting called by Kala “accepted” Sirsa’s resignation and authorised junior vice-president Kulwant Singh Baath to act as DSGMC president. The executive also passed a resolution condemning that action of Sirsa to call off the meeting “misusing” the DSGMC letterhead. It also formed a three-member committee to inquire into the “scam” of running a computer land, gymnasium, and a shooting range in Guru Hargobind Institute without any approval of the DSGMC. Kalka said that the executive had sent Sirsa’s resignation to the general house for ‘accepting’ it. Both the Kalka-led executive members and Sirsa separately addressed press conferences in which they made claims and counterclaims. Sirsa said he had been acting as president to ensure that the working of the DSGMC did not face hiccups. Reading out the clarifications sought from the director, gurdwara elections, he said that his resignation could be accepted only by the general house and not by the executive. “I am neither interested in running the DSGMC affairs nor would become its member and my only purpose of withdrawing the resignation is to ensure that as it was not accepted there should not be any problem in smooth functioning of the working of the routine affairs and especially the financial matters,” he said. “If there was no problem in me working as president till December 31 then what’s the problem on January 1,” he said. “When Kalka came to the meeting room I showed him the clarifications received from the director, gurdwara elections, and asked what should be done but he left the room,” he said. Kalka said that they were sending papers to Sirsa but either he was delaying signing these or were returning these. “That is why we have taken the decision to accept his resignation. He tried to pre-empt acceptance by withdrawing his resignation,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/resignation-of-bjps-sirsa-accepted-after-withdrawal/articleshow/88641170.cms||IP Singh

Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, man in charge of the BJP’s Punjab election campaign, claimed this on Saturday.Addressing various state BJP cells in Jalandhar, Shekhawat said that Punjab, which used to be a model of prosperity with a good gross domestic product (GDP) rating not long ago, today was identified with debt and drugs. He claimed that job avenues for the youth had "dried out" and the public was "disenchanted with the political parties because of rising corruption and sagging economy". To build up public enthusiasm for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming rally in Ferozepur on January 5, Shekhawat said the PM had a special bond with Punjab and the state should trust him to work out a roadmap for rejuvenating its economy. State BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma and all-cell co-incharge Rakesh Sharma were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-hopes-to-win-pb-revive-states-economy-shekhawat/articleshow/88641176.cms||---

Let the parliamentary board sit and take a decision on the issue,” he said when asked by journalists during an interaction here on Saturday.Asked that party’s national general secretary Tarun Chugh had made this announcement, Shekhawat these could be just personal sentiments of a leader.On December 28, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma had also sought to underplay earlier announcements by party leaders as expression of their “sentiments”. “orkers express sentiments and wishes but final decision in our party is taken by the parliamentary board, he had said after being confronted that it was not an expression of sentiments but an announcement by responsible party leaders.Chugh had announced that BJP would have Dalit CM in Punjab on April 14, a few hours after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced in Jalandhar that if voted to power the SAD-BSP alliance government would have a Scheduled Caste chief minister.

---||Chandigarh||Have always been ready to work with Navjot Singh Sidhu saab, says Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Saturday said he had always been willing to work in coordination with party’s state president Navjot Singh Sidhu even as he was trying to discharge the task (as CM) assigned to him by the party leadership. As he listed the achievements of 100 days of his government at a press meet, Channi faced a volley of questions about his alleged differences with Sidhu, but tried to avoid making any direct remarks. He, however, said the cable rate issue could not be resolved even though Sidhu himself remained a minister for two years and also rejected Sidhu’s charge of not handling the case against SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia properly. To a question about Sidhu’s tirade against his own party’s government, Channi said, “I am a loyal soldier of the party. I am delivering on the duty assigned to me with all my sincerity. Meanwhile, I am ready to work with Sidhu, and am already doing it. The party has to uplift the state government. I am always ready to make any sacrifice for the party. I will go by whatever the party tells me. But today we should focus on the 100 days of the government.” When prodded further, Channi said, “Kannu, rehan do, hor koi gal karo (Why? Leave it. Talk about something else).” He also tried to reply with a couplet, “Aate Aate aayega dil ko karar, jaate jaate bekrari jaayegi… Don’t worry, we will resolve all issues.” Channi, however, sought to rebut Sidhu’s charge about the way the case against SAD leader Majithia was handled. He said, “There is a procedure to catch someone accused of a crime. It begins with a police case and even that has been done on court directions in this case. The entire STF report has been included in the FIR and it is being acted upon. The AAP said a weak case will be built but that being the case it would not have stood legal scrutiny in the lower court.” Asked about Sidhu questioning the announcements made by the state government on reduced cable rates, sand prices and sacrilege, Channi said, “We haven’t yet solved the issue of cable rates in the state. Sidhu had got a law made about it, but it was not up to the mark. He too remained a minister for two years. I had said the cable rate should be Rs 100, but they (operators) met me demanding that the rate be fixed at Rs 150. We are giving it a thought to bring a proper law. It falls under the ambit of the Centre.” He added, “As far as sand prices are concerned, it is now being sold at the reduced price of Rs 5.5. The Kapurthala sacrilege case was solved in 48 hours and an arrest was made. About the incident at Golden Temple, SGPC is involved and they wanted to form their own panel to probe. But we won’t run away from our responsibility and we are working with the Centre. Since religious sentiments are involved, we want to go by what the SGPC says.” To a question if the open criticism of the state government by Sidhu could hurt the Congress’ poll prospects, Channi said, “I always welcome criticism. It may come from anyone, even my brother tries to find faults.” Channi skipped a question about the CM face of the party and Sidhu obliquely positioning himself for it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/have-always-been-ready-to-work-with-sidhu-saab-cm/articleshow/88641179.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Leader of opposition, Bhupinder Hooda too demanded adequate compensation for those dead and an indepth probe into the circumstances that led to the incident.Dharamvir Singh, MP from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh parliamentary constituency, got the area videographed while alleging that around 800 to 900 feet deep gorge has been caused due to illegal extraction. So deep is the extraction that even water started coming. This matter is pending in NGT and a team from NGT has also visited the spot here a fortnight ago,” said Dharamvir.According to him, this is one of the five or more such points where the base for standing of a rock is very narrow. “Given that, such incident was imminent. Those involved had deployed persons and henchmen to ensure that the outsiders do not enter here. However, now, I will talk to the CM and will ensure that everybody involved is not spared,” added dharamvir.Similarly, Choudhary reminded the government about the issue being raised by her at various platforms. “Our requests, representations as well complaints lodged by locals, have gone unheard in the administration, hence this result. Now, we demand compensation for those dead and injured and action against guiilty,” said Choudhary.Hooda termed it as yet another scam that has been unearthed on the first day of the year. “The working of government should be questioned. This is a major scam and demands a CBI probe as well compensation for those dead,” added Hooda.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cong-leaders-seek-probe-into-tragedy/articleshow/88641181.cms||Manvir Saini

He said Kejriwal’s Delhi health model was a complete failure during the first and second wave of Covid, as thousands of people ran from Delhi to Punjab for treatment at the time. “Now Kejriwal is making such fake promises of Delhi health and education models in Punjab, but the people of Punjab are much aware of his theatrics. A person who cannot even handle a city like state properly, how can he run a complete state?” Earlier, he paid obeisance at Gurudwara Sri Qatalgarh Sahib on the occasion of New Year and prayed for Sarbat Da Bhala (welfare of all).

---||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet okays quality control wing for soil & water conservation department||CHANDIGARH: For accurate planning, design, and estimation, besides transparent and accountable implementation of public works, the Punjab cabinet on Saturday approved adding a design and quality control wing to the soil and water conservation department. The decision came at the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. An official spokesperson has said the wing that will come up at the department’s headquarters won’t cost anything extra but rather help save public money due to better planning. It will help small and marginal farmers in availing benefit schemes. The soil and water conservation department lays underground pipelines, installs drip and sprinkler systems for irrigation-water-use efficiency, builds water harvesting structures, and constructs rooftop rainwater harvesting systems and check dams for groundwater recharge. All this work requires proper designing and estimation to save cost. The cabinet also decided to set up a micro irrigation (MI) special purpose vehicle (SPV) in the department for promoting intelligent irrigation systems. The government will nominate an expert to head this SPV and set up the requisite organisational structure. Punjab has been implementing a micro irrigation programme for the past over 15 years. Despite providing farmer with up to 90% subsidy on these systems, the adoption is far from satisfactory. The coverage is limited to just 1.2% of the area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cabinet-okays-quality-control-wing-for-soil-water-conservation-dept/articleshow/88641185.cms||---

As per the record of the National Green Tribunal, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had submitted a report to NGT about the illegalities highlighted by a joint committee of the Bhiwani district administration at the Dadam mining site. An examination of the report revealed that after visiting the site on October 6, 2020, the joint committee had opined that ways in the forest area were created illegally without having any valid permission. The mining equipment/ machines were found standing in the non-minable forest area. The 'Dadam Hills Minor' is a protected forest area under the Forest Act and the same was found illegally mined. The mining is done at the site about 200 feet deep but in the progressive closure plan, the depth was shown to be up to 42 metres... The mining is not done in a scientific manner," said the committee's report. During the inspection, the concerned mining officer stated that the mining project has given dimensions of the mining pit as per the approved plan - Length 536 metres, depth 78 metres (from ground level) - but no record was provided at the site during the inspection in this regard. The concerned assistant geologist (water cell) reported that no borewell was found in the lease mining area. "The project is meeting water requirements for plantation, dust suppression and domestic purposes etc through tankers from outside the mining area and also using the water stored within mining pits and water stored in pits cannot be identified at spot whether it is groundwater or rainwater," the report had stated. Even the HSPCB had issued a show-cause notice for closure of the mining under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 was to M/s Govardhan Mines and Mineral, village Dadam, Bhiwani vide letter No 2633 dated October 8, 2020. The joint inspection team comprised of a representative of the Bhiwani district magistrate, Bhiwani mining officer, assistant geologist, groundwater cells, Bhiwani; divisional forest officer Bhiwani, regional officer HSPCB Bhiwani and SDO Nigana water service, sub-division Bhiwani. Later, the Bhiwani regional officer vide letter No 5235 dated November 6, 2020, recommended closure action against the said unit under Section 5 of the EP Act, 1986 to the competent authority. However, after receiving representation from M/s Govardhan Mines and Minerals, another inspection was undertaken on December 28, 2020, by the joint committee and it was found that past violations were required to be remedied but currently, there are no serious violations. An examination of the record also revealed that the subsequent reports on the issue had held the mining allotted to M/s Govardhan Mines and Mineral in order and legal and it was suggested that the alleged illegalities were conducted during the period of the previous allottee, M/s Sunder Marketing. The matter had reached before the NGT in the wake of several applications filed against the alleged illegal mining in forest area by M/s Govardhan Mines and Minerals at Dadam hills, Tosham, Bhiwani district. The applicants had relied upon FIR, complaints and letters in support of the allegation against the illegal and unscientific mining in the Dadam area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/dadam-mining-called-unscientific-by-panel/articleshow/88641188.cms||Ajay Sura

After Mansa district youth Congress president Chuspinder Singh Chahal’s followers disrupted Moosewala’s rally attended by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Mansa on December 11, now Congress leader late Sher Singh Gagowal’s family has staked claim over the party ticket by holding a rally in Mansa on Friday. A large number of Mansa residents attended the rally which had pictures of Gagowal family members presenting themselves as aspirants of party ticket. Gagowal won from Mansa on a Congress ticket in 1992. He then won as an independent candidate in 2002, after Congress had left the seat for ally CPI. In 2007 again, he won on a Congress ticket. In 2012, his daughter-in-law Gurpreet Kaur was given the Congress ticket, but she lost by 1,305 votes to the Akali candidate. Gurpreet Kaur’s son Arshdeep Singh, who is a zila parishad member and Youth Congress general secretary, said since 1972, it had been only his family which had won on a Congress ticket from Mansa, from where CPI or SAD leaders had been winning otherwise. “The popularity of the family could be gauged from the fact that my grandfather even won as an independent candidate when the party had left the seat to CPI in 2002. Now we want the party ticket to be given to the family,” he said. However, sources said the party wanted to use the services of Sidhu Moosewala not only in Mansa, but in other assembly segments too to cash in on his popularity, especially among youth. Party insiders said fielding Moosewala could be favourable for the party, but local leaders differed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/like-moosewala-ex-mlas-kin-eye-congs-mansa-ticket/articleshow/88641190.cms||Neel Kamal

He said NDA’s victories in all the seven NE states from 2016 to 2019 was not a one-off performance and that the same governments will be retained in the six states where elections are lined up till 2024, starting with Manipur, which will be followed by elections in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura together in early 2023 and Mizoram towards the end of the same year. Arunachal Pradesh will go to the polls together with the Lok Sabha election in 2024. “My own assessment is that after five successive years, all the governments in all the NE states will be retained. This is the second BJP government in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. In Manipur, we are going to form a government on our own this time. Last time, it was a big coalition but this time I am confident that there will be a proper BJP government in Manipur,” Sarma said. He added, “In Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya also we will see a stronger NDA and stronger BJP after the next elections in the states. In Tripura, too, we are going to repeat,” Sarma said. “Finally, it will be established that wining the northeast was not one of those occasions. BJP has come to stay here in northeast and it will be proved after these series of elections,” he added. “The BJP will form the next government in Manipur, which goes to polls in March, on its own, hinting at disintegration of the current alliance. He said BJP is here to stay in NE and stronger and NDA will retain all the six states where elections are lined up till 2024 with a stronger BJP The BJP formed its first government in the northeast in Arunachal Pradesh in 2003 but that was through a mass defection led by Gegong Apang. The saffron party’s first elected government was in 2016 in Assam through a coalition in which Sarma played the most important role. He then stitched a coalition of five parties in Manipur to form the first government in 2017 followed by similar feats in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. “Political history was created in Assam last year when the BJP-led coalition became the only non-Congress government to retain power for the second consecutive term in the state,” he said. He added that the BJP’s rise to power in Assam has kept Ajmal in abeyance. “If the BJP hadn’t formed the government in Assam, Ajmal saab would have been the chief minister. But in 30 years’ time, we could be heading towards that,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/bjp-will-form-govt-on-its-own-in-manipur-to-stay-put-in-ne-cm/articleshow/88641192.cms||Prabin Kalita

Preliminary reports suggested that over-exploitation of the mine beyond permissible limit coupled with climatic conditions led to the earth caving in. The state government called in the Army from Hisar Cantt and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team from Noida for conducting the rescue operation. The administration had pressed into service earthmovers, cranes and other equipment to remove the debris. "Our main aim is to rescue people who have been buried under the debris. It is difficult to say how many people are trapped. Some deaths could be confirmed as the local villagers had conducted rescue operations. Let the rescue and relief operations be over first,’’ said P K Das, additional chief secretary, revenue and disaster management. Unconfirmed reports give the time of the landslide at 1pm. It occurred within hours of the mining contractor carrying out an explosion on the hill. Men and machines were at work and the vehicles had lined up to load the mining material, when the landslide occurred. DC Dr R S Dhillon and SP Ajit Singh, agriculture and farmers' welfare minister Jai Parkash Dalal visited the spot. Three of the dead mining workers have been identified as Sanjay from Jind, Vijender from Tosham and Tufan Singh from Jharkhand. According to sources, several people were travelling to another site when the landslide occurred and they got trapped in their vehicles. Expressing shock over the incident, BJP Bhiwani MP Dharambir Singh said that the excavation was being conducted at a depth of 500-700 feet in forest land or area of Aravali range. He alleged that the contractor of the mining zone did not permit the entry of outsiders and even officials on duty were never permitted access to the mining zone. He said he would speak to the chief minister for conducting a thorough probe into the incident to expose the guilty. On being asked about the ban at the mining site, he said there were complaints against the contractor. "If the complaints were looked into on time, the tragedy could have been averted," he added. He said that those behind today's incident would be brought to book. Haryana agriculture minister, who is the MLA from Loharu in Bhiwani, said that a few people had lost their lives and three people were taken to a hospital. "According to the mining contractor, there could be more people trapped underneath," he said. Expressing grief over the deaths, Haryana home minister Anil Vij tweeted that four people had died. Haryana's former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda blamed the state government for the occurrence during a press conference in Rohtak. Demanding a judicial probe into the accident, Hooda, who is also Leader of Opposition, said "Even the Supreme Court has made a serious comment on this matter and illegal mining is being done in this area by flouting all the rules, but the government is not conducting a fair investigation. The opposition demands that there should be a judicial inquiry into the entire scam". Flagging the mining activitiy, Tosham MLA from Congress party Kiran Choudhry said these were banned in the area after a National Green Tribunal order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/landslide-at-hry-mining-site-4-dead-several-trapped/articleshow/88641193.cms||Sat Singh

The ship, Cordelia Cruises’ Empress, had come from Mumbai. “After testing passengers for Covid-19, some tested positive,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane. “We have not allowed them to dock the ship. They have a tie-up with a private hospital for Covid testing, and we’ve told them to test all passengers for Covid-19 before they leave the ship.” However, MPT and health officials said that only one crew member (and no passengers) tested positive via an antigen test while the ship was still on its way to Goa, with 2,017 passengers aboard. The antigen result has to be confirmed via an RT-PCR test. Pathologist Dr Eugene D’Souza, a consultant at Victor Hospital which is doing the tests, said the RT-PCR testing of all passengers started at 9.30pm. Till 11.30pm, about 500 samples were collected and results of first batch were expected by 1am. "Testing will continue throughout the night. We will complete all tests within next six-eight hours," D'Souza told TOI. As per safety protocol, the vessel informed MPT and the health department, after which the district collector’s office and the state authorities were informed. Earlier in the day, Guruprasad Rai, deputy chairman of MPT said that they will follow all the instruction issues by the state and central governments on Covid protocol. “As per the instruction all the passengers will go for covid test and after the results they will be allowed to get down the ship,” Rai said. “We have allowed the ship to berth, but everyone will be tested before they disembark. All the passengers are double-vaccinated. The ship doctor had tested a crew member who had a fever for a day. The vessel was kept outside the port limits while the authorities were informed,” an MPT official said. The collector gave permission for the vessel to berth at MPT after all safety measures were put in place. A team of healthcare professionals will board the vessel and conduct RT-PCR tests on all passengers, and only once the results are obtained will the passengers be allowed to leave, MPT said, adding that the crew member who tested positive would be taken off the ship and to a private hospital for treatment. Rane said that every day, international flights land in Goa with 4,000 passengers, and that every flight has Covid positive cases. “We have to be strict to control Covid spread,” he said. The cruise vessel was to disembark some passengers for a day tour in Goa.

Police registered 287 cases of drunk driving on New Year’s eve in 2020 and 236 cases in 2019. There were no cases of drunk driving in 2021 New Year’s eve.  ADCP (traffic) Ch Adinarayana said a total of 93 drunken driving cases were reported under Zone-II of Vizag police commissionerate and 41 under Zone-I.

Compared to the previous years, the number of drunk driving cases was low in 2022 New Year’s eve,” the police added. Except one major fatal accident due to rash and negligent driving near Arilova in which three youngsters were killed and one suffered injury, the strict enforcement by the city traffic police resulted in fewer number of road accidents on New Year. Police said very few non-fatal accidents were reported during the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. Apart from drunken driving, police have also booked cases against 1,820 motorists for not wearing a helmet, 9 for dangerous driving, and seized 104 driving licences for various traffic violations. “We didn’t let drunk motorists get away as our teams with advanced breath analyzers changed locations of checkpoints from 9 pm on December 31 to 4 am on January 1. Most of the motorists who were caught for drunk driving were youngsters. Meanwhile, winter chill and the New Year festivities have been pushing liquor sale in city in the past few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/134-drunk-drivers-booked-in-new-year-drives/articleshow/88638864.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Three held for attacking policemen||Thiruvananthapuram: Three men who tried to attack a police team emulating the Kizhakkambalam incident were arrested by Kollam East police on Saturday. The incident happened on Friday night at Polayathode under Kollam East police station limits while the police team were trying to enforce the curfew. Rajendran, 40, Kishore, 25, and Ashraf, 22, are the accused who have been arrested. All three men are residents of National Nagar at Polayathode. They allegedly smashed the windshield of the police vehicle using stones and even tried to attack the officers. The police have booked them under relevant sections of causing riot, destroying public property and attacking government officials. Kollam East sub inspector Ratheesh Kumar, who led the team that faced the attack, said that they were attacked when the officers tried to disperse the men who were consuming liquor and partying near a public road well after the curfew hours began. The key accused Rajendran was earlier arrested on charges of ganja peddling. ''While charging at us, they were shouting that if Bengalis can do it, so could they,'' the sub inspector said, adding that it clearly showed that they were inspired by the Kizhakkambalam incident. The police team however, managed to overpower and apprehend three of the assailants. Their arrests were recorded by station house officer inspector R Ratheesh. The SI added that there are two more men to be arrested in connection with the case as they managed to flee after the incident. Besides sub inspector Ratheesh Kumar, the officers who were part of the team are sub inspectors (grade) Jayalal and Pramod and civil police officers Anu, Sanoj, Shafeeq, Sajeev and Ramesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/three-held-for-attacking-policemen/articleshow/88639341.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Daily Covid-19 infections double in a week in Assam||GUWAHATI: The daily Covid cases in Assam have nearly doubled in a week amid the Omicron threat. A total of 192 cases were reported in the state on Friday night compared to 100 infections detected last week. Senior officials of the state health department are keeping their fingers crossed, though they are yet to ascertain whether there will be a surge in cases. However, considering the upward spike in cases across the country and the experience of the two waves of the pandemic, they are apprehensive that the trend in Assam is suspicious. Out of the 192 cases, 105 cases were detected in Kamrup (Metro) district that covers the city areas. The positivity rate too has gone up from Thursday’s 0.38% to 0.77% on Friday night, while no Covid deaths were reported. Even as the daily case number on Saturday has marginally declined to 150 in the state, the positivity rate remained unchanged at 0.77%. “We are keeping our fingers crossed. In the next five to 10 days, the number of Covid cases in the state could increase, if the virus has spread during New Year celebrations. By viewing only Friday’s data, one cannot come to a conclusion that the daily rise in cases is due to celebrations,” a senior health department official told TOI on Saturday. On December 24, the total cases in the state dropped to 93 and the positivity rate dropped as low as 0.33% from 28,111 tests. The city also heaved a sigh of relief as the total cases in Kamrup (Metro) plummeted to 47. A top official of the health department claimed that a “small spike” occurred on December 31. Nevertheless, he said that the health authorities are on high alert. “In case of a persistent rise in number of cases, strict measures will be initiated with the approval of appropriate authorities,” he said. The night curfew timings have been revised by the state government from last Sunday from 11.30 pm to 6 am instead of the previous 11 pm to 5 am. The night curfew was, however, not applicable on December 31 night as the government allowed relaxations to allow people to welcome the New Year. On Saturday, there was great fanfare and festive mood at the amusement centres, parks, state zoo, temples and the book fair in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/daily-covid-19-infections-double-in-a-week-in-state/articleshow/88641195.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||Guwahati||Tribal militancy over in Assam, pragmatic call on AFSPA in March, says CM Himanta Biswa Sarma||GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said the state will take a “pragmatic decision” on AFSPA when it comes up for renewal in March. He added that tribal militancy in the state is over and the “beginning of end” of conflict with Ulfa (I) has become visible. The CM said though Ulfa’s (I) sovereignty demand is still a stumbling block, the government and the outfit are working together to find a way around it. “It is a very complicated situation. Paresh Baruah has been in the jungles since 1982 and the Assam Police has been on the warpath since then. But I dare to say that we are seeing the beginning of an end,” Sarma added. “Before resolving such a complicated issue, we need to go slow. But I think the beginning of an end to reach a peaceful solution can been seen. I cannot say a definite time frame (for arriving at a solution) but the present positioning should not reverse. I think hostile situation will not be there in Assam. We are seeing the beginning of peace but I cannot say right now when it will be here,” he said. “From personal interactions with various people who are directly or indirectly in touch with Paresh Baruah, it is clear that he is very positive and wants a negotiated settlement and so does the Centre and the state government. But the only stumbling block is its demand for sovereignty. We are working towards creating a new position where both parties actually do not find it very difficult to talk,” Sarma added. Tribal insurgency has come to an end and only Ulfa (I) remains. If you exclude them (Ulfa-I), every other militant organization has deposited their weapons," he said. He added that the curtains have come down on militancy in the tribal lands in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao districts and the Bodo territory. Sarma lauded the tribal civil societies and student bodies in playing the most important roles in convincing the militants to join the mainstream. He said, "Regarding AFSPA, finally Assam will see rationalization of it in 2022. The Army has virtually withdrawn from Assam, barring just five to six districts. It is a dynamic situation. After three months when AFSPA is up for renewal, then Assam will take some pragmatic decision in consultation with the MHA." The Act, which was last extended in September for six months, was first imposed in Assam in 1990 by the MHA. But in 2017, the power to extend or withdraw was transferred to the state government. He added that in Nagalnd, too, there will be certain positive developments regarding AFSPA. On Nagaland, the approach of PM and home minister is very positive. The formation of the committee with a deadline of 45 days on AFSPA in Nagaland is a very important step which the Centre has taken. With that there will lot of confidence and will help in addressing other issues also, he said. Appreciating Ulfa (I)'s unilateral ceasefire, Sarma said, "If you look very closely, even the government has shown positive inclination towards this ceasefire. There has been no direct conflict with them in the last eight months. Though, being a constitutional government, we have to act against extortions and recruitments to protect life and liberty of people."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/tribal-militancy-over-in-assam-pragmatic-call-on-afspa-in-mar/articleshow/88641201.cms||Prabin Kalita

People mostly celebrated the day at their houses with their family members and some close friends. “For several years, we enjoyed a New Year picnic at the Sekmai river in Imphal, but today we celebrated at home with our family members. Health is more precious than outdoor gaiety,” said Brojen Singh, an Imphal resident. On December 27, the first Omicron case in the Northeast was detected in Imphal in a returnee from Tanzania. Hailing from Imphal West district, the patient is now lodged in a isolation facility at JNIMS Hospital here. After finding that the patient had allegedly flouted the home isolation guidelines before testing positive for Omicron, and had visited different places in Imphal, the state health department has taken up active surveillance and necessary steps to combat the possible spread of the variant. The surveillance team has already traced all primary and secondary contacts of the patient and testing has been conducted. As part of its measures to combat the spread of Covid-19, the state home department had restricted music concerts, celebratory feasts, large gatherings in enclosed areas or outdoor halls and Thabal Chongba (traditional dance). Night curfew has been also extended from 9 pm to 4 am. Chief minister N Biren Singh in his New Year greetings said, “The start of a new year is always a time of reflection and contemplation. The year 2021 has been of progress coupled with landmark achievements for our state. We made several inroads and made good progress in health, education, welfare and infrastructure sectors.” Biren Singh believes 2022 will be a year of renewed hope and confidence in the people’s ability to face and overcome challenges, “as we continue to move on the road to greater progress”. “With the advent of the new year, let us resolve, reaffirm and commit ourselves towards building a peaceful, harmonious and prosperous Manipur,” said the chief minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/manipur-revellers-skip-picnics-ring-in-ny-at-home-amid-omicron-threat/articleshow/88641202.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

The cabinet adopted a policy to reduce the mammoth number of 4,224 police personnel deployed as personnel security officers (PSO). More than half of them, 2565, are deployed to guard political leaders, 854 with civil officers, 546 with judicial officers, 167 with businessmen and student leaders, 40 with tea garden managers and 52 with former militants. “The chief minister’s convoy at present comprises 22 vehicles. The cabinet has decided that this number will be brought down to seven or eight. We will continue to attempt to reduce it further to move towards an ideal situation when the chief minister can move without any security. But for that we need some more rounds of negotiations for peace to return completely,” said chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. Sarma currently has Z category of security cover with CRPF personnel. He added, "The past government under late Tarun Gogoi's leadership had taken a decision to provide ex-CMs a government house and the same security cover he had while in office. Today, we have decided that from me onwards, no prospective ex-CM will get government house and security cover, except if the security committee thinks otherwise. This decision will exclude Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and Sarbananda Sonowal. From me onwards, no ex-CM will be entitled to any such privileges." "If the salary for each personnel is Rs 1 lakh, then Assam is investing Rs 400 crore in providing personal security, which cannot continue," Sarma said. He added, "The endeavour is to end the practice of having PSO as a status symbol more than a need against security threat."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/no-govt-house-security-for-future-ex-cms-of-assam/articleshow/88641206.cms||Prabin Kalita

The Mahalaxmi temple had a large number of local and outstation devotees on the first day of the new year. Jyotiba temple, Rankala lake, New Palace museum, Panhala fort, Kaneri Math and other tourist attractions were also crowded on Saturday. Traffic jams were reported from many places.The queue at the Mahalaxmi temple extended till the Bhawani mandap on Saturday morning. Though children below the age of 10 are still not allowed into the temple premises, many devotees had their children with them in the queues. As a result, there were many cases of arguments between the temple management and devotees.Shivraj Naikawde, the secretary of Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti, said, “We got an overwhelming response on the first day of the year. Many devotees said they came from distant places as they feared a new lockdown may again shut down the temples. The queue for the darshan extended beyond the barricade area and reached almost the Bhawani mandap.”“We advise people not to bring children below 10 years along with them. People must also follow mask, sanitization and social distancing norms so that the Covid situation stays under control, and the temples remain open. For the Mahalaxmi and Jyotiba temples, the darshan timings were from 6 am to 9pm. Only devotees who had booked online darshan slots were allowed inside the temple premises,” added Naikawde.Smita Adhav, a devotee from Pune said, “We had not expected so much rush at the temple. Even after staying in the queue for about an hour, we had not even reached the half-way mark. However, taking blessings of Goddess Mahalaxmi is the best way to start the new year. There is a fear that the temples will be closed again due to the increase in the number of Covid cases. We wanted to have a darshan before any new lockdown is announced.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-big-turnout-of-tourists-long-queue-at-mahalaxmi-temple/articleshow/88641209.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Zoology professors Omkar Yadav, Tejas Patil and Amrut Bhosale carried out the research on this large cricket frog species. Yadav, head of zoology department at Amdar Shashikant Shinde College, said, “Minervarya goemchi was first spotted by me in 2015 but I couldn’t make a record of it as the molecular DNA analysis was not completed. In 2017, this frog species was first described from Surla village in Goa state and now, this has been recorded by us for the first time in Maharashtra.” The frog genus 'Minervarya' is currently represented by 37 valid species. These are commonly called as cricket frogs and are divided into four distinguishable species groups based on phylogenetic studies which are Minervarya Nilagiraca, Minervarya rufescens, Minervarya sahyadris and Minervarya syhadrensis. Minervarya Goemchi fits in M. Nilagiraca as per its characteristics. This large-sized frog species is native to Surla village in Goa and has now been recorded at 155km distance at Patne village in Shahuwadi. “Our research paper got published in the journal published on 29th December by Bombay Natural History Society. A detailed study of the frog species is required to find out more scientific details,” added Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/cricket-frog-endemic-to-goa-spotted-in-satara/articleshow/88641212.cms||---
---||Kochi||State to focus on restoration of its endemic forest trees||Kochi: The state government has issued orders and come out with a policy document on eco-restoration of its natural and endemic forest trees in place of exotic species that were planted for commercial purposes.While the document talks of phasing out these large monocrop plantations planted for wood and timber industries, these have now become a threat to the ecology, a realization dawning in the face of climate change.Researchers have been pointing out that these monocrop plantations have been detrimental to the soil as well as other vegetation in the area. “It is going to be a long-drawn process because they would have used chemicals for various purposes in these controlled plantations. Those chemicals will prevent natural species from growing there. So unless those chemicals are washed away, it will be difficult to have natural forests,” said Sajeev TV, senior principal scientist, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) and the ‘national focus point’ for Asia-Pacific forest invasive species network.The initial plan is to have fruit trees in some of these areas. Many of these monocrop trees were planted in large numbers as part of the agreement with the Hindustan Newsprint Ltd. HNL could get the raw material for its products from these areas. According to the data available with the forest department, there are around 27,000 hectares of monocrop plantations of exotic species like Eucalyptus, Acacia, Wattle etc. Also, around 90,000 hectares of teak has been planted in Kerala forest areas.“As of now, no action plan has come out of how they will go about it because it will be a huge exercise having to keep in mind the natural trees in that region,” Sajeev said. KFRI has a list of identified local and endemic species for various regions in the state.According to the document, this will be done with the participation of forest-dependent communities. Monocrop plantations which have lost their ecological significance and proved detrimental to the ecology will be phased out and steps will be taken to ensure growth of natural forests in these plantations.It is proposed that the forest restoration will consider the region’s ecology and the problems faced by people living in the area in the wake of erratic climate changes. It is expected that the removal of exotic and invasive species will also address the issue of exotic animals. Fire control measures will be implemented with public support to protect the forest tracts while removing the exotics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/state-to-focus-on-restoration-of-its-endemic-forest-trees/articleshow/88641214.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

These were isolated from sediment samples collected by the team during their expedition to the Arctic Ocean. The researchers had brought the sediment samples in cold storage for further research and have been able to culture them in the laboratory. “It took us four years to confirm that we found a new genus, Roseitranquillus sediminis gen nov, sp nov isolated from the sediments collected from an Arctic fjord, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard,” said Sajeevan T P, assistant professor, National Centre for Aquatic Animal Health, Cusat. He said that as part of the continuing experiments, they will isolate the compound and look for its potential as a medicinal drug. “Right from the days of invention of the Penicillin drug or streptomycin series of medicines, bacteria have contributed to making several molecules that went on to become medicines. However, over the years we have become resistant to many of these compounds and we will need to start looking for newer compounds. Deep seas are a potential source for several such microbes which would be used for making drug molecules. Several of them have anti-cancer, antibiotic properties which will help us overcome the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is the biggest challenge in the medical world,” Sajeevan said. Following the successful identification of a new genus and isolation of a compound from another species also brought from there, the Cusat team has applied and won financial assistance from the department of biotechnology (DBT) to look for similar such molecules in the deep Indian Ocean waters under the Blue Economy programme. The project “Integrated genomic and metabolomic approach for the discovery of novel small molecules with anti-cancer activity from marine micro-organisms” is under the multi-institutional project entitled “Bioprospecting of marine microbial diversity for various products under the Marine Bioresource and Biotechnology Network Programme”. Sajeevan will be the principal investigator working in collaboration with Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow, along with Rosamma Philip, professor (retd), Cusat and Venu S, assistant professor, Pondicherry University. The total fund for the project is Rs 83,04,160 for three years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cusat-team-finds-new-bacterial-genus-from-arctic/articleshow/88641218.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

During the Christmas days, a record number of tourists visited the district. But since the curfew, the numbers have largely declined. After two years, a record number of tourists arrived at Eravikulam National Park (ENP), the natural habitat of endangered Nilgiri tahrs during the Christmas days. Eravikulam park assistant wildlife warden Job J Neriamparambil said that on December 26, a record number of 3,900 tourists visited the park. “On Christmas Day it was 3,800. Though the park’s allowed capacity is 2,880 tourists per day, we gave special consideration to permit more tourists,” he said. “Since the curfew, the number of tourists have largely declined. On December 31 and January 1, only about 2,300 tourists visited the park. We suspect that many tourists cancelled their trips after the curfew announcement,” Neriamparambil added. According to Idukki district tourism promotion council (DTPC) data, the tourist arrival was reduced by a third since the curfew. On December 25, 21,575 and on December 26, 28,815 tourists visited the tourism centres under DTPC. But on December 31, only 9,255 tourists visited the tourism centres. “It is a reality that the number of tourists declined in the district after the curfew,” said an official. Aju Abraham Mathew, general manager of Tall Trees Resort in Munnar, said that after the imposition of night curfew, North Indian tourists cancelled their bookings. “In the present situation, a tourist leaves before 5pm to reach their destinations before the curfew time. The tourists reach the destination to enjoy the nightlife and New Year party. After the curfew was imposed, most of them cancelled it. “he said. Idukki dam, which was opened to the public during the festival season, also witnessed heavy rush till December 30. “From December 24 to 28 period, 12,366 tourists visited the dam and received an income of Rs 6,44,000. But on December 31 and January 1, the number of tourists visited declined and only 1,400 and 2,000 tourists, respectively,” said Sreeni Peethambran, unit manager, Hydel tourism Idukki.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/night-curfew-hits-idukki-tourism/articleshow/88641220.cms||---

Jincy, 27, is the deceased. The police have arrested her husband, Deepu, 28, following the incident. According to the police, the alleged crime took place around 5 pm at their new house, ‘Ayodhya’, at Mevanakonam under Kadakkal police station limits on Saturday. The house was under Jincy’s ownership and it was only six months since they started living here. The couple had been living separately for the past one month owing to marital problems. While Jincy remained to live in the new house along with their elder son, Deepu lived in his ancestral house at Cherukulam with their younger daughter, aged four. Kadakkal station house officer inspector V S Rajesh said that Deepu surrendered before the police after committing the crime. He told the police that Jincy suspected him of infidelity and this had often made way for quarrels between the couple. He left home one month ago following a similar squabble. On Saturday, he visited Jincy’s house. They soon broke into a quarrel during which he hacked her with a machete he was carrying with him. ‘’He told us that he brought the machete along with him just to scare her, but he used it to attack her when his rage took over,’’ the inspector said, adding that the police have not ruled out the possibility of the murder being premeditated. Deepu was a tipper lorry driver. Jincy was working at a cashew factory under Cashew Development Board at Parippally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/wife-hacked-to-death-during-domestic-dispute/articleshow/88639344.cms||---
