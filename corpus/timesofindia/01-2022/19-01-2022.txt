---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Video call facility between prisoners and their relatives resumes||MUMBAI: After a gap of three months, the video call facility between prisoners and their relatives has begun again. The move comes after the jail authorities stopped physical meeting at prisons due to the increasing Covid cases. The video call facility was first started in July 2020 during the first wave of Covid and it gain popularity. However, soon after the Covid cases reduced the physical meeting (mulaqat) between prisoners and their families began in October last year. In October one of the most prominent persons visiting jail was actor Shah Rukh Khan who had gone to meet his son, Aryan. The 23-year-old junior Khan was in jail after his arrest in a drug case by the NCB. He was later granted bail. The smart phones have again been set up in prisons. "An inmate can talk to his relatives for 10 minutes once in a week," said a jail official. As a procedure, an inmate gives his family member's mobile number and call is made on it. The conversation takes place in presence of jail police personnel. "The entry of all the visitors in jail premises has been prohibited since three four days due to Covid cases," said a jail officer. The jail officials have instantly began the video call facility so that the inmates could talk to their families. While the Arthur Road jail capacity to house inmates is 804, currently it has 3,200 inmates in the jail. Smart phones have been placed in all the jails for making calls to inmates' families. Meanwhile, all the new inmates are being examined for Covid and kept at the two temporary prisons in Mumbai before sending them to the prisons. "The new inmates are kept at the quarantine centres for two to three days. They are then shifted to jail, if their results are negative," added a jail source. Jail authorities also started administering booster dose to prison staff on Tuesday. Almost all the jail personnel have been given two shots earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-video-call-facility-between-prisoners-and-their-relatives-resumes/articleshow/88981761.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||World||Pak poll panel wants report on PTI funding to be made public||ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday directed authorities to make public the entire report of the scrutiny committee constituted to audit the foreign funds of prime minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI). The foreign funding case was filed in November 2014 by Akbar S Babar, a founding member of PTI, alleging serious financial irregularities in the party’s accounts. The allegations included illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts in Pakistan and abroad, money laundering and using private bank accounts of PTI employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the US and countries in Europe and the Middle East. Earlier this month, the ECP’s scrutiny committee had released some parts of the report compiled by it, confirming that the ruling party had received funding from foreign nationals and companies, under-reported funds and concealed dozens of its bank accounts. The report had provided an opportunity to Imran’s opponents to demand his resignation from office. They accused him of deliberate lies, concealing of facts and illegal foreign funding. It was later revealed that the report did not include eight volumes of the documents and bank statements requisitioned through the State Bank of Pakistan. The documents concealed by the committee included all original 28 bank statements and year-wise details of foreign funds transferred to the PTI’s accounts between 2009 and 2013. During Tuesday’s hearing, chief election commissioner Sikander Sultan Raja ordered that no segment of the report should be kept confidential and the entire report should be provided to Akbar S Babar, the petitioner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-poll-panel-wants-report-on-pti-funding-to-be-made-public/articleshow/88981895.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

In a video message on Tuesday, SFJ's US-based general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said Khalistan Referendum activists Jaswinder Singh Multani who was detained by German police after the recent Ludhiana court blast for allegedly furthering pro-Khalistan agenda but was later released, and Gurmit Singh Bagga would 'Raise Khalistan' and 'Block Tiranga' at the Indian embassy in Frankfurt, while Paramjeet Singh Pamma would do the same in London, UK, and Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Vancouver, Canada. The SFJ has already announced a budget of 1 million dollars for the project 'Raise Kesri-Khalistan', and 'Block Modi-Tiranga' coinciding with India's Republic day celebrations this year. Pannun had earlier released a video asking Sikhs to raise the 'kesri' flag in place of the Indian Tricolour.  On Tuesday, in a statement, released by SFJ, Pannun said: "Citing infamous Article 25(b) of the Indian Constitution, a global anti-India campaign #SikhsAreNot Hindus has been launched, emailing UK Prime Minister (Boris) Johnson, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Biden and Trudeau administrations urging them to support the first-ever Khalistan Referendum for secession of Punjab from India."  Pannun, Paramjit Pamma, Nijjar and Bagga are in the list of individual terrorists banned under the UAPA.  A few days back, NIA declared Rs 10 lakh award on Jaswinder Singh Multani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sfj-threatens-international-campaign-against-tricolour-on-republic-day/articleshow/88981873.cms||Bharti Jain

While 14 civilians, including a child and a critically-ill heart patient, were rescued from near Khooni Nala and SM Hill on NH-701, 16 others stuck at NC pass area, also known as Sadhna pass, were saved by two avalanche rescue teams of the Army and a team of GREF late Monday, an Army spokesperson said in a statement. Those rescued were brought to Neelam and provided food, medical care and shelter for the night. The entire operation took around five to six hours. The avalanches, triggered by snowfall on Monday morning, blocked Tangdhar-Chowkibal road and 14 civilians were stranded along with their vehicles. “On obtaining the information, Army’s avalanche rescue team from Neelum Company Operating Base under Capt Kuljot Singh, along with GREF, immediately swung into action and evacuated to safety,” said defence spokesperson Col Emron Musavi. One of the rescued civilians told Army officials that they had a narrow escape as they had managed to jump out of their vehicle before it got buried under snow. The rescuers later retrieved the vehicle from under mounds of snow. As many as 12 vehicles were recovered on Tuesday after the snow was cleared from the road. GREF played a stellar role in snow clearance amid dangerous conditions, said the spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/srinagar/army-rescues-30-civilians-stuck-in-kupwara-twin-avalanche/articleshow/88981944.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Goa||Hit by Covid-19, FC Goa welcome players back for clash against East Bengal||FC Goa coach Derrick Pereira had to rearrange the starting line-up on the way to the stadium for the clash against NorthEast United last week. With players getting ruled out due to Covid-19 positive cases even hours before kickoff, nothing is certain. But compared to the last game when nine players were missing – including three foreigners and all four captains – Goa are expected to be in better shape for the clash against SC East Bengal at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Wednesday. According to sources, captain Edu Bedia and Australian defender Dylan Fox are both available, while Brandon Fernandes has started training with the team and could make his much-awaited debut, possibly from the bench, against East Bengal this season. “I am very happy and confident about the whole team, particularly after the last encounter with Covid,” Pereira told TOI during an online media interaction on Tuesday. “Whoever went in, they knew their roles and responsibilities and they performed to the best of their abilities. We all saw we had a good game, despite the challenges. Our first 11 players were not available. If we were a little sharper and finished the chances, we could have been in a better position on the table.” Goa’s position on the table isn’t looking good. They are ninth with 13 points from 11 matches with a negative goal difference. That’s so unlike their campaigns since they finished at the bottom of the table in 2016. Part of their problem is upfront where they create chances but are unable to finish. Nothing dramatised this better than the last game against NorthEast United – Goa had 20 shots, eight of them on target, but just one goal. “We had some clear-cut chances, should have finished and got three points. As a coach, we keep working hard and trying our best. I am happy with the way all players have stuck together to put in good performances,” said Pereira. If Pereira is looking for goals, he should look at this fixture alone. It was a 4-3 goal-fest that Goa won, the only time they scored more than two goals this season. East Bengal, though, have changed quite a lot since those days when it didn’t take much time for the floodgates to open. In the last four games, the Kolkata giants have conceded just three times, drawing and frustrating three top opponents. “My job here is to change the mood of the team,” said new coach Mario Rivera. “When you come into the middle of the season, it’s because the team is not doing well. The first challenge is to change the mood and change the psychological situation of the players.” Rivera is the third coach to take charge of the bottom-placed team, following the sacking of Manuel Diaz. Renedy Singh was interim coach for three games and did brilliantly, without much help from the foreigners. “The team is better than what the table shows. Many circumstances have influenced the performance of the team,” said Rivera, who will be without most of his foreign players. Now it’s over to Rivera to change East Bengal’s fortunes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hit-by-covid-19-fc-goa-welcome-players-back-for-clash-against-east-bengal/articleshow/88982076.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||FC Goa file official complaint against two referees, say errors cost valuable points||Panaji: FC Goa have complained to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) that refereeing decisions directly prejudiced the outcome of two games, robbing them of crucial points in the Indian Super League. The target of Goa’s ire are referees CR Srikrishna (Kerala Blasters vs Goa) and R Venkatesh (Goa vs NorthEast United) who officiated two of the last three games where the former League champions dropped points. Against Kerala, Goa said, a clear penalty was denied in the second half, and their player Jorge Ortiz instead punished for simulation with a yellow card. The Gaurs believe no player fouled the NorthEast goalkeeper and “clearly the referee panicked in the situation” while disallowing a late goal. “The two major incidents that have been highlighted have potentially cost us valuable points in the current league table and for the performance of the refereeing to have such a big impact on the final outcome of games is not a good indicator for the standard of refereeing,” Goa’s director of football, Ravi Puskur, said in the club’s complaint to AIFF’s head of referees department on Tuesday. Goa were particularly incensed after Makan Chothe’s late goal was disallowed against NorthEast United, a match they dominated with 20 shots, eight of them on target. “We’ve looked at the incident multiple times now trying to assess further as to why the referee might have potentially ruled out the goal. Judging by the actions of the referee and the linesman, we are certain that there is no clear reason and at no point in the build up to the point the ball is bundled into the back of the net, does the referee act upon anything that may indicate that he has seen a foul,” said Puskur. Post the game, Puskur said he personally requested the match commissioner to request the referees to clarify their decision. The referees did not make an attempt to speak to the club, though the match commissioner “indicated at the time of the incident that it was his interpretation that the goalkeeper had been fouled in the build up to the goal.” “We have always sought dialogue with the referees prior to the game and post the game, but we’ve always found them to be unapproachable and we are left with no means but to use this medium to write to you to seek an improvement in the standard of decision making. “The department will agree that the standard of refereeing leaves a lot to be desired. However, if the referees are approachable and encouraged to engage in discussion post the game regarding a particular decision, it at least aids in alleviating the tension and frustration that is clearly evident across all the clubs that are competing in the league with regards to the standard of refereeing,” said Puskur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/fc-goa-file-official-complaint-against-two-referees-say-errors-cost-valuable-points/articleshow/88982111.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Former New York Post editor alleges harassment, retaliation||NEW YORK: A New York Post editor whose departure was announced Tuesday alleged she was fired two months after revealing to an executive that former editor Col Allan had sexually harassed her.  The Post said any suggestion of wrongdoing related to the editor-in-chief Keith Poole's announcement of Michelle Gotthelf's exit was meritless.  Poole, who Gotthelf said fired her in November after more than two decades at the Post, is a defendant in a lawsuit she filed Tuesday, along with Allan, the newspaper's publishing company and corporate owner News Corp.  Gotthelf said Allan's harassment of her "peaked" in fall 2015 when she was the newspaper's metro editor. The two were having drinks after an editors' dinner meeting when Allan said that "we should sleep together," she said in the lawsuit.  She said Allan became hostile when she rejected his advances. She complained to her superiors and human resources, and alleged that Allan was forced to retire shortly thereafter.  He returned as a consultant in 2019, however. Gotthelf said their relationship remained tense, and she saw her influence and status in the newsroom erode. She said that in 2019, Allan ordered her to remove from the Post's website a story about journalist E. Jean Carroll's accusations that she had been raped by then-President Donald Trump. Trump denied the charges and the lawsuit said Allan claimed Carroll's charges were baseless.  During a lunch meeting in November 2021 to discuss a soon-to-expire contract, Gotthelf said Poole asked her "what happened between you and Col?" She told him Allan had propositioned her.  She said Poole fired her "without cause" on Jan. 12.  "Any suggestion of wrongdoing related to the management changes announced today is meritless," the Post and News Corp. said in a statement.  The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they're a victim of sexual harassment, unless they speak publicly, as Gotthelf has done.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-new-york-post-editor-alleges-harassment-retaliation/articleshow/88982138.cms||---
---||Business||AT&T will delay some 5G deployment amid aviation standoff||WASHINGTON: AT&T said it would temporarily defer turning on some wireless towers near key airport runways to avert a looming aviation crisis but the White House is still pushing Verizon Communications to follow suit.  Discussions are centered around that proposal that would also allow about 90% of the wireless tower deployment to go forward, sources told Reuters, though it would impact 5G deployment near many large population centres.  Two of the sources said it would require delaying just over 500 towers from being activated near airports. The vast majority are Verizon towers.  "We are frustrated by the FAA's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services," AT&T said.  The announcement came as the White House is working to prevent a massive disruption in flights ahead of Wednesday's scheduled 5G deployment and actively engaged on the issue, a senior official said.  Airlines are preparing to cancel a significant number of passenger and cargo flights in the coming hours to prepare for new 5G C-Band service that starts on Wednesday, after warning on Monday of "catastrophic" impacts. Airlines are concerned that the issue could prevent them from flying Boeing 777s and other widebody jets to many key airports.  The chief executives of major US passenger and cargo carriers on Monday said new 5G service could render a significant number of widebody aircraft unusable, "could potentially strand tens of thousands of Americans overseas" and cause chaos for US flights.  Airlines have urged wireless carriers to not turn on some wireless towers near airport runways in a bid to avoid most of the flight disruptions.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that potential interference could affect sensitive airplane instruments such as altimeters and significantly hamper low-visibility operations.  The airlines asked Sunday "that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles (3.2 km) of airport runways" at some key airports.  Verizon's rollout plan is much more aggressive than AT&T's. It is significantly impacted by the Biden administration request to delay using some towers near airport runways.  Alaska Airlines Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said Tuesday in a statement "there's a serious threat of mounting cancellations, delays and diversions of our passenger and cargo flights if action is not taken immediately."  AT&T and Verizon, which won significant C-Band spectrum in an $80 billion auction last year, on Jan. 3 agreed to buffer zones around 50 airports to reduce interference risks and take other steps to cut potential interference for six months. They also agreed to delay deployment for two weeks until Wednesday.  Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg told employees on Jan. 4 the carrier saw no aviation safety issue with 5G, but reluctantly agreed to a two-week delay that expires Wednesday. Verizon did not comment Tuesday.  "Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded," wrote the chief executives of American Airlines , Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/att-will-delay-some-5g-deployment-amid-aviation-standoff/articleshow/88982199.cms||---
---||India||Gujarat, Telangana receive Covid death claims 9 & 7 times of official toll||NEW DELHI: Data filed by states in the Supreme Court shows that the number of Covid compensation claims received by some of them far exceed their official count of deaths. In Gujarat and Telangana, it’s as high as almost nine and seven times, respectively, while in absolute numbers, the gap between the official toll and compensation claims is the largest in Maharashtra. The number of claims is generally expected to be higher than the official toll because of the SC’s guidelines, which are seen as broader and more liberal in their definition — mandating that all fatalities, including those by suicide, recorded within 30 days of a person testing positive be treated as Covid deaths. Still, the gap is exceptionally high in a few states. According to data with the SC, which is monitoring implementation of its order to ensure that compensation is paid to all affected families, the number of claims received so far in Gujarat is 89,633 against the official toll of 10,094. The state has so far approved 68,370 claims and disbursed compensation amount to 58,840 families, while rejecting 4,234 applications. In Telangana, compared to the official figure of 3,993 deaths, around 29,000 claims have been received, of which 15,270 have been approved. For Maharashtra, claims add up to 2.13 lakh against the official toll of 1.41 lakh. There are a few states where the number of claim applications received by the government is lower than the official toll. The gap could be because of ignorance, especially in rural areas, about the compensation scheme. The court had in December directed all states to give wide publicity through print and electronic media, particularly in vernacular newspapers, to inform people about how and where to apply for ex gratia. Expressing satisfaction over the Gujarat government’s decision to publish advertisements in newspapers, it had directed other states to use the same format of advertisement. The SC verdict expanding the ambit of Covid deaths came on a petition by social activist Gaurav Bansal for payment of Rs 50,000 compensation to families of virus victims. The deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a Covid-19 case shall be treated as deaths due to Covid-19 even if the death takes place outside the hospital/in-patient facility, the court had ruled. It had also said that a family member of the someone who committed suicide within 30 days from being diagnosed as Covid-19 positive shall also be entitled to avail the financial help/ex gratia. The court had also made it clear that it was not concerned about the allegation of under-reporting of deaths and that its focus was to ensure people should get relief and governments should work towards that objective. As per the data compiled by the Centre, the number of claim applications is less than the number of officially declared deaths in various other states, including Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab and Rajasthan. In Punjab, 8,786 claim applications have been received so far against the official death figure of 16,557. In Karnataka, the number of claim applications received is 27,325 against the death figure of 38,376. In Jammu & Kashmir, the number of recorded deaths is 4,483 while 3,115 applications have been received for compensation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-telangana-receive-covid-death-claims-9-7-times-of-official-toll/articleshow/88982330.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

We had decided to ask 3 crore Punjabis about their choice,” AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said before walking towards Mann to hug him, reports Vibhor Mohan. Kejriwal said some people voted for him, too, but that wouldn’t count as he was never in the race. “Navjot Sidhu got the second slot (with 3.6 per cent votes).” Kejriwal claimed all surveys suggested AAP would form the next government in Punjab and Mann was the right person to lead it. “I have a double responsibility now – the party’s faith in me and that of the people who voted for me (in the feedback poll). When I was a comedian, people would smile at the sight of me. Today, the scenario has reversed, and people begin to cry at public meetings while narrating their state of affairs. I tell them that I can only be a tool to improve their lot,” Mann said. Mann listed drugs smuggling and unemployment were the primary challenges, besides making farming profitable and creating a congenial atmosphere for business and the return of Punjabi youth who have migrated abroad. “We already do not sleep. If we get the authority we seek, I assure you it will be used for the needy and not any stooges.” Mann’s younger sister Manpreet Kaur and mother Harpal Kaur said the family was initially reluctant to back his decision to join politics. BJP said by choosing Mann to be its CM face, AAP had declared its intention of turning Punjab into “a liquor state”, just as Delhi had become one under its government. BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh said Mann had been once censured in the Lok Sabha for being in an allegedly inebriated state. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal declared Mann “a compromise candidate”, with Kejriwal remaining the backroom claimant to the CM's chair. Born in Satoj village of Sangrur district in 1973, Mann was also an actor before he took the political plunge in February 2012. He lost his first election against former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal from Lehra (Sangrur) as a candidate of Manpreet Badal's People’s Party of Punjab. Mann joined AAP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which saw him become the Sangrur MP.

The raids, which came almost five years after the mining case was filed, yielded around Rs 6 crore in unaccounted cash, directorate officials said. The raids, yielded around Rs 6 crore in illegal cash, including Rs 4 crore from the residence of CM Channi’s businessman nephew Bhupinder Singh Honey, ED officials said. Sheaves of property documents were confiscated too. The 10 locations that ED teams searched included the Ludhiana house and a rented apartment in Mohali belonging to Bhupinder, a director in the companies through which the prime accused in the illegal sand mining case, Kudratdeep Singh, allegedly laundered ill-gotten money. Several other premises in Mohali and Pathankot were raided, including those of Bhupinder’s associate Sandeep Kumar. ED sources said around Rs 2 crore was seized from Sandeep's residence. The raids were on the basis of an enforcement case information report (ECIR) registered on November 30 last year. CM Channi was among the first to react to the raids, terming the ED action “vendetta politics” and drawing a parallel with how central agencies allegedly hounded his Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee's nephew and MP Abhishek Banerjee ahead of assembly polls in that state last year. “This is nothing but an attempt to target me, my ministers and Congress workers,” he said, suggesting the ED raids might be a retaliation to the security breach during PM Narendra Modi's January 5 visit to Ferozepur. Punjab’s main opposition party AAP claimed it had all along been saying that many members of the Channi cabinet were involved in illegal sand mining, and that they enjoyed the CM’s patronage. Congress’s central leadership accused the BJP government at the Centre of defaming Punjab. Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the BJP government was “seeking revenge on a Dalit CM”. He accused AAP of “being in cahoots with BJP”. “BJP and Arvind Kejriwal are unable to digest the fact that a Dalit took over as the chief minister of Punjab. The ED is not the Enforcement Directorate, but BJP’s election department,” Surjewala said. The illegal sand mining case was filed by Punjab police at Mohali on March 7, 2018, naming Ludhiana businessman Kudratdeep Singh among the 26 accused. The FIR at Rahon police station in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar had been registered after then CM Captain Amarinder Singh apparently spotted illegal sand mining between Rahon and Phillaur from a chopper that was flying him to Kartarpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-raids-homes-offices-of-channi-nephew-in-mining-case/articleshow/88982503.cms||---
---||India||'I will break Draupadi’s curse, a woman will rise in Hastinapur'||She is bold and beautiful, and successful. That she is a dalit, only adds that bit of hurt, and grit, to the persona. “Actress Hema Malini is an MP from the neighbouring temple town of Mathura. Did these Hindu leaders/sadhus question her election candidature like they are slamming mine?” asks an incredulous Archana Gautam. Since the day Congress announced Archana as it’s candidate from Hastinapur assembly seat last week, the little-known model and movie actor, as also Miss Bikini etc, has been in the eye of a storm, inundated by a coarse avalanche of her bikini-clad pictures on social media and sly queries about why she had been fielded by a weak Congress. As if on cue, the so-called religious seers raised a red flag over “such a woman’s” suitability to fight elections from the holy town of the Mahabharat mythology. But with stigma and struggle part of her hardscrabble upbringing in the deeply feudal western UP, Archana has come too far to back down now. “I am being run down while Hema Malini was not, I think, because I am a dalit. Else, she also wore skimpy clothes … It’s nothing but social trolling. I don’t care about it,” she told TOI. It is difficult to figure out if Archana’s grit flows from her upbringing as a poor dalit girl in Hastinapur/Meerut or if her flight for freedom, that took her to Mumbai, Chennai and landed the wide eyed go-getter on silver screen, steeled her to question and confront. But she, all of 26 years, knows her Ambedkar enough to credit her growth, and of all women, to the father of the constitution, and also to tell the sadhus that their opposition to her is akin to “bringing religion into politics”, contrary to the “secular Constitution”. After finding untouchability all around her growing up, she found it liberating that “there is no discrimination in modelling/film industry”. It is intriguing that the articulate young “star” attracting such attention is from the weak Congress ticket. But she says Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has enabled her aspirations to move to the next level, after she managed to leave Meerut and land in Mumbai, “and became a star”. “I am confident Congress can win. My voters have voted SP, BSP, BJP. I am asking Hastinapur to give me a chance too. I will develop my village. I am a local, and I am getting support,” she says with conviction. In BSP leader Mayawati, she finds an “inspiration of the community” and is urging people to support her like they did “our elder sister”. Far from the puritan worldview of sadhus and conservatives, Archana paints in their midst a society where “girls like me” are harassed by rowdies no sooner we step out on the streets and are promptly pushed back inside the oppressive four walls. “Our girls have small dreams but even they die early… I want to be a role model for them. My victory will liberate them,” she says, of her dreams and goals behind the political plunge. Wherever, it’s coming from, Archana is confident enough to put herself at par with politician-actors - Hema, Jaya, Jayalalithaa et al. “I have big movies in south But I am making a big sacrifice. I have told people that if I win, I will never go back to the industry and will only work for their welfare. Most of the actors come to politics after 40 when their careers are over, I am coming at 26,” is her strong pitch in her favour. In the end, the trolled dalit girl sees a historic mission for herself. “Draupadi had cursed Hastinapur that no woman will rise from here. That curse will be broken this time by a woman, and i will become a medium for it,” she said, with the confidence of a self-made person.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-will-break-draupadis-curse-a-woman-will-rise-in-hastinapur/articleshow/88982568.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Mallya lives in the lavish Grade-1 listed home 18-19 Cornwall Terrace — two terraced houses converted into one home — overlooking Regent’s Park, with his 34-year-old actor son Sidhartha and his 95-year-old mother Lalitha, wife of the late industrialist Vittal Mallya. If the family do not leave immediately of their own accord, they may get evicted from the house by bailiffs. At the end of the hearing in the chancery division of the high court in London on Tuesday, the barrister for UBS, Fenner Moeran QC, said the bank would not delay any enforcement proceedings. The house is worth tens of millions of pounds. Deputy master Marsh of the high court in London dismissed on Tuesday Rose Capital’s application for a stay of enforcement and also refused to stay Tuesday’s judgment pending any appeal. It also refused permission to appeal, saying: “Rose Capital’s position is completely hopeless.” He said the company “has had more than sufficient time to resolve this and I am satisfied there is no real prospect that another judge will take a different view and you would succeed on appeal.” Daniel Margolin, representing the Mallyas, said: “This will have serious consequences for my clients, including Vijay Mallya and a lady of some 95 years of age”. He requested a “stay of execution pending appeal in case enforcement officers start turning up in the next few days”. This was refused. However, Rose Capital and Mallya plan to contest Tuesday’s judgment by seeking permission to appeal from a different judge, but, since there is no stay, bailiffs can now enter the house. Mallya has another house in Tewin, Hertfordshire, which he bought off Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton’s father, Anthony, worth over Rs 100 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/vijay-mallya-loses-battle-to-keep-london-home/articleshow/88982607.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The explosion occurred around 4.45pm in an internal compartment of the destroyer, which was anchored at Mumbai on cross-coast deployment from eastern Naval Command at Visakhapatnam. Though the board of inquiry ordered into the mishap will ascertain exact details, sources said the blast was probably due to leakage of gas in the air-conditioning compartment of the warship. “Those who died were sitting in their cabin adjoining the AC compartment when the blast occurred. The cabin collapsed on them. The blast was not ammunition-related,” a source told TOI. A defence spokesperson said: “The ship’s crew responded immediately and brought the situation under control. No major material damage has been reported.” “INS Ranvir has been on a cross-coast operational deployment from the eastern Naval Command since November 2021 and was due to return to base port shortly,” said the spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-killed-11-injured-in-blast-on-navy-ship-in-mumbai/articleshow/88982678.cms||V Narayan
---||Business||FM: Govt will target assets owned by Devas promoters||NEW DELHI: A day after the SC verdict, FM Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday attacked Congress for “committing a fraud on the country” in the Devas deal with Antrix, and said it would move aggressively and target assets owned by promoters of the company, both in India and abroad. It indicated that the ruling by the SC, which established fraud by Devas and gave a go-ahead for liquidation of Devas Multimedia, will be used to defend claims overseas. Simultaneously, the ministry of corporate affairs while going for liquidation of the company will also use a rarely-used provision of the Companies Act to recover dues from Devas promoters. "It was a fraud of Congress, by Congress and for Congress... It’s Congress’s turn to explain. It’s a master game player,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, adding that the Devas was given rights for unlimited rights of 70 MHz of the scarce S-band of spectrum even when the cabinet had not approved the plan, something that was noted by ministers in the Manmohan Singh government, which hastily called off the deal after the disclosure of details. She also accused the lead UPA player of being “master of corruption” ahead of crucial assembly elections in five states, including UP and Punjab. Along with corruption charges related to allocation of 2G spectrum, coal blocks, “space spectrum scam” were successfully highlighted by BJP which emphasised that the Department of Space, which oversaw Isro, was under the PMO. “This kind of selling of primary endowments like wavelengths, satellites or spectrum bands, giving it away to private parties and making money from private parties and making a deal out if it marks the feature of the Congress government,” Sitharaman said. Sources said even before the satellites were approved by the cabinet, 90% of the rights were given away to a private company, which promised to pay $11 million annually to Isro but “not even a paisa” was paid till the deal was annulled by UPA itself. Officials said the agreement was “ab initio” void as it had been signed by a clerk employed with Devas’s chartered accountant. Besides, the company was handed over rights to use S-band, which is of strategic importance, for a “pittance”, Sitharaman said. Quoting the SC order, the FM said that Devas had “siphoned off” large part of the money out of the country, while it made claims in various courts. Apart from payments of over $200 million under bilateral investment treaties, apart from damages of $1 billion. She said Antrix did not even appoint an arbitrator, despite a request from the ICC, and reminders from the government, leaving it to the Modi government to defend taxpayers’ money. “The Modi govt fighting in every court to ensure the fraud doesn’t get away,” she said, adding that she would be holding inter-ministerial discussions to decide the future course of action to defend the claims made by the company. Government officials, however, said that courts in other countries will take on board the SC order. Last week, Devas disclosed that a Paris court granted in September 2021 its plea claiming rights over a Paris apartment that houses India’s deputy chief of mission.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fm-govt-will-target-assets-owned-by-devas-promoters/articleshow/88982742.cms||---

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna held that sufficient time and opportunity must be given to an accused to argue on quantum of punishment, particularly on death sentence. The SC commuted death sentence of a man to 30-year jail or raping and killing an 11-year-old girl in MP in 2017. Itsaid there was violation of fair trial for deciding quantum of punishment as no chance was given to him before sentencing. It is travesty of justice as the appellant was not given a fair opportunity to defend himself. This is a classic case indicating the disturbing tendency of trial courts adjudicating criminal cases involving rape and murder in haste. It is trite law that an accused is entitled for a fair trial which is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. In respect of the order of conviction and sentence being passed on the same day, the object and purpose of Section 235 (2) CrPC is that the accused must be given an opportunity to make a representation against the sentence to be imposed on him,” it said. The bench said a bifurcated hearing for convicting and sentencing is necessary to provide an effective opportunity to the accused. “Adequate opportunity to produce relevant material on the question of death sentence shall be provided to the accused by the trial court,” it said. The court noted that mitigating circumstances--that accused was first-time offender, belonging to a poor family from Scheduled Tribe, the probability of reformation--was not considered by the trial court and the high court while awarding the death sentence. “The appellant was aged 25 years on the date of commission of the offence and belongs to a Scheduled Tribe community, eking his livelihood by doing manual labour...,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-hasten-in-giving-death-sc-tells-courts-gives-man-30-year-jail/articleshow/88982783.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The city reported 25,595 new cases on Tuesday, taking active cases across the state to nearly 1.8 lakh. BBMP's projection on the peak is based on the week-on-week increase, which is around 250%. While BBMP has not specified the dominant variant in circulation, sources suggest it is Omicron, given that a majority of infected people are reporting high fever, congestion, body pain and cough for a short duration. Two independent data trackers told TOI: "It looks like almost every other household will have at least one positive case during the third wave. It won't be a surprise if the daily count crosses 35,000. If we factor in those conducting Covid self-tests at home without coming under the BBMP radar, the daily count will be a lot higher." Bengaluru reported 810 positive cases on January 1 and the number jumped to 6,812 on January 7 before touching 22,224 on January 15. Data from the past 15 days shows Bengaluru reported a daily average of 8,800 new cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/250-rise-in-bengaluru-cases-in-a-week-set-to-peak-by-january-25/articleshow/88982911.cms||Nithya Mandyam

"Bhandara police have caught the Modi I was talking about. Some villagers had approached me, saying that a goon called Modi was troubling them. To boost their confidence, I said I will take care of the problem," Patole said at Nagpur airport, accusing BJP of "unnecessarily" making an issue of it. Sources in police said the complaint mentioned by the Sakoli MLA in his disclaimer was being probed, but nobody by the surname "Modi" had yet been arrested. "We have spoken to Congress workers who had gone to Patole with this complaint. They claim that a man with the initials 'UG' calls himself 'Modi', and is a troublemaker," a police official said. "First, we have to first trace this man, ascertain if he does call himself 'Modi' and then verify if he threatened anyone." Leader of the opposition and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis demanded an FIR be registered against Patole for suggesting "he could kill the PM". "It is a policy of Congress. In Punjab, the PM's security was compromised, and in Maharashtra, the Congress chief says he can kill the PM. This shows what respect they have for the PM. We demand legal action against Patole, besides an FIR naming him," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patole-says-his-modi-caught-bjp-for-fir-against-neta/articleshow/88982939.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||TB flagged as comorbidity in new Covid clinical management protocol||NEW DELHI: The government has included tuberculosis as a comorbidity that can put patients at "high risk" of severe coronavirus infection and also advised TB testing post Covid-19, if cough persists for more than two to three weeks, in new clinical management protocol for the disease. Apart from TB, there are six other categories identified as "high risk" for developing severe disease or death due to Covid-19. These include people aged above 60 years, those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD), people suffering from diabetes mellitus or immunocompromised states (such as HIV), patients of active tuberculosis, patients of chronic lung, kidney or liver disease, people with cerebral vascular diseases, and those who are obese. During the previous surges, the Centre had issued multiple advisories and guidance emphasising on the need for bi-directional screening of TB-Covid and TB-ILI/SARI (influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection) as notification of TB cases had dropped significantly, particularly in 2020. Both Covid and TB are infectious and primarily attack the lungs, presenting similar symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. However, TB has a longer incubation period. While India has set a deadline of 2025 to eliminate TB, the disease continues to be one of the major public health challenges. Each year, it is estimated that over 24.8 lakh new TB cases emerge in India, with about 4 lakh people succumbing to the disease annually. A national TB control programme registered a 25% fall in the detection of new patients during the first half of 2021 when compared with the corresponding period in 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-flagged-as-comorbidity-in-new-covid-clinical-management-protocol/articleshow/88982956.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Lt Gen Pande to be next Army vice-chief||NEW DELHI: The government has approved the appointment of Eastern Command chief Lt General Manoj Pande as the next Army vice-chief, even as the decision on the next chief of defence staff (CDS) is still awaited. Lt Gen Pande will succeed Lt-General CP Mohanty, who is slated to retire on January 31, sources said on Tuesday. There was, however, no official word on the appointment. Another senior Lt Gen, Northern Command chief YK Joshi, is also slated to retire this month-end. A third senior Lt Gen, Army Training Command chief Raj Shukla, in turn, will superannuate on March 31. Consequently, Lt Gen Pande, who was commissioned into the Corps of Engineers (the Bombay Sappers) in December 1982, will be the senior-most serving Lt Gen if present Army chief General M M Naravane retires on turning 62 in April as scheduled. The untimely death of Gen Bipin Rawat, who had assumed charge as the country's first-ever CDS on January 1, 2020, in a Mi-17 V5 helicopter crash last month, however, has put a question mark on the line of succession in the Army. Though Gen Naravane is considered the frontrunner for the CDS post, the government has shown no urgency as yet in naming Gen Rawat's successor. While a CDS can serve till the age of 65, the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier. Defence minister Rajnath Singh has made it clear that Gen Rawat's "unfinished task" of integrating the Army, Navy and IAF will be taken to its logical conclusion. With the groundwork already done, one of crucial tasks for the new CDS will be to work towards the creation of four new unified commands: the integrated maritime theatre command (MTC), air defence command (ADC), and two land-based commands for Pakistan and China.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lt-gen-pande-to-be-next-army-vice-chief/articleshow/88982996.cms||---

Vaccination among adolescents continues to progress well with over 50% of those between 15-17 years covered with the first dose in just about 16 days. Officials said while high infection among health and frontline workers, coupled with fear of contracting the virus at the site of vaccination, may have deterred people from seeking the third dose, the option of availing vaccination at schools has helped youngsters. Overall, nearly 159 crore doses were given across India till Tuesday. Around 93.6% adults have received at least first dose of Covid vaccines, whereas 70.7% people above 18 years age are fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/booster-shot-uptake-remains-subdued-amid-omicron-surge/articleshow/88983051.cms||---

Foreign minister S Jaishankar made the offer in a letter to his counterpart GL Peiris, said the Indian high commission in Colombo. India had recently also extended foreign exchange support of over $900 million to Sri Lanka for import of essential items like food and medicines. Early operationalisation of the LoC, said the Indian government, will help realise one of the four pillars of economic cooperation identified during the visit of Lankan finance minister Basil Rajapaksa to India in December 2021. These four pillars include a food and health security package, energy security package, offer of a 'currency swap' to help Sri Lanka address the current balance of payment issues and facilitating Indian investments in different sectors in Sri Lanka that would contribute to growth and expand employment. In a virtual meeting with Jaishankar last week, Basil had welcomed Indian investments in Sri Lanka in a number of important spheres including ports, infrastructure, energy, renew able energy among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-lanka-forex-crisis-india-offers-500m-line-of-credit/articleshow/88983206.cms||---

Responding to the call, police rushed to the house and found the burglars still inside. The intruders opened fire and one of them was injured in retaliatory police fire and apprehended. The others escaped. Around Monday midnight, Vijay Awasthi, a software engineer based in New Jersey, got an alert on his phone. The signal was from CCTV cameras and sensors he had installed at his ancestral house in Kanpur. When he checked the footage, Vijay was shocked to find intruders inside his house. "Vijay used the mic option to warn intruders. But his warning had no impact on them. Instead, they broke the CCTV camera," police said. Vijay then immediately called up his neighbour in Shyamnagar, who informed the police control room and a police patrol reached the site within five minutes. Soon, police commissioner Vijay Singh Meena, DCP (east) Pramod Kumar, and police personnel s arrived and cordoned off the house. The intruders, who were hiding on the roof, were asked to surrender. However, they shot at police, who returned fire, injuring one of the intruders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sitting-in-new-jersey-engineer-catches-burglars-at-kanpur-home-in-tech-web/articleshow/88983225.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

SC asks govt to explain cap on women in NDA||NEW DELHI: After demolishing the gender barrier and directing entry of women aspirants in the National Defence Academy (NDA) which was earlier allowed only for men, the Supreme Court has agreed to examine a plea for letting women compete with men for admission for all seats without putting restrictions on the number of women to be enrolled. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh on Tuesday sought response from the Centre after the court was informed that only 19 out of 400 seats were allotted to women candidates last year and in the current year too, same number of women will be given admission. The court said limited seats were allotted for women candidates last year as there was no infrastructure to cater to the needs of women candidates on the campus. As the government has assured the court to increase the intake of women candidates in a phased manner, the court sought explanation from additional solicitor general Aishwayra Bahti who was appearing for the Centre. Bhati said the intake of women candidates is not linked with infrastructure issues and it depends on requirement of the force. She agreed to file an affidavit giving explanation to the court. The court issued notice to the Centre granting it three weeks' time to give explanation on the "restricted" entry of women candidates in NDA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-only-19-sc-asks-govt-to-explain-cap-on-women-in-nda/articleshow/88983242.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The proposed amendment asks the states to nominate a pre-decided number of IAS officers for central deputation reserve and allows the Centre to post these officers, even overriding state objections. She wrote: "By insisting on officers to be made available for deputation through proposed amendment, not only will the administration of states be affected but also it would become impossible to assess and plan the administration of a state by engaging such officers who form part of Central Deputation Reserve, fraught with the uncertainty of their sudden deputation by the Centre... The proposed amendment of cadre rules will legalise such actions which are unwarranted."

---||Gurgaon||Circle rates go up: Pay more for land or home in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: Homebuyers planning to capitalise on the pandemic flatness in the market and buy properties in upscale condominiums of the city will have to set aside a higher budget. The government has approved an increase in circle rates for the current year, which will make registration of properties more expensive in the areas where most new housing in the city is available. After the revision, circle rates of sectors adjoining the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), Golf Course Road and Dwarka Expressway have increased by up to 25%. The circle rates of commercial sectors, however, remained unchanged. Circle rates are minimum government-defined prices at which the sale or transfer of a plot, built-up house, apartment, commercial property or land take place. The property cannot be registered below this price. Stamp duty and registration charges for a property are also based on this. In sectors along the SPR, the prominent ones being 58 to 65 that are closest to Golf Course Road and the Rapid Metro corridor, circle rate for land has gone up by Rs 6,000 per square yard. The new circle rate in these areas is Rs 36,000 per sq yard. In DLF 2, the rates have been revised from Rs 77,000 per sq yard to Rs 85,000. The sectors along Golf Course road – 27, 28, 42 and 43 – have witnessed an increase in circle rate by Rs 5,000 to Rs 55,000 per sq yard. In the new sectors along Dwarka Expressway, the circle rate has been increased from Rs 30,000 to Rs 36,000 per sq yard. Among colonies, circle rates have been increased in the 5-10% range in the Gurugram and Wazirabad tehsils, 25% in Badshapur tehsil, and 10 -15% in Manesar. Circle rates for the HSVP sectors have been hiked by 5-10% in Gurugram tehsil, 10-12% in Badshapur and 10-15% in Wazirabad. In cooperative group housing societies, Gurugram saw the maximum hike of 66% in circle rates, followed by Manesar (38%) and 5-10% in Wazirabad. For other multi-storeyed group housing and builder floors, circle rates have seen maximum increase in Manesar (30-40%), followed by 10-20% in the Gurugram tehsil – which translates to a Rs 500 per square feet increase for flats – and 10-15% in Badshapur. Developers said the increase in circle rates will adversely affect the realty sector, which witnessed a difficult phase due to pandemic, and has of late been seeing green shoots. Navdeep Sardana, managing director of Elite Landbase, said the real estate market has been reviving and an increase in circle rate would impede that. “Higher purchase costs resulting from higher circle rates may impair the already ailing residential real estate market, with secondary market implications being more severe,” he said. Saransh Trehan, managing director of Trehan Group, said the decision to raise the circle rate would put an additional burden on prospective homebuyers in the form of higher stamp duty for registration of properties. “This should have been avoided, especially during the pandemic,” he said. Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman of Signature Global, added, “Higher acquisition costs caused by higher circle rates will dampen sentiments. An objective market assessment of property prices is the need of the hour, but the approach to determining circle rates needs to be reconsidered in order to capture the market rates more accurately,” he said. A recent survey by a property portal found housing sales in all Indian markets, particularly in the NCR, had improved nearly to pre-Covid levels but there hadn’t an increase in the average listing prices of residential apartments, indicating the flatness in prices was drawing more buyers towards an investment as the economy emerged from the pandemic. But the price of residential plots appreciated, especially in the Gurugram and Sohna markets and some areas along the Dwarka Expressway, according to the survey. Delhi-NCR cities added 31,710 new units in 2021 compared to 18,530 units in 2020 – a significant rise of 71%, according to another survey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/circle-rates-go-up-pay-more-for-land-or-home/articleshow/88983278.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

With the flyover ready for traffic, the intersection will likely open to commuters in the first half of the next month.While extending the project deadline from December 31, 2021, to February 10 on Tuesday, the authority stressed that only 10% of the work on the project is remaining. “More than 90% of the work on the project has been completed. The flyover is ready, but work is underway to complete the underpass and repair the service roads. Two foot-overbridges are also part of our plans, but those can get installed even after the junction is thrown open to traffic,” a senior GMDA official, who did not want to be named, said.The project costing nearly Rs 43.07 crore includes a 269.5m-long bi-directional flyover running between Hussain Marg and the road towards Signature Towers, as well as the construction of a 705m-long unidirectional underpass, running from the direction of Signature Towers towards Subhash Chowk. The two foot-overbridges, as well as escalators, lifts and stairs supplementing them, would get installed on the road towards Signature Towers and another road towards Iffco Chowk, respectively.Commuters expressed relief on being informed about the upcoming opening of the junction. Sumit Sinha, who resides in Sector 43, said, “The opening will ease the worries of residents and commuters in this area and has been a long time coming. Traffic movement at this intersection had been problematic earlier, but the work on the project for the past three years has also inconvenienced us. Going ahead, we will have to see how effective the revamp will be in terms of easing traffic and pedestrian movement in the area.”Although the GMDA had started work on the project in July 2019, with an initial deadline of one year, it got held up due to the pandemic lockdown, the ensuing shortage of labour and complications in shifting utilities. Till November last year, the GMDA officials were hopeful of meeting the December 31 deadline. However, the ban on construction activities for around a month over high pollution levels in the National Capital Region (NCR) again delayed the project.The Huda City Centre junction is a critical point in the city, where traffic from the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road and the Netaji Subhash Marg merge. The intersection has several gated societies, hospitals, offices and the last station on the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Yellow Line in its vicinity and sees a very high volume of both vehicular and pedestrian movement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/flyover-ready-revamped-huda-city-centre-junction-to-open-next-month/articleshow/88983279.cms||Sakshi Dayal

There was, however, a fall in testing as well, which likely led to this drop in cases because the daily positivity rate on Tuesday actually increased to 30.8% from 28.5% on Monday. Data from the health department showed 10,191 tests were conducted on Tuesday, which is the first time since January 6 that testing has fallen back into the 10,000 range. On Monday, 12,083 tests were carried out. The city now has 23,377 active cases, with 23,221 patients in home isolation and 156 admitted in hospitals. Currently, there is no confirmed active Omicron case. Meanwhile, 1,882 Covid patients recuperated on Tuesday.The health department said the city is likely to see a decline in Covid cases by next week. “We are currently experiencing a surge in new cases daily, but by next week, cases might start to decline in Gurgaon,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. Doctors treating Covid patients said that most do not have severe symptoms. Dr Arunesh Kumar, HOD and senior consultant pulmonology, Paras Hospitals, said, “The Omicron strain causes relatively mild illness compared to the Delta strain. It causes mainly upper respiratory symptoms, cough, fever, scratchy throat, headache, aches and pains, and some more flu-like symptoms. The lower respiratory tract and lungs are less affected by Omicron when compared to Delta. We used to see more people with low oxygen saturation levels during the second wave, resulting in hospitalisations. But that is less this time, with just a few people requiring ICU care, BiPap or high flow oxygen, etc. So, we can say, despite the high number of cases, that this is a milder variety of Covid."The chief medical officer, meanwhile, continued his inspections of various health institutes on Tuesday, visiting Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and the Rajendra Park urban primary health care centre. The CMO gave warnings to the health officials in these institutes as several medical and paramedical staff arrived late at their offices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/3000-cases-again-but-10-dip-in-24-hrs-testing-falls-too/articleshow/88983281.cms||Ipsita Pati

They took him to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. He succumbed to injuries later that night.“Preliminary investigation has revealed that the men tried to snatch his belongings. When he put up a fight, one of them whipped out a gun and fired at him. When he slumped to the ground, they fled. We will arrest them soon,” said Kabu Singh, the SHO of Model Town police station.Singh’s family members said he had asked Zomato for a transfer to Rewari from Palwal just a couple of months ago in the hope of better opportunities. In Rewari, he had shifted to a house near his sister’s along with his wife and 10-year-old son. “Little did we know that he would leave us within months. We are devastated,” said Bittu, Singh’s younger brother who is pursuing an ITI course. Singh was the only sole earning member of the family that had two more brothers. Another younger brother of Singh worked as a labourer and barely earned enough to manage his own expenses.“Being the eldest of all, he took care of everyone. Since he shifted to Rewari, he would send money to his father as well. He also contributed for my education,” Bittu said. A spokesperson for Zomato said they would provide all possible support to Singh’s family. “We will provide a job to one of the brothers as a delivery agent. We have also raised funds internally to hand over to the family. We will provide unconditional support to the family,” the spokesperson said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/zomato-delivery-executive-was-shot-trying-to-resist-snatching-bid-cops/articleshow/88983283.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The policemen escorting Sanjay immediately rushed him to the Civil hospital in Sector 10 and informed the family members who subsequently shifted him to a private hospital.Sanjay, who suffered a heart attack two years ago and had been confined mostly to his home since, died during treatment at the hospital two days later. Sources told TOI that Sanjay had given a cheque of Rs 20,000 to a neighbour. After it was dishonoured and Sanjay failed to settle the amount, the neighbour moved the court which declared the accused a proclaimed offender as he failed to appear before it.Sanjay’s mother Chandrawati said that on January 15, two men came to her house and identified themselves as officials of the electricity department. “They asked my son to produce his Aadhar card and then took him along with them, saying that they will have to produce him (my son) in the court,” she said.“After three hours, I received a phone call that Sanjay had fallen sick and was admitted to the Civil hospital. I rushed to the hospital and found my son in a critical condition and shifted him to a private hospital, where he died on January 17. My son was in a good condition when he had left the house,” Chandrawati said.Footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area shows that Sanjay was being taken by two people, confirming his mother’s version that he had been in a good condition at the time. Based on her complaint, a case was registered at the Shivaji Nagar police station under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 365 (abduction), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of IPC against unknown persons. “Further probe is in progress,” said Gurgaon police spokesperson Subhash Boken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/held-in-cheque-bounce-case-41-year-old-dies/articleshow/88983284.cms||Bagish Jha

The residents have written to GMDA CEO Sudhir Rajpal seeking his intervention to lay the cycle track from Bristol Chowk to the Boulevard Avenue intersection. Spread across 500 acres, DLF City-1 has 8,000 families. Also, Silver Oak Apartments has 700 families living there. The residents pointed out that it is the need of the hour to make the city’s road more cycle-friendly to provide an alternative and sustainable way of transportation.Baljeet Singh Rathee, president of Qutub Enclave RWA said, “People have now become more health conscious because of the pandemic and with the increasing air pollution and traffic congestion in the city, it is imperative to develop cycling track which is eco-friendly way to commute. We have written to the CEO of GMDA urging him to lay the cycling track on the Gurgaon-Faridabad road.”They pointed out that residents in the area are cycling enthusiasts and due to lack of a dedicated cycling corridor are forced to brave the high speed vehicles on this busy stretch. “Our area is surrounded by the Aravali forest and attract many cycling enthusiasts but due to road traffic, they don’t feel safe. Many others also want to engage in a healthy lifestyle but lack of safe infrastructure and poor road conditions are the real downers,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of QERWA.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: No school entry for teens aged 15-17 without 1st dose?||GURUGRAM: The health department, on Tuesday, asked the education department to ensure that all children in the 15-17 age bracket in Gurgaon receive their first Covaxin doses before April 1 and cautioned that the children without first dose would not be allowed to attend physical classes when schools reopen. The direction comes just three days after health minister Anil Vij issued a directive on Twitter, saying the same. According to the education department, it is helping increase the vaccination pace in the 15-17 age bracket and keeping an eye on the vaccination drives in schools across the state. “We have told all schools to upload the vaccination data on the Avsar mobile app to get a clear picture of the situation so that we can assess how many children are getting vaccinated daily,” Vivek Kalia, additional director, secondary education, Haryana, said. As many as 92,340 children, nearly 61% of the 15-17 population eligible for vaccination, have received the first doses since January 3, but the target is 1.51 lakh children. There are 127 government and 232 private schools in Gurgaon, which are now preparing a database of the eligible children to ensure that all get the first dose soon. “I am confident that all eligible children in our school will get vaccinated by April 1. We have already prepared a list of the children eligible for vaccination; the ongoing drive at the school is being carried out based on that data,” Peeya Sharma, principal, Ryan International School, Sohna, said. The vaccination pace has been smooth, Sharma added. "Both parents and children are excited about it. With the cases on the rise, students now want the vaccine," she said. Parents welcomed the direction, too. “I got both my kids vaccinated last week. It has been such a relief. I welcome the decision,” said Sikha Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 48. The health department is trying to increase the vaccination coverage from its side. On January 23, the department will set up vaccination camps at the Gurudwara in New Colony, the Badi Church at Sheetla Colony, the Hanuman Mandir in Ashok Vihar, the Anjuman Jama Masjid in Sector 57 and the Jain Mandir in Sadar Bazar. At all five camps, children in the 15-17 age bracket will get the first doses, and over-60 people will get the booster doses. On Tuesday, 2,059 people in the 15-17 age bracket got vaccinated in Gurgaon. On the ninth day of the booster vaccination drive, 2,222 people got the precautionary dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-school-entry-for-teens-aged-15-17-without-1st-dose/articleshow/88983289.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||5-month-old rescued from trafficking gang, 2 held||Gurgaon: Police on Tuesday arrested two more members of a child trafficking gang and rescued a five-month-old girl from them, which takes the total number of arrests in the case to 13 and the number of rescues to four since January 8. According to Gurgaon police, the arrested duo, identified as Anand and Baby, had plans to sell the five-month-old. While Anand got nabbed in Delhi, police arrested Baby from Rajasthan. “Anand was involved in purchasing children from couples from humble backgrounds. The gang mostly targeted those who worked as labourers, lived on the streets or slums and had no means to raise a child,” inspector Manoj Kumar, station house officer (SHO), DLF 3, said. The gang, he added, used to pay a small amount to the parents and sold the children for a higher price. Police had earlier revealed that the gang sold the children to a community of street performers in Rajasthan for Rs 1.5 lakh (for girls) to Rs 4 lakh (boys). The performers then trained the children to show dangerous street acts such as walking on the rope. All the arrests in the case have been from Delhi and Rajasthan. Meanwhile, four infants, including three girls, have been rescued from the gang to date. Two girls rescued earlier were less than one month old, and the boy was four-month-old. According to police, the girls were in demand because the street performers sold them to older men as brides after they reached a certain age. Police are still trying to find the total number of children sold by the gang and locate all such children. The gang was busted on January 8 after a cab driver drove to the DLF 3 police station and complained about two women and a man in his cab. The driver had overheard a phone conversation between one of the women and a person from Alwar, Rajasthan, negotiating to buy an infant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/5-month-old-rescued-from-trafficking-gang-2-held/articleshow/88983291.cms||---
---||Noida||Nine-year-old girl, her 10-month-old brother drown in drain outside home in Noida||NOIDA: A nine-year-old girl and her 10-month-old brother died after falling into a drain in Sector 85 on Monday evening. The family of the children said the kids were playing outside their house when they slipped into the drain. No police complaint was lodged by the family till late on Tuesday evening. Rubina and Sumit, the family said, would have lived had the drain been covered. Officials of the Noida Authority, however, cited the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) orders to say that stormwater drains cannot be covered due to the cleaning purposes. Shambhu Kumar, their father, told TOI that his two children were playing outside the house around 4.15pm. “The two had been playing for a long time. So, I went to check on them but couldn't find them nearby. After a brief search, I realised that the kids had fallen into the drain near our house,” he said. Without wasting a minute, Shambhu jumped into the swollen drain. “After a little struggle and with help from the neighbours, we managed to get both of them out. We rushed them to Felix Hospital in Sector 137,” said the father, a daily wager originally from Bihar. The family’s worst fears came true when doctors at the hospital declared the children dead on arrival. “By the time the family reached the hospital with the two children around 5.45pm, the two were already dead,” said Dr DK Gupta, the Felix Hospital chairperson. Family members said they wouldn’t have had to see this day had the drain been covered. The two kids had three siblings. However, SC Mishra, a senior official of the Noida Authority’s public health department, said that in keeping with the green tribunal’s orders, no stormwater drain can be covered. An order by the NGT bars the authorities from covering stormwater drains because they need to be cleaned regularly. Activists have suggested that the authorities should build barricades around such drains to avoid accidents in the future Police said they got to know about the deaths from the hospital management. “No complaint has been filed by the family yet. However, a probe has been initiated,” a senior officer at Phase-2 police station said. “The bodies were handed over to the family on Tuesday afternoon after an autopsy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/nine-year-old-girl-her-10-month-old-brother-drown-in-drain-outside-home/articleshow/88983292.cms||Advitya Bahl
---||Noida||Activist: Don’t cover drains, but build walls around them||Noida: Authorities should build barricades around stormwater drains to avoid accidents in the future, an environmentalist suggested in the wake of the tragic deaths of a nine-year-old girl and her 10-month-old brother after falling into a drain in Sector 85.An order by the National Green Tribunal bars the authorities from covering stormwater drains because they need to be cleaned regularly. “We cannot just say that the accident happened because the drain cannot be covered. It’s the failure of the local authority. Open drains, especially those in densely populated areas, should be barricaded, be it through wire fencing, a concrete wall or even a natural wall with plants and hedges. They should also set up signboards so that people stay away from them,” said Vikrant Tongad, the green activist.According to Tongad, stormwater drains should not be covered not only because they need to be cleaned regularly, but also since they are the source of rainwater and groundwater recharge.Residents’ welfare associations have, however, been demanding that the Noida Authority cover the drains, at least the smaller ones. “We have been urging the Authority to do this for several years now. There are many sectors that continue to have uncovered small drains, where accidents keep happening,” said KK Jain, the secretary-general of the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA).SC Mishra, a senior official at the public health department of the Authority, too cited the NGT order. “The purpose of the order was to ensure that stormwater drains are cleaned regularly and to provide uninterrupted drainage. Covering the drains will lead to increased toxicity and health hazards because of trapped gases. So, it has been ruled out,” said Mishra.He did not respond to the proposal of safety measures such as barricades around the drains. Mishra, however, said the Authority would look into complaints of open manholes and sewers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/activist-dont-cover-drains-but-build-walls-around-them/articleshow/88983294.cms||Advitya Bahl

The private firm given the mandate to set up water meters will also create an mobile application through which users would be able to monitor their daily consumption, officials said. The Authority has also started survey work to gauge the current level of groundwater in the city. While a budget of Rs 9.50 crore has been set aside through which 5,000 smart meters will be provided to the allottees of different categories in various parts of Noida in the first phase, the app would allow residents and industrial users to register complaints related to disruption in water supply, low pressure, overbilling and daily consumption, officials said. General manager of the Noida Authority, PK Kaushik said that the process to install the meters will be initiated in the fourth week of February. “We want to provide smart meters to the city’s households and allottees and are finalising the features. Talks are also on with the executives of the agency to finalise the design of the mobile app and its offerings.” On the other end, a dashboard and control room will be set up in the water and sewerage division of the Authority from where officials will be able to monitor the amount of water supplied to various sectors and locations though the metered network from its facilities. “We will not have to deploy the manpower to take the readings. The bill will be calculated as per consumption and will be available at our end as well as on the mobile app available for a user,” said RP Singh, deputy manager of the water and sewerage works department. Residents of the city finally heaved a sigh of relief. “Other cities in NCR are already offering metered water supply and options to monitor daily consumption. We have been waiting for the water meters for several years,” said RK Chauhan, a resident of Sector 51. Meanwhile, the Authority has also hired the services of WAPCOS Limited, a public sector undertaking, to survey the ranney wells in the city. Out of 11, seven ranney wells have become unproductive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/coming-soon-an-app-to-track-your-daily-water-use/articleshow/88983296.cms||---

The two projects have been developed on waste and construction dumpsites. The Sector 54 wetland has been developed on a 22-acre area at a cost of about Rs 5 crore as a part of the wetland restoration project of the old waste dumpsite. The adventure theme park in Sector 33 has been developed in 4.5 acres of land at a cost of nearly Rs 7 crore and will include tunnels, swings and an area for rock climbing activities for children. The first deadline for both the projects was in October last year. It got postponed due to heavy monsoon showers and delayed tendering process. A new deadline was set for December last year, but that too was missed owing to a ban on construction activities to curb severe pollution in the National Capital Region. “The Sector 54 wetland project is 99% complete and ready for the public,” said Mahendra Prakash, deputy director of horticulture, Noida Authority. According to officials, the wetland consists of free-flowing elevated walkways, sit-outs, elevated viewpoints, a pond (to be recharged with STP water), an open-air theatre for 150 people, etc. The dumpsite at Sector 54 had shifted to Sector 145 in 2019 following the NGT order after residents’ complaints. A wetland was then proposed to be built on the land. But the pandemic delayed the project. “This wetland restoration project aims to create usable space/park for the public from a wasteland. The landscape in this park is an effort to create ecological infrastructure in the region by transforming dead space into the lifeline of the city through the use of public amenities, parks, vegetation and treated water,” said an officer on special duty (OSD). Similarly, the Sector 33 Shivalik adventure theme park for children is also nearly 80% complete, officials say. “We have completed the landscape and created the elevated tunnel. Soon, we will plant the flora around it and create a mound over the tunnel for elements of rock climbing as the park is based on the theme of adventure. We will also place swings for children while sit-out benches, huts, toilets, boundary wall and parking for about 200 vehicles is complete.,” said the deputy director of the Authority’s horticulture department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/after-missing-2-deadlines-sector-54-wetland-shivalik-park-to-be-ready-by-next-month/articleshow/88983299.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Two Delhi residents in the vehicle were detained for failing to produce documents pertaining to the source and use of the money, police said. A probe has been initiated to determine if the money was meant for distribution during the assembly elections, they added. Akhilesh Kumar (40), a driver at an Ashok Vihar-based garment firm, and Bhim Sen (35), a field executive, were detained from the white Toyota Fortuner car after Rs 99,30,500 in cash was recovered from the vehicle, Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Noida, said.“During initial interrogation, Sen had identified himself as Arun Kumar. The duo also could not produce any document in connection with the money. They could not clearly state the source of money and its use,” the ACP said. The men, he added, claimed their employer had given them the bag full of cash and it was to be delivered to someone in Noida.“We are trying to reach their employer and question him in connection with the money, while the SUV, registered in the name of the employer’s wife, has been seized. We have also seized the cash and informed income tax officials to probe into the matter. A case will be registered if we find irregularities in connection with the seized money,” the ACP said, adding that police are probing if the money was meant to be used in the upcoming state election. The seven-phase state polls are set to commence from February 10 when the three constituencies —Noida, Jewar and Dadri — will cast the ballot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/99-3l-stashed-in-an-suv-police-to-probe-if-cash-was-for-votes/articleshow/88983306.cms||---

He also released the first list of candidates for 33 seats.Addressing a press meet in Greater Noida, Azad came down heavily on the SP’s top leadership for failing to reach a consensus on seat sharing but stopped short of naming former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. “Even if the SP now offers us 100 seats, we will not go with them,” the Azad Samaj Party chief said, adding that he would not shy away from contesting against UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath “if our party wants”.“Our strength is the lakhs of our party supporters. We have decided to fight the elections alone and if I give up today in front of our established leaders, then no youth would come forward to fight for change. We will not compromise with our self-respect,” Azad said.The Bhim Army chief also made it clear that he would not refrain from helping opposition parties post-polls by giving them support from outside to stop the BJP from returning to power. “I have never bowed down before the government. But I am also worried about the BJP coming to power again due to the lack of unity among opposition parties. If that happens, lakhs of youths like me will have to pay the price.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/azad-samaj-party-to-go-solo-releases-first-list/articleshow/88983308.cms||Aditya Dev

As Singh has tested positive for Covid, BJP MP Mahesh Sharma filed the papers on his behalf. However, Singh would be required to take the oath by January 21. In case, he does not recover by that time, he would have to complete the process in hospital and an affidavit would have to be sent to the returning officer.From the Noida seat, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Kriparam Sharma, AAP’s Pankaj Awana, Sarva Samaj Party’s Sanjeev Kumar Goswami and Saurabh Goyal, an Independent, filed their nominations.

He was admitted to a private hospital in Kaushambi on January 13 after testing positive for Covid. After he complained of difficulty in breathing, he was put on a ventilator.BSP district president Virendra Jatav confirmed Bansal was unwell and Shukla would contest the assembly elections in his place. Bansal was among candidates for 53 of the 58 seats in the first phase of the assembly elections announced by Mayawati on her birthday (January 15). Apart from Bansal, BSP had also announced the names of Haji Akil Chaudhary from Loni, Haji Ayyub Idrishi from Muradnagar and Dr Poonam Garg from Modinagar.Shukla held various BJP posts in western UP over the past three decades but had been unhappy for a while and resigned on Monday. He was apparently upset at not getting a ticket from BJP to contest elections. Shukla said he was disillusioned with BJP and despite working for the party for 27 years, his district was not getting due importance. “I had informed senior party officials about the issues – be it on educational institutions, water supply or infrastructure. My constituency never got anything in the past five years. I had no option but to leave the party,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/bsps-new-gzb-candidate-bjp-man-who-joined-party-a-day-ago/articleshow/88983311.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Bengaluru||Two planes fly close, major midair collision in Bengaluru skies averted||BENGALURU: People onboard two IndiGo flights had a miraculous escape when the aircraft were cleared to take off simultaneously in the same direction from the Kempegowda International Airport's parallel runways on January 7. Luckily, a radar controller spotted the potentially grave error and alerted pilots in both flight decks. One plane swerved sharply to the left and the other to right to avoid a collision. The serious situation did not end then as local authorities allegedly tried to hush it up by not reporting it to DGCA, possibly to avoid a probe, and punishment. Directorate General of Civil Aviation chief Arun Kumar has taken a very serious note of this incident. A probe has been ordered and Kumar told TOI "strict action will be taken against" those found responsible for it. The distance between the two airstrips at Bengaluru is not sufficient enough to allow parallel and simultaneous take-offs or landings. A certain time difference has to be maintained between flight movements for operational safety reasons. "On January 7, 2022, two IndiGo flights — 6E-455 to Kolkata and 6E-246 to Bhubaneswar — were involved in breach of separation at Bengaluru airport. That morning, Bengaluru airport's north runway was meant to be used for take-offs and south for landings. Later, the shift incharge (WSO) decided to have single runway operations by using the north runway for both arrivals and departures," said a senior DGCA official. At this time, the south runway was supposed to have been closed for operations. However, this was not conveyed to the south tower controller. As a result, the "south tower controller gave departure (clearance) to 6E-455 and at the same time north tower controller gave departure (nod) to 6E-246 without coordination. Both aircraft after departure were moving towards each other. The approach radar controller gave diverging heading and avoided a mid-air collision," the DGCA official said. Shockingly, Airports Authority of India (AAI, that provides air traffic control or ATC services) neither reported this incident nor was it recorded in any logbook. "The two planes were on the same course close to each other till they reached around 3,000 feet and the pilots were operating unaware of the danger. Luckily, a radar controller on the ground at Bengaluru airport spotted the flights just in time and alerted the two pilots. The Kolkata-bound aircraft swerved to the left and the other to the right avoiding a major mishap," said an official attached to the Bengaluru airport safety team on condition of anonymity. While Bengaluru ATC officials were not available for comment on the mid-air scare, sources confirmed that lack of coordination on the part of senior Bengaluru ATC officials on duty with the south and north runway had caused the confusion. Bangalore Airport International Limited (BIAL), that operates KIA, refused to comment as the matter was related to ATC. Attempts to reach general manager of Air Traffic Management (ATM) in Bengaluru airport also proved futile. A query to IndiGo Airlines didn't receive a response till Tuesday evening. But the query by TOI had the carrier reportedly take up the matter with the DGCA following which the aviation regulatory body ordered a department probe on Tuesday afternoon on one of the biggest air safety lapses at Bengaluru airport, sources confirmed. Captain Mohan Ranganathan, an aviation safety expert, termed the Bengaluru air incident as "disturbing." "Parallel runway takeoffs or landings are not permitted in India, including at the Bengaluru airport, and if that happens, it has to be in a staggered fashion. It is appreciable that the radar controller acted in time. The incident needs to be probed," he said.

---||Mumbai||Three Navy men die in explosion on warship in Mumbai dockyard||MUMBAI: Three Indian Navy sailors were killed and 11 sustained burn injuries in an explosion on board the Rajput-class destroyer, INS Ranvir, at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai on Tuesday. The explosion occurred around 4.45pm in an internal compartment of the destroyer, which was anchored at Mumbai on cross-coast deployment from Eastern Naval Command at Visakhapatnam. Though the board of inquiry ordered into the mishap will ascertain the exact details, sources said the blast was probably due to leakage of gas in the air-conditioning compartment of the 4,000-tonne warship. “Those who died were sitting in their cabin adjoining the AC compartment when the blast occurred. The cabin collapsed on them. The blast was not ammunition-related,” a source told TOI. Dockyard explosion: INS Ranvir packed with array of weaponsAdefence spokesperson, in turn,said: “The ship’s crew responded immediately and brought the situation under control. No majormaterial damage has been reported. A BoI has been investigated into the cause of the accident.” The families of the three deceased sailors, who were from Visakhapatnam, have been informed about the incident, said sources. The injured have been shifted to INHS Asvini hospital at Colaba. Colaba policewere in theprocess of registering an accidental death case. INS Ranvir is the fourth of thefive Rajput-class destroyers built for the Indian Navy in Russia which was commissioned in October 1986. Its home base is at Visakhapatnam. Theship was ona three-month cross-coast deployment and was in Mumbai’s Western Naval Command. “INS Ranvir has been on a cross-coast operational deployment from the Easter n Naval Command since November 2021 and was due to return to base port shortly,” said the spokesperson. The explosion occurred barely eight days prior to Republic Day. Earlier, on August 14, 2013, 18 naval personnel were kil- led when a seriesof blasts occurredinside the Indian Navy submarine Sindhurakshak a day before Independence Day. Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar had commanded INS Ranvir earlier in his career. It is packed with a wide array of weapons, including the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-navy-men-die-in-explosion-on-warship-in-city-dockyard/articleshow/88983320.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Covid deaths topped cancer, heart attack in 2020||MUMBAI: Covid displaced usual chart-toppers heart attack and cancer to become the leading cause of death in the city in 2020. Out of 1.1 lakh total deaths recorded in the first year of the pandemic, 11,105 (10%) were Covid fatalities, 8,576 (7.6%) were cancer deaths and 5,633 (5%) were heart attacks, according to recent data accessed through RTI. While deaths under most of the dozen heads separately mentioned dropped, three saw higher fatalities compared to previous years—kidney failure, malaria and typhoid. Coronary heart diseases and cancer have for decades remained at the top of the city’s death charts. ‘Heart attack deaths fall 35%, cancer 15% from 2018 to 2020’RTI data, based on death certificates issued by the BMC, show a 35% drop in heart attacks in 2020 in the city compared to 2018 (8,601) and nearly 4% compared to 2019 (5,849). Cancer deaths too dropped by 14%-15% in 2020 (8,576) compared to two pre-pandemic years of 2018 (10,073) and 2019 (9,958). Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit committee, said a drop in deaths due to communicable diseases and trauma was expected, but heart attack and cancer deaths simply cannot disappear; factors such as certification, deaths at home need to be looked into closely. Hospitals had seen a decline in cardiac events in the first few months of the pandemic because of a combination of factors and partly due to the fear of coming to hospitals, said cardiologist Dr Brian Pinto. The numbers normalised as everything started to open. The data showed deaths in Mumbai were up 22.7% in 2020 over the earlier year, and a vast majority of them is attributed—as in the earlier years—to ‘Other Diseases’. That head could include deaths due to septicaemia, bacterial diseases, intestinal infection, blood disorders, encephalitis, and poisoning, among others Of the additional 20,719 fatalities in 2020, Covid accounted for 11,105 deaths. Murad Banaji, a mathematician at the University of Middlesex, who has closely followed Mumbai’s graph, told TOI many of them were likely Covid deaths, probably among people who were never tested, especially in the early days. “A high fraction of these deaths probably occurred in the slums,” he said. The RTI data obtained by Chetan Kothari revealed that fatalities due to head injury saw a remarkable fall to 760 in 2020, down by 24% from 1,000 deaths of 2019. Burn injuries were under 100 in 2020, probably a first in decades. The lockdown made a dent in deaths due to accidents, a civic official said. Among communicable diseases, TB deaths declined by almost a quarter—2020 saw 3,719 deaths as opposed to 4,940 in 2018 and 4,899 in 2019. Dr Shripad Banavali, director, academics, at the Tata Memorial Hospital said cancer accounted for about 15% deaths in the pre-pandemic times which fell to 11.4% in the first pandemic year. “Many patients couldn’t be investigated and some missed treatment. Mumbai gets patients from outside, who are issued deaths certificates here if they pass away. Due to the lockdown many couldn’t come, which is underlined by a drop in registrations in the hospital,” he said. The 8% rise in kidney failure deaths in 2020 has surprised Dr Shrirang Bichu, head of nephrology at Bombay Hospital.“Kidney failure is rarely the cause of death. It’s often heart attacks or infections that kill kidney failure patients,” he said. Given that many died at home in the first wave, it is likely doctors certified their pre-existing condition.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC commutes death for 2 killer sisters in Maharashtra to life, blames lax babus||MUMBAI: Holding that an unexplained and gross delay of almost 8 years in disposal of their mercy petitions is “wholly due to the casual approach” of Maharashtra government officers, the Bombay high court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of sisters Renuka Shinde (50, left) and Seema Gavit (48) to life term for kidnapping 13 children and brutally killing five of them. The Kolhapur women had killed an 18-month-old kid by smashing his head. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, however, declined the sisters’ plea for orders to release them as they had completed 25 years in prison. The murders were committed between 1990 and 1996 and the two have been in custody since October 1996. In 2001, a trial court had convicted them; in 2004, the high court confirmed the death sentence awarded; and in 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the noose, observing the two had shown no remorse for the brutality. On July 7, 2014, the President of India had rejected their mercy petition. Prolonged delay in executing death rap has a dehumanising effect: HCThe Bombay high court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of sisters Renuka Shinde (50) and Seema Gavit (48) to life term for kidnapping 13 children and brutally killing five of them. On Tuesday, the Bombay HC said, “Life imprisonment is till (end of) life of the convict, unless the competent authority remits the remainder.” It added that the brutality in murdering innocent children “is beyond words to condemn” and this gravity and “depravity” will be factored in by the state if the sisters seek remission. “Though the procedure for deciding the mercy petitions mandates speed and expediency, the state machinery showed indifference and laxity at each stage of processing the files. That it took seven years only for the movement of files for such a grave issue is unacceptable when electronic communications were available to be used,” the HC said. In 2014, the sisters had filed a petition before the HC to commute their death rap to life imprisonment. Their counsel, Aniket Vagal, contended that the state’s unreasonable and unjustified delay in dealing with their mercy petitions violated their fundamental right to life and sought their release from their “solitary confinement”. They were on the death row in prison, in the “phansi (noose) yard”, said public prosecutor Aruna Pai, not solitary confinement. The HC said the yard’s name itself has “an ominous connotation” of a “brooding horror of hanging haunting the prisoner in the condemned cell”, as described once by Justice V R Krishna Iyer. The HC referred to the Supreme Court’s judgment in the case of Shatrughan Chauhan—the top court had held that this additional incarceration stemming from unexplained delay under such a situation is unconstitutional. Article 21, for right to life, of the Constitution of India extends to the stage of execution of the sentence, the SC had said. “Prolonged delay in execution of a sentence of death has a dehumanising effect and that circumstances beyond the petitioners’ control caused the delay in this case, and the resultant situation mandates commutation of their death sentences,” the HC said in its 59-page judgment. It expressed surprise at the state’s “vehement” submission that the sisters be executed even today despite the delay. The HC said the state’s argument “overlooks that it is the dereliction of its officers that is the cause for commuting the death sentence to that of life imprisonment”, adding that the “state represents the interest of society in the criminal justice system” and it “not only violated the constitutional rights of the petitioners but also failed the innocent victims of these heinous crimes”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-commutes-death-for-2-killer-sisters-in-maha-to-life-blames-lax-babus/articleshow/88983334.cms||Swati Deshpande

The director of students welfare, MUHS, Sandeep Kulkarni, said that if the student is not satisfied with the college’s inquiry report, they can approach the university. The university can then initiate an independent inquiry, he added. The allegations made by the student appeared to be related to discrimination and not under the purview of ragging, said the official. After the student filed a complaint on December 13, the college carried out an inquiry and submitted their report to the university. The report mentioned that the “student’s complaint did not amount to ragging, harassment (mental or physical) and humiliation in public”. Two students were, however, suspended for two weeks on grounds of ‘misconduct’. The student, who was not happy with the college’s inaction, filed a police complaint on Saturday against 17 persons, including a dozen students and a hostel warden.

The two-month-old cub has been named Veera. Meanwhile, Tuesday saw the zoo authorities name the male penguin chick hatched in August last year Oscar. He is a chick of the pair Molt (male) and Flipper (female). Zoo officials said Veera is kept within the exhibit section but in a separate area, also referred to as the kraal area by the veterinarians and zookeepers taking care of the big cats. Veera would be brought to the main exhibit area after a month. Till then, her mother Karishma would be busy teaching her skills such as playing, running and fighting. Currently, the cub is on a diet of buffalo meat and chicken. Due to the third Covid wave, the zoo is currently shut and the intervention of vets is limited. Dr Sanjay Tripathi, zoo director, said a tiger cub arrives after a 90-100-day gestation period. “Veera who arrived on November 14 last year has been kept under observation. She has to be administered the anti-rabies vaccine and also the Tricat vaccine. However, once she completes one dose of the anti-rabies vaccine by next month, we hope that she along with her mother will come into the main exhibit area. As female leopards are very aggressive, we are strictly monitoring her. Her father Shakti also keeps watching over her from the exhibit area,” said Tripathi. The tiger pair was brought to Mumbai from the Aurangabad zoo in February 2020, just before the nationwide lockdown in March that year. Zoo authorities have created a specialised viewing facility for visitors to get a close glimpse of the pair swimming underwater too. It was almost after 15 years that a pair of tigers had arrived at the Byculla zoo as the last tiger at the zoo had died in 2005. Last year saw two penguin chicks hatched at the zoo. One was hatched on May 1, 2021, and named Oreo and Oscar was hatched on August 18. The name was declared by mayor Kishori Pednekar. Oreo is a chick of the pair Donald and Daisy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-precious-births-at-zoo-get-their-names-tiger-cub-veera-penguin-chick-oscar/articleshow/88983343.cms||Richa Pinto

In the Mumbai region, Thane was among the top three RTOs in the state when it came to both vehicle registrations and revenue earnings, after Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The share of Mumbai vehicle registrations in 2021 stood around 10% of the state registrations. More than 19.2 lakh new vehicles hit the roads of Maharashtra in 2021 compared to over 17.7 lakh registered in 2020. The registrations in 2021 stood just 17% short of pre-Covid times in 2019, when total vehicle registrations numbered 23.1 lakh. In Mumbai, nearly 2 lakh vehicles were registered from January to December in 2021, of which the eastern suburbs (Wadala RTO) witnessed the highest registrations at 52,702. The city registered 57,652 new cars and 1.24 lakh new bikes, and the rest were other categories of vehicles, such as buses and trucks, in 2021. Dhakne said that despite the lockdown and restrictions during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, the 50 RTOs across the state collected a revenue of Rs 6,530 crore till January 13 in the ongoing financial year (2021-22). A transport expert said that during the pandemic last year, several citizens chose to have their own cars or bikes for travel. It was not just for short-distance travel, but people planned road trips with families in their SUVs, sedans and hatchbacks to go to their hometowns or to any tourist destination within or outside the state. The reason was simple: avoid going out with family in local or long-distance trains or by flights for fear of catching infection. Experts added that personal cars and bikes were also the best forms of social distancing compared to packed trains or buses. Thane, which was among the top three RTOs in the state, registered 82,401 vehicles and earned a revenue of Rs 483 crore last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/vehicle-registrations-show-8-growth-in-state-in-2021/articleshow/88985715.cms||Somit Sen

---||India||Open community kitchens, end hunger, SC tells Centre||NEW DELHI: Bemused by the Centre's deadpan statement that there are no starvation deaths in the country, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked whether the government seriously believed that the apex court would accept such a stand when statistics and data, both from domestic and foreign surveys till recently, indicated much to the country. When attorney general K K Venugopal qualified his statement by saying that the Centre's stand was based on the state governments' assertion about no starvation death in their geographical jurisdiction, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli said, "Hunger and malnutrition go hand in hand. Hunger has to be satiated. It is the duty of the governments to provide food to the section of the population that stays hungry. Community kitchens need to be spread far and wide, into the rural areas." CJI Ramana-led bench lamented that during the electioneering, most political parties talk of various freebies and welfare schemes. "Many states have popular community kitchen schemes. So, if they talk about spreading these kitchens far and wide, it would also be popular," it said. "They (the political parties) are promising so many freebies. The state governments are running many welfare schemes. Instead of giving the freebies, if they (political parties and governments) could frame schemes to provide food to the hungry, these would also be very popular among people," the bench said. Reading out the affidavits filed by various states, CJI Ramana told the AG that the states are willing to start community kitchen, even in remote rural areas, provided the Union government increased the allocation of food grains by 2% over and above the present quota and assisted financially in setting up the kitchen infrastructure with manpower. Venugopal said the Centre is ready to consider increasing the foodgrain allocation by 2% to meet the requirements for additional community kitchens but expressed Centre's inability to provide any financial assistance. "The Centre is running 131 social welfare schemes and spends lakhs of crores of rupees annually towards providing benefits to the needy. Additional financial resources needed for setting up of community kitchens has to be borne by the States from their own resources or it can be raised through additional taxations," he said. The CJI pointed out to th AG, from the National family Health Survey Report of the Union government, that as many as 26% of male children are malnourished, while the percentage of girls are higher at over 30%. "It is difficult for the court to frame a straitjacket model national community kitchen scheme as various regions have their own peculiarities and food habits. Cooking food and giving it to the hungry is a difficult task and requires considerable expertise," it said. The AG said that the grassroot level democratic governance institutions, the panchayats, would be best suited to run the community kitchens as they know which areas have high prevalence of malnutrition among the population. "The panchayats have land at their disposal and can run the community kitchens most effectively." The CJI-led bench asked the Union government to also study the manner in which the ISKCON runs its 'Akshay Patra' scheme to provide free food to poor children in many states. When petitioner's counsel Ashima Mandla said an expert committee needs to be appointed to frame a broader scheme that would require proper identification of starvation deaths and a financial module for taking remedial measures, the SC said it does not want to delve into broader policy issues and underlined the need to provide immediate succor to the hungry. The bench directed the states to provide all statistics and data about malnutrition and starvation deaths, the area where its prevalence is higher as well as other details in an affidavit within two weeks. The SC said these affidavits would be provided to the attorney general for consultation with the Union government officials for framing of a scheme in the next 10 days. It posted the matter for hearing after three weeks. CJI Ramana reminded the AG that the majority of the states in their affidavits have said that they were willing to widen the reach of community kitchens provided the Centre framed a model scheme and gave foodgrain support.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/open-community-kitchens-end-hunger-sc-tells-centre/articleshow/88983346.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The accused, Vishal Suresh Chavan alias Anuragh Chavan, made fictitious accounts on various matrimonial sites and would court and then dupe women of money with false promises of marriage. With the arrest of Chavan, the police are believed to have solved more than a dozen cases of cheating on various matrimonial sites. Chavan, who hails from Dombivli, has been booked under the IPC for cheating, as well as under the Information Technology Act. The complaint was filed by a 28-year-old woman who was duped of Rs2.5 lakh by Chavan, who posed as a high-ranking executive working for a multi-national company abroad. They exchanged mobile numbers and started chatting. The accused later told the victim that he was heading to Mumbai to finalise their marriage. He claimed that his debit card was blocked and he urgently needed money, which she transferred.  There are four similar offences registered at Sion, Versova and Narpoli police stations. Cops said Chavan cited various reasons to different victims in order to extract money from them. “Till now, we have come across around 10 to 12 complaints against him and are requesting other victims to also come forward and lodge their complaints,’’ said Sangramsingh Nishandar, DCP (crime). Interestingly, when the police team — consisting of Priya Thorat, Sudhir Jadhav, sub-inspectors Amogsidh Olekar and Ramdas Kadam — went to arrest him at his residence in Kalyan, they found his door locked from outside, even though he was sitting inside. He could not dupe the cops though, and was apprehended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/b-tech-grad-dupes-dozen-women-on-matrimonial-sites/articleshow/88983348.cms||Ahmed Ali

A manhunt has been launched to nab him. The accused and 28-year-old complainant have two children. They used to live in Thane. The woman was being harassed physically and mentally by her husband and in-laws. Fed up of the torture, she returned to her maternal home in Malad East with the kids, said cops. She submitted an application to the Kurar police station last year, stating that her husband and in-laws were demanding an apartment from her. “We sent a letter to her husband, summoning him to the police station for inquiry,” an officer said. The accused persuaded her to not pursue the police complaint further for the sake of their children, and kept urging her to return to him. He was enraged when she did not do so. Earlier this month, her sister was checking WhatsApp status updates when she was appalled on seeing the video clip uploaded by the accused. It was a video clip of his wife bathing. “The accused had filmed her while they were still together. The complainant had no idea that he had uploaded the clip on social media for everyone to view,” said the officer. The victim’s sister took screenshots and shared it with the complainant. Shocked, the complainant approached the Kurar police station again. This time, an FIR was registered against the accused under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act for intimidation and breach of trust. The police said the accused is employed in a senior position with a private company and they are tracking down his location.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/man-leaks-wifes-nude-video-on-social-media/articleshow/88983349.cms||---

At present, commuters who use the recently introduced ‘Chalo’ mobile app have to purchase a ticket online, but the same needs to be validated in the bus by the conductor who issues a paper ticket. “In the next few days, we will eliminate paper tickets completely for the mobile app. Those purchasing e-tickets will need to validate the same with the conductor during the journey, but the conductor in turn will issue an e-receipt in your mobile phone. This e-receipt will be just like a valid paper ticket,” he said.  This will be environment friendly, minimise use of paper rolls and add to passenger convenience. Also, the BEST plans to introduce a system wherein you can book a ticket on the ‘Chalo’ app from one point to another and board a bus of any route in that direction. At present, one has to mention the “route number” of the bus while booking a ticket. “In near future, we are improving our app wherein commuters need not mention any route number, but can board any bus on the same route to reach the destination,” another senior official said. This decision has come close on the heels of a commuter complaining on Tuesday that he had booked a ticket on a particular bus route number, but did not get that bus.

Waze has sought to strike down Section 15 (1) of the UAPA as unconstitutional and in violation of articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and liberty) or to read it down. The petition has said the UAPA nowhere defines the expression ‘other explosive substances’ and hence “Section 15 (1) suffers from vagueness, rendering it manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable and unconstitutional”. It added that “expressions in penal provisions cannot be nebulous in meaning” and the section must be read to mean “any substance of the type of ‘bombs’ and ‘dynamite’ which must be a complete device capable of exploding”. Waze has also challenged the September 2 order by ministry of home affairs for sanction of his prosecution under UAPA as being without application of mi-nd and in violation of his fundamental rights. He claimed no case was made out from chargesheet for invoking UAPA against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/waze-challenges-sanction-under-uapa-in-antilia-case/articleshow/88983359.cms||Swati Deshpande

Justice Chandiwal commission has been appointed to probe into the allegations of corruption made by Singh against Deshmukh. In his eight-page letter to the CM, Singh had alleged that in February 2021, Deshmukh had told then assistant police inspector Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants owners for him. “I had a meeting with the CM about Singh’s letter to him. He did not specifically desire comments from me; there was no specific elicit made by the CM,” Deshmukh said, who was cross-examined by Yogesh Naidu, counsel for Waze, who has been dismissed from service. Deshmukh claimed that when he read Singh’s letter, he realized that it was based on hearsay and in retaliation for his transfer from the police commissioner’s post. “If Singh wanted to make any grievance, he could have done in advance, but he chose to give the letter, which is false, malicious and politically motivated to his knowledge and the contents were only on hearsay,” Deshmukh claimed. “I did not initiate any legal action against Singh in view of the letter... and even against Waze...since action was already contemplated before the Bombay high court and Supreme Court. We had a discussion with the advocate general. Anukul Seth, counsel for Singh, and Shekhar Jagtap, counsel for Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande, declined to cross-examine him. On March 5, 2021, when the legislative assembly was in session, the House was disrupted and adjourned at least seven times after the members demanded action against Waze for the incidents arising out of the Antilia bomb scare and murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran. Deshmukh had made a statement in the House that stern action would be taken against Waze. “I had made the statement as home minister...and it was communicated to the CM. I had even suggested to the CM to initiate the inquiry into the allegations, which he did,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/deshmukh-cm-had-not-sought-my-view-on-param-birs-letter/articleshow/88983361.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

There are a total of 13,000 encroachments on railway land in CR’s Mumbai divison. A fortnight ago, the Supreme Court had directed that action should be taken against bureaucrats of the central government, the state government and local urban bodies whose derelication of duty had led to illegal occupation of public land. The additional solicitor general had submitted before the Supreme Court that it will initiate a pan-India drive which can be monitored by the apex court. A senior CR official said, “We have been advised by the railway ministry to take action against the encroachers after the SC expressed its disappointment on the issue.” Even though Central Railway has served the notices, eviction can only be initiated after city police provides security. The notices have caused panic among the residents who have approached local politicians. State housing minister Jitendra Awhad issued a statement, saying, “These people are staying there for 70 years. The railway has issued a seven-day eviction notice by taking an inhuman approach. The railway should make alternate arrangements before taking any action or else we will stand by these people.” The CR said removal of encroachments is necessary for future expansion of projects, smooth running of trains and keeping the tracks garbage-free.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cr-starts-serving-eviction-notices-on-encroachers/articleshow/88983362.cms||Manthank Mehta

The HC in its order said, “Bansal shall also consider the aspect of safety and security of the public, who reside in the vicinity of Juhu Airport, and throw light as to whether commissioning of the Metro rail line of the MMRDA would in any way affect aircraft operations at Juhu Airport.’’ Adjourning a PIL challenging the NOC for the Metro 2B line to February 28, the HC permitted MMRDA to “carry on preparatory work for the metro rail line, viz Geotechnical investigation and utility identification’’ till further orders and clarified “apart from such preparatory work, no other work may be carried out without the prior leave of this court at the site.’’ The PIL filed by Harit Desai challenged the NOC granted by Airports Authority of India (AAI) to MMRDA for overground Metro rail line within the Funnel Zone to the east of the approach and take off climb surface of runways 26 and 08, respectively, of Juhu Airport. The NOC was contrary to the ministry’s (height restrictions for safeguarding of aircraft operations) rules, 2015, submitted Desai’s counsel Nishant Thakkar. The rail corridor is from DN Nagar, Andheri (West) to Mankhurd. The court after also hearing AAI counsel, Sandeep Marne and, the state advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, wanted to know if the NOC conforms to the rules. Observing that since it does not have expertise to examine the technicalities involved “but at the same time the concern raise in this PIL appears to be serious,’’ the HC sought the expert assistance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/metro-height-at-airport-hc-seeks-aviation-secys-report/articleshow/88983366.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Prolonged delay in executing death rap has a dehumanising effect: HC||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of sisters Renuka Shinde (50) and Seema Gavit (48) to life term for kidnapping 13 children and brutally killing five of them.On Tuesday, the Bombay HC said, “Life imprisonment is till (end of) life of the convict, unless the competent authority remits the remainder.” It added that the brutality in murdering innocent children “is beyond words to condemn” and this gravity and “depravity” will be factored in by the state if the sisters seek remission.“Though the procedure for deciding the mercy petitions mandates speed and expediency, the state machinery showed indifference and laxity at each stage of processing the files. That it took seven years only for the movement of files for such a grave issue is unacceptable when electronic communications were available to be used,” the HC said. In 2014, the sisters had filed a petition before the HC to commute their death rap to life imprisonment. Their counsel, Aniket Vagal, contended that the state’s unreasonable and unjustified delay in dealing with their mercy petitions violated their fundamental right to life and sought their release from their “solitary confinement”.They were on the death row in prison, in the “phansi (noose) yard”, said public prosecutor Aruna Pai, not solitary confinement. The HC said the yard’s name itself has “an ominous connotation” of a “brooding horror of hanging haunting the prisoner in the condemned cell”, as described once by Justice V R Krishna Iyer. The HC referred to the Supreme Court’s judgment in the case of Shatrughan Chauhan—the top court had held that this additional incarceration stemming from unexplained delay under such a situation is unconstitutional.Article 21, for right to life, of the Constitution of India extends to the stage of execution of the sentence, the SC had said. “Prolonged delay in execution of a sentence of death has a dehumanising effect and that circumstances beyond the petitioners’ control caused the delay in this case, and the resultant situation mandates commutation of their death sentences,” the HC said in its 59-page judgment. It expressed surprise at the state’s “vehement” submission that the sisters be executed even today despite the delay.The HC said the state’s argument “overlooks that it is the dereliction of its officers that is the cause for commuting the death sentence to that of life imprisonment”, adding that the “state represents the interest of society in the criminal justice system” and it “not only violated the constitutional rights of the petitioners but also failed the innocent victims of these heinous crimes”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/prolonged-delay-in-executing-death-rap-has-a-dehumanising-effect-hc/articleshow/88983369.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Court acquits UP youth in 2016 Taj hotel bullet case||MUMBAI: A youth who was arrested by the Colaba police on the allegations that a bullet was found in his baggage inside the Taj hotel was acquitted by the court after the prosecution failed to prove the charges. The police also failed to obtain the requisite sanction under the Arms Act from the competent authority. The 8th court of Metropolitan Magistrate R M Nerlikar acquitted Mohammed Furkhan Irfan, a native of UP who was arrested in 2016 from the main entrance of the hotel in Colaba. The prosecution case was that the accused was found in possession of an 8mm live cartridge without having any valid licence and thereby had committed an offence punishable under Ssection 3,25 of the Arms Act. After completion of investigations, the police submitted a charge-sheet against the accused. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed he had been framed. During the cross-examination too, witnesses did not support the police theory. “Therefore, it cannot be said that the alleged bullet was possessed by the accused and the same was seized from his possession. Furthermore, the prosecution has not obtained the requisite sanction from the competent authority in view of Section 39 of Arms Act, which is mandatory. Non-compliance of the said provision is fatal to the prosecution case. Considering all these aspects of the above discussions, it cannot be said that on the alleged date and time the accused was found in possession of a bullet and thus committed the alleged offence,” the court remarked. The court directed Furkhan to furnish fresh bail bond of Rs 15,000 and directed that the seized property, one live cartridge, be sent to the district magistrate for its disposal after the appeal period is over. Furkhan’s lawyer Sunil Pandey stated that Furkhan was falsely implicated to save another person. “My client had come to the hotel for a job interview. Also there was no screen shot of scanning machine at the hotel and also no CCTV footage was given to police,” said Pandey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/court-acquits-up-youth-in-16-taj-hotel-bullet-case/articleshow/88983371.cms||Ahmed Ali

A government resolution suspending Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) vendors was issued on Tuesday, though the cabinet had approved the proposal last month. In 2016, then CM Devendra Fadnavis had ruled that all recruitment exams would be conducted online. MahaIT set up the Mahaportal and conducted a few exams, but due to poor manpower resources declared its inability to continue the exercise. In February 2020, it was decided to conduct exams through OMR vendors.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Girl didn’t die of post-vax complication, says panel||MUMBAI: The BMC on Monday said that a state-level sub-committee of medical experts has ruled that a 15-year-old girl, about whom a social media post had gone viral allegedly attributing her death to Covid-19 vaccination, did not die due to vaccination. “On January 14, a man spread false news on Twitter that a 15-year-old girl had died due to vaccination. After this news, the case was thoroughly investigated. The committee has given a clear opinion that the death was not due to vaccination,” the BMC said on Monday. An urgent meeting of a 15-member sub-committee of medical experts, including a cardiologist, neurologist, paediatrician and pathologist, was held on Monday to review the death. The committee found that the teenager was consulting a doctor for the past two months for anxiety issues. Dr Mukesh Agrawal, who heads the Mumbai committee to audit adverse events, said the girl had been consulting a doctor for symptoms of breathlessness and vomiting, which were presumably triggered by her upcoming exams. “In deaths related to vaccination, an allergic shock would kill the person immediately or within a few hours. Her death occurred after four days of vaccination. It was also unlikely to be linked to a thrombotic event as that usually occurs in the second week after vaccination,” he said. The committee, however, couldn’t reach a conclusion on what the teenager died of. “No autopsy was conducted. Therefore, only the doctor who certified her death could shed some light on what the girl was experiencing and was being treated for,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, saying they have written to the doctor, who certified her death, to share the details. Gomare also said that the parents have insisted that the death was not due to vaccination but natural causes. Covid vaccination of beneficiaries in the age group of 15 to 17 years has started from January 3. To date, 1,47,944 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Mumbai and Gomare said no serious adverse events have been reported. BMC officials said they are now tracing the Delhi-based doctor named Dr Tarun Kothari who posted on Twitter a photo message on January 13 saying the girl died shortly after getting her Covid vaccination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/girl-didnt-die-of-post-vax-complication-says-panel/articleshow/88983374.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid-19 deaths in third wave nowhere close to second wave casualties||MUMBAI: Daily Covid-19 deaths may be inching upwards in the state but the numbers are nowhere close to the casualties seen during the raging second wave. An analysis by the state has found there were 25,787 deaths reported between April 11 to May 1, 2021, considered the peak of the Delta-driven second wave and the deadliest in the pandemic thus far. In the first week starting April 11, there were 6,798 deaths, which jumped by 38% in the second week to touch 9,358. It further rose to 9,631 deaths in the third week ending May 1 before the fatalities started to decline. In several weeks after, the state carried out reconciliation adding hundreds of unreported deaths, indicating that many more died in those weeks. In comparison, the third wave has not seen an exponential jump in fatalities yet despite the surge in cases. The state data showed that in the three weeks between December 27 to January 16, when cases raced past 5.5lakh, confirmed deaths were 314. If week-on-week increase is considered, deaths rose from 59 between December 27 to January 2, then nearly doubled to 120 and touched 135 in the third week ending January 16. The case fatality rate in this period was 0.05% compared to the peak second wave's 1.95%. Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer, said the second wave with nearly 7lakh active cases was much bigger. “The third wave is already declining in the big districts such as Mumbai,” he said, adding that just about 1% of active cases are critical now. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, said the numbers suggest that even if cases have multiplied in the last three weeks, deaths have remained lower. In the second wave, there were also deaths reported among children, young adults and people under 30. Such a trend is not seen in the third wave yet, he added. At the Government Medical College in Nagpur, majority of hospitalisations are of elderly with complications such as diabetes. “During the second wave, young people used to come gasping for breath,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, head of pulmonary medicine at GMC, Nagpur. “There are almost negligible people on ventilators ,” said Meshram, adding deaths are due to delay in seeking care in many cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-19-deaths-in-3rd-wave-nowhere-close-to-2nd-wave-casualties/articleshow/88983375.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The move comes after the jail authorities had stopped physical meeting at prisons due to the increasing Covid cases. The video call facility was first started in July 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and it gained popularity. However, soon after the Covid cases reduced the physical meetings between prisoners and their families began in October last year. The smart phone facilities have been set up once again in prisons. “An inmate can talk to his relatives for 10 minutes a week,” said a jail official. As procedure, an inmate gives his family member's mobile number and a call is made on it. The conversation takes place in presence of jail police personnel. “The entry of all the visitors in jail premises has been prohibited since three four days due to Covid cases,” said a jail officer. Meanwhile, all the new inmates are being examined for Covid and kept at the two temporary facilities in Mumbai before sending them to the prisons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/video-calling-facility-set-up-again-in-jail-for-inmates-family/articleshow/88983376.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The government is under pressure from a section of parents and school associations who have petitioned them to reopen schools. In some parts of the state, schools opened on Tuesday, but after meeting leaders, Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA) decided to put it off till the cabinet takes a decision. The Parents Association of Mumbai along with MESTA have written an open letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and BMC commissioner I S Chahal seeking reopening of schools from January 24. In view of the third wave, schools have been shut in the state till February 15. The associations have demanded that when the entire city is open, why has the government shut schools. Health minister Rajesh Tope who met a delegation from MESTA in Aurangabad urged them to not take any steps that would violate Covid curbs. “Although it is very clear the rate of infection among children is low and there is rarely any fatality, the only concern is that kids can act as carriers and infect senior citizens at home. However, all viewpoints—of parents, school associations, task force and other experts—will be considered in the cabinet this week and a review could be taken,” said Tope. “We will wait for the cabinet decision. If we still don’t get a favourable reply, we will carry out a peaceful march outside Mantralaya by following Section 144 restrictions,” said Vinod Kulkarni, general secretary, MESTA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cabinet-may-weigh-school-opening-issue-on-thursday/articleshow/88983377.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Little improvement in registration of home tests despite civic, FDA orders||MUMBAI: Despite orders from the FDA and the civic body asking people to register their reports of at-home tests, there appears to be negligible improvement on the ground.  The BMC till date has been informed of 1,17,182 at-home tests, of which 3,859 people had tested positive. Moreover, these numbers are of total tests done between August 2021 and January 17, 2022. FDA officials said the real numbers are likely to be manifold high as chemists have sold kits in thousands.  A civic official said early in December before the third wave hit, barely 200-300 tests were communicated to them in a day. In fact, barring four days, the numbers reported used to be under 1,000. “That started to go up to 3,000 to 3,500 reports every day in January. So, it will be incorrect to say that reporting of self-tests has not improved,” said the official. TOI had previously written how companies have sold more than 5 lakh kits in a span of seven days.  The official said manufacturers and chemists have also started emailing them details of people who have bought the kits as well as their sale records. The contact numbers of buyers are shared with ward warrooms so that they can be contacted about the test results. The checks were brought in after doctors raised concerns of huge underreporting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/little-improvement-in-registration-of-home-tests-despite-civic-fda-orders/articleshow/88983378.cms||---

According to the BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard wards of H west ( Bandra,Khar and Santacruz) and K west (Andheri-west, Vile Parle) have the highest growth rate of Covid positive cases at 1.71% and 1.67% respectively. This is above the average growth rate of the city which stands at 1.22%. Civic corporator from H west ward BJP’s Swapna Mhatre said that even though growth rate of cases maybe high but there isn’t any kind of panic. “Most are mild cases are those living in buildings and are choosing to quarantine at home. They even prefer that the sanitisation works of their flat and area around done by the civic body is completed after their quarantine period ends,” said Mhatre. In K wear ward also the situation is the same. Many who have tested before taking national and international flights were also found to be positive said officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/parts-of-bandra-andheri-report-highest-covid-positive-cases/articleshow/88983379.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mucormycosis case surfaces again, now due to uncontrolled diabetes||MUMBAI: Mucormycosis, the black fungal infection that worsened the impact of the second Delta wave in India, hasn’t disappeared from the Covid wards in the city. A 70-year-old admitted to a south Mumbai hospital with Covid on January 12 developed mucormycosis on the third day and needed an elaborate debridement (removal of affected tissues) surgery on cheeks and around the eyes. “He is likely to need surgery as well,’’ said Dr Honey Savla, internal medicine specialist with Wockhardt Hospital near Mumbai Central station. Unlike in the second wave, the cause for mucormycosis in this case isn’t misuse of steroids but uncontrolled diabetes. “When the patient was brought to hospital with general fatigue, his blood sugar level was 532,” said Savla. “He has no pneumonia in his lungs and isn’t on steroids, but he is our first patient with this condition during the third wave.” Swelling on his cheeks and around his eyelids led doctors to suspect the fungal infection.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mucormycosis-case-surfaces-again-now-due-to-uncontrolled-diabetes/articleshow/88983380.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Heart attack deaths fall 35%, cancer 15% from 2018 to 2020’||Mumbai: RTI data, based on death certificates issued by the BMC, show a 35% drop in heart attacks in 2020 in the city compared to 2018 (8,601) and nearly 4% compared to 2019 (5,849). Cancer deaths too dropped by 14%-15% in 2020 (8,576) compared to two pre-pandemic years of 2018 (10,073) and 2019 (9,958).Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit committee, said a drop in deaths due to communicable diseases and trauma was expected, but heart attack and cancer deaths simply cannot disappear; factors such as certification, deaths at home need to be looked into closely.Hospitals had seen a decline in cardiac events in the first few months of the pandemic because of a combination of factors and partly due to the fear of coming to hospitals, said cardiologist Dr Brian Pinto. The numbers normalised as everything started to open.The data showed deaths in Mumbai were up 22.7% in 2020 over the earlier year, and a vast majority of them is attributed—as in the earlier years—to ‘Other Diseases’. That head could include deaths due to septicaemia, bacterial diseases, intestinal infection, blood disorders, encephalitis, and poisoning, among othersOf the additional 20,719 fatalities in 2020, Covid accounted for 11,105 deaths. Murad Banaji, a mathematician at the University of Middlesex, who has closely followed Mumbai’s graph, told TOI many of them were likely Covid deaths, probably among people who were never tested, especially in the early days. “A high fraction of these deaths probably occurred in the slums,” he said.The RTI data obtained by Chetan Kothari revealed that fatalities due to head injury saw a remarkable fall to 760 in 2020, down by 24% from 1,000 deaths of 2019. Burn injuries were under 100 in 2020, probably a first in decades. The lockdown made a dent in deaths due to accidents, a civic official said. Among communicable diseases, TB deaths declined by almost a quarter—2020 saw 3,719 deaths as opposed to 4,940 in 2018 and 4,899 in 2019.Dr Shripad Banavali, director, academics, at the Tata Memorial Hospital said cancer accounted for about 15% deaths in the pre-pandemic times which fell to 11.4% in the first pandemic year. “Many patients couldn’t be investigated and some missed treatment. Mumbai gets patients from outside, who are issued deaths certificates here if they pass away. Due to the lockdown many couldn’t come, which is underlined by a drop in registrations in the hospital,” he said.The 8% rise in kidney failure deaths in 2020 has surprised Dr Shrirang Bichu, head of nephrology at Bombay Hospital.“Kidney failure is rarely the cause of death. It’s often heart attacks or infections that kill kidney failure patients,” he said. Given that many died at home in the first wave, it is likely doctors certified their pre-existing condition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/heart-attack-deaths-fall-35-cancer-15-from-2018-to-2020/articleshow/88983381.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The group’s IT services flagship TCS has assumed the Toronto Marathon title from Scotiabank, the main backer of the running event for several years. TCS didn’t reveal the deal size for the five-year title rights of the Toronto event, but it said last year that it will spend $320 million on marathon sponsorships over an eight-year period. Prior to Tuesday’s development, TCS had joined hands with sister concern Jaguar Land Rover to be the title sponsor of Britain’s Formula E racing team. Last year, it renewed the title rights of the New York Marathon until 2029 and won the headline sponsorship of the London Marathon from 2022 to 2027. Bagging the title rights of the Toronto Marathon will help TCS to boost its image among employees and customers in Canada, a market it entered in 1991. It employs about 7,000 people in Canada. TCS, which will also be the tech partner of the Toronto running event, will develop an app to support in-person and virtual runners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tcs-bags-title-sponsorship-of-toronto-marathon/articleshow/88983383.cms||---

The state governments have seen their borrowing costs move up by 9-14 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) from last month.The RBI had announced an auction of state bonds (state development loans, or SDLs) to take place on Tuesday. These were issued by 12 state governments, totalling Rs 20,659 crore. The tenure on these bonds ranged from five years to 20 years.The biggest borrower, the state of Uttar Pradesh (at Rs 3,000 crore) sold its 10-year bonds at a cut-off yield of 7.24%. Among other states that opted for the issue of a 10-year paper, West Bengal priced its bonds at a cut-off yield of 7.23% compared to 7.14% last fortnight. Bihar’s 10-year was at 7.24% and Goa & Manipur sold at 7.23%. On January 4, the 10-year yield was 7.10%. Therefore, the overall cost has gone up by 0.14%.“Bond yields are spiking upwards on inflation as well as budgetary concerns. The borrowing programme for next year is under focus. And, with redemptions being around Rs 4 lakh crore, there will once again be a large borrowing programme,” said Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis. He pointed out that oil prices were adding to inflationary pressures.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-govts-borrowing-costs-surge-as-yields-rise/articleshow/88983385.cms||---

At 70, they are the lowest-ranked team in Group A, but India are not taking Iran, nicknamed as ‘Melli Banovan,’ lightly ahead of their Women’s AFC Asian Cup opener against the West Asian team at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday evening.Placed in a group with China PR, Iran and Chinese Taipei, the ‘Blue Tigresses’ know that if they beat Iran first up then they’ll have a good chance of going through to the quarterfinals of the competition. A quarterfinal spot will almost ensure at least an intercontinental playoffs berth for the 2023 FIFA World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. It would give India some confidence that they had beaten Iran 1-0 in Bhubaneshwar the last time the two teams met.At a pre-tournament virtual press conference of all the coaches and captains in India 2022 on Tuesday, India women’s team head coach Thomas Dennerby said, “We are happy with the preparations as we have been working hard for a long time. We have spent a long time working together with more than 200 sessions — tactical, technical and physical. We feel we are ready. Our target is to qualify for the quarterfinals, and we think it’s a realistic target. Our first target is to get to quarterfinals. We think we have a realistic chance to do that. Iran is going to be a real tough game. We have followed them through videos and they are really a fighting (team).”A major strength of Iran, according to Dennerby, is their ability to defend. “They have a strong defence. They defend very well around their box. It is going to be a challenge for us to score. It is not going to be an easy game. We are hoping that with some creative and good passing game, we can break down their defence. We have a lot of players that can create chances and score goals. We have to be good all through the match.” he said.“We’re very excited and happy to take part in the Women’s AFC Asian Cup. This is the first time that we’re participating in this tournament. We’ve trained hard. We’ll of course do our best to be successful at this level,” Iran captain Behnaz Taharkhaani said. Five teams from the tournament will directly qualify for the 2023 women’s FIFA World Cup while another two will make it to the intercontinental playoffs. “It is a big challenge but also a big opportunity. If we qualify for the quarterfinals, we have a chance to qualify for the FIFA World Cup next year and that will be huge,” said captain Ashalata Devi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dennerby-eyes-qf-berth-in-afc-asian-cup/articleshow/88983386.cms||---

The Rabale Police has registered an FIR after one victim Shrikrushna Jawale, a Thane resident, lodged a complaint against the accused Manish Painter on January 14.  Jawale has stated in his FIR that in October 2017, his friend Manoj Sakpal told him that Manish Painter has claimed that he has contacts in BCCI and can help in getting jobs like guards, ground staff and in the maintenance department. In February 2018, Jawale and Sakpal met Painter at his row house in Airoli and also at Airoli railway station, where Painter took Rs 50,000 cash from Jawale for providing a job as assistant ground staff supervisor in BCCI. Painter even gave him an appointment letter on a BCCI letterhead, with signature of BCCI CEO Vinod Rai. The letter stated his appointment on April 24, 2018 with an annual salary package of Rs 5.29 lakh. Thereafter, the painter started giving excuses to Jawale that his appointment will be confirmed after a proposal is tabled in the BCCI board meeting which he claimed was postponed as the BCCI chief has gone to Delhi and then abroad. The painter gained Jawale's trust by showing emails received from BCCI officials DK Jain, Saurav Ganguly, Vinod Rai and Jay Shah. As the painter daily dialed about the job in BCCI for the past three years and recently started avoiding his calls, Jawale inquired about his credentials and learnt that Painter had similarly duped 10 other unemployed youths. Hence, he registered a FIR against Painter on January 14. DCP (crime) Suresh Mengade said, "The probe into the criminal case against accused Manish Painter has been transferred to the crime branch unit-1. However, Painter has gone absconding."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/man-booked-for-duping-11-jobless-youths-of-5-5l/articleshow/88983387.cms||George Mendonca
---||Navi-mumbai||FIR filed over destruction of mangroves in Kharghar||NAVI MUMBAI: Acting swiftly on Kharghar residents’ complaints about massive destruction of mangroves and a wetland site in the intertidal area, state revenue officials have lodged an FIR under the Environment Protection Act. TOI had earlier reported that JCBs were used to crush aquatic flora, while bunds were created around a wetland in order to do prawn or shrimp farming. Revenue circle officer Pandurang Kachre stated in the FIR filed at the Kharghar police station that a team of revenue and forest officials had conducted an on-the-spot site inspection on Saturday, following media reports of mangrove destruction near Vastu Vihar housing society. They have also urged the mangrove cell and district collectorate to take urgent steps. TimesViewThe FIR was filed only after Kharghar activists raised a hue and cry. Such eco-crimes must be curbed quickly and local authorities need to act proactively in safeguarding these eco-sensitive zones. Such cases must be fast-tracked, and violators and land grabbers booked.NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan (SEAP) had earlier complained to the chief minister about the destruction of mangroves and the illegal prawn culture ponds, and the CMO had, in turn, asked the forest department to further investigate. Simultaneously, Raigad district collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar asked the sub-divisional officer to probe the issue. Appreciating the prompt action as a good start, NatConnect Foundation director B N Kumar said, “The local police should take the case to its logical conclusion and trace the culprits. The vehicles used to level the ground at the spot could provide vital clues.” Nandakumar Pawar, head of SEAP, pointed out that the creek and the mangrove fall under CRZ-1 and no one has any business tampering with the free flow of tidal water. The organised, planned prawn and crab culture ponds cutting into mangroves is an act of certain vested interests and not ordinary fishing community members, Pawar said. Mangroves serve as carbon sinks and rainwater forests, as well as a hub for biodiversity. Recently, golden jackals were noticed at Kharghar. Local activist Nareshchandra Singh said, “We have been complaining to the authorities for a long time and no action has been taken despite several inspections,” he said. The destruction at sectors 17 and 25 is an ongoing activity, Singh said, and pointed out that the National Wetland Inventory Assessment clearly shows that miscreants drained out water from these areas and converted them into fish ponds .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/fir-filed-over-destruction-of-mangroves-in-kharghar/articleshow/88983388.cms||Vijay Singh

Among the dead Maoists were two men and one woman whose identities are yet to be established. The Greyhounds commando, who suffered a bullet injury, was shifted to Hyderabad and his condition is stable, police officials said. This is the second setback for Maoists in less than one month. Six Maoists were earlier killed in December last week by Bhadradri-Kothagudem district police on the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border. Police said Tuesday's gun battle happened during combing operation, which had started on Sunday, following intel that Telangana Maoist state committee members had camped near Mulugu-Bijapur districts. "We had information that they were planning to abduct politicians, sarpanches and contractors. A few days ago, on Chhattisgarh side a sarpanch was abducted. The exchange of fire took place during a joint operation of security forces," Mulugu SP Sangram Singh Patil told TOI. "The deceased Maoists must be members of Telangana state committee. But till we get confirmation from their respective family members, we cannot identify them," a cop said. Police suspect that Telangana Maoist state committee senior leader Sudhakar was also there among those who had camped in the area. The joint combing operation included Telangana police, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Chhattisgarh police. Following the exchange of fire, police continued the combing in search of scattered Maoists hiding in the forest. Police seized 1SLR, 1 INSAS riffle, 1 single-bore weapon and 10 rocket launchers from the encounter site.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/3-maoists-killed-in-gun-battle-with-forces-on-chgarh-border/articleshow/88983389.cms||---

Dark matter forms the skeleton on which galaxies form, evolve, and merge. Pointing out that out of plane bending of the bar in barred galaxies (a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars) is a rare violent bar thickening mechanism known as buckling, the scientists say trillions of galaxies in our Universe have different shapes and sizes, which are determined by the motion of their stars. “Our own galaxy — the Milky Way — is a disk galaxy made up of stars moving in circular orbits around the center in a flattened disk, with a dense collection of the stars at the center called the bulge. These bulges can have shapes ranging from nearly spherical to as flat as the galaxy disk. The Milky Way has a flat boxy or peanut-shaped bulge in its center. Such bulges are formed due to thickening of the stellar bars in galaxies. One of the interesting and violent thickening mechanisms is buckling, where the bar bends out of the plane of the galaxy disk,” the scientists have said.Stating that many recent numerical and observational studies suggest that dark matter halos are spherical, prolate (a sphere squashed from the sides), or oblate (a sphere squashed from the top and bottom) in shape, they said that however, its effect on stellar kinematics in the bulges and bars of galaxies is not well understood.In its current work led by Ankit Kumar, a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and co-authored by Prof Mousumi Das of IIA and Sandeep Kumar Kataria of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the team investigated the dynamical evolution of the galaxies using state-of-art numerical simulations at IIA.IIA is an autonomous institution of the department of science and technology (DST). The DST said that the team’s simulations demonstrate that bars in prolate dark matter halos undergo three prominent bar buckling (out of plane bending) events in eight billion years which make them detectable for a longer time. “...It is the first time that three-bar buckling events have been reported in any study,” the DST added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/star-motion-clue-to-dark-matter-shape-key-to-galaxies-evolution/articleshow/88983394.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Why punish only the common man when parties also flout Covid rules, ask citizens||BENGALURU: Recently, a video of a man arguing with BBMP marshals when they tried to penalise him for not wearing a mask appropriately went viral on social media. He wanted to know why thousands of Congress workers were allowed to walk without masks or not maintaining social distancing during the Mekedatu padayatra. On Sunday, a farmer was seen throwing vegetables on a road in Tumakuru in protest against police who allegedly prevented him from selling them citing the weekend curfew. Another incident of a youth who was waylaid in Mandya by police when he was taking his Covid-infected father home also came to light. After 15 minutes of heated exchange of words, they let him go. Many citizens cite these incidents to claim that ever since the government imposed restrictions a fortnight ago in view of surging Covid-19 cases, there has been discrimination. While common people are targeted, political parties and ther functionaries who flout rules are getting away, they allege. “This shows the rules are only for the common man to follow or at least police believe so. Otherwise how can you explain such gross partiality in enforcing Covid guidelines,” asks Munegowda, who was roughed up by police in Bengaluru on Sunday. He was outdoors to drop his son for work. In Bengaluru last week, an elderly man’s bike was allegedly seized when he was purchasing vegetables. This despite the government allowing sale and purchase of essential commodities. On the other hand, the law enforcers remained mute spectators when Covid rules were thrown to the winds by Congress functionaries during their padayatra. Only after a nudge from the high court, they woke up but did nothing other than filing three FIRs against 142 functionaries. Police were also seen giving protection during the birthday bash of Jagalur BJP MLA SV Ramachandra recently. NR Ramesh of the BJP hosted a similar function showing utter disregard for guidelines. Chief minister’s political secretary MP Renukacharya openly admitted that he flouted norms by attending a bull-racing event and said the cops were to file a case against him, but they did not. “The enforcers of Covid rules should handle the situation with a humane approach. Let them impose restrictions strictly and punish everyone who violates them, be it politicians or the common man. If they can't do it, then they have no right to punish only one section of the people,” said Ramakrishna, a human rights activist from Belagavi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/why-punish-only-the-common-man-when-parties-also-flout-covid-rules-ask-citizens/articleshow/88983395.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Fever clinics, Covid war rooms to come up in villages||BENGALURU: In view of the third wave, the government on Tuesday decided to open fever clinics and set up Covid war rooms in all district headquarters and rural areas. The decision was taken during chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s virtual meeting with deputy commissioners and CEOs of 18 districts. A direction was issued to take special care of the elderly and get them tested for Covid on priority if they show symptoms. “Fever clinics and Covid war rooms will help in tele-triaging and decide on the need for hospitalisation of a Covid-positive patient. Unnecessary hospitalisation will lead to panic and denial of beds for those who are really in need,’’ said health minister K Sudhakar. Medical kits will be given at the doorsteps of those who are in home quarantine. The minister said 222 out of 244 new oxygen plants in government hospitals are functioning. “Seventeen plants were to be installed by companies using their CSR funds but there was a delay. So, the government has taken up the responsibility of installing those units,” he said. The CM expressed displeasure over the slow progress in administering booster (preventive) dose to frontline Covid warriors, he said. “As of now, just 39 per cent of warriors have taken the dose. We have instructed officials to speed up the drive. In the next 10 days, we are expecting significant improvement,” he added. According to Sudhakar, the state may see around 1.2 lakh cases during the peak of the third wave. “In the best possible scenario, it may touch 80,000 cases a day if we take into account the report of the technical advisory committee. Cases are increasing as per experts’ prediction. Compared to the first and second wave, the spread of the virus in the third is five times faster. But it will also subside fast,” the minister said, adding that cases may start declining from the first or second week of February.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fever-clinics-war-rooms-to-come-up-in-villages/articleshow/88983396.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: We’re firm on Sanskrit university plan, says minister||BENGALURU: Amid strong opposition, the BJP government on Tuesday clarified there are no changes in its plan of building the Sanskrit university in Magadi taluk, Ramanagara. Higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan told TOI the government will not budge following statements and campaigns against the university, claiming vested interests were behind them. “We are not sacrificing our Kannada asmite (identity). The BJP government was the first to bring a law to make Kannada compulsory in all varsities. So where is the question of us sacrificing our mother tongue? The decision to develop Sanskrit university will stay,” Narayan said. The plan to build the varsity was originally mooted by then BJP government led by BS Yediyurappa in 2011 and 100-acre of land in Thippasandra village had been identified. There are 14 Sanskrit colleges in the state, which are affiliated to the university, which at present is functioning from the campus of Sri Chamarajendra Sanskrit College in Bengaluru. Ramanagara will have two universities with the government having decided to shift Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences from Bengaluru to the neighbouring district. A social media campaign “#saynotoSanskrit” was launched two days ago after the government allocated Rs 320 crore to develop the Sanskrit university. Several pro-Kannada organisations and Kannada writers described it as a brazen step by the BJP government to accord special treatment to Sanskrit at the cost of Kannada. They alleged Kannada University in Hampi has no money even to pay salaries and fellowships and several Kannada chairs are staring at a bleak future. However, Narayan denied these allegations and said the government has not stopped any grants to the institution and salaries are being paid on time. “There have been concerns only with regard to payments of non-teaching staff, who were appointed in violation of rules, on which the finance department has been seeking clarity,” he added. Higher education department officials clarified Rs 25 crore has been allocated for infrastructure development and the Sanskrit varsity has only been granted a small parcel of the land accorded to Karnataka State Open University. They are now hoping that CM Basavaraj Bommai will allocate more funds in his budget. Kannada and culture minister V Sunil Kumar feigned ignorance on the controversy. The opposition has launched a Twitter campaign #NotoSanskritUniversity. “The BJP government is imposing Hindi and Sanskrit on us, killing Kannada in schools and colleges. Organisations like RSS have been pushing Sanskrit over Kannada dubbing it the mother of all Indian languages. But the truth is Kannada is a Dravidian language and not an Aryan language like Sanskrit,” read a tweet by Congress. The BJP government-appointed chairman of Kannada Development Authority TS Nagabharana also opposed the move.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/min-were-firm-on-sanskrit-univ-plan/articleshow/88983397.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Missing Bengaluru girl drawn to shamanism traced to Ahmedabad||BENGALURU: A 17-year-old girl who had fled her home in the city on October 31 last year, following personal reasons and being drawn to shamanism, has been rescued from a private orphanage in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The girl reunited with her parents on January 16. Police said she left home in pursuit of shamanism (an ancient practice among indigenous people. It seeks to connect with spirits that are believed to control the world) and finally decided to return to her parents. The girl is the elder of the two children of a couple living near Rajajinagar. Her father is a private company employee, while mother a homemaker. A missing person’s complaint was registered with jurisdictional Subramanyanagar police. “My daughter is missing since she left home on the morning of October 31, 2021. She was depressed over not getting a seat in a good college to pursue fashion designing course, which she was passionate about. She regularly surfs the internet and in recent times, was drawn to shamanism. She had left her mobile phone at home,” her father stated in the complaint. However, police could trace the girl only till Hulimavu. “We scanned footage from more than 200 CCTV cameras and traced her to a place near Hulimavu on October 31 evening. However, after that her trail turned cold,” said police. A few days ago, the girl is said to have called her father and told him she was in a private orphanage in Ahmedabad. The father immediately contacted police. Together they travelled to Ahmedabad and brought her back. ‘Told parents to counsel her’“She was deeply drawn towards shamanism and we have requested her parents to counsel her,” added police. Describing the case as one of teenage vulnerability, city-based psychiatrist Dr Vijay Harbishettar said the girl came back because she loved her family. “Leaving home and visiting ashrams and orphanages indicate the person believes that he/she will get peace of mind there. In this case, the girl is a teenager and is vulnerable to thoughts such as shamanism. Such minds act both like an adult and a child at times. They go through different mood swings. These were the main reasons behind her decision to leave home. But her act of calling her father and telling him where she was shows she loves her family and trusts her father,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/missing-girl-drawn-to-shamanism-traced-to-ahmedabad/articleshow/88983398.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: One-year jail for sacked Nimhans doctor, mom & sisters in DA case||BENGALURU: A special court for CBI cases in Bengaluru sentenced a 58-year-old dismissed senior general duty medical officer at Nimhans, his mother and three sisters to one year in jail and slapped a fine of Rs 25,000 each in connection with a disproportionate assets (DA) case. Dr K Mailan is the convicted doctor. His sisters K Renuka, K Sarala and K Akila and mother Jayalakshmi alias Jaya Kannan, were convicted for abetting Mailan to commit the offence. All four are residents of Viveknagar. The court also ordered the government to confiscate 80.3% of Mailan’s disproportionate assets. Mailan was dismissed from service on February 20, 2014. HA Mohan, special judge for CBI cases, pronounced the judgment on January 11 and awarded sentence to the four convicts. According to the prosecution, Mailan and his four family members acquired movable assets in their names during the check period from April 1, 2002 to January 25, 2013 at Bengaluru by illegal means and beyond their known sources of income. The CBI had found disproportionate assets worth over Rs 1 crore. But they failed to give a satisfactory explanation about it. Initially, CBI officials had estimated that the disproportionate assets were 88% more than his known sources of income and later it was revised to 80.3%. The defence counsel contended that the accused persons earned money by doing business of selling used cars and pets. But no evidence was produced to show how much income they were making from the said business. The suspects failed to properly clarify about Rs 92 lakh cash found in their residence during the search. The prosecution contended that Mailan was a government servant when he committed the said offence. His three sisters and mother abetted his offence. HK Hema, public prosecutor, appeared to argue on behalf of CBI. According to the judgment, Mailan was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one year and with fine of Rs 25,000 for the offence punishable under section 13(2) and 13(1)(e) of Prevention of Corruption Act. In default of payment of fine, he has to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months. Renuka, Sarala and Akila, and Jayalakshmi have to undergo imprisonment for a period of one year for the offence punishable under IPC section 109 and sections 13(2)r/w, 13(1)(e) of PC Act and are also liable to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 each. If they default, they have to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/1-yr-jail-for-sacked-nimhans-doc-mom-sisters-in-da-case/articleshow/88983400.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||Two cops, two peddlers held with ganja near CM Basavaraj Bommai’s house in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Two police constables on bandobust duty at the chief minister’s residence in RT Nagar and two suspected drug peddlers, all allegedly in possession of narcotic substances, were arrested last week.  The quartet was nabbed on January 13 night near the CM’s house. While 400 grams of ganja was seized from head constable Shivkumar, 33, and constable Santosh Nowkar, 33, 100 grams was recovered from the two peddlers, Akhil Raj and Amjad Khan. Charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and questioned in police custody, the four men were released on bail by a local court on Tuesday evening. Confirming the development, deputy commissioner of police (north) Patil Vinayak Vasantarao said the suspects were detained on the night of January 13 from 80 Feet Road, RT Nagar. “Members of the public called the police control room saying a few men inside a parked autorickshaw were behaving suspiciously. Hoysala staff immediately reached the spot, detained the four persons along with the auto and brought them to RT Nagar police station. Two of the detainees were from Koramangala police station. During the search, ganja was recovered from them. An FIR was registered,” the officer said. “We reached the said place on 80 Feet Road in our Hoysala vehicle. Seeing us, the four tried to speed away in the auto. We blocked their three-wheeler with the Hoysala vehicle. Two of them were in police uniform. When we frisked them, we recovered ganja from a bag with the men in uniform. We detained all the four. The men in police uniform told us they had brought the ganja from Akhil’s house and were trying to sell it,” the FIR read. Sources privy to the investigation said the accused constables were hand in glove with the peddlers. “But for how long the constables were in touch with the drug peddlers, we don’t know at this point in time,” a police officer said. However, another officer refused the allegations that the constables were involved in drug peddling. According to him, they were trying to extort money from the peddlers. “The two got concrete information about a food delivery boy supplying ganja to known people near RT Nagar and caught him with the drug on January 13. Also, the constables succeeded in nabbing the peddler who had handed over ganja to the boy. Both were made sit inside the autorickshaw and the constables started demanding money from them. When the cops were threatening the suspects, residents heard them shouting and alerted the police control room,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/two-cops-2-peddlers-held-with-ganja-near-cms-house/articleshow/88983401.cms||---

I went to the RTO office at Jnanabharathi to check the process to get it. But the moment they saw me in shorts, RTO officials were clearly irritated and started arguing with me. There was some exchange of words and they insisted they will not share any details just because I was wearing shorts,” Rao told TOI.  Transport commissioner N Shivakumar said: "There is no dress code, but RTOs are government offices. So, we expect people to come in proper attire. There are no written rules, but we will not entertain those who are not in proper covered clothes.” “When there is no dress code for driving licence applicants at RTO, how can they deny a service to me? In fact, I didn’t see any helpdesk to get information to avail RTO services,” he added. This is not the first time such an incident has been reported in the city. In 2016, a DL applicant who was wearing shorts while visiting Koramangala RTO faced a similar situation. Many netizens extended support to Rao and shared their experience on Twitter. Shankar KV tweeted: “The same thing had happened to me where they objected and took money to issue a new DL...

---||Bengaluru||New framework to check energy storage in 2D materials||Bengaluru: A team of IISc scientists developed a fully automated computational framework that can assess the energy storage capacity of thousands of 2D materials in a high-throughput fashion. The scientists said research on environment-friendly energy storage devices, mainly lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and supercapacitors, gained tremendous momentum in recent times with the emergence of electric vehicles. They said there is greater desire now for lighter and smaller energy storage devices and electrode materials with high surface-to-mass ratio. “Two-dimensional materials are an ideal fit for such requirements. However, the 2D material space is massive and despite recent efforts (both experimental and theoretical), only a small fraction of it has been explored. The limited choice has hindered promising applications of 2D materials in energy storage devices,” IISc said in a statement. To address this, Arnab Kabiraj and Santanu Mahapatra from the department of electronic systems engineering developed a fully automated, first principles-based computational framework to assess the energy storage capacity of 2D materials. “A realistic estimation of the maximum Li-ion storage capacity in any material requires a global minima search, which is computationally hard and expensive. The researchers devised four easy-to-calculate descriptors to simplify this problem. These descriptors not only enable rapid screening of materials but also provide important chemical insights such as volumetric change of the electrode during charge and discharge,” the statement read. Their approach also combines explicit-ion and implicit-solvent formalisms to assess a material’s potential for both LIB and supercapacitors, making it useful for a supercapacitor-battery hybrid system, which has been proposed as a viable solution for electric vehicles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/new-framework-to-check-energy-storage-in-2d-materials/articleshow/88983411.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||No takers for 290 PG dental seats in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Over 30% of postgraduate dental seats in the state continue to be vacant even after the second round of counselling. This despite the Dental Council of India (DCI) lowering cutoffs this year. According to data provided by Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), of 933 seats, 643 have been filled and 290 are vacant after the second round of counselling. KEA did not disclose stream-wise break-up, citing an ongoing Supreme Court hearing on admissions in the state. Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) said the number of vacancies is more compared to last year. “Last year, 154 seats were vacant. This is excluding two private universities. This year, the vacancy is more because our counselling has been delayed compared to other states. Students from other states would have opted for seats there instead of waiting for our colleges,” said Dr Jayakara SM, vice-chancellor, RGUHS. The last date for admission to PG dental seats according to the DCI was November 20. However, in Karnataka, counselling for the same was held only in December. The state has now approached the Supreme Court for approval of the admissions. This trend of PG dental seats going vacant has been on for the past few years. So much so that the DCI decided to lower the cutoff percentile for admissions this year. For general category, the cutoff score was lowered to 185 from 259 (from 50th percentile to 26.971th percentile). “Job prospects — mainly teaching for a PG-holder — are very low in the state. While there are 900 seats, maybe 30-40 posts open up every year. If a student aspires to practice, even a BDS degree would suffice. Therefore, MDS — especially non-clinical subjects — has become non-attractive for students,” said Dr Girish Giraddi, dean-cum-director, Government Dental College and Research Institute, Bengaluru. “Students chose seats in their neighbouring states as admissions got delayed in Karnataka. But if there is a mop-up round, we hope seats will get picked up. Only subjects like community dentistry and oral pathology and other non-clinical subjects are likely to be left out,” said Dr Pradeep AR, principal, Oxford Dental College. KEA said the possibility of a mop-up round will depend on the SC order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-takers-for-290-pg-dental-seats-in-state/articleshow/88983413.cms||---

The 15-year-old Bengalurean, who has been making waves on the Indian circuit while shooting low scores consistently in recent months, will be the first Indian to feature in the tournament.The All-India champion received the official invite from the Board of Governors, Augusta National Golf Club, signed by Chairman Fred S Ridley, on Tuesday. It will be an all-expenses-paid trip for her and the person accompanying her.The three-round tournament will be played on two courses — the first two rounds at the Champions Retreat golf course and the final round at the Augusta National Golf Club that hosts the prestigious Masters Tournament. “I wanted to play the tournament but wasn’t expecting to get an invite. It feels amazing. Even in my wildest dreams I wouldn’t have thought I’d be invited for this prestigious event,” an elated Avani told TOI on Tuesday.“I’m really excited to go there. Firstly, it is The Masters venue, and then I will also be competing with the best amateurs in the world. It can’t get any better than this,” added the ninth standard student of Greenwood High International School, who has twice put the pros in the shade on the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour last season.The youngest Indian to achieve the amateur treble — All-India Juniors, All-India Ladies Amateur, and the Billoo Sethi memorial — Avani knows full well that a good performance could be a gateway to the Paris Olympics. Although a win won’t fetch any world ranking points, the winner will get an invitation to the next five Augusta National Women’s Amateurs, the 2022 US Women’s Open, the 2022 Women’s British Open, and any USGA, R&A and PGA of America amateur championships for which one is eligible, for one year.The Rotary Bangalore Golf Foundation backed teenager, No. 128 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings, said a win can’t be ruled out. “If I just play my natural game and if my putting works too, then I’m capable of winning the tournament,” said Avani, one of the longest hitters in the women’s game in the country.For now, the golfing sensation, who shot a bogey-free eight-under recently at the KGA, considered one of the challenging courses in the country, is busy with her ninth standard exams.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/teen-wonder-avani-gets-augusta-invite/articleshow/88983414.cms||---

He also asked members to help the state expand its revenue sources to overcome its present financial constraints. “When it comes to industrial development and employment, some districts achieved higher growth, while others lagged far behind. This cannot be set right in a day. But I am keen to initiate this process and ensure uniform growth for the entire state,” Stalin told at the meeting of the state planning commission here. The members of the commission have been offering various suggestions to officials to improve the state and the condition of the people through better implementation of projects. “Instead of suggestions, I want the members to undertake a thorough study of the issue, visit the districts, interact with concerned people and come up with a detailed report covering all aspects and submit to the government,” he said. “Members of the commission should suggest measures for the state to increase its own revenue from tourism, rural activities, handicrafts and khadi and help it overcome the financial constraints. It has now solely depend on VAT and property tax for its revenue,” Stalin said. Tamil Nadu is a developed state on several fronts. It achieved it due to its focus on developmental schemes linked to ensuring social justice. “At the same time, it has not yet developed fully. To ensure that the state is fully developed, the members of the planning commission should focus your attention on human resources development, lifestyle, life expectancy, child development, abolition of poverty, human rights, social justice and marginalized sections of people,” Stalin said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ensure-uniform-growth-cm-to-tn-planning-panel/articleshow/88983416.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Worker suspended as leopard dies in zoo squeeze cage||CHENNAI: An employee of the Arignar Anna Zoological Park (AAZP) in Vandalur was suspended on Tuesday in connection the death of a 15-year-old female leopard at the zoo. The animal died reportedly after it was put into a squeeze cage on Monday evening for collecting samples for Covid-19 test. Zoo animals are usually led into these cages during medical examinations. Since the cages immobilise animals, it becomes easy for zoo veterinarians and keepers to administer injections, examine, or vaccinate them, sources said. After collecting samples from the leopard, however, the employees were unable to open the cage. Preliminary investigation suggested the cage's pulley failed to work. The animal is believed to have died of asphyxiation. "We will soon come out with a detailed report," said V Karunapriya, AAZP director. The leopard, named Jaya, was taken to the cage as part of a drive to test all animals following detection of Covid-19 among 80 zoo employees. Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Chief Wildlife Warden, said the particular squeeze cage was not lubricated and anti-corrosive paints had not been applied on the metal rods. A post-mortem examination was conducted on the carcass on Tuesday to ascertain the cause of death, Niraj said. According to official data, there are 20 squeeze cages in Vandalur zoo and most of them were put to frequent use to examine big carnivores. AAZP authorities said the suspended employee is trained in dealing with animals in squeeze cages and has over 20 years of experience at the zoo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/worker-suspended-as-leopard-dies-in-zoo-squeeze-cage/articleshow/88983418.cms||P Oppili

According to police, Rasool Ahmed, 64, a resident of RKJ Valli Velan Nagar in Pothur near Avadi, runs a tiffin shop at Thai Nagar main road. His 18-year-old granddaughter often visited him at the shop. Meanwhile, she complained to him that Prabhu, 19, a vegetable vendor, stalked her. Following which, Ahmed warned the youth to stay away from the girl. Prabhu was irritated and complained about the incident to his friend Lakshmanan, 20, an electrician. On Monday, when Ahmed was walking down the Palvadi road near Avadi Tank Factory, Prabhu and Lakshmanan attacked him. The duo fled as onlookers rushed to the rescue of the elderly man. Ahmed suffered an injury on his nose and was bleeding. Avadi Tank Factory police admitted Ahmed to Government Stanley Hospital. Based on Ahmed’s complaint, the police registered a case and arrested Prabhu and Lakshmanan.

In January 2021, it was supplying only 830 million litres daily. A senior Metrowater official said this is the second consecutive year wherein the combined reserve of Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam lakes has reached 10,000+ million cubic feet of water (mcft) in January. As on Tuesday, the reserve stood at 10,909 mcft; in January 2021, it was 10,481 mcft. According to data, the combined reserve tanked to 1,686 mcft in January 2017 from 9,848 mcft same month in 2016. In January 2018, the reserve stood at 4,952 mcft, but a failed monsoon that year took the reserve to an all-time-low of 1,389 mcft in January 2019. The Metrowater had to bring water from Jolarpet, said an official. From the four reservoirs, water is lost at an average rate of 40 cubic feet per second (cusecs) owing to evaporation, percolation and seepage, a senior PWD official said. The overall loss of water this way will be at a rate of about 3,620 cusecs a month. It may be noted that the Metrowater is yet to draw water from the new Kannankottai Thervaikandigai reservoir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/reservoirs-have-enough-water-to-last-ten-months/articleshow/88983420.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Widening of Adyar river in limbo as no central nod yet||CHENNAI: Widening and desilting of Adyar river might face delays as the Central expert panel authorised to approve the project has deferred it. The state Public Works Department (PWD) had proposed in 2021 to widen and desilt the river from bar mouth to Thiru Vi Ka Bridge at an estimated cost of 21 crore. The idea was to improve the water carrying and holding capacity of the river. Since the project site is near the mangroves and falls in a Coastal Regulation Zone, it requires mandatory clearance from the Union environment ministry. An Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the ministry usually recommends such eco-sensitive projects. After going through the proposal in March 2021, the EAC said the data presented by PWD on sewage and effluent pollution of the river was incorrect. It asked the state to ascertain the data by an independent and nationally acclaimed institute and submit a report. The PWD, howevever, approached the EAC for permission in December 2021 without the report, leading to the panel rejecting the proposal. "This means the river widening project will remain incomplete even during this year's monsoon," said A Anand Kumar, a resident from Ramakrishna Nagar. Several government reports have indicated high pollution in the river. TNPCB had recently told the National Green Tribunal that despite efforts under the Chennai River Restoration Trust project, there was no significant improvement in water quality at Adyar and Cooum rivers. The board collected samples from 12 locations last year and all of them had high levels of Ammo-Nitrogen (a toxic pollutant), conductivity (indicating the presence of salts and heavy metals) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), the TNPCB's report said. High BOD means the water is polluted and will harm lives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/widening-of-adyar-river-in-limbo-as-no-central-nod-yet/articleshow/88983424.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: 213 centres that rescue, train child labourers to shut shop?||CHENNAI: They have produced doctors, engineers and government officials in the past three decades after rescuing children from shops, brick kilns, quarries and factories. Now, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, 213 special training centres under National Child Labour Project (NCLP) in 15 TN districts face an uncertain future as the Union ministry of labour and employment has not extended the NCLP beyond April 2021. These centres in districts including Chennai, Kancheepuram, Coimbatore, Salem, Dharmapuri, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Vellore and Tirunelveli currently educate and train 3,861 children. “The Centre is yet to release funds for some districts for up to 18 months. Due to non-payment of rent, many landlords have locked the training centres and teachers have been working without salaries for six to 18 months. Teachers rehabilitating child labourers are treated worse than bonded labourers,” a teacher volunteer said. Under NCLP, the Centre would disburse the amount to collectors and payment was made based on enrolment in each centre which has a volunteer-teacher, vocational trainer, clerk and cook. “Earlier, the Centre used to give 400 monthly stipend for rescued children. This was stopped more than a year ago. The scheme also was not extended after April 2021,” a district project director said. R Vidyasagar, former child protection specialist with Unicef, said the NCLP had become more relevant in view of the increase in child labour. “As per a 2021 Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan survey, 1.8 lakh children were found to be out of schools in TN. Of them, more than 40,000 are yet to return. We cannot enrol child workers straightaway in regular schools as they would have forgotten everything. They need rehabilitation and proper training.” TN should pressure the Centre to release the NCLP funds or at least provide an interim grant, he added. The TN labour department has written to the Centre in this regard, an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/213-centres-that-rescue-train-child-labourers-to-shut-shop/articleshow/88983431.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai corporation reserves 100 wards for women||CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation has reserved 100 wards for women after the Madras high court quashed its previous order that had allotted more than 50% wards to women. As per the new order, 16 wards have been reserved for scheduled caste (women), 16 for scheduled caste (general) and 84 for women (general). The highlight, however, was the fact that mayors of all three corporations here — Chennai, Tambaram and Avadi — have been reserved for SCs with Chennai and Tambaram to have their first women mayors. Dalit activists and political parties have lauded the reservation, especially for Chennai. Villupuram MP and Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi’s general secretary D Ravikumar said, “It is a welcome move. It is based on the population and demography data and this is something that we have been fighting for several years. However, to reserve it for a woman candidate is laudable.” Some former councilors were, however, unhappy about the way seats were reserved, saying several wards in Chennai with low SC population had been reserved. “In West Mambalam, areas that have no SC population have been reserved for SC candidates. We cannot understand the rationale as they haven’t shared the population data with us. Usually, the norm is that wards with higher women voters and higher SC population are reserved for those candidates,” said M Gunasekaran, former AIADMK councillor from Virugambakkam area. Even in Coimbatore, said S Manimeghalai, former AIADMK councillor, many wards with lower SC population such as Chettiveethi were reserved for SC candidates and wards such as Kamarajapuram with higher SC population have been reserved for a general candidates. “The rationale can only be deemed political,” she said. DMK officer-bearers and ministers said reserving Chennai and Tambaram for SC women was as per norms and adhered to the party’s ideology. “We always have given deputy secretary posts to women in our party and we have several strong women candidates. As far as reservation is concerned, our party has always voiced the concerns of the SC communities and also supported the Mandal Commission. We want women to lead governance,” said Ma Subramanian, health minister and former Chennai mayor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-corpn-reserves-100-wards-for-women/articleshow/88983433.cms||---

Extraordinary cases require extraordinary remedies,” a division bench of Justices P N Prakash and S Srimathy said. The issue came to light after the owner of the land approached the court challenging the registration of sale deed of an 8 acre plot in Dharmapuri. During the proceedings, it came to light that the fake arbitration centre was run by a lawyer and even had a fake bailiff and armed gunmen as personal security officers to the ‘arbitrator’. The issue pertains to a plea moved by K J Sumathy and other legal heirs of K S Jagannathan seeking to cancel the registration of the sale deed. The petitioners said Jagannathan owned 25 acres in Adhiyamankottai, Dharmapuri. Nagaraj, a local politician, entered into a loan agreement dated April 5, 2004, with a man named Rajendran, under which Nagaraj made it appear as if he received a loan around 4 lakh for which he gave Jagannathan’s property as security. The two had no ownership over the land but contrived a dispute and appointed advocate K Rajaram as an arbitrator. On October 31, 2014, Rajaram passed an ‘award’ directing execution of a sale deed in respect of 8 acres and 16 cents of Jagannathan’s property in favour of Rajendran, counsel for the petitioners A Ilaya Perumal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-nixes-sale-deed-registered-at-fake-arbitration-centre/articleshow/88983434.cms||Suresh Kumar

A team which recovered the stolen goods from the accused’s native village near Vriddhachalam is also looking into a complaint from VCK functionary Chelladurai that the house help, Dhanush, was detained at the actor’s apartment for theft. Investigators are also probing the claim that Galrani plans to withdraw her complaint against Dhanush. Police said Galrani employed Dhanush at her condominium in Royapettah, five months ago. In her complaint, the actor said she found Dhanush leaving her apartment on January 11 with a bundle. She tried to chase him, but he escaped. After verifying her complaint, a team rushed to Tirupur and nabbed Dhanush.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/teen-steals-valuables-worth-1-2l-from-actors-flat-held/articleshow/88983436.cms||---

In the last one week, the state has vaccinated more than 32,000 health care providers, at least 25,000 front line workers and 24,000 senior citizens with precautionary doses of the vaccine, he said. “Of the 4.42 lakh people who have completed taking the second dose nine months ago (eligible for booster), the state has so far vaccinated only 92,000 people. By the end of January at least 10 lakh people will be eligible to take the vaccine” he said. The three categories of people are extremely vulnerable to infection and will need booster doses, he said. From Thursday, at least 600 primary health centres and hospitals including 160 urban primary health centres, community diseases hospital and GHs in the city will offer these precautionary doses. Later today, director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam has issued directions to all deputy directors to conduct “special Covid vaccination drive for precaution doses on January 20 and all Thursdays thereafter at PHCs, government hospitals and medical colleges. The districts have also been given the line list of people who are due to take their booster doses. ‘Booster doses at doorstep’In addition to mega vaccination , the Greater Chennai Corporation will send health workers to houses of senior citizens who can not come to the UPHC for vaccination. On Monday evening, a senior citizen from Arun Flats on Seshachalam Street in Saidapet constituency called health minister Ma Subramanian on his mobile requesting him to inaugurate the door-to-door vaccination programme. She told him that she had got his mobile number sometime ago and had saved it. “This launch was planned yesterday based on her request. I am sure there will be more people requesting booster doses at doorstep,” Subramanian said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/precautionary-dose-special-camps-aim-to-boost-coverage/articleshow/88983438.cms||---

So far, 387 streets with 10-25 Covid-positive cases have been barricaded. Of the 57,526 active cases in the city as on January 17, about 71% are in home isolation. “We are not blocking homes like last year. We are following the protocol of pasting stickers outside these homes to ensure others are aware. We ensure the patient gets utmost care in terms of tele-counselling from volunteers who check on their health and also doctor visits. Only streets with more than 10 cases are blocked,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. After being checked daily by Covid volunteers and those from tele-counselling centres, patients are given medicine kits and asked to check their temperature and oxygen levels thrice a day. In most of the 387 streets that have been blocked, a zonal health official told TOI, clusters were sourced to family gatherings, travel, office spaces, temple and market visits. “In this wave, the number of cases being hospitalized is less. In clusters, we continue the contact tracing process as we need to ensure those aged above 60 years with comorbidities and unvaccinated are provided treatment early. We cannot identify the source as we did in delta as the positivity rate is high showing higher transmission. We are expecting a peak by January-end. Since there is no lockdown, we cannot specify the reasons,” he said. Experts say cities with more than 10% positivity rate should ensure gatherings are curtailed or stopped. Corporation officials say they are focusing on vaccination and have achieved 74% coverage for the second dose and 94% for the first. “We have vaccinated more than 60% of the 15-17 age group and hope to complete the booster dose target as well. The problem is to get unvaccinated senior citizens with comorbidities vaccinated,” said Bedi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/civic-body-begins-containment-process-blocks-387-city-streets/articleshow/88983439.cms||Komal Gautham

Suburban residents alleged that they were denied tokens even when the MTC is actively operating buses from their neighbourhood depots. According to the scheme, introduced by the MTC in 2016, senior citizens (aged 60 or above) are eligible for free travel on all categories of buses except air-conditioned ones. Upon submitting an application and proof of age, 10 tokens are issued at the nearest depot to their residential address. However, the scheme has not been extended to Thiruvallur till date, despite repeated appeals. Senior citizen commuters from this area are forced to spend money for commuting. "Buses are being operated daily from Thiruvallur headquarters to several areas including Avadi, Poonamalle, T Nagar, Koyambedu, Sriperumbudur and Red Hills. This shows there is high patronage from the district. But bus pass facility has not been extended putting a lot of people in hardship," said Raghavendra Bhat Kadekar, a resident-activist from Thiruvallur. Also, it is costly for the public to commute by any other means of transport to the nearest health centres including the Thiruvallur Government Medical College Hospital. While a bus travel —to and fro — would only cost between ₹40 and ₹50, autos and cabs charge at least ₹300 for the same, he added. Because of the spread of Covid-19 and vaccination (booster dose), many are forced to visit these hospitals frequently now. Concurring, another senior citizen, V Sekharan rued that mostly deluxe buses (which charge more fare than ordinary category buses) ply in Thiruvallur. Till the scheme is implemented, the government could at least ensure more ordinary buses operate in the area. A Anbu Abraham, MTC managing director, refused to comment about it. Even within city limits, senior citizens complained that the scheme was poorly implemented. "We have been requesting MTC to provide beneficiaries with permanent ID cards so that the burden of submitting proofs every now and then gets reduced," said B Kannan from T Nagar Residents' Welfare Association. MTC MD did not answer any of these queries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/thiruvallur-senior-citizens-yet-to-get-tokens-for-free-bus-rides/articleshow/88983441.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||TN: Two Tangedco engineers held on charges of graft acquitted||CHENNAI: A special court for exclusive trial of cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act has acquitted two Tangedco engineers booked for corruption after it was proved that a civil contractor with Tangedco, in order to escape hefty penalty for not completing project in time had filed a false complaint against the engineers that they had demanded bribe. Assistant executive engineer D Jawahar and Assistant engineer, S Kasi Viswanathan were booked by the DVAC (Directorate of vigilance and anti corruption) in July 2007 based on a complaint by a contractor S Muniyasamy. The contractor had obtained the contract for the construction of a sub station at Sholinganallur at a cost of ₹69.6 lakh. The contractor had approached the DVAC claiming that the engineers had demanded a bribe of ₹30,000 each to pass a bill when the site was at the final stage of completion. On July 10, 2007, the contractor met the engineers at a restaurant in Adyar, where he gave the money to them, when they were caught red handed, the prosecution stated. The counsel for the engineers proved with documents that no bill was pending. The engineers contended that the money was given by the contractor for buying tiles for the construction site. The court noted, “It is quite evident that if there is a delay in completion of the work penalty will be levied to an extent of .5% per week and the same will be recovered from the contractor. In this case there was a delay of more than 20 weeks. If the final bill which was sanctioned to the contractor is calculated with the above said condition, he would be liable to pay ₹8 lakh as penalty. But, from official documents, it is evident that ₹29,620 alone is levied as an penalty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/two-tangedco-engineers-held-on-charges-of-graft-acquitted/articleshow/88983442.cms||---

The court also directed that the building constructed illegally on the premises be demolished and the property be handed over to the temple authorities within three months. According to the petition by the executive officer of Thenupureeswarar temple, the temple has vast extent of immovable properties in and around Madampakkam, measuring about 84 acres. T Suyambudurai had encroached about 1400 sqft of temple land and developed an illegal construction on the land in 2012. When the temple management complained to the Selayur police, the complaint was closed as it is civil in nature. After that the temple authorities moved the court. After years of trial, the executive officer of the temple completed chief examination on August 16, 2021 and despite issuance of summons, no one represented Suyambudurai. Additional district judge K Ayyappan noted that the defendant himself had admitted in a written statement that the properties belongs to the temple and were leased out to hundreds of people including him. The court said the defendant failed to appear before the court and did not produce any document to show that the government recognized the occupation of the defendant and held that the temple is the absolute owner of the property. “The temple is also entitled to the consequential relief of delivery of vacant possession of the property after demolishing the entire super structure put up by the defendant within three months,” the court held.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/court-rules-in-favour-of-temple-over-1400sqft-encroached-property/articleshow/88983444.cms||---

---||India||All-India Covid peak yet to come, go for strategic testing: Centre||NEW DELHI: Even as Covid-19 cases in most metro cities have started declining, overall India peak is still ahead as the infection is spreading to smaller cities that are likely to manifest a surge over next two to three weeks, officials said.  The Centre has also asked states and UTs to enhance testing in order to identify new clusters and new hotspots of infection. Testing has significantly declined in certain states and UTs, whereas the positivity continues to remain high. “In Mumbai, decline is clear. In Delhi, the peak has been reached and decline should be seen in the coming week. Both of these should be sharp. India peak is still ahead, as the third wave spreads outside the bigger metros,” CSIR Institute Of Genomics and Integrative Biology Director Anurag Agarwal told TOI.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Experts say the infection travels gradually from bigger cities to tier 2 and 3 cities and though hospitalisations have been limited in metros so far, testing continues to be important for early detection, isolation and treatment. On Monday, a total of 16.49 lakh tests were conducted across the country. “Omicron will follow the same wave pattern as of Delta. It first hit metros and is likely to have spread to smaller cities and villages too. While cases have started sliding in metros, overall cases will continue to remain high as the infection is likely to follow the 2-3 weeks cycle to travel to smaller cities, which are estimated to witness a surge soon" says Fortis C-DoC Chairman Dr Anoop Misra.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); According to Dr Misra, the actual rate of hospitalisation – even in Delhi - will demonstrate by next week as hospital admissions usually follow surges after at least three-four days. In a letter to States and UTs, the health ministry said testing remains a key strategy for pandemic management as it can help in early identification to aid containment measures. Besides, it is also crucial for ensuring reduction in mortality and morbidity.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); “As you are aware, the Omicron which has been designated… as a variant of concern is currently spreading across the country… Testing remains a key and crucial component of the framework. However, it is seen from the data available on the ICMR portal that testing has declined in many states and Union territories,” Arti Ahuja, additional secretary in the health ministry said. “Progression of a disease to a severe category can be averted by strategic testing of those who are at high risk and more vulnerable, as well as in areas where the spread is likely to be higher,” she added. While ICMR has recently issued new testing guidelines waiving off testing requirements for many categories, the health ministry advised states to opt for strategic and focused testing of people who are vulnerable, living in closed surroundings, in densely populated areas in emerging new clusters and new hot spots of positive cases. “In order to ensure that an effective track of the spread of the pandemic is kept and also immediate citizen centric action is initiated, it is incumbent upon all States/UTs to enhance testing,” Ahuja said in the letter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-india-peak-yet-to-come-go-for-strategic-testing-centre/articleshow/88983447.cms||Sushmi Dey

Digital gold investments are in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where the units represent physical gold which may be in paper or dematerialised form. One gold ETF unit is equal to 1gm of the yellow metal. It is backed by physical gold of high purity. Gold ETFs combine the flexibility of stock investments and the simplicity of purchasing the yellow metal. From an AUM of Rs 14,480 crore in January 2021, the gold ETF portfolio grew to Rs 18,405 crore at the end of December, according to recent data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data. Lakshmi Iyer, CIO-debt & head of products at Kotak Mutual Fund, said the market saw demand from across sectors. “With the lockdown imposed after the second Covid wave, many Indians were convinced to purchase gold online, as digital gold. We have seen higher interest from millennials who saw the gold ETF as an alternative investment instrument when the equity market slowed down,” she said. The volume of gold ETF folios surged more than three times from 9.7 lakh to nearly 32.1 lakh last year. The folio penetration was boosted by the ease of purchasing gold ETFs. “An investor who got initiated into the world of finance has now seen gold as a key part of asset allocation. In 2021, newer investors would have seen merit in buying gold as an asset class in the digital format. Further, there was almost 2x growth in new gold ETF folios. This is largely because many online portals have facilitated ease of purchase of gold as an asset class, as compared to purchasing physical gold during the lockdown,” Iyer said. For December, gold ETFs saw inflows of Rs 313 crore. They also repurchased gold ETFs worth Rs 176 crore in the last month. According to a World Gold Council report, despite considerable outflows for the year, globally gold ETF holdings remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-etf-assets-surge-27-in-2021/articleshow/88983449.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Chennai||I was approached on Instagram to fix games: Sathish||Chennai: The scourge of match-fixing refuses to die down. Tamil Nadu allrounder R Sathish was approached on social media to fix matches earlier this month and he was offered Rs 40 lakhs. The 41-year-old player told TOI that he refused the offer and went on to file a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Bengaluru police.Sathish said that the ‘approach’ was made by an individual named Bunny Anand on Instagram. “It was earlier this month that I got a message on my Instagram account. I immediately refused the offer and I thought it is my duty to report the matter. I informed BCCI Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) and upon their advice went to file a complaint with the police a couple of weeks ago,” Sathish told TOI on Tuesday.At present, Sathish is part of the current Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) champions Chepauk Super Gillies. He had earlier played for IPL franchises like Mumbai Indians, Kings XI Punjab and Kolkata Knight Riders.It was also learnt that the individual concerned had claimed that two players have already agreed to his offer. However, it couldn’t be ascertained whether the offer made to Sathish was for fixing matches in Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL). “I wasn’t specifically told anything about fixing TNPL games,” Sathish added.The TNPL was mired in controversy a couple of years earlier when allegations of spot fixing and match fixing had emerged. However, BCCI had cleared the league of corruption charges as they couldn’t find any conclusive evidence to prove any malpractice had taken place.BCCI ACU chief Shabir Khandwawala also said that his unit will be probing the matter. “Sathish informed us as and ICC earlier this month that he was offered money to fix matches. Since we are only facilitators in such cases, we advised him to lodge a police complaint. He has done that and now police will investigate and do the needful,” Khandwawala said.Sathish said that he is ready to co-operate with the authorities. “I needed to come clean on this matter, so I raised the complaint. Now, if the police and the authorities want to probe the matter, I am open to co-operate with them. We need to keep the game clean,” said Sathish.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/i-was-approached-on-instagram-to-fix-games-sathish/articleshow/88983450.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu was told to make Velu Nachiyar’s horse brown||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu will miss the Republic Day Parade at Rajpath in New Delhi on January 26, but not before it argued its case thrice, making changes to the tableau under the theme, ‘Tamil Nadu in the freedom struggle’, and failing to impress the expert committee of the ministry of defence. The 21 tableaux for this year’s parade have been drawn from 12 states/Union Territories and nine Union ministries/departments. But TN has lost the race. After participating in the parade for three consecutive years -- 2019, 2020 and 2021 -- the state government was gearing up to make it this time by presenting seven sketches. A design had a model of a ship in front and freedom fighter V O Chidambaram, famously known as “Kappalottiya Tamizhan”, standing. The ship model was to highlight the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company founded by VOC, one of the first indigenous companies to compete against the British. The committee felt that a bust of VOC would be better so that the rear side view was not blocked. “In the third round, a committee member wanted to know if VOC was a businessman?” a source said. The government officials had explained the prominence of the famous leader whose 150th birth anniversary is being celebrated across Tamil Nadu. The sketch had the fiery freedom fighter and poet, Subramania Bharati, freedom fighters burning foreign goods as a mark of protest, queen Velu Nachiyar of Sivaganga riding a white horse with a sword and women soldiers with swords. Born in 1730 and popularly known as Veeramangai, Velu Nachiyar was the first queen to have fought the British. “In the second round, the committee said the colour of her horse should be changed to brown and Tamil features on her face be made more prominent since she looked like Jhansi Rani. A suggestion was to have a temple since the state is Tamil Nadu,” the source said. The committee felt the design of Vellore Mutiny and Vellore Fort or Maruthu Pandiyar brothers, the well-known rulers of Sivaganga, who were publicly hanged to death by the British, were “harsh portrayals.” A member had quipped that Maruthu brothers were “unknown to a national audience.” In the third and last round, the state government went with the ship model and bust of VOC, Bharati raising a slogan and freedom fighters burning foreign goods beside. Velu Nachiyar riding a brown horse in green saree, with Maruthu brothers holding swords, and four women soldiers holding spears. Kalaiyar temple was also there. The team was told to come up with a three-dimensional model, but the call never came. A defence official told TOI, “Among the best is selected. It is not that the tableau of one state is good and other is bad.

After former AIADMK minister D Jayakumar attacked the DMK for showering praise on MGR on his birth anniversary, DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi hit back saying Jayakumar should read history about association of MGR with the DMK, M Karunanidhi as well as chief minister M K Stalin before peddling false information. “Jayakumar is unable to digest the fact that even AIADMK cadres lauded Stalin for his statement narrating the friendship shared by MGR and Karunanidhi. Hence, he has issued a statement full of falsehood,” Bharathi said. Bharathi said Stalin had won the appreciation of MGR when he started the ‘Ilaignar DMK’ as a youth. The DMK statement issued to mark MGR’s 105th birth anniversary recalled that the AIADMK founder found a special place for himself through films like ‘Maruthanattu Ilavarasi’ and Manthirakumari scripted by Karunanidhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/jayakumar-should-read-about-mgrs-relation-with-dmk-r-s-bharathi/articleshow/88983455.cms||---

The district consumer forum said that the theatre management had no staff with torch lights to help her find her seat. The court called it deficiency in service and stated that any delay in paying her compensation beyond 45 days would carry penal interest of 9% annually.Gogireddy Vanaja, the complainant, had in November 2016, gone with friends and relatives to Asian Theatre to watch a noon show. As the movie screening had begun by the time they entered the cinema hall, they found it difficult to get to their seats in complete darkness. Staff with torches to guide the viewers too was missing. Vanaja said in her complaint that in the darkness she felt as if something impeded her step, and she tripped and fell, leaving her with a fractured leg. Her friends and relatives called an ambulance and shifted her to a nearby hospital.The next few months were painful for Vanaja as she underwent two surgeries that involved replacing some leg bones with steel rods costing her more than Rs 8 lakh. She alleged in her complaint that the theatre management did nothing to support her during her hour of distress. Even the ambulance that took her to the hospital was arranged by her friends. A legal notice sent to the theatre management seeking an explanation and costs too did not yield any response.It was then that she approached the district consumer commission seeking compensation for the loss she suffered and the trauma she underwent. She also filed an FIR with the local police seeking punishment for those responsible for the negligence in the maintenance of the theatre.A bench of president Chitneni Lata Kumari and members GVS Prasad Rao D Madhavi Latha called for an explanation from the theatre management. Though an advocate appeared for the theatre, he failed to file an affidavit. Finally, the bench took note of the complainant's evidence including movie ticket photos, and medical bills, and came to a conclusion that the theatre was deficient in its service. "It is a common practice at theatres that a person wields a torch and escorts people to their seats. There was no such service in the current case," said GVS Prasad Rao, who wrote the order for the bench.The bench while partly allowing the plea by Vanaja, directed the theatre management to pay Rs 3.81 lakh towards medical expenses, an additional Rs 25,000 compensation, and Rs 10,000 more as legal costs to the petitioner within 45 days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/movie-goer-suffers-fracture-in-theatre-gets-4l-relief/articleshow/88983462.cms||---

Reinfections are occurring across age groups and also in those fully or partially vaccinated. For 32-year-old Prakash Mantripragada, the second infection came as a surprise. He realised he was positive when he went for an RT-PCR test before domestic travel. "I have had a moderate infection in the second wave and I took more than a month to recover. This time, however, I had no symptoms," he said. While for Rekha Sharma, a housewife, it has been a second positive test within just five months of last infection. "I was sure I wouldn't be infected so fast again. It has not yet been five months since I got infected last. I had a slight headache and the RT-PCR test showed I was positive," she said. Like Rekha, many who have got infected for the second time are showing mild to moderate symptoms, doctors said. "While reinfection cases at our hospital are anywhere between 20% and 25%, most of the cases are mild in nature and being treated as outpatients," said Dr Rajiv Singhal, Group CEO, Care hospitals. With Omicron dominating positive cases and Delta still very much present, many patients are also going in for genome testing on their own to find out the variant, hoping it may help in their treatment. Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said that he has seen many second/third infections and it was not necessary to do genome sequencing always to find out which variant caused the reinfection. Apart from reinfections, several breakthrough infections are also being reported. "While we are seeing a large number of reinfections, there are also many breakthrough infections. Around 30% are cases of breakthrough infection where an uninfected person who had got two doses of vaccine was subsequently infected," said Dr Pradeep Panigrahi, medical director, SLG Hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/reinfections-up-as-cases-surge-in-city/articleshow/88983465.cms||Amrita Didyala

The state governments have seen their borrowing costs move up by 9-14 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) from last month. The RBI had announced an auction of state bonds (state development loans, or SDLs) to take place on Tuesday. These were issued by 12 state governments, totalling Rs 20,659 crore. The tenure on these bonds ranged from five years to 20 years. The biggest borrower, the state of Uttar Pradesh (at Rs 3,000 crore) sold its 10-year bonds at a cut-off yield of 7.24%. Among other states that opted for the issue of a 10-year paper, West Bengal priced its bonds at a cut-off yield of 7.23% compared to 7.14% last fortnight. Bihar’s 10-year was at 7.24% and Goa & Manipur sold at 7.23%. On January 4, the 10-year yield was 7.10%. Therefore, the overall cost has gone up by 0.14%. “Bond yields are spiking upwards on inflation as well as budgetary concerns. The borrowing programme for next year is under focus. And, with redemptions being around Rs 4 lakh crore, there will once again be a large borrowing programme,” said Bank of Baroda chief economist Madan Sabnavis. He pointed out that oil prices were adding to inflationary pressures. The cost is higher than what triple A-rated companies are paying for their borrowings. For banks, there is no credit risk in buying the state government loans auctioned by the RBI. Unlike borrowing by a state government undertaking, repayment of interest and principal on these loans is ensured by the central bank by dipping into the accounts of the states. All state governments have accounts with the RBI, where central government transfers are parked. There is, however, a liquidity risk and a higher market risk. The market for these bonds is not as deep as central government bonds, because of which price movements are likely to be more volatile. According to a Care Ratings report in December, with the size of the consolidated state budgets being higher than that of the centre, the development responsibility is almost equally distributed across the Centre and states. According to various budgets, expenditure for the Centre is Rs 34.8 lakh crore for FY22 as against Rs 42.9 lakh crore consolidated for the states. “In fact, with the finance commission mandating higher transfers to the states from the Centre’s revenue collection (41%), the role of the states has increased,” the report said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/state-govts-borrowing-costs-surge-as-yields-rise/articleshow/88982084.cms||---

The group’s IT services flagship TCS has assumed the Toronto Marathon title from Scotiabank, the main backer of the running event for several years. TCS didn’t reveal the deal size for the five-year title rights of the Toronto event, but it said last year that it will spend $320 million on marathon sponsorships over an eight-year period. Prior to Tuesday’s development, TCS had joined hands with sister concern Jaguar Land Rover to be the title sponsor of Britain’s Formula E racing team. Last year, it renewed the title rights of the New York Marathon until 2029 and won the headline sponsorship of the London Marathon from 2022 to 2027. Bagging the title rights of the Toronto Marathon will help TCS to boost its image among employees and customers in Canada, a market it entered in 1991. It employs about 7,000 people in Canada. TCS, which will also be the technology partner of the Toronto running event, will develop an app for the race incorporating augmented reality features to support in-person and virtual runners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-bags-title-sponsorship-of-toronto-marathon/articleshow/88982068.cms||---
---||Business||Cos must react to change swiftly to survive crises||By James Agrawal Amazon founder Jeff Bezos believes that every day is ‘Day 1’ at the e-commerce giant. With this philosophy, he aims to build a company that is ready to adapt to changing business scenarios, while keeping customer delight as its core goal. This ‘Day 1’ mindset encourages innovation and experimentation within the company to keep up with both sudden and gradual shifts in the external environment. The Covid situation that is playing out across the globe is forcing companies to implement something akin to this ‘Day 1’ mindset in their business models too. Companies have had to deal with change at every level with enforced lockdowns, workplace health & safety concerns, employee distress and disrupted supply chains. The suddenness and the unpredictability of the frequency and duration of these Covid effects have required companies to redraw their future plans — multiple times. The companies that have been able to respond to these changes swiftly and with a startup mindset are the ones that have survived — companies where employees were prepared to jump headlong to implement changes that were required to be made across the organisation. How do you prepare a company to respond to such external changes, overnight in some cases? Here are some things that HR should consider to help employees think along the lines of the ‘Day 1’ mindset: * Prioritise the plan: When change is the only constant, carefully laid out plans cannot be executed. The solution is not to throw the plan out of the window but to break it down. Prioritise using the simple urgent/not urgent matrix to line up tasks and to-dos. Once you start executing the plan using priorities, you will be able to start work and not be paralysed by the changes that are threatening to wreck the plan. A modified plan will emerge as a result of this prioritisation that may look very different from the original one. Be prepared to work towards this plan and correct for mistakes. * Speed of rollouts: The speed and clarity at which the modified plan is communicated across teams is essential when responding to crises that threaten to overwhelm the company’s existing structure. Identify single points of contacts in teams and roll out the plan across the organisation as soon as possible. Teams need to be ready to change priorities at their level too for ensuring implementation of the modified plans. * Invest time in building cross-functional capabilities: HR needs to have an ongoing initiative in place to build cross-functional team capabilities. Some teams might need to operate with less numbers compared to others to work towards the modified plan. This is when people who are trained to work across teams will come in handy. HR should orient employees to be ready to work in different teams and provide them with the required resources and support when they pitch in to support other teams. * Empower individuals to respond in crises: Companies need to empower individuals to take decisions — especially in customer-facing roles. A rigid hierarchical structure with multiple approvals is a hindrance and increases the response time. When speed is key, holding on to a bureaucratic structure — more so in bigger companies — can prove disastrous for the company. This is driven by company culture and is built over time by the policies that HR enforces. When clear objectives and responsibilities are laid down, it is easier to empower individuals to take decisions — big and small. * People first: The importance of focusing on employee health and well-being in keeping a company going in uncertain times has to be emphasised. This takes precedence over achieving company goals and will have a positive effect in the long term. When employees see that the employer is walking the talk in prioritising people, they will be more invested in a workplace that is preparing for constantly changing work scenarios. * Be prepared to change everything: Getting into the mode of continuous change is a conscious way of working in the current times. This needs a lot of work before employees in the organisation are able to adapt to continuous change. An atmosphere of security and safety needs to be built before expecting employees to work towards modified plans and in different teams, together. Companies that have this culture in place will have a head start over those that are just trying to respond to how the climate is shifting. Companies should be prepared to change everything — be it short-term and long-term plans, or the basic organisational structure — to prepare for an uncertain future. The idea is to be able to move to a different future based on how the situation is progressing. When working towards such multiple futures, a readiness for change needs to be part of the DNA of the company, which is a process that needs to be started sooner than later. Companies across the globe have been forced to respond to extended and repeated lockdowns with remote work capacity building, digital transformations and completely altered workflows. But treating these measures as a short-term solution till we get back to normalcy will not work. These uncertainties are here to stay and there needs to be a concerted effort towards preparing for the possibility of shifting between different work scenarios for employees across the organisation and different business outcomes. Flexibility, cross-functional capacity and recognition of initiative from employees will keep the ‘Day 1’ mindset alive and help in responding to crisis situations better.

Scientists on the expedition aim to acquire geophysical and geological data from the central Indian Ocean. The expedition’s SK-375 team was flagged-off from the research institute on Monday. “The scientists will conduct a geophysical survey of the ocean floor wherein magnetic data will be collected from the ocean. There are many places that have magnetic value changes. The scientists will gauge the anomalies and attempt to detect its source,” NCPOR sources said. The scientists will be making use of a magnetometer that will be towed along with the vessel to collect the data. This data will be analysed during the research expedition. The scientists on board the deep-sea ocean research vessel (ORV) Sagar Kanya have been fully vaccinated and have gone through a series of medical tests before undertaking the month-long voyage, to ensure that there are no obstacles during the process of embarking and disembarking the vessel during port clearance. The vessel is a multi-disciplinary research vessel which was built in the 1980s in collaboration with experts from Germany. This is its 375th expedition since its inception.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/scientists-to-study-magnetic-anomalies-in-indian-ocean/articleshow/88982328.cms||---

Compared with 27,673 birds from 81 species in January last year, birders this time counted 10,592 birds from 71 species. Osprey, common crane, bar-headed geese, Eurasian coot, northern shoveler and greylag goose were among the major sightings, the census stated. While Najafgarh jheel had emerged as the abode of a large number of greater flamingos, ranging from 100 to 500 birds on any given day, just one was spotted during the census this year. Terming the situation “alarming”, experts called for conservation and immediate legal protection of the “degraded and disturbed” habitat. They said factors like encroachment and visible disturbances, like fishing and nets at the areas where flamingos often wade, could be possible for the low turnout. “Water birds are one of the key indicators of a wetland’s health. At Najafgarh jheel, both pollution and human disturbance are prominent. The lake is also stuck between two states, which is delaying a proper management plan. Conservation and sustainability of the wetland now depends on the pending final order and directions of National Green Tribunal for notification as per the Wetland (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017,” said TK Roy, an ecologist from Wetland International. Najafgarh is the largest wetland in Delhi and second largest in NCR after Basai in Gurgaon. It is located partly in Haryana and in Delhi’s southwest district. Considered an important habitat, it is home to 281 species of birds, according to government records. It is currently facing major threats from pollution, siltation and encroachments, among other things. “The construction of the Massani barrage on Sahibi river in Rewari had made the Najafgarh jheel dependent on monsoon for water. It is killing the wetland. Besides, the two sewage drains of Badshapur and Dharampur in Haryana are also polluting it. Large-scale illegal fishing, encroachments, water pumping, agriculture and urbanisation are all destroying this beautiful wetland,” Roy added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bird-sightings-more-than-halve-at-najafgarh-jheel/articleshow/88982315.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The Saibaba Colony police identified the deceased as K Shanmugam, aged around 50. “A resident of Idikarai, he had separated from his family more than a decade ago. He used to be a tourist guide and was fluent in Tamil and Malayalam. Sometimes, truck drivers visiting Kerala will take him with them and pay him. Otherwise, he will get drunk and sleep on the pavement near a tiles shop near Saibaba Colony,” a police officer said. On Tuesday early morning, motorists found him dead on the pavement and alerted the Saibaba Colony police. Subsequently, investigation wing inspector P K Regina and team reached the spot and found a stone with blood stains near the body. They sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem and registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and initiated an inquiry. “We found the deceased had run-ins with K Prasath, 45, a loadman from Kavundampalayam. When we picked him for questioning on Tuesday evening, Prasath said the deceased had used expletives while talking about his wife. So he got drunk and decided to drop a stone on the victim’s leg, but dropped it on his head mistakenly,” the officer said. The officer, however, said Prasath was yet be arrested formally. Meanwhile, police have informed the kin of the deceased. The postmortem would be carried out on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/homeless-man-50-found-murdered-loadman-detained/articleshow/88982345.cms||TNN
---||Delhi||Delhi gets own QAT to deal with terror situation||NEW DELHI: Around forty CRPF commandos who have fought with distinction in Jammu and Kashmir and Left-wing extremism-hit areas are now part a CRPF quick action team (QAT) set up exclusively in Delhi to respond to terror situations or attacks on VVIPs and installations under CRPF protection in the national capital. Sources told TOI that the Delhi QAT, which is on the lines of QATs deployed in all the theatres where CRPF is deployed, has been functional for around 7 months now and comprises commandos who have successfully taken on hardcore terrorists affiliated with Pakistan-based terror outfits like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashker-e-Toiba in J&K, which are also the ones most likely to plan and execute a terror attack in the national capital, as well as Maoists in Naxal strongholds. “They are familiar with the potential adversaries’ capabilities and operational methods, and know exactly how to deal with them,” said a senior para-military officer. The Delhi QAT may either be requisitioned to assist the local police in the event of a terror or fidayeen attack or can move on its own were such an attack to be on an individual or installation being secured by the CRPF. Many of the commandos picked for the Delhi QAT have been decorated with gallantry awards for having successfully foiled terror attacks and neutralising some key leaders of outfits like Jaish, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen in J&K. They are trained in all aspects of counter-terrorism including handling hostage situations and IEDs and shall have all the weaponry, gear and gadgets required to tackle terror attacks and fidayeen strikes, said a source. “The commandos for the Delhi QAT were selected on the basis of their superior skills and training as well as their first-hand experience in fighting terrorists and Maoists. It’s a standard practice to have QATs wherever CRPF is engaged in operations and hence a similar setup has also been created in Delhi,” said an officer. Incidentally, special DG in CRPF Zulfiqar Hasan, who had earlier served in J&K, is said to have been instrumental in not only creating the Delhi QAT but also in picking the best commandos for it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-gets-own-qat-to-deal-with-terror-situation/articleshow/88982325.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Kolkata||Narayan Debnath dies in Kolkata, a slice of childhood lost||KOLKATA: Veteran comic artist Narayan Debnath — who had transcended the generation gap with his portrayal of iconic characters like Bantul The Great, Handa Bhonda and Nonte Phonte — passed away in the city on Tuesday after a prolonged illness, aged 96, leaving a void in the home-grown world of comics and, for many, taking a chunk of their fondest childhood memories. Debnath was in hospital for the past 25 days. Just five days back, even as he was on respiratory support, he was awarded the Padma Shri. President Ram Nath Kovind expressed his sadness at Debnath's death, saying it was a "big loss to the world of Bengali literature." Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, expressed his condolences, saying, "the characters he created will remain eternally popular." Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in her statement, said Debnath's characters "have been etched in our hearts for decades." Debnath began working in an era when the term "graphic novel" hadn't yet been coined, and decades before comic-art was considered "respectable". Born in Shibpur, he displayed a creative bent of mind from his childhood, even as a student of BK Pal School. He hailed from a family that was in the trade of gold jewellery and used to draw designs at his ancestral shop. "My grandfather was so impressed seeing a sketch that he got him admitted to the fine arts department of the Government College of Art and Craft," said nephew Sanjay Debnath. Debnath left his five-year course in his fourth year. "In between, he joined a printing press and was spotted by Deb Shahitya Kutir. He was tasked with sketching an episode on PC Sorcar (Senior). The magician was so impressed that he wrote back to him, expressing admiration. This fondness grew and he would write to my uncle from all parts of the world," Sanjay said. Handa Bhonda, started by Pratul Chandra Bandyopadhyay, gained popularity in Debnath's hands in 1962. But Debnath's name became a household one with Bantul The Great, the strong boy-next-door with a Superman-like invulnerability and invincibility, who could not be harmed by bullets and was, again like Superman, a do-gooder, astounding everyone with impossible feats of strength. There are stories of Debnath having drawn the first sketch of Bantul on a tram ticket. "A comic journal called The Dandy used to publish a comic called Desperate Dan and Korky The Cat in 1937. Both were Debnath's inspirations for developing Bantul and Bahadur Beral," said Jadavpur University's Amritesh Biswas, whose PhD thesis has a chapter on Debnath. "Bantul was first published in 1965. Initially, he was a regular parar dada. He became popular after Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971, when many strips show him defeating the Pakistani army. Bantul became a symbol of the victory of good over evil. Later on, he even took on terrorists," Biswas added. Nonte Ar Phonte made their first appearance in a comic book in 1982. "Interestingly, these characters were inspired by Satyen Bose's ‘Paribartan' (1949), which had two naughty boys as protagonists. Through this strip, he celebrated Bengal's culture that has had a big space for the unadulterated fun of school days," Biswas said. Debnath was a more versatile artist than what he has been credited for, pointed out Jadavpur University professor Abhijit Gupta, who is an archivist of Bengali comics. While Debnath has mostly been associated with children's comics, "he also did a lot of other comics that are not that well-known," Gupta said. "For instance, he did detective comics for Kishore Bharati. It was the Black Diamond series that was published in the 60s. He occasionally did biographical comics for Deb Sahitya Kutir's Shuktara. These are significant because there he was able to explore different kinds of styles." Unfortunately, not many have seen them since they appeared only in magazines and periodicals. He had also created a female duo. "There are very few female characters in Bengali comics. He did a short-lived Shuntki Aar Mutki series, starring a thin and fat girl. These were among the few female characters in the Bengali comic space," Gupta said. The biographical strips were realistic in style, Gupta said. The Black Diamond series had a lot of "light-and-shade and cross-hatching. It was darker in certain ways than Handa-Bhonda and Bantul. The stories were written by Dilip Kumar Chattopadhyay and he used a lot of styles from cinema. There were these long, close and medium shots. Most of the stories were presented like cinematic credits." Cartoonist, graphic novelist and documentary film-maker Sarbajit Sen was introduced to Debnath's comics in childhood. "Back then, I loved his clean drawings. He presented a set of characters with a next-door appeal. It isn't easy to sustain and survive by pursing this profession. Later on, I appreciated the way he consistently did so and worked for so long," Sen said. Author Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay, too, admired the way Debnath had relentlessly worked till the very end. Actor Kharaj Mukhopadhyay said he owed a lot to Debnath for being able to bring out humour in his acting. An avid reader of Bantul, he belongs to the generation that collected his strips. "The simplicity of the characters was appealing. I loved their trademark wardrobe and Batul's haircut. Reading the strips was pure enjoyment and triggered our imagination," the actor recalled. Much later, while making inroads in acting, Mukhopadhyay got an assignment to be a part of an animation series based on Debnath's works. "I had to take Kanchal Mullick and Rudranil Ghosh to dub for the animation project on Handa-Bhonda. I dubbed for Bantul's animation.

Children and youngsters love his work. Re-reading him after growing up continues to leave a smile on our lips. It brings back memories of our childhood. A magician with creative emotions, he saw so much for decades and shared the essence of his creativity with everyone," Bandyopadhyay said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/narayan-debnath-dies-a-slice-of-childhood-lost/articleshow/88983492.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The enthralling Beating Retreat ceremony, which is held on January 29 every year, will include 1,000 drones flying in synchronisation with background music as well as a laser “projection mapping” show this time. The defence ministry has “conceptualised” the “novel” drone show and several other new initiatives for the Republic Day celebrations from January 23 to 30 to mark 75 years of Independence, a senior official said on Tuesday. The initiatives range from eco-friendly invitation cards that will have seeds of medicinal plants ashwagandha, aloe vera and amla and display of 10 huge 75-metre-long painting scrolls along the majestic Rajpath to installation of 10 large LED screens and reservation of some seats for auto drivers, construction, sanitation and frontline health workers at the events. The drone and projection mapping shows at the Beating Retreat ceremony may cause some disquiet among purists. But the MoD is enthusiastic about the endeavour. “The 10-minute novel drone show has been conceptualised, designed, produced and choreographed within the country. This ‘Make in India’ initiative has been organised by a start-up, ‘Botlab Dynamics’, supported by IIT-Delhi and the department of science & technology,” the official said. “India will be the fourth country to conduct a drone show of this size, with its own design and technology, after China, Russia and the US. The three to four-minute projection mapping show will be showcased on the walls of North and South Blocks before the end of the ceremony,” he added. Last September, BotLab had organised a critically acclaimed drone light show at the IIT Delhi grounds using 60-80 nano drones, each weighing up to 250 grams. A single operator used a single computer on the ground to control drones as their LED panels changed colours, shades and shapes to create formations like the Tricolour, human DNA and a vessel. “The government has enabled scaling up the light show, which now aims to use 1,000 drones together. Their only precondition was that everything — the drones (hardware) and technologies (software) — should be made-in-India. For the IIT Delhi event, the drones were 3D-printed. This time, all drones are of much better quality, using plastic moulding and made in east Delhi’s Seelampuri,” said a source. The practice is on in full swing. All drones will have required safety features and be controlled using a single computer. “The drones will be geofenced, which means they will not be able to fly beyond a certain vertical (height) and lateral distance. Each drone also has a ‘kill switch’ that gets activated in case a machine suffers a malfunction, say GPS glitch, and will then fall to the ground,” the source added. Meanwhile, the Republic Day parade on January 26 will begin at 10.30am this year, instead of the customary 10am, to ensure better visibility of the massive flypast, in which 75 aircraft will take part. “People for the first time will also get a glimpse of some unseen visuals from the cockpits of fighter jets performing manoeuvres,” the senior official said. The pandemic, however, will be a dampener. “The number of people physically attending the parade has been severely curtailed. The exact number is still being finalised but it will be only 5,000-8,000,” the official said.

Endosulfan victim and social worker Shridhar Gowda brought to the notice of deputy commissioner K V Rajendra, that a few children at the Kokkada Daycare Centre were not provided diapers, and the vehicle facility to pick them up was stopped. The DC directed Sajivuddeen, district coordinator Endosulfan Cell, to look into the issue immediately, and call for fresh tenders in case the drivers refuse to pick up the children. He also asked officials to look into the procurement of diapers through tenders. Meanwhile, at the Koila Daycare Centre, it was brought to the notice of the DC, that the parents meeting was not held for the past two years. The centre is managed by Seon Ashram, and a section of the parents accused the staff of providing victims with sleeping pills. The DC directed officials, including the assistant commissioner, Puttur, and district health officer, to hold a meeting in the presence of a counsellor and medical health professional, to review the situation at the centre, and decide if the Seon Ashram should continue to manage the centre for the next six months, or fresh tenders be called. The DC also reviewed the progress of the four proposed daycare centres to come up at Vittal, Kaniyoor, Bellare and Panaje. The maintenance cost is approximately Rs 2.8 lakh per month for them. When the issue regarding admission to superspeciality hospitals for endosulfan victims was raised, and a social worker said that many were not aware of the benefits available at these hospitals, the DC said that a video and a booklet with all details will be released soon. It is the responsibility of the village accountants to ensure that every house with an endosulfan victim has a copy of the booklet, he said. Many demanded that lower rung officials must be sensitised on how to deal with endosulfan victims. Activist Ravindranath Shanbhag raised concerns about the lack of facilities at the mobile health units, and suggested a similar facility at a PHC. The DC assured to look into the issue. Only 209 patients were making use of the facility. The DC discussed various issues, including a permanent rehabilitation centre at Kadaba, and insurance cover for endosulfan victims, and the provision to provide them nutritious food. On the alleged dumping of endosulfan pesticide at Nettanige Mudnur, bordering Dakshina Kannada and Kerala, the DC said that he has already taken up the issue with his counterpart in Kasaragod district, and said that the issue will also be taken up through the District Legal Services Authority. Mohammed Ismail from Uppinangady arrived at the meeting by carrying his son, an endosulfan victim, and demanded that he be provided a house. The DC directed the officials to look into his case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/denial-of-facilities-to-endosulfan-victims-highlighted-at-meeting/articleshow/88981052.cms||---

As many as 836 active cases have been reported on Tuesday, while it was 666 on Monday. The highest number of active cases among policemen have been reported from Thiruvananthapuram city police (148) and Thiruvananthapuram rural (45) while Thrissur city (4) and Kollam city (5) are at the bottom of the chart. With the number rising exponentially, the police top brass have once again begun ensuring that the vaccination drive for the booster dose is completed, and the police officials are adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. “We are aiming at 100% vaccination for policemen. Administering the booster shots have also started and are being expedited. All police officials have been asked to strictly adhere to Covid safety protocols,” said DGP (armed police battalion) K Padmakumar, who is also the Covid-19 monitoring officer for the police force. Among the six armed police battalions, the highest number of active cases were reported from the special armed police battalion at Peroorkada in the capital with 30 active cases on Tuesday. While only one case was reported at Kerala armed police battalion-6 at Nilambur, three cases were reported among the members of the women’s police battalion in the capital. Despite the number of policemen being affected by Covid has shot up in the last one week, only one policeman was reported to be admitted to hospital. In 2020, as many as 7,321 policemen were affected by Covid, of which seven succumbed to the virus. In 2021, as many as 15,332 policemen were affected by the virus and 12 lost their lives. The state police have been actively pressed for Covid-19-related enforcement activities along with health department officials. After the initial days of lockdown when police were deputed for ensuring the lockdown, they were given the task of cluster and containment management duties. The police were given more responsibilities after finding that the majority of those affected by the end of July were from primary contacts outside their families. However, the decision was modified later when the number of Covid cases among police officials increased. The police then decided that no official above 50 years of age should be put on Covid-related field duty. The state police chief instructed that even if the police personnel are below 50 years of age, they should not be put on field duty if they have comorbidities. The police had then taken more precautions, including familiarizing all those on field duty, on health protocols. The officials, along with their family members, were asked to follow all the health protocols, both while on and off duty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-cases-rise-among-police-force/articleshow/88981815.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Hyderabad||Telangana may offer English & Telugu medium instruction in government schools||HYDERABAD: Unlike the Andhra Pradesh government which made English medium compulsory in all government schools right from primary classes, the Telangana government is likely to offer both English and Telugu mediums parallelly in government schools from the academic year 2022-23. A senior official from the school education department said that the state is not looking to replace Telugu medium schools with English medium ones. In the state, English medium is already being offered in about 3,000 government high schools and about 6,000 government upper primary and primary schools. “It is likely that both Telugu and English medium will be run parallelly in the state. It is up to parents to decide in which medium they want to continue their child’s education,” said an official, adding that about 40% of schools are already offering both English and Telugu mediums. There are 26, 065 government schools in the state in which about 20 lakh students are studying. However, about 65% of the total strength is concentrated in 9, 123 schools. On Monday, The Telangana cabinet decided to introduce the English medium in all government schools in the state from the coming academic year. The decision was taken after seeing a substantial jump in enrolment of such students with that preference in the state in the past year, especially after the second wave of the pandemic. To prepare modalities a cabinet sub-committee, which will be headed by education minister P Sabita Indra Reddy, has been constituted. “After the committee submits its report, the state will bring in a new Act to introduce English medium in the government schools from the coming academic year,” said the official. Even the government teachers said though the state has not made it clear whether Telugu medium will be discontinued or will run parallelly with English medium, it is most likely the state will continue with both. “We will get a clear picture once the sub-committee submits its report, but most probably both the mediums will continue,” said Chava Ravi,general secretary, Telangana State United Teachers Federation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-may-offer-eng-telugu-medium-instruction/articleshow/88983496.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||‘Uphill task for Eng plan at govt schools’||Hyderabad: While teachers and educationalists welcomed the government’s move to introduce English medium in all government schools in Telangana, they said that it will be an uphill task for the state to implement it.Primary reason: Lack of teachers competent in the English language. “If the state is serious about providing quality education, it has to conduct English orientation classes for teachers for about three to four months so that they can teach in English,” said M Ravinder,vice-president, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation. He said that though teachers might have knowledge, about the subject, they might face difficulties with terminology, grammar, and communication if they are asked to take classes in English without any training.Citing the example of 625 success schools — started in 2008 in the state after they were converted from the existing Telugu medium into English medium — teachers said that not a single English teacher was recruited for these schools. Instead, teachers from Urdu or Telugu mediums were roped in to take classes even for English.To avoid a similar situation, the state should recruit new teachers this time around so that students can compete with those studying in top-notch private schools, teachers added. They said the faculty must be asked to do certification courses in English.“How can one expect a Telugu or Urdu medium teacher to teach in English? If that happens it will do more harm than good to the students. The only solution is to recruit competent teachers,” said Prof K Laxminarayana, organising secretary, Telangana Save Education Committee and a professor at the University of Hyderabad.“They talked about free KG to PG education, implementing common school system, introducing English medium with CBSE syllabus, even before. This might just be another such announcement. If the state is serious, why did it not announce anything regarding teachers’ recruitment,” he questioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/uphill-task-for-eng-plan-at-govt-schools/articleshow/88983499.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

They said that there has been a tremendous loss of education by keeping schools shut during the first and second waves and added that the state should ensure there was no further loss of academic activity by ensuring that online classes were conducted until physical classes resume. “Schools should be first to open and last to close as a public policy. However, in India, schools have remained shut for about two years even as all other sectors, including multiplexes or movie theatres, bars, clubs, where people spend considerable amount of time, and as well as public gatherings are resumed. It is meaningless to say that schools are turning into Covid clusters and children are the most affected,” TRSMA president Y Shekhar Rao said. The TRSMA members said that they have taken all precautions while conducting physical classes since September 2021 and added that it was unfair to shut schools once again because of Omicron. They pointed out that educational institutions were functioning in the US, France and England. “The reason is maybe they are well aware of the importance of education and limited use of online classes,” TRSMA general secretary S Madhusudan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/resume-physical-classes-from-feb-1-trsma/articleshow/88983501.cms||---

Historians found the 13th century sculptures lying in the bushes at the famous Saivite temple. A life-size statue of Siva and a Nandi idol carved out of black basalt stone were found.Archaeologist E Sivanagi Reddy said they found them during the explorations conducted near the Anjaneya temple at the foot of the hill on Tuesday. “Umamaheswaram is considered to be the northern gate of famous Siva shrine Srisailam. The Saivite sculpture’s head and hands are broken. The Nandi idol’s head and left leg were also in broken condition,” he said.The idols are decorated with rich ornamentation representing the artistic dexterity of the mature phase of the Kakatiya art that flourished during the 14th century AD. Sriramoju Haragopal, convenor, Kotha Telangana Charitra Brindam, said the mutilated Saivite sculpture represents Veerabhadra based on the style of art and iconography and a similar discovery he found at Devaracharla in Nalgonda. “An inscription of the last Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra dated to 1320 AD was found inside the temple. It records donation of lands in 16 villages for the maintenance of Umamaheswara temple that attests the Kakatiya patronage,” he explained. Sivanagi Reddy said that a 14th century inscription at Umamaheswaram records the installation of the sculptures of Parvati, Chennakesava, Mahishasura Mardhini, Veerabhadra and Nandikeswara (bull) by Sadananda Swamy and were carved by two sculptor brothers Chinna Sarabhayya and Peda Sarabhayya. He said the sculptures of Veerabhadra and Nandi were the same ones mentioned in the above inscription and the other three sculptures — Parvati, Chennakesava and Mahishasura Mardhini — were now seen inside the mahamandapa of the Umamaheswara temple. “It is disheartening to know from locals that the two sculptures were left in such condition by miscreants. Neglect of an inscription of the Recharla chief madanayaka dating back to 1377 AD was broken into four pieces and found scattered at Anjaneya temple,” he lamented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kakatiya-era-sculptures-in-t-lying-in-neglect/articleshow/88983504.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili, which was hearing a two-year-old PIL on the issue, expressed its unhappiness with the state and the CS for not filing its counter for so long. “File your counter or appear before us on March 14 to explain your case,” the bench said, while seeking reasons for keeping several posts vacant despite officers waiting to work. The PIL was filed by retired postal employee, Bondili Nagadhar Singh, who had questioned the state’s attempts to dodge the issue. Petitioner’s counsel M Venkanna said that scores of officials from excise, revenue and commercial taxes departments were sitting idle without any postings for months and years together. “Since the government has been paying salaries to all such idle officers, it should be concluded that the state has been purposefully wasting state funds on account of its inaction. There is no point in crying hoarse citing lack of officers while wasting the services of the available ones like this,” Venkanna said. At a time when the state needs more people to attend to relief activities pertaining to the pandemic, it would be a criminal waste of resources and wrong strategy to keep officials idle, Venkanna said. “Even while keeping these officers without any postings, several tasks are being entrusted to a few officers as additional charges,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/explain-why-officials-not-given-postings-for-yrs-hc/articleshow/88983508.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The demand for more officers has increased in the past two years, especially after enhancement of districts to 33 from earlier 10 districts. According to officials, during the bifurcation of the state, the Centre had allocated only 208 IAS officers and 119 IPS officers while the state requires at least 250 IAS officers and another 200 IPS officers for various positions. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has been asking the Centre to allocate more All India Services (AIS) officers for the past few years and submitted representations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah on various occasions. During his meeting with Shah a few months ago, the CM asked to enhance the IPS officers’ cadre strength to 139 to 195. But, there is a criticism against the government for not utilising the services of existing AIS officers, especially IAS and IPS officers effectively. While some officers are holding more than one crucial departments, some departments are being given to retired IAS officers. For instance, V Anil Kumar, a retired IAS officer, was given important postings such as commissioner of civil supplies department and also endowments commissioner. Some other departments like education are being headed by Sandeep Kumar Sultania, who is also secretary of panchayat raj and also animal husbandry departments. Similarly, Neetu Prasad has been handling two crucial departments — as commissioner of commercial taxes and also member-secretary of Telangana State Pollution Control Board. Municipal administration special chief secretary Arvind Kumar is incharge commissioner of information and public relations department and also commissioner of HMDA. Special chief secretary K Ramakrishna Rao is incharge of planning department apart from finance wing. There is a feeling in the IAS and IPS officers that some senior officers’ services were not being utilised properly by confining them to the same post for several years. “A senior IAS officer of secretary cadre is not being shifted in a department in the city for almost six years though he made a request to the government. Similarly, an officer in the welfare department is also seeking change in his posting,” sources in the government said. The situation is same even in districts with Siddipet and Bhadradri-Kothagudem not having a full-fledged collectors for the past few months. In IPS officers’ postings too, some officers were in the same posts in the past five to six years while it is a general norm that they should be relocated after two to three years of their existing postings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/severe-shortage-of-ias-ips-officers-continues-to-haunt-admin-in-state/articleshow/88983509.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||...But several have escaped the charge despite fatalities||Hyderabad: The latest arrests of five youngsters responsible for a drunk driving fatality notwithstanding, in many cases, tipplers causing fatalities have not been charged with culpable homicide though police rolled out a policy in 2015. Family members of the accident victims that TOI spoke to said that the sections of IPC were not followed by cops. Since 2015, the state police took it up as a policy while booking the accused involved in drunken driving fatalities under section 304 (II) of IPC (culpable homicide) instead of section 304(A) of IPC (causing death due to negligence). While cops book the accused under culpable homicide section in a majority of the cases, its implementation lacks consistency as family members of the accident victims point out that the sections are not followed in toto.For instance, in October 2020, 24-year-old Jennifer Maria D’Cruz died on the spot while her fiance T Ajay sustained grievous injuries in a hit-and-run accident after a businessman rammed his SUV against their two-wheeler. Cops managed to arrest the accused Kasa Srujan Kumar (28) of Vivekananda Nagar in Kukatpally and found that he was ‘drunk’ at the time of the accident.However, they registered a case under sections 304(A) and 337 (endangering life) of the IPC. Three months after coming to know about the technicality, John Cyrill, Maria’s father, approached Madhapur police. Cops admitted that the accident warranted culpable homicide and eventually agreed to alter the section while filing the chargesheet. “We spoke to Madhapur police and they said that since the chargesheet is being filed most probably by the end of this month, they will alter the sections,” John told TOI. In a more recent instance that happened three weeks ago, cops booked Nikhil Reddy, an engineering student, for killing B Neeraja and injuring her husband Hanuman Das. Here too, cops booked an FIR initially under section 304(A) and later altered it to 304(II). “Soon after the fatal accident took place, we did register a case under section 304(A) and later when the test result showed that the accused was drunk, we altered the section to 304(II),” Ghatkesar circle inspector Chandra Babu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/-but-several-have-escaped-the-charge-despite-fatalities/articleshow/88983514.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Delhi||Making Waves: How A Third Radar Can Help Capital Weather The Storm Better||New Delhi: In July last year, INA Colony in south Delhi suffered inundation in a few areas after heavy rains. In contrast, no rainfall was recorded at the weather observatories at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, and Lodhi Road, both in the vicinity. To forecast such localised flash floods and alert the public in real time, the India Meteorological Department has now installed a Doppler weather radar (DWR) at Ayanagar, making Delhi the first Indian city to have three such devices. The antenna of the radar, which looks like a giant ball sitting on a tower, detects weather systems like rain, thunderstorm, hailstorm and cyclonic storms using radio waves, also known as radar beams. The radio waves travel at the speed of light and when the beam strikes rain or hail, it bounces back to the radar. The meteorologists analyse the strength and time it took for the beam to return to predict the type of precipitation or other weather trend and also measure their distance from the source radar. In Delhi, IMD uses three DWRs employing microwaves at S, C and X bands. Met officials said the wavelength and frequency of radar played an important role in determining the effective range of radar to detect a weather phenomenon. The S-band radar at Delhi airport with a wavelength of 7.5-15cm has an effective radar range of 400km. The C-band DWR atop Mausam Bhawan on Lodhi Road with a wavelength of 3.8-7.5cm and can detect rain and thunderstorm over Delhi-NCR up to 250km. “The polarimetric radar can tell if hail has been formed in the clouds,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. Delhi’s third DWR, the X band device at Ayanagar, has a wavelength of 2.4-3.8cm and it can detect severe weather with a radius of 100km around NCR. According to Met officials, the radar at Delhi airport is employed for detecting severe weather and aerodrome warning and forecast aviation weather hazards like thunderstorm, dust storms, height and areas of cumulonimbus clouds (associated with clouds which can produce thunder or lightning) and wind shear. The Lodhi Road radar is being used to detect thunderstorms and heavy rainfall over Delhi-NCR area and to identify the type of precipitation — rain or hail — and to determine the intensity of winds. Met officials said the radar at Ayanagar will help predict localised flash floods and aid in identifying areas and depth of inundation in real time at such locations. It will facilitate impact-based forecasting and warn markets, wards or streets about risks related to winds, thunderstorms and heavy rain. “The main difference between the radars at Lodhi Road and Ayanagar is the resolution. As the wavelength is shorter at Ayanagar, the resolution is high and will be useful in three-hourly weather warnings issued by IMD,” said Jenamani. He elaborated, “As it will help in identifying locations of inundation in real time, we can issue advisories on rain, dust storms or thunderstorms to the public. Say, there is inundation in some parts of Dhaula Kuan due to heavy rain, we can immediately issue an advisory to the public and police can divert traffic to other routes.” TOI had already reported how IMD was developing an urban meteorological service for Delhi/NCR to forecast the impact of weather in specific places, including inundation hotspots in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/making-waves-how-a-third-radar-can-help-capital-weather-the-storm-better/articleshow/88982344.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Hyderabad||Five drunk drivers held for culpable homicide in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police arrested five persons in two separate fatal road accident cases under the charge of culpable homicide. While an Air India staffer and two of his friends were arrested in a drunk driving accident causing the death of a cyclist at Masjid Banda, a truck driver and his employer were arrested for causing a fatal accident while driving without a license at Kukatpally. At 5.45 am on December 31, a sedan driven by Shashank Shekar, a B.Com graduate and cabin crew of Air India hit a cyclist, Nithin Agarwal, 45, of Gachibowli and fatally injured him near Botanial Gardens on Kothaguda-Masjid Banda road. Agarwal succumbed to injuries on January 1 and his fellow cyclists, Sanjeet Srivastava and Rajiv Gajaria sustained minor injuries in the accident. Police arrested Shashank for driving under the influence of alcohol as his BAC reading was 186 mg/100 ml. Police found that Shashank’s friends, Manabendra Roy, a cabin crew member of Air India and I Srikanth, a employee of Accenture in Pune were also in the car at the time of the mishap. “The trio consumed alcohol at Shashank’s flat in Masjid Banda on December 30 night and at 5.30 am on December 31, they went to Ayyappa Society for breakfast. While they were returning to Masjid Banda the accident occurred,” police said. As Roy and Srikanth knowingly allowed Shashank to drive the car when he was under the influence of alcohol, police booked them for abetting culpable homicide not amounting to murder. All three friends were produced before the court in Kukatpally and sent in judicial remand in the first week of January. In another fatal road accident, Y Jagan Mohan Reddy, 28, a private worker from Nagole, died when his bike was hit by a tipper at Metro Pillar No. 756 in Kukatpally at 4 am on January 9. Police found out that the tipper driver, O Ravinder, drove in a negligent manner and dashed the victim’s bike. Police arrested Ravinder and as he does not have a driving license, cops charged him and his employer under culpable homicide. The duo was remanded in judicial custody on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/five-drunk-drivers-held-for-culpable-homicide-/articleshow/88983521.cms||---

This is for the first time since BJP’s inception in Goa that it will contest all seats. To date, it has contested a maximum of 39. Most constituencies, incidentally, have only one name for the ticket. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, Tanavade, BJP general secretary (organisation) Satish Dhond, Union minister of state Shripad Naik and Goa desk in-charge C T Ravi will attend a parliamentary board meeting before the list of candidates is finalised. Tanavade did not rule out the possibility of revolt within the party once its first list was released, and said that BJP would convince everyone to work together to elect the party’s candidate. “The parliamentary board will take a decision on tickets,” Tanavade said when asked if the party was likely to face embarrassment over ‘family raj’ if two of a family were given an opportunity to contest the elections. The first list may not contain the names of candidates in the constituencies of Santa Cruz, Canacona, Sanguem, Bicholim and Cumbharjua. TOI had reported on Tuesday that Goa legislative assembly speaker and sitting BJP Bicholim MLA Rajesh Patnekar has conveyed to the party that he has decided not to contest the upcoming elections on health grounds. MGP’s probable candidate Naresh Sawal and independent candidate Chandrakant Shetye have also declined BJP’s offer. Meanwhile, BJP has shortlisted three names in Santa Cruz, including sitting MLA Antonio Fernandes, Chimbel ZP’s Girish Uskaikar, and Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate’s close aide and former Taleigao sarpanch, Angelo da Cunha.

---||Delhi||Eight-hour shifts for Delhi cops, ‘e-chittha’ software kickstarted in Rohini district on pilot basis||NEW DELHI: The much-talked-about eight-hour shift system in Delhi Police has started in Rohini district on a pilot basis. All 10 police stations there are on the new time system. The new e-chittha software to automatically allot duties to police personnel is also being tried out. The integrated e-chittha and 8-hour shift programme is expected not only to reduce the workload of the force, but also create transparency with respect to allocation of responsibilities. On Monday, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana asked the DCPs of all districts to see how e-chittha can be incorporated into the 8-hour shift system. The pilot in Rohini will help evaluate the merger and synchronise the two initiatives. After years of just being discussed, the 8-hour shift system is finally in place. With the separation of law and order and the integration of the police control room with the local police station, the strength of police personnel in each police station has increased. The shifts run from 8am to 4pm, 4pm to midnight and midnight to 8am, but this can differ depending on the police station and the area. The e-chittha software, developed by an IPS officer, aims to reduce the human interface while deploying staff in the police stations. “The system has to be integrated with the 8-hour shift system to ensure a time-bound shift for a policeman,” explained an officer. “The software automatically generates the place where a police personnel is to be posted, while its integration with the 8-hour shift system ensures that the specific person does duty only as per his shift timings. We are implementing the e-chittha in 10 police stations on a pilot basis and the 8-hour shift is going to be implemented as a pilot in the Rohini district. Once the results of both are analysed, further action on their expansion will be taken.” TimesViewCops posted in police stations are often overworked due to lack of regular duty hours. The shift system is a much-needed move that will hopefully lead to more efficiency.The 8- hour shift system currently has in its purview personnel up to the rank of a sub-inspector. The move will not provide rest to people deployed at the police station level. The e-chittha programme will give information about any policeman’s place of deployment at a specific time. TOI spoke to cops to find out if the integration was helpful. One of them said, “The change will definitely be productive, but we want it to be universal. For example, an SHO has to remain in the police station longer than the shift timings, so a way has to be worked out about this. When an SHO is on leave, the officer immediately below takes charge. This same system can be adopted on a daily basis to allow an SHO eight hours of work. Also, to meet security demands police personnel are often deployed away from the police station. There has to be a way for adequate staff presence in police stations at such times to ensure uninterrupted shift timings.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/8-hour-shifts-for-cops-e-chittha-software-kickstarted-in-rohini-district-on-pilot-basis/articleshow/88982348.cms||---

Police said the accused, who had come from inside the campus, fled after she raised an alarm. So far, no arrests have been made. The PCR got a call around 12.45am on Tuesday regarding the molestation. DCP (Southwest) Gaurav Sharma and the local Station House Officer went to the campusto probe the case. “Around 11.45pm on Monday, a woman pursuing PhD at JNU was taking a stroll. When she reached near the east gate of the university, a man came on a bike from inside the campus and tried to molest her. The girl raised an alarm and the accused rode off inside the campus. A case of outraging the modesty of a woman has been registered and efforts are on to nab the accused,” said Sharma. Angry over the incident, JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) on Tuesday carried out a protest march demanding action against the accused and raised concerns over the safety of women students inside the campus. “Gender insensitivity has increased in the campus along with sexist comments and misappropriate remarks. There has been an alarming increase in cases of stalking and harassment. Hooligans have been sighted in speeding cars, playing loud music and hooting, making it very uncomfortable for women to step outside at night. In most cases, it was observed that the offenders were not JNU students,” JNUSU stated. JNUSU also reiterated their demand to reestablish the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment (GSCASH). “The incident brings to light the failure of the JNU administration that dismantled GSCASH and replaced it with the inefficient Internal Complaints Committee,” the students’ body added.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Medical staff shortage hits Covid treatment in Palakkad||PALAKKAD: There is an acute shortage of medical and paramedical staff at the special Covid-19 treatment centre in the district hospital as new cases have crossed 1,000 in the district. The main Covid-19 specialized treatment centre at the district hospital lacks enough staff. Since Covid-19 special wards are full and other medical branches are also functioning, there is an acute shortage of medical and paramedical staff. To overcome the crisis, the hospital management committee tried to take in staff on a temporary basis. But not enough trained people could be hired. The National Health Mission should have provided more medical staff but they have stopped recruitments. More health workers being affected by the third wave of Covid-19 has compounded the problem, said experts in the health sector . Though the government has issued directions to start Covid first-line treatment (CFLT) centres, it is difficult to open more of them due to the non-availability of medical and paramedical staff. The Covid-19 treatment centre will start in Palakkad Government Medical College from Wednesday with the limited staff it has now. After the second wave, the Covid-19 Brigade, recruited by the National Health Mission, was disbanded. Thus the health department has directed the taluk hospitals, public health centres, community health centres and family health centres to admit more patients to ease the pressure on the district hospital, which is depended on by a majority of people for their treatment. As the district hospital is facing a serious crisis, it has no full-time superintendent and the deputy superintendent is given charge of the superintendent. The superintendent of the district hospital is given charge of the district medical officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/medical-staff-shortage-hits-covid-treatment-in-palakkad/articleshow/88981844.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||At 17,000, Gujarat daily Covid surge higher than 2nd wave peak; 10 deaths||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat on Tuesday recorded 17,119 Covid-19 cases, breaking the earlier all-time high of 14,605 daily cases registered on April 30 last year at the peak of the second wave. The state saw a 34% spike in cases in a day, recording an average 12 cases every minute. It also recorded 10 deaths after seven months. It was also the day of highest-ever daily tallies for four major cities of Gujarat. Against an earlier high of 5,790 in April last year, Ahmedabad city recorded 5,998 cases. Surat and Vadodara had recorded their highest daily cases on January 14 this year at 2,986 and 1,274 respectively. Against that, on Tuesday these cities recorded 3,563 and 1,529 cases. Rajkot recorded highest jump – from 764 on April 20 last year to 1,336. It was the first day for the state where all four major cities recorded 1,000-plus daily cases. As the state struggles with a surging third wave, shortage of doctors in government colleges and hospitals continues to plague the state. The eight Gujarat Medical & Education Research Society (GMERS)-run colleges of Gujarat have 30% shortage of doctors as the college authority has not been able to fill 323 vacant positions of professors, associate professor and assistant professors. While the doctors at these colleges have been at the forefront in the state's battle against Covid-19 for about two years now, a change in rule by the GMERS authority for over three years now where professors are recruited on contractual basis rather than on permanent basis is said to be a major reason behind this shortfall in Covid warriors. "The last recruitment for regular full-time faculty members was in July 2019 after which hiring has been done on a three-year contractual basis," said Bipin Nayak, CEO, GMERS. GMERS-run medical colleges are in Sola, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Himmatnagar, Vadnagar, Patan, Gotri, Valsad, Junagadh. These medical colleges affiliated with state government-run Civil hospitals are run by state appointed trust GMERS. There are 1,600 seats for admissions in first year MBBS every year and there would be about 6,400 students in their first year to fourth year studying in these eight colleges. Some experts feel that it is difficult to find faculty members in clinical branches as compared to non-clinical ones. Of the 323 vacant positions, about 250 will be for clinical field. In the case of professors there are 60 who are hired on regular basis while 31 positions are filled by appointments on contractual basis. The total number of positions approved by GMERS is 169 of which a total of 78 lie vacant. Dr Nitin Vora, dean of GMERS medical college at Sola in Ahmedabad said the number of vacant posts at his college are less than 10%. "In the case of cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot and Surat it is easier to find faculty in clinical areas as compared to other smaller cities in Gujarat." The doctors of GMERS and government-run medical colleges have threatened to go on a strike from January 20 to press for their pending demands. One of their demands is to recruit faculty members in GMERS colleges on a permanent basis and do away with the system of hiring temporary teachers. "In many cases, the assistant professors are recruited on an 11-month contract basis. There can be a lack of commitment on their part as they are there for a short duration. The government can fix their responsibility by recruiting them on a permanent basis," said Dr Bhavesh Dalwadi, secretary, GMERS. Dr Hiren Prajapati, president of GMERS faculty association said hiring of faculty on a contractual basis will not draw aspirants from the clinical field. "There is a lot of pressure on the students due to a shortage of faculty," said Dr Prajapati.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/at-17k-guj-daily-surge-higherthan-2nd-wave-peak-10-deaths/articleshow/88983525.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||India||In 2020, Covid top cause of death in Mumbai: RTI reply||MUMBAI: Covid-19 displaced usual chart-toppers heart attack and cancer to become the leading cause of death in the city in 2020. Out of 1.1 lakh total deaths recorded in the first year of the pandemic, 11,105 (10%) were Covid fatalities, 8,576 (7.6%) were cancer deaths and 5,633 (5%) were heart attacks, according to recent data accessed through RTI. While deaths under most of the dozen heads separately mentioned saw a drop, three conditions saw higher fatalities compared to non-pandemic years - kidney failure, malaria and typhoid. The data, based on death certificates issued by the BMC, show a 35% drop in heart attacks in 2020 compared to 2018 (8,601) and nearly 4% compared to 2019 (5,849). Cancer deaths too dropped by 14%-15% in 2020 (8,576) compared to two pre-pandemic years of 2018 (10,073) and 2019 (9,958). Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit committee, said a drop in deaths due to communicable diseases and trauma was expected, but heart attack and cancer deaths simply cannot disappear; factors such as certification, deaths at home need to be looked into closely. Hospitals had seen a decline in cardiac events in the first few months of the pandemic because of a combination of factors and partly due to the fear of coming to hospitals, said cardiologist Dr Brian Pinto. However, the numbers normalised as everything started to open. The data showed deaths in Mumbai were up 22.7% in 2020 over the earlier year, and a vast majority of them is attributed - as in the earlier years - to 'Other Diseases'. That head could include deaths due to septicaemia, bacterial diseases, intestinal infection, blood disorders, encephalitis, and poisoning, among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-2020-covid-top-cause-of-death-in-mumbai-rti-reply/articleshow/88983531.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rice rates soar in local markets on high exports, record procurement||KOLKATA: The increase in retail prices of rice, the main staple in eastern India, is causing considerable stress in households already struggling with tight budgets and ever soaring prices of commodities. Record procurement of rice, massive growth in exports of rice to Bangladesh and Vietnam and higher transportation costs have all contributed to the price rise that has happened twice in the past two months. Parboiled varieties of rice, particularly fine and long grain ones, have increased by Rs 8-12 a kg since November. These are the varieties largely consumed in Bengal’s towns and cities. Traders say the price could rise further due to high demand for the long-grain Bengal variety in Bangladesh and other countries in the region. State government agri-adviser Pradeep Mazumdar, though, allayed such fears, saying the prices could actually stabilise and even go down once the Boro crop is harvested. “All these long-grain rice varieties are products of Boro season. The seeds have just been sown and we are expecting a good crop. The prices should come down,” he claimed. But rice traders said while both the Centre and state have procured record quantities of rice at higher MSP in 2020-21, sowing was just 40% compared to 2019-20, leaving a deficit in production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rice-rates-soar-in-local-markets-on-high-exports-record-procurement/articleshow/88983533.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||There’s no feud, TMC is gearing up for party polls: Partha||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Tuesday dismissed the war of words among party leaders against each other to be an internal feud. “There is no point in bringing Abhishek Banerjee into the controversy. The entire incident is being blown up by a section of the media,” TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.Chatterjee said the party elections will be held from February 2 and will conclude before March. The list of delegates, he said, who can vote will be prepared by him — as the party’s poll returning officer — by January 25. It will start with electing the party chairperson and then the other party bodies will be formed. The February 2 elections will be held at Netaji Indoor Stadium after adherence to all Covid protocols.Asked about the rift, he said, “We remain a united family. Each one of us will work under the guidance of Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee. The organisational poll will be held under their guidance. As a returning officer, I cannot comment beyond that.”The statements come in the backdrop of the 153 lawyers attached to the Trinamool Congress legal cell first demonstrating and then writing a letter to the Supreme Court and Calcutta High Court chief justices along with CM Mamata Banerjee against senior lawyer and Srirampore MP Kalyan Banerjee.The letter makes several personal insinuations against Kalyan, including nepotism. Kalyan, however, chose not to respond to the allegations. “I have nothing to say. The chief minister and the party supremo is watching everything.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/theres-no-feud-tmc-is-gearing-up-for-party-polls-partha/articleshow/88983534.cms||---

The court stated that the petitioners will have to wait for the next delimitation excercise, which will take place after the first census after 2026.  “The petitioners are not justified in contending that relief can be granted to them because they are not seeking delimitation of constituencies but they are seeking implementation of reservation in accordance with the already existing delimitation and already existing census. We are of the opinion that the petitioners are actually seeking a direction from this court against the respondents for carrying out an exercise, which under the aforesaid scheme of the Constitution has to wait till the next exercise of delimitation is undertaken in terms of the provisions of the Constitution and the Delimitation Act,” the court stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-st-quota-for-assembly-polls/articleshow/88982425.cms||---

But no one has been admitted to hospital. According to sources, 99% of the police force were vaccinated twice and 70% of the city cops out of 2,700 eligible had taken booster dose. “The third wave is very infectious. The infected are in home isolation with mild symptoms. We have been taking precautions and asked our staff to attend duties with contactless policing,” said city police chief Manish Kumar Sinha. Collector A Mallikharjuna, GVMC commissioner Lakshmisha, GVMC chief medical officer Sastry and DMHO Tirupati Rao and many officials of various departments have been tested positive. Tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao, deputy CM, and revenue minister Dharmana Krishna Das too tested positive.

---||Kolkata||Calcutta University’s Ballygunge campus gets a healing touch||KOLKATA: Calcutta University has started renovating its over-a-century-old Ballygunge campus. The state PWD has undertaken the renovation work. The Rajabazar campus will be the next on agenda. The CU authorities said the renovation work started last week. The overall renovation for the College Street campus of Calcutta University is also underway. The Ballygunge Science College is the second campus where a complete renovation project has been taken up. It began with the outer wall repairs but soon it will get the look of a modern building with all facilities. The auditorium on the campus will also be refurbished with all modern equipment and facilities. Renovation work in progressA few years ago, a devastating fire broke out in the university’s Ballygunge campus, damaging some floors, especially the zoology department. Now the CU authorities are planning to come up with proper fire fighting system on every floor with fire extinguishers and sprinklers. Classrooms, elevators and the guest house will be renovated one by one. Vice-Chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee said, “CU embarks on the renovation of its Ballygunge Science College Campus in view of the celebration of 75 years of Indian Independence.” Taraknath Palit, who was closely involved with the Swadeshi movement, had gifted his sprawling house for the purpose of Science and Technology, where the Ballygunge Science College came up. Palit donated his huge assets and property, including his house, in 1912 for University College and Science and Technology, which was soon followed by equally magnanimous charity for the same purpose from Rashbehari Ghosh in 1913. Palit executed two trust deeds in June and October, 1912 for Calcutta University by donating 1.5 million. Palit and Ghosh together donated nearly Rs 37.5 lakh that was used to build Taraknath Palit Siksha Prangan on Ballygunge Circular Road and Rashbehari Siksha Prangan at Rajabazar. The VC said Palit’s mission was to develop a strong higher educational base in the pre-independence era. It was a remarkable move and a great contribution for Swadeshi advancement along the path of scientific teaching and learning during colonial times. The renowned teaching staff took the baton of the Swadeshi progression like Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray, Sir Chandra Sekhar Venkata Raman, Sisir Kumar Mitra. “Today, by resolving to initiate a full scale renovation of Ballygunge campus, also known as the Taraknath Palit Siksha Prangan, through the state PWD, we pay our tribute to the original pathfinders who had paved the way for India’s freedom” the VC added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cus-ballygunge-campus-gets-a-healing-touch/articleshow/88983536.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Gyms open after a fortnight’s Covid break, fitness freaks celebrate||KOLKATA: From dividing members and patrons into different slots to issuing multiple restrictions, including ban on lockers, sauna and shower chambers, and strict check of vaccination and infection status before entry, gyms across Kolkata went back to the basics of Covid protocol that had been adopted following the first and second wave of the pandemic when they reopened after a fortnight on Tuesday. “We have curtailed the gym timings and are allowing only five at a time. We are not allowing patrons in the afternoon to sanitise the entire place before the evening shift. All patrons and staff will have to display their vaccination certificate and undergo thermal check for update on their infection status at the time of entering the gyms,” said Minu Budhia, director of Addlife gym on Camac Street. Aurit Saha, owner of Xtreme Kross fit Gym in Lake Town, said once the state government issued the order, they began texting patrons, informing them about the reopening and sought their preference of slot timings to ensure there is no crowding. “We are sticking to the government-specified norms and are also following utmost sanitisation protocol, including timely cleaning and sanitisation of the gym equipment,” said Saha. The state government had instructed gyms to shut down from January 3 following a spurt in Covid numbers. The decision had led to demonstrations from gym owners and trainers and pleas to the state government to roll back the order as it was about people’s fitness. On Monday, the state government allowed gyms to reopen with 50% of the capacity till 9pm. It also issued a rider that all staff and members needed to be vaccinated and Covid negative. “The Bengal fitness/health club industry was yet to recover from the losses incurred during the first and second wave when the third wave shutdown was enforced. Since March 2020, gyms in the city have remained shut for around six months during multiple Covid-related restrictions. We are thankful the government has allowed gyms to reopen after a fortnight,” said Gagan Sachdeva of Gym Owners’ Forum. Among those relieved was fitness trainer Biswajit Sarkar, who rushed to his gym in Salt Lake early in the morning on Tuesday only to help other staff in the sanitisation process. “This is not only our workplace but we treat this gym as our place of worship. I had lost my livelihood twice during the last two waves. I am glad this time it has been different,” said Sarkar, who is the sole breadwinner for his family of five. The fitness enthusiasts were equally excited as well. Bangur Avenue resident Ishani Ghosh said she had got used to working out at the gym since joining it two months ago. “Since I am new to fitness, working out online was a tough task for me. I am glad I could come back to the gym again,” said Ghosh (23), a teacher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gyms-open-after-a-fortnights-cov-break-fitness-freaks-celebrate/articleshow/88983538.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Reopen parks & lakes for sake of citizens’ mental and physical health, urge experts||KOLKATA: Public health experts, doctors, mental health specialists, virologists and citizens from across the spectrum have appealed to experts strategising on restrictions to control spread of Covid-19 in Kolkata and other metros to refrain from shutting down open green spaces whenever cases rise. At present, parks and lakes in the city are shut. In the past two years, these public places have remained closed for 14 months. For the few months they had been opened, timings have been extremely restrictive and children have not been allowed entry. Public health expert Charulata Banerjee, who specialises on mother and child nutrition, feels access to parks is vital for not just children and senior citizens who have been confined to homes for nearly two years but also for staying fit and building immunity to fight the virus. “It is imperative that parks reopen at the earliest so that people who do have to go out to work can get their quota of exercise,” she said. Psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram, too, called for the immediate opening of parks and squares, pointing out that they have a profound impact on the mental well-being of people, especially at a difficult time like pandemic when the normal way of life has been disrupted. “Just being in the lap of nature and seeing other people enjoy themselves can have such a positive effect,” he explained. Even virologists are perplexed by the decision to shut parks. “Transmission of a virus is many times more in an enclosed air-conditioned space than in the open. Closure of parks and lakes defy logic. These are safer places than markets, malls, theatres, restaurants and pubs,” said Sreedhar Chinnaswamy, who researchers on genetics of infectious diseases. Mental health activist Ratnaboli Ray feels people should reclaim public spaces. “One is safe to drink at an AC bar, travel in a crowded bus, shop in a congested market. But it is risky to walk or play in a park or lake. Again, a park becomes safe when a fair is organised,” she wondered. If the Maidan is the city's lungs and East Kolkata Wetlands its kidneys, the 600-plus parks are the pores: the mechanism for temperature control, says green activist Bonani Kakkar. “When parks are shut, it affects the physical and mental health. of a personAny city would be blessed to have so many parks,” she said. Corporate executive Shankho Chowdhury says it is not enough to just open the parks and lakes for a few hours in the mornings and evenings but keep them open for extended hours so that people can go in their own free time. “Let’s not do what happens in markets when restricted hours leads to crowding. Please unshackle the open spaces in the city,” he pleaded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/reopen-parks-lakes-for-sake-of-citizens-mental-and-physical-health-urge-experts/articleshow/88983539.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Kolkata||Despite 3rd wave, number of flyers has grown 5 times since 2nd wave in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Unlike the second wave, when flyer count took a plunge as Covid cases soared, the sweeping third wave is yet to act as a deterrent for air travellers. In the one month period between mid-December 2021 and mid-January 2022, the Kolkata airport has clocked five times the number of passengers it had recorded in May 2021, when the second wave was at its peak. While only 2.5 lakh passengers had travelled during May 2021 when the second wave was at its peak, 12.6 lakh passengers travelled in 31 days during the third wave. Representatives of the travel trade community said airlines as well as travel agents were petrified when Covid cases began shooting up in mid-December and passengers were detected with the Omicron variant in the country initially. But their fears were allayed by the passenger figure. “During the second wave of the pandemic, airlines had to cut down on flights as passenger count had plunged. This time, more than twice the number of flights have been operating out of Kolkata. Yet, loads on flights have been more than twice that of the second wave,” an airline official said. Against 4,367 flights that operated in the month during the second wave, 9,833 flights operated in the month-long period during the third wave. Rahul Wadhwa, chairman of Airlines’ Operators Committee at Kolkata airport, said it was the severity of the infection and high mortality rate during the second wave that had driven people indoors, out of fear of contracting the virus. “Though many more people are getting infected this time, that fear is absent as a majority of patients are also recovering quickly without the need for hospitalization,” said Wadhwa. A senior official at the Kolkata airport pointed out that the passenger footfall did fall by nearly 40% but it was primarily owing to the restrictions on flights on two high-density sectors: Delhi-Kolkata and Mumbai-Kolkata. “That a majority of the adult population is vaccinated and those infected are recovering in less than a week have boosted travellers’ confidence,” said the official. Travel Agents’ Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi, who had almost downed shutters for 45 days during the second wave, said the uncertainty had lasted barely four-five days in the initial period of the third wave, when new case count was doubling every 24 hours, he recounted. “During the second wave, people cancelled travel plans. The mood had become sombre with severe illness and deaths in families. This time, it has been business as usual,” said Punjabi. Manav Soni, chairman (east) of Travel Agents’ Association of India, felt the situation has reversed as people seem to be willing to travel now but are constrained by the absence of flights. “Europe, the US, the UK and the UAE have opened up. Thailand and Singapore are set to open. We are in the midst of the third wave but it is not affecting minds. The fear of the unknown is not longer there. That speaks volume of how we have come to live with Covid and carry on,” he remarked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/despite-3rd-wave-number-of-flyers-has-grown-5-times-since-2nd-wave/articleshow/88983544.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||1,517 violations in 16 hours: Kolkata cops mull breathalyzer test soon||KOLKATA: The Kolkata traffic police is considering to bring breathalyzer test back in order to curb the sudden rise in the number of accidents that the city has been witnessing in the past 10 days. In fact, they have already tightened the checks, registering 124 incidents of rash driving and 1,393 cases of signal jumping and erratic lane driving in 16 hours on Monday, making up for 56% of all the traffic prosecutions the day before. Monday’s figures showed that the maximum incidents of dangerous driving were reported from five guards—headquarters, Jorabagan, Sealdah, East and Vidyasagar—which reported 74 of the 124 rash driving cases. “We think that a few of the offenders drove and rode drunk. Statistics from the past back our belief as we have often found drunk driving to be closely associated with dangerous driving that includes not just speeding but also jumping signals and talking over the mobile phone,” said an officer. The high number of prosecutions came hours after Lalbazar asked all the 25 traffic guards to clamp down on dangerous driving after spot fines were reintroduced following a 10-day gap. Cops claimed that dangerous driving prosecutions saw a jump from a mere 25 cases on Sunday to 124 on Monday with ACPs recommending temporary suspension of licences in multiple cases. The total prosecutions touched 2,732, the figures almost doubling from that on Sunday, when the figure had stood at 1,406. The traffic brass said the statistics led Lalbazar to consider the reintroduction of breathalyzer tests soon. “When we had stopped spot fines, accidents went up. The figures from Monday have only proved that dangerous driving can only be kept under check through stringent prosecution. By the same logic, we need to keep a check on drunk driving. Between November and December, when we carried out breathalyzer tests, we had prosecuted over 950 bikers and motorists. Yet, this weekend, we could identify just six drunk cases in the absence of the test. Under normal circumstances, weekend drunk driving cases are much higher than that on weekdays. Mondays usually throw up the least number of drunk drivers and riders. Yet on Monday, we arrested three persons for drunk driving, the same number for this Saturday and Sunday. Thus, it is clear several motorists are managing to slip away even while being drunk,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Kolkata Police traffic unit shared the examples of Indian Railways, Delhi Police and Chennai Police, who are continuing tests using the same SOP as KP. A final decision on reintroduction of the breathalyzer test is expected “very soon”. “At present, there is no breathalyzer test. But it might change any time, depending on Covid numbers and its spread. One-time use of disposable straws and sanitisation of equipment after every use are good enough precautions. No link has so far been established between Covid and breathalyzer tests. Hence, we are hoping to resume breathalyzer tests soon,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/1517-violations-in-16-hrs-cops-mull-breathalyzer-test-soon/articleshow/88983546.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The third-year student’s family members, residents of Chetla, informed Hastings police about the matter. Though the youth’s bike was recovered from the bridge, cops were yet to ascertain whether he had chosen to jump into the river. Cops were checking CCTV footage and talking to some witnesses in this regard. However, cops refused to confirm if the youth had stated any reason, for which he wanted to take the drastic step. “Before the video call, he had sent another video to his elder brother, telling him that he was planning to end his life. We have found that there is no proper reason for him to take such extreme step in life. He worked in a small accountancy firm at Ladies Park and earned around Rs 6,000 per month,” said an officer. According to Kolkata Police, the south division received a complaint that the youth might have jumped from pillar No 1. So, boats and launches were pressed into service late at night to rescue him. “Around 5am on Tuesday, the DMG team joined the search even as his worried family members were standing at the Princep Ghat. However, several efforts by divers to trace the youth went in vain till the evening when the search operation was called off. We have deployed our best divers and we will again search for him on Wednesday morning,” said a DMG official. This is the third such incident reported from the flyover in the past two years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/student-goes-missing-from-vidyasagar-setu-after-suicide-call/articleshow/88983547.cms||Amit Moulick
---||Kolkata||New Town book fair from January 28 to February 6||Kolkata: The eighth New Town book fair that was earlier scheduled from January 7 and was later postponed due to the Covid situation will start from January 28.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Afternoon blaze guts Park Street cinema||KOLKATA: A major fire broke out at Park Show House located close to the busy Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing on Tuesday afternoon. The fire, visible from a long distance away, left several traders of Mullickbazar alarmed till five fire tenders finally managed to bring the blaze under control. The fire department said that no one was injured in the fire. Even as the fire raged on, two groups got engaged in a heated exchange of words which forced the police to intervene. “The blaze started around 2. 20pm, and firefighters doused it in 30 minutes,” an official said. The fire that broke out on the top floor of the now abandoned building gradually engulfed the main theatre, he added. Both fire department and Beniapukur police rushed to the spot within minutes of the distress call. “We had to enter through the side doors as the fire had engulfed the main entrance. We found rolls kept inside to fight fire. But we did not use the fire fighting equipment as the cinema hall had been shut for sometime now. The seats were all burnt and the sidewalls extensively damaged,” said another firefighter, adding that the cooling process took some more hours. “The reason behind the fire is yet to be ascertained,” said a Beniapukur police officer. Cops refused to speculate on the cause of the fire, stating that only a detailed probe by the fire and forensics team will ascertain the actual cause. Both police and fire brigade said the structure has received extensive damage with several parts of the hall, especially closer to the roof and the furniture, severely damaged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/afternoon-blaze-guts-park-street-cinema/articleshow/88983550.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Readying policy on Maidan horses, state tells court||KOLKATA: The state government on Tuesday told the Calcutta High Court that it was preparing a comprehensive policy to regulate horse-drawn carriages around the Victoria Memorial and the Maidan. The state urged the HC to allow it some more time to come out with a detailed policy. The HC will hear the matter again on February 28. On Tuesday, HC allowed the state more time to file its reply. Last month, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) had moved the HC, seeking a ban on horse-drawn carriages around Victoria Memorial after their survey revealed that most of these horses were bruised, ill and did not have proper food. PETA has also urged the court to allow it to treat the ailing horses. The HC had sought from the state a detailed report by January 18 on the medical condition of the horses and asked whether the horse-carriage drivers had licences. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj is hearing the matter. PETA said that for a month from July 14, 2021, a four-member team of experts had examined 80 horses at the Brigade Parade Grounds and those below the Nivedita Setu. The team found that most of the horses had injuries — some of them were hurt in traffic accidents. The committee found the horses did not get basic medical care. The horses were unfed, with 58% of them “very thin.” The report said indiscriminate breeding was also compounding the woes. The expert team also found that among the 80 horses examined, 65 had “sore” body conditions and were thin. The report also found that 80% of these horses had below-normal red blood cell count, and blood haemoglobin level. Most of them were anaemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/readying-policy-on-maidan-horses-state-tells-court/articleshow/88983554.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Endless list of Omicron symptoms: Headache, runny nose, diarrhoea||KOLKATA: From fever, body ache, loose motion, sore throat to night sweats and cough, never has Covid-19 come with so many varied symptoms of the infection in the earlier waves of the pandemic. Doctors said that changed clinical manifestations of the infection this time indicates that the majority of infection this time is caused by the Omicron variant. Take the example of pulmonologist Dhiman Ganguly who tested positive recently. At his late 70s, the senior physician had only mild fever for about 36 hours, sore throat and mild cough. “In many occasions the symptoms look like a passing flu. Therefore, severity wise, Omicron definitely is causing a milder disease but with higher infectivity. And due to the sheer number, patients needing intensive care treatment could rise,” said Ganguly. Seven days ago, IT professional Sudip Bakshi felt feverish after dinner. At night he was shivering and then sweating. Next day his swab samples tested positive. “The rigor and chill made me wonder if I had malaria. But my doctor told me to go for the Covid test. Even while my test report arrived the fever started disappearing and it was completely gone by the third day. Now days down, I am feeling fine apart from pain in lower back, the hip, lower limb and heaviness in the head,” said Bakshi. Unlike the second wave when Delta had caused the surge, majority of the infected — young and old alike — would gasp, complain of loss of smell and taste and the fever would drag on for a week or two in many cases. But this third wave with Omicron being the dominant variant, the symptoms of the infections have changed, often overlapping with common flu. “Some of the symptoms will overlap even with that of dengue and chikungunya because these are viral infections. But Omicron so far is not invasive and most common symptoms are scratchy throat, soreness, dry cough and blocked nose indicative of only the upper respiratory involvement,” said internal medicine specialist Syamasis Bandyopadhyay of Apollo. Doctors said in most cases of Delta variant lung involvement was the cause of the infected requiring oxygen. A good number of recovered patients would suffer from long Covid that continued for two to three weeks post hospital discharge. “The current variant of the virus has lost its virulence. It is causing overlapping symptoms with seasonal diseases like common cold and also dengue and malaria. Therefore, there is no need for any panic but to be aware of warning signals that would warrant medical attention,” said virologist Amitava Nandi. Even the recovery from the symptoms is also relatively faster this time that has led to the change in isolation and treatment protocol.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/endless-list-of-omicron-symptoms-headache-runny-nose-diarrhoea-/articleshow/88983555.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 7 Vietnamese sailors test Covid-19 positive, 5 have Omicron||KOLKATA: Seven Vietnamese sailors, all Covid-19 positive, are currently undergoing treatment at the state-run Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital. While five are confirmed Omicron-positive cases, genome sequencing report of two others are awaited. Health department officials said all of them have been brought from a cruise ship docked at the Diamond Harbour port. “Few days ago we had discharged two more sailors from the same ship. Those two Vietnamese nationals were also positive for Omicron. The discharge was done according to protocol as the two tested negative to the infection during the course of treatment,” said ID&BG principal Anima Haldar. About 10 days ago the district administration and health officials got the information of a few sailors in that ship had developed symptoms of Covid-19. On testing, seven were found positive. Genome sequencing later found them positive to the Omicron variant. “The information was relayed to Swasthya Bhawan. We were asked to transport the positive sailors to ID&BG hospital and accordingly the hospital made all arrangement for their treatment,” said Diamond Harbour chief medical officer health Debasis Roy. At the state’s nodal Covid-19 hospital the seven were admitted at its ward for the Omicron suspected patients. Aged between 30 and 45 years, the crew members of the cruise had only mild symptoms. Being landed in hospital of a foreign country, communication issues due to language barriers and different food habits was a bigger challenge for the medical team. The extreme anxiety had resulted in blood pressure shooting up in some of them. The medical team gave all efforts to calm their nerves. Doctors patiently tried to listen to their problems partly through words — written/verbal and gestures. Slowly the seven started to shed their apprehensions. By the time two of them recovered and were discharged a couple of days ago, all their fears were gone. “Now they smile at us. They are all doing well clinically, also. We should be able to discharge them once they test negative,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, nodal officer for Covid-19. “Humanity and fellow-feeling can break every barrier. Thanks to the effort by our medical team for their effort,” said MSVP Asis Manna. Two more Covid positive sailors from the same ship were bought to the hospital on Monday. The two are being treated at Omicron suspected ward.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/7-vietnamese-sailors-test-covid-5-have-omicron/articleshow/88983557.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to a KMC health department official, the civic team is struggling to contain the Covid spread from New Alipore to Lake Gardens despite having declared multiple micro containment zones in the past two weeks. According to a member in KMC’s Covid combat team, while Covid cases were on the decline in a number of boroughs, it was on a rise in Borough X. The biggest concern for the civic body and city police is that this borough has as many as 12 micro-containment zones (out of 33 in the city) spread across New Alipore, Lake Gardens, Jodhpur Park and Netaji Nagar. Borough 3 (Phoolbagan-Beliaghata) has five micro-containment zones and boroughs 7, 8 and 9 now have two micro-containment zones each. The KMC-KP joint team in Borough X is focusing on high-rises and housing complexes where the case count remains steady. Deputy mayor Atin Ghosh is set to hold an important meeting at the Borough X office on Thursday to take stock of the situation and chalk out a fresh strategy to combat Covid. According to South City Residents’ Association secretary Manoj Gupta, though the infection rate had come down by 50% in the past one week, there were still 100 active cases in the complex. “We are following all sorts of Covid protocols as directed by the state health department and the KMC. We are ready to cooperate with the government and the civic body to deal with any emergencies,” Gupta said. Debjani Mukherjee a director of Urbana facility management said though the high-rise located off EM Bypass has exited the micro-containment list, they were vigilant as there were still 40 active cases in the complex. Fresh areas under Borough X have been included in the new list of containment zones that were released on Monday by KMC health department team. There are 49 addresses in New Alipore. The other containment zones in borough X are located at Selimpur, Lake Gardens, Jadavpur and Netaji Nagar. A total of 57 addresses are in the micro-containment list. Four addresses in Beliaghata-Phoolbagan continued to feature in the micro-containment list for the fifth time. Kolkata Police said it has stepped up joint awareness campaigns with KMC at high-rises and all markets, especially in boroughs VIII and X.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/12-of-kols-33-micro-c-zones-in-new-alipore-jodhpur-park-lake-gardens-netaji-nagar/articleshow/88983558.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The piping hot food was served, for the first time since March 2020, along with ready-to-eat food. Speaking on the restoration of e-catering services at Howrah, Sealdah, Kolkata, Durgapur, Asansol, Malda and Bhagalpur stations, Debashis Chandra, director, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IR CTC), said, “There was a growing demand for hot, healthy and hygienic food for premium trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto. As per the Railway Board guidelines for serving cooked food, we have restarted the service from today, following Covid protocols to the hilt.” All this time, only tea or coffee, snacks and ready-to-eat packaged stuff like noodles, rajma-chawal and soup were available on these long-distance trains. “At last, we got our favourite dishes from the a la carte menus as well as the staple vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare, like we used to, in the pre-pandemic era,” said Surangama Sanyal, a passenger at Rajdhani-Sealdah on Tuesday. Fellow passenger Abhijit Mondol was happy that IRCTC has restarted its base kitchens to serve its trademark dishes, especially on Rajdhani and Shatabdi. Since March 2020, Railways had stopped food catering business, offering bedrolls and putting up curtains due to the surge in Covid-19 cases and the lockdown. The Railways has incurred losses of over Rs 1,000 crore due to the suspension of catering services, sources said. Officials said the choice of opting out of the onboard catering services in the premium trains shall also be available to passengers. Those who have not booked their food at the time of booking their tickets could also visit the IRTCT website and order cooked food. “It has to be done before the charting of the trains (four hours before the scheduled train departure). The passenger can also change his food option before the first charting of the trains,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/piping-hot-food-back-on-rajdhani-shatabdi/articleshow/88983559.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Wife of junior works manager at Jabalpur gun carriage factory, Sharda Charan Khatua, had filed a petition in the high court in 2019 seeking a CBI investigation into her husband's murder, who had disappeared the day when he was summoned by the CBI for interrogation in connection with scam relating to use of Chinese bearing in the manufacturing of first indigenous 155 MM artillery gun in India, Dhanush. His body was recovered from the compound where he lived 20 days later. The petitioner while alleging failure on the part of the police to unravel the mystery shrouding murder of her husband and bring the culprits to book has demanded a CBI probe into the case. She said that a Delhi-based firm was given the contract for supply of bearing for the artillery gun, which supplied Chinese bearing with a seal "Made in Germany". After the scam surfaced, the CBI started investigation into the case. It had summoned Sharda Charan Khatua, who was junior works manager in the gun carriage factory, Jabalpur, for interrogation on January 17, 2019. On the same day, Khatua had gone for morning walk but didn't return. His body was recovered on February 5, 2017, from near the pump house in the factory premises, where he lived. In the CCTV footage, he is seen coming into the factory premises indicating that he was killed inside the factory premises. However, months after the incident, the police have failed to solve the case and nab the culprits. She, therefore, requested the court to order a CBI probe into the incident. In the previous hearing of the case, the court of justice Vishal Dhagat had asked for presence of SP, Jabalpur during hearing of the case to apprise the court of the progress made by the SIT formed by the district police to investigate the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-grants-cops-6-weeks-to-file-report-on-khatua-murder/articleshow/88983604.cms||---

---||Bhopal||New excise policy: Madhya Pradesh cabinet cuts duty on foreign liquor, allows microbreweries||BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh cabinet, headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Tuesday approved the proposed new excise policy for 2022-23, slashing duty on foreign liquor by 10% to 13%. What’s more, anyone with an annual income of Rs 1 crore can now get a licence to run a bar at home. The limit for keeping liquor at one’s disposal has been increased four times. As of now, a person can keep one crate of beer, six bottles of wine and four bottles of spirit. The new policy also permits micro-breweries in Bhopal and Indore. A state government release explained, “Microbreweries are small units with daily production of 500-1,000 litres of alcohol. These micro-brewery plants can be permitted in hotels for production of fresh beer.” Briefing reporters after the cabinet meeting, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “There was a proposal for new liquor shops in the state, which the chief minister disallowed.” However, the government has approved the opening of liquor shops at airports and serving wines at counters in malls. The tribal-dominated districts of Alirajpur and Dindori will run pilot projects for Mahua-based spirits. While the cut in duty of foreign liquor will make it cheaper in the state, the cabinet also approved liquor shops to be ‘composite’, which means both foreign and country liquor can be sold at these outlets. In 17 big districts of the state, the reserve price for foreign liquor has been fixed at 15% and country liquor at 25%. he state Congress, however, alleged that the government’s claim that there won’t be any new liquor shops is an eyewash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/new-excise-policy-mp-cabinet-cuts-duty-on-foreign-liquor-allows-microbreweries/articleshow/88983608.cms||Suchandana Gupta

---||Delhi||HC junks Tata Power plea to exit NTPC pact for sourcing electricity||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has dismissed without any relief a petition filed by Tata Power’s Delhi distribution company – TPDDL or Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd – seeking to end a May 2008 agreements with state-run generation utility NTPC for sourcing power from the latter’s Dadri-I power station in UP. The TPDDL petition sought the court’s direction restraining NTPC from scheduling any power from Dadri–I station or to raise any bill for the period after November 30, 2020 on the ground that the plant’s 25-year useful life and the validity of the power purchase agreement ended on that date. The court’s dismissal of the petition without any relief would make TPDDL liable to pay the amount payable since November 30, 2020 along with late payment surcharge as per Central norms. The dispute arose after TPDDL in March 2020 asked NTPC to stop scheduling power from the unit or raise any bill. The company cited Central Electricity Regulatory Authority regulations allowing distribution companies the option to exit a PPA (power purchase agreement) after 25 years of the ‘useful life’ of a plant and PPA on mutual agreement. TPDDL had also asked NTPC for reworking tariff for continued power purchase from Dadri-I, citing the options in CERC regulations that allows discoms and generators the option to rework tariff after 25 years, provided both sides agree. NTPC had rejected TPDDL’s contention saying the options of ending a PPA or reworking tariffs after 25 years applies only if both parties agree.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-junks-tata-power-plea-to-exit-ntpc-pact-for-sourcing-electricity/articleshow/88982474.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The team will be responsible for creating awareness on source level waste management and can undertake installation of biogas plants to process waste at the community level. At present, 443 members have started work in 41 wards in the city covering 14,375 houses. The survey is underway in 82 wards.The city corporation had earlier approved the decision to launch Haritha Karma Sena workers in all the hundred wards for the collection of non-biodegradable waste. In the council meeting held on January 7, the health standing committee proposed that the workers shall collect an amount of Rs 4,000 per month as user fee and that their monthly remuneration shall be fixed as Rs 10,500. In case of deficit, the additional amount will be allotted from viability gap fund for a period of six months.It was proposed that the hike in salary would be considered after six months. It was also decided that Haritha Karma Sena workers shall cover 40% of houses in one ward on a monthly basis. During the council meeting BJP councillor Girikumar had expressed reservations regarding mandatory collection of Rs 4,000 as user fee. He cited that such a clause shall be taken off from the proposal. The amount being collected on a monthly basis will be deposited in the joint account of the group secretary and president and salary will be taken from that account. As per the document prepared for the functioning of Haritha Karma Sena workers, income from user fee, amount collected from sale of scrap and other items are the sources of monthly income. The department has directed that special wages shall be disbursed for the workers if local bodies engage them in services other than door to door collection and segregation of non-biodegradable materials. The department has, however, pointed out that VGF shall not be given in local bodies where basic duties were not fulfilled in spite of ideal circumstances.In 2018, the government had permitted local bodies to utilize a specified amount from plan funds to provide VGF for six months for the activities of Haritha Karma Sena. The amount was approved at rates of Rs 23,175 per ward in gram panchayat, Rs 46,350 per ward in municipalities and Rs 92,700 per ward in corporations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/haritha-karma-sena-begins-collection-of-dry-waste/articleshow/88983634.cms||---

Though no casualties were reported in the attack, a police vehicle parked on the premises of the station suffered damages.According to the police, the incident happened around 11 am on Tuesday. The police have recovered visuals from surveillance cameras installed at the station and identified the suspects. A hunt has been launched to nab the assailants. In the visuals, two youths who were riding on a motorycle could be seen throwing two petrol bombs, made of beer bottles, at the station. While one of them landed on the ground, the other hit the rear windshield of one of the two official vehicles parked on the premises of the station.Aryancode station house officer inspector P Sreekumaran Nair said that they suspect the attack to be retaliation to a series of raids the police conducted during the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday to nab a person who had allegedly stabbed and injured a higher secondary student at Chemboor on Monday evening.“The suspect in the case is a known drug and ganja peddler and he had allegedly stabbed the 19-year-old student on his arm,” the inspector said, adding that the identity of the suspect cannot be revealed before the arrest. He said that it was a personal rivalry that resulted in the attack and the police launched a search for him. The search teams of the police visited his house, but he was absconding. Hence the police conducted raids at the residences of his close friends too. This action might have provoked him and his friends to launch the attack on the police, the inspector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/men-hurl-petrol-bombs-at-police-station/articleshow/88983635.cms||---

The university has taken up the project for Kalady Rice Millers Consortium Pvt Ltd (KRMC), a consortium of 36 rice mill owners founded to serve as a common facilitation centre for the rice milling industry. The centre was established under the ministry of MSME's flagship scheme micro small enterprises- cluster development programme (MSE-CDP).The project will draw on the expertise of the faculty members from across the university's associated colleges. The project is being facilitated by the university's industry attachment cell.Rice husk is being considered as an alternative source for cement manufacturing which is costly, energy intensive, and depletes natural resources. Large-scale disposal of rice husk, such as open-field burning and unregulated dumping, has also raised environmental problems; the reason why rice husk cement has quickly acquired appeal in construction industry.

As many as 836 active cases have been reported on Tuesday, while it was 666 on Monday. The highest number of active cases among policemen have been reported from Thiruvananthapuram city police (148) and Thiruvananthapuram rural (45) while Thrissur city (4) and Kollam city (5) are at the bottom of the chart. With the number rising exponentially, the police top brass have once again begun ensuring that the vaccination drive for the booster dose is completed, and the police officials are adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. “We are aiming at 100% vaccination for policemen. Administering the booster shots have also started and are being expedited. All police officials have been asked to strictly adhere to Covid safety protocols,” said DGP (armed police battalion) K Padmakumar, who is also the Covid-19 monitoring officer for the police force. Among the six armed police battalions, the highest number of active cases were reported from the special armed police battalion at Peroorkada in the capital with 30 active cases on Tuesday. While only one case was reported at Kerala armed police battalion-6 at Nilambur, three cases were reported among the members of the women’s police battalion in the capital. Despite the number of policemen being affected by Covid has shot up in the last one week, only one policeman was reported to be admitted to hospital. In 2020, as many as 7,321 policemen were affected by Covid, of which seven succumbed to the virus. In 2021, as many as 15,332 policemen were affected by the virus and 12 lost their lives. The state police have been actively pressed for Covid-19-related enforcement activities along with health department officials. After the initial days of lockdown when police were deputed for ensuring the lockdown, they were given the task of cluster and containment management duties. The police were given more responsibilities after finding that the majority of those affected by the end of July were from primary contacts outside their families. However, the decision was modified later when the number of Covid cases among police officials increased. The police then decided that no official above 50 years of age should be put on Covid-related field duty. The state police chief instructed that even if the police personnel are below 50 years of age, they should not be put on field duty if they have comorbidities. The police had then taken more precautions, including familiarizing all those on field duty, on health protocols. The officials, along with their family members, were asked to follow all the health protocols, both while on and off duty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-cases-rise-among-police-force/articleshow/88983637.cms||KP Saikiran

Two months ago, TMC had moved a proposal for an alliance with GFP and when talks were at an advanced stage, the regional party backed out at the eleventh hour, much to the disappointment of the Mamata Banerjee party. Within a week or two, TMC took GFP’s working president Kiran Kandolkar and on Tuesday the party made him the state TMC president. TMC, which revealed its plan for Goa four months ago, has been in a hurry to broaden its base in the state by importing functionaries of other parties mostly from Congress and to make a mark in the February 14 polls. Naturally, a source said, TMC did not take Sardesai’s rejection lightly and planned to deal him a heavy blow. By fielding one of its top functionaries, Faleiro, who is known to have his clout in Fatorda and have an understanding of the undercurrents, it is clear that TMC wants to make Sardesai’s win for the third term from Fatorda a difficult task even as his party is in an alliance with Congress. In its first list, TMC also declared candidatures of Churchill Alemao for Benaulim, his daughter Valanka for Navelim and newly-appointed state executive committee president, Kiran Kandolkar for Aldona. It has named Sandeep Vazarkar for Porvorim, Samil Volvaiker for Cumbharjua, Ganpat Goankar for Poriem, Gilbert Rodrigues for Cortalim, Jose ‘Raju’ Cabral for Nuvem, Jorson Fernandes for Cuncolim and Jagadish Bhobe, who joined TMC on Tuesday, for St Andre. Kandolkar who released the first list in the presence of Faleiro and MP Mahua Moitra said candidates for other constituencies will be declared in a few days. He said the candidates whose names have been announced have already started campaigning in their respective constituencies. Besides announcing the state executive committee, the TMC also announced youth and Mahila committees, and also block committees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/tmc-hits-vijai-hard-gives-luizinho-fatorda-ticket/articleshow/88985691.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Familiarity breeds compassion towards patients||Vijayawada: Neighbours are turning into good Samaritans for those who are down with Covid-19. Discrimination towards Covid-19 patients has come down significantly and people are now coming forward to help the patients who are in home isolation. Covid-19 cases have increased significantly in the last ten days. Positivity rate crossed the 22 per cent-mark on Monday and almost every colony and apartment complex in the city houses Covid-19 patients. People who initially discriminated against Covid-19-hit families and denied them help are slowly changing their mind and coming forward to extend help. Many apartment complexes and residential colonies have formed action forces to support the families which are in home isolation.  Housing societies have formed groups on messaging apps and are asking the patients to post what they want to get from the market. Available people will respond and deliver it to the needy.  “There are around eight families with Covid-19 positive people in our apartment complex. Initially, we were afraid of reaching out to those who have tested positive for Covid-19. But our attitude changed after the second wave of Covid-19. We are not letting the families step out of their homes and are delivering medicines, fruits, and groceries at their doorstep,” said Daram Naveen Kumar who lives in an apartment at Gurunanak Colony.  “Women in our apartments are voluntarily preparing food and delivering it to the Covid-19 positive families. This helps in speedy recovery,” he added. Meanwhile, the situation is same in urban slums in Vijayawada. Youth in colonies are forming groups and delivering essentials to the Covid-19-hit families. Psychiatrists say support from neighbours will help in speedy recovery of Covid-19 patients. “Stigma caused psychological issues in people affected by Covid-19 in the first two waves. Many patients concealed the fact that they were tested positive due to fear of discrimination. But the situation is slowly improving and people have started treating Covid-19 patients normally,” said Dr. K Narendra, a psychiatrist in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/familiarity-breeds-compassion-towards-patients/articleshow/88981171.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Ahmedabad||Now, deepfake porn clips starring TV actresses||AHMEDABAD: Sextortionists are now turning to AI (artificial intelligence) to up their blackmailing game. Their latest weapon is deepfake videos — digitally altered footage of real people showing stuff they never did. The worst victims are, of course, women. Top sources say that online sextortionists from Mewat in Haryana, who earlier used screenshots of their male victims in compromising positions on WhatsApp chats to blackmail them, have gotten a tad creative. They now use deepfake apps to create porn clips starring television actresses to target moneybags. Using AI, the starlet’s face is superimposed on the face of the woman in the original clip to create a deepfake porn clip which is used to lure gullible men. “The end product will look like the celebrity was part of the porn clip,” said a police official. Recently, a city lawyer, who was contemplating suicide after losing Rs 3 lakh to sextortionists, had called up a suicide prevention helpline. That is when the police learnt about the new modus operandi. The offenders threatened to make his footage public. The police are yet to register a case and are trying to track the criminals’ digital fingerprints. According to sources, the offenders first collect information about their ‘prey’ from their public social media profiles. They then contact those men with the deepfake porn videos, asking them basic questions and gradually luring them into disrobing themselves. The crooks record the video of the same and blackmail the men by threatening to send the sexually explicit content to their online contacts. “Many are unaware that their Facebook, Instagram and Telegram accounts can be locked to allow only their friends to access them,” explained the police officer. “The deepfake videos they create of TV soap actresses are exceptionally believable and any naive person will take them for real,” said another police officer. The official also revealed that the Mewat gang has been identified, acknowledging that the deepfakes are becoming a menace. Earlier, the cybercrooks used clips from porn sites to entice credulous men. But with the new modus operandi, they transplant faces onto the clips to create deepfakes and blackmail people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/now-deepfake-porn-clips-starring-tv-actresses/articleshow/88983601.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad’s Covid positivity rate crosses 30%||GANDHINAGAR: The city’s and district’s test positivity rate in RT-PCR has crossed 30% on Tuesday, giving state health officials an indication that the Covid peak with the Omicron variant blitzkrieg will happen soon for Ahmedabad. On Tuesday, 6,600 city and district labs reported RT-PCR results as positive. Everyday, there are some 18,000 to 19,000 RT-PCR tests taking place in the city in various labs, said state health officials. When compared to denser cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, Ahmedabad’s test positivity percentage is almost the same. The Uttarayan festival was a major reason for the sudden spike in cases. For instance, in the last five days test positivity – which is January 13 to January 18, the test positivity rate jumped from 20% to 30% on Tuesday. “At this rate of test positivity rate progression, Ahmedabad may reach up to 35% to 36% in next five days and then remain stable and then it remains to be a wait and watch game to observe a decline. Over the last few days, many labs have not been regular in reporting RT-PCR tests owing to the festivities across the state, but that will be streamlined,” said the official. The only blessing, according to the official, is that the rate of hospitalization is low. “In Ahmedabad city for instance, 219 patients were hospitalized till Monday evening, 10 patients were added by Tuesday evening,” added the official. The number of youngsters that is below 18 years who required hospitalization has been one or two cases. “People are reporting symptoms to last for four to five days maximum and then the fever and other indications subside,” added the official. Unlike the Delta variant, where one observes a plateau of 300-400 cases a day for a few days and then spike to 500-600 cases a day for the next few days, Omicron maintains a steep curve and one sees a steep rise,” adds a state health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabads-covid-positivity-rate-crosses-30/articleshow/88983639.cms||Paul John

Ahmedabad was declared UNESCO World Heritage City in July 2017. However, till now the AMC had not taken much interest in showcasing this achievement on its official website. As if to atone for this delay, AMC’s newly launched heritage website heritage.ahmedabadcity.gov.in not only displays this coveted status but also, for the first time, acknowledges the city’s jewels such as Siddi Sayed mosque, Rani Sipri mosque, Jumma Masjid, Jhoolta Minara, Rani no Hajiro and the 12 city gates which were part of Ahmedabad’s official dossier to UNESCO. Earlier, the official AMC website made no mention of these monuments. The newly launched website has detailed information and short videos on most of these sites. “This website offers people from across the world a glimpse of the city founded in 1411,” said an AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/after-5-years-heritage-city-gets-dedicated-amc-portal/articleshow/88983640.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: New coronavirus cases have lesser lung involvement, say experts||AHMEDABAD: Between the second and third wave of Covid, how has the patient profile changed when seen from the perspective of a radiologist? Answering this query, city experts said that the involvement of lungs is comparatively low in the latest wave. Dr Amit Gupta, a radiologist, said that till about 10 days ago, Covid patients did not have to undergo high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). “However, we now see about 5-10 patients in various labs. In the second wave, we would see ground-glass opacity and very high lung involvement. In comparison, this time we see mucus plugs in bronchioles – small air sacs that branch out from the tracheae into lungs. Secretion can also be seen in some cases,” he said. What would be its implications for patients? Dr Gupta said that due to the nature of infection this time, dry cough and blocked nose are some of the signs. However, people generally recover in 3-5 days. Dr Sahil Shah, radiologist and joint secretary of AMA, said that the oxygen levels don’t fall due to involvement of only upper respiratory tract. “We would advise citizens not to rush for x-ray or HRCT in every case. Such imaging is required only when the patient has breathing difficulty. The nodes seen in the lungs last year are also absent,” he said. The experts said that the changed nature of viral infection is behind the fact that this time relatively very few patients require oxygen in treatment protocol whereas in April-May last year about 80-85% needed oxygen therapy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/new-corona-cases-have-lesser-lung-involvement-experts/articleshow/88983644.cms||Parth Shastri

Officials said that there are multiple reasons for the hesitancy, including the relatively less severe nature of the symptoms and the fear of getting quarantined. “In our door-to-door surveillance, we have observed that people are avoiding getting tested as they fear they will be forced to home quarantine for at least a week if they test positive,” a health department official said. “During lockdowns, they suffered — including financially.” People don’t want to go through that again, he said. “After the second wave ended, Covid norms were relaxed,” he noted, implying that people did not want to relive the days of stringent isolation.Starting from Monday, the civic body reduced the micro-containment period to seven days from 14. The official said that people have started treating the new variant of the coronavirus as common flu and are not scared like they were before. He said that the symptoms of the prevalent variant of Covid are less severe compared to those produced by the earlier variant. “Mild to high temperature for a couple of days and sore throat are the major symptoms in the case of Omicron,” the official said. “In the initial phase of the pandemic, we observed that apart from these symptoms most people quickly reached a stage where they had difficulty in breathing.” The official added: “Breathlessness is not seen much now. This aspect, unfortunately, makes people think that it is seasonal flu or cough due to the cold weather.”The official went on to say that in the second wave, people saw the seriousness of the pandemic and got themselves tested.“We observed reluctance to get tested at the beginning of the pandemic when people were scared because of the social stigma the disease brought,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tests-dodged-over-quarantine-fears/articleshow/88983645.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The number of mask-rule violations dipped dramatically on Uttarayan and on the following day as police appeared to show leniency. On an average day so far, January has seen 1,066 mask-rule violations throughout the city and most offences were recorded on January 8 and January 10. However, just 612 cases were registered on Uttarayan and the figures dipped even further to 537 the next day, which is celebrated as Vasi Uttarayan. The average number of mask-rule violations for three days ahead of Uttarayan was 1,270. The number of Covid-19 cases on Uttarayan and on the previous two days remained over 3,000. Ahmedabad logged 15,997 mask-rule violations between January 1 and 15 and fines totalling Rs 16 lakh were collected. A similar trend was seen during the Diwali festival in 2020 and 2021 and during the 2021 Gujarat local body polls. On the polling day, police had found only four people violating the mask rule as they were busy with the election bandobust. Those were the lowest ever cases of mask-rule violations in the city, recorded on February 21, 2021. “During the Uttarayan festival, cops were deployed to maintain social distancing and to implement Covid protocols strictly,” said a city police officer. “After the festival, about 85 cops were diagnosed with the Covid infection.” The officer added: “However, as people were celebrating the festival with joy, we did not want to be a spoilsport.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mask-rule-violators-get-fest-shield/articleshow/88983646.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Axe effect: Ahmedabad district second biggest loser||AHMEDABAD: In the state, Ahmedabad district was the second biggest loser in terms of the green cover. The latest report of Forest Survey of India reveals that urban areas as well as tribal zones in Gujarat have registered a decline in the green cover. Narmada district registered the steepest fall of nearly 21 sq km in the green cover in 2021 as compared to the 2019 figures. Officials in the forest department said that one of the factors that affected tribal districts was the state government’s decision in 2015 to remove 87 different tree species. Ordinarily, the forest department is consulted before such a tree-cutting drive. In the end, tribal districts lost a large number of trees. The officials said that in districts such as Ahmedabad there has been rampant erosion of the green cover owing to urbanization not just within city areas but also in the adjacent rural swathes. The officials said that apart from urbanization, the threat to trees comes from road-expansion projects. These projects include Ahmedabad-Rajkot, Ahmedabad-Bhavnagar, and Ahmedabad-Udaipur stretches on which trees have been cut on a large scale. Moreover, green cover is thinning in AUDA (Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority) areas which are the sites of rapid development. The officials said that the state government’s recent count had showed an increase in the number of trees because the count had considered trees of even 10cm girth. But, the officials said, Forest Survey of India data is accurate as it is based on estimates derived from the study of satellite images. The officials said that of the 14,925.9 sq km area, 2,828 sq km has shrubs including gando baval (prosopis juliflora). The officials said that the increase in the overall forest cover of the state was 68.5 sq km compared to the previous estimate. But in the case of Kutch, it was 94.2 sq km mainly because of the gando baval proliferation. Hence it appears that over the last two censuses, the state is making up for the loss of the green cover by taking the gando baval spread into account. However, according to officials, there is no change in the dense forest cover, which is defined as a canopy density of over 70%. There was a decline of 60 sq km in moderately dense forests, where the canopy cover is between 40% and 70%. Many patches of moderately dense forests have turned into open forests, again because of gando baval.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/axe-effect-abad-dist-2nd-biggest-loser/articleshow/88983649.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The SIT will conduct a thorough probe and unearth the truth,” Trivedi said.Trivedi had recently come across a racket in which some scamsters, in connivance with the local revenue officers of Navsari district, had siphoned off crores of rupees meant to be paid to land owners as compensation for land acquisition for the proposed Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway.In all, 12 land owners of Chikhli taluka, from where the highway will pass, were duped by fraudsters using fake consent letters, power of attorney and other forged documents, the minister said.“The criminals, with the help of a lawyer and revenue officials, showed themselves as landowners and used forged documents to claim the compensation, which runs in crores of rupees. Instead of the actual owners of the land, the compensation against the acquired land went to these accused,” Trivedi said.“In all, we have unearthed 12 cases. The Navsari police have already registered an FIR and the process is on for 11 other cases,” he said.The collector has also been directed to probe the issue. As per the department’s estimates, nearly Rs 1 crore has been siphoned off by the accused in each of these 12 cases, he added.In the first FIR, the complainant Fatmaben Mayat (82) of Alipore village in Chikhli, has alleged that the fraudsters used forged consent letters and power attorney of her and her relatives, some of them deceased, to claim compensation of Rs 2.12 crore against the land acquired for the highway, it was stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/revenue-dept-to-form-sit-to-probe-illegal-land-deals/articleshow/88983650.cms||---

The scheme, announced by former CM Vijay Rupani last January, was put on hold after the new government took charge. The purpose of the scheme is to boost horticulture farming in the state. ‘The government is intent on relaunching the scheme with a few modifications, state agriculture minister Raghavji Patel announced on Tuesday. There were some allegations of irregularities in land allocation after which the scheme was put on hold.A sum of Rs 100 crore had been allocated in the 2021-22 budget for the ‘Mukhyamantri Bagayat Vikas Mission’ (Horticulture Development Mission). It has remained unused so far.While addressing the media, Patel said, “The government has received over 4,000 applications for allocation of wasteland for horticulture farming. We are keen to restart the scheme as soon as possible. It is on hold for finalization of land allocation criteria. At present there is no use of wasteland for agriculture, so it can definitely increase agriculture output.”The aim of the mission is to accelerate agriculture, horticulture and promote farming of herbal plants. It will also create employment opportunities through an increase in the export of such products, he said.The first phase was supposed to include Kutch, Surendranagar, Patan, Banaskantha and Sabarkantha districts. Around 50,000 hectares of land was earmarked for 30-year lease in areas and survey numbers fixed by the government to cultivate medicinal plants and horticulture crops on wasteland which is generating zero output at present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-wastelands-to-see-horticulture-farming-soon/articleshow/88983656.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Textile manufacturers’ body seeks export incentives||Ahmedabad: With increase in yarn prices by almost 70%, backed by rising cotton prices and high export demand, domestic manufacturers of textiles and apparel are losing their competitiveness to international counterparts like Bangladesh and China. In a bid to let the domestic fabric and apparel manufacturers stay competitive, members of Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council (PDEXCIL) have sought special export incentives for fabric and apparel makers back home. A representation was made before Union minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal, during a meeting held late on Monday.Gujarat is home to some 200 spinning units with an installed capacity of around 50 lakh spindles, according to estimates by All Gujarat Spinners’ Association (AGSA). According to PDEXCIL members, the government must support MSME exporters by providing intensives in the form of subsidy due to increased cost of yarn, logistics and raw materials over the past one year.PDEXCIL members held that India’s yarn exports to China have doubled in value terms and so have those to Bangladesh. “The two countries are key sourcing markets for apparel and textile for global brands besides India,” said Bharat Chhajer, former PDEXCIL chairman who was at the meeting.Estimates by PDEXCIL suggest that export of cotton yarn from India to Bangladesh as well as China have almost doubled. Yarn exports to China increased over the past nine months especially after the US and the UK imposed a ban on procuring cotton from China’s Xin Jiang province, as a result of which Indian yarn makers gained in terms of order volumes.“While this is good for yarn makers back home, the industry is not getting enough realisation. Secondly, with surging cotton prices, the price of cotton yarn has also gone up. As a result, input cost of domestic manufacturers is increasing and making them less competitive in the international market. As a result, we wish that the government provides some export incentives to textile and apparel makers, so that they remain competitive and exports sustain,” said Chhajer.The increase in cotton prices which has led to the increase in yarn prices was a key issue represented. In the past, industry players had demanded that yarn exports be restricted so that domestic demand can be met at competitive rates which will help makers stay competitive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/textile-manufacturers-body-seeks-export-incentives/articleshow/88983657.cms||---

They claimed that the strength of interview panel kept on changing. The department asserted that its methodology was just, fair and legal and does not deserve interference by court. It further said that by change in the strength of panel members, all candidates were not provided equal opportunity is totally misconceived. To defend the missing panel members, the department stated, “It is nowhere stipulated that candidates would be interviewed by same member of panel members and hence in absence of any rules or regulations in that regard, more particularly with respect to the quorum of panel members, the interview board cannot be said to have committed any impropriety or acted arbitrarily in holding the oral interview.”The department also submitted that any change in number of panelists would not make any difference in distribution of 100 marks because the marks would be divided by the number of penal members present in the interview. On the complaint that one of the panelists had twitted about her presence in the interview, the department stated that the members should be have been impleaded in the petition.On candidates’ complaint about not adhering to quota norms, it was replied that these candidates participated in the process and waited till the result was declared.

However, when it was time to pay up, the man disappeared with Rs 2.78 crore he scammed out of 475 victims. A complaint in this regard was filed with the city crime branch on Monday against Mahesh Bhadra, who ran various finance firms in Behrampura, Vatva and Nava Naroda. The complaint stated, “In June 2018, Bhadra floated two schemes offering instant money or lottery rewards. In the first scheme, a participant had to pay Rs 2,000 every month for 32 months. If he was selected in a lucky draw held on the 16th of every month, he would get a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh. If the person does not land the prize, then he would get Rs 64,000 plus an additional Rs 6,000 at the end of the 32-month period. The scheme was meant for a group of 30 members.” It added, “The second scheme was bigger with 60 participants. Apart from cash reward of Rs 2 lakh, they were also promised life insurance of Rs 3 lakh.” Bhadra used to allegedly deposit the amount in the account of his firm, Anand Finance, and provided incentives to agents who brought members to enrol in his schemes. “Initially, a couple of members got rewards, but then the payment became irregular. In February 2021, when he was supposed to return the deposit with interest to all members, he began avoiding people. When he went incommunicado, a missing person complaint was filed with Krishnanagar police on June 26, 2021.” One of his agents who filed the complaint also accused Bhadra’s son Chirag and daughter Mamta of being complicit in the crime. The police registered a complaint of cheating and also booked the accused on charges under sections of the Gujarat Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act and The Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/lottery-scam-man-dupes-475-of-2-8cr/articleshow/88983667.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC levies Rs 1 lakh exemplary fine on litigant||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court imposed an exemplary fine of Rs 1 lakh on a litigant for filing a petition for a second time, without informing the court that he had filed a similar plea earlier and withdrawn it. While imposing the fine, the court said, “It was to ensure that any other future litigant, who decides to undertake such a misadventure of coming before this court by suppressing material fact, would be dissuaded from doing so after looking at the fate that the present petition has received at the hands of this court.” The petition was filed in 2018 by one Ashwin Patel from Anand district for quashing of charges like forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy. Opposing this plea, the complainant’s advocate, Shakeel Qureshi, brought to the court’s notice that Patel had filed a quashing petition earlier in 2017 and withdrawn it. “However, the petitioner did not mention about the previous litigation in the new petition. The petition can be rejected on the ground of suppression of facts as the petitioner is not entitled to file the petition after withdrawal of a similar petition,” the advocate argued. When the court questioned the petitioner about this, Patel filed an affidavit and tendered an apology for not informing the lawyer about the withdrawal of the earlier petition. The high court termed the apology as ‘perfunctory’. It further said, “The court has come to a conclusion that the petition does not deserve to be entertained on the ground of material suppression of the fact, and more particularly that this petition has been pending since 2018 and has received consideration from various learned co-ordinate benches at various stages, resulting in immense wastage of precious judicial time. So, this court is of the considered opinion that costs, in the nature of exemplary cost, deserve to be imposed upon the present petitioner.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-levies-1l-exemplary-fine-on-litigant/articleshow/88983668.cms||---

According to annualized data computed in the report, the Ahmedabad BO saw 23,113 complaints in 2020-21. Maximum complaints are related to ATM, credit and debit cards as well as digital banking transactions. With increased use of digital payments, especially since the pandemic, more such cases are being reported, suggest bankers. An email query sent to the officials of Ahmedabad BO, seeking details on the reasons for surge in complaints went unanswered. “Most of the banking-related complaints are related to digital modes of transactions and payments over and above service quality,” said a senior official at a public-sector bank. Ahmedabad BO has the second-highest number of complaints reported in the western zone followed by Mumbai-I and Mumbai-II offices. Pan India, the Ahmedabad BO ranks seventh highest in terms of the number of banking related complaints reported. Pan India, at least 40% of the banking-related complaints are related to credit and debit card usage, ATM cards and mobile and electronic banking. “Since the pandemic, digital transactions have grown multi-fold. However, not many people are well-accustomed to using the platforms and there is poor awareness about safety and security of digital banking. In such times, cases of card skimming and fraudulent withdrawals are quite commonly reported to banks. Poor awareness among people is one of the key reasons besides scamsters at play,” said a banker not willing to be named. In ATMs and debit cards, maximum complaints were related to amount being debited from bank accounts but cash not getting dispensed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/30-rise-in-banking-plaints-in-a-year-rbi/articleshow/88983670.cms||Niyati Parikh

Moreover, she told Sola police, her father-in-law wanted to have sex with her and when she objected to the demand, he and her husband thrashed her.

---||Visakhapatnam||Less than 5% Covid patients need hospital care in 3rd wave in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The quantum of hospitalisations has remained under 5% among the active Covid-19 patients in the ongoing third wave in Andhra Pradesh, corroborating with the worldwide trend. It was nearly 20% during the first and second waves. Of the 36,108 active cases as of Tuesday, only about 1,500 patients have been admitted to various hospitals spread across the state. For instance, when the active caseload touched the 2.1 lakh mark during the peak of the second wave on May 22, 2021, 21,058 patients required oxygen support. As many as 5,889 patients were admitted to ICU wards. Several hospitals ran out of their capacity and critical supplies like oxygen in cities like Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Tirupati and Vijayawada. It was a herculean task for the patients or their relatives to find a bed with oxygen support, forget ventilator support, in the second quarter of 2021. Even half of the 16,575 general wards were occupied by the patients, which stands as a testimony to the situation. Similar was the situation during the first wave. The occupancy ratio was nearly 15% during the peak of the first wave in August 2020 when the active caseload crossed the one lakh mark. Going by the current scenario, the hospitalisations may continue to remain in the same 5% range. However, there are widespread concerns over the rapidly increasing daily caseload and positivity rate. If Andhra Pradesh would witness a three-fold increase in daily cases compared to the second wave, a similar number of patients may end up in ICU/oxygen wards. The silver lining this time is that the hospitals in Andhra Pradesh can supply oxygen to about 25,000 patients without any external oxygen supplies, thanks to the PSA oxygen plants installed across the state. Covid-19 state nodal officer and director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu asked the public to be cautious. “We should not take the new variant Omicron as a ‘milder’ one. When it comes to symptoms of the patients who contracted the disease in recent times, the majority of the patients are experiencing upper respiratory symptoms. No loss of taste or smell has been observed in this spell. We will get more clarity on the severity of the infections as we further progress into the third wave,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/less-than-5-covid-patients-need-hosp-care-in-third-wave/articleshow/88983676.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

A high level meeting convened by ministers G R Anil and Antony Raju assessed the situation on Tuesday. Authorities have informed that regulations will be strictly enforced at marriages and funerals. Police surveillance will be strengthened to keep a tab on the number of persons attending marriages and funerals. The ministers said that there shall not be any compromise in vigil in the wake of unprecedented TPR in the district. Seven first line treatment centres are currently functional in the district. Crowding will not be allowed in malls and shops, the ministers said after the high-level meeting. About 6,911 new cases were reported in the district on Tuesday. While about 36,250 persons are presently under treatment for Covid 19 in the district. Even while Covid clusters are forming in various institutions within the urban areas, weekly test positivity rate in rural panchayats are reaching alarming levels. As on Tuesday, there were two panchayats in the district with a weekly TPR above 60%; Poovar with 62.67% and Vilavoorkal with 61.36%.

These include Malayinkeezhu, Venganoor, Maranallor, Kalliyoor, Kanjiramkulam, Karode and Athiyannoor. As many as 22 local bodies in the district are dealing with a weekly TPR between 40% and 50%. The fact that only four local bodies have recorded weekly TPR below 20% paints a bleak picture of the district. Authorities said that the pace of the spread is unprecedented in panchayats while it is mostly about cluster formation in institutions within the city. “We are expecting a similar rise for another 10 days after which the district is expected to record a dip in the number of cases. The coming week will be very crucial because the pace at which the disease is spreading in rural panchayats is really appalling,” an official said. Within the city limits, 21,602 samples tested positive out of 55,247 in the last one week. The corporation’s weekly TPR has been 39%. Some of the coastal panchayats in the district like Karumkulam, Karode, Poovar have started reporting cases in high numbers. More than 40 local bodies in the district have recorded weekly TPR of above 35% which also includes the Trivandrum corporation. Daily tests in the district have increased by 34% in the past two weeks. Within a week, active cases have leapt from 6,176 to 30,149.

At least two non-BJP ruled states — Bengal and Tamil Nadu — have protested against the Centre accusing it of “petty politics” following the similar rejection of their themes, this tribal heartland where the UPA is currently in power, is not in the mood to join the protest bandwagon, officials in the know of things said in Ranchi. Every year, states have to submit at least three proposals to the national selection committee for the R-Day tableaux parade. For the 2021 R-Day, the state didn’t send any entry for selection due to Covid-19. This year, it sent a first proposal themed on Santhal Hul (Santhal rebellion) in November last year and was considering to send another one on the success of fisheries in the state. After the rejection of the first proposal, sources in the state’s information and public relations department (IPRD), which is the nodal agency for the job, said they couldn’t send more proposals due to the pandemic. Authorities didn’t pursue a second one, citing lack of enough manpower to work on the themes due to Covid-19 and other engagements in the state. Assistant director of the IPRD department, Avinash Kumar, conceded that the state will miss out on showcasing its tableau this year. “Unfortunately, one proposal on Santhal Hul which we had sent was rejected. Many officials were down with Covid-19 and the rest were busy with other official work. As a result, we couldn’t send any more proposals,” he said. Official sources said Jharkhand’s proposal was rejected after it could not explain properly the importance of Santhal Hul and its national and international relevance. Asked if the state will ask the Centre for a rethink like Bengal and Tamil Nadu, another senior official said, “No. As of now, we don’t have any such plan. Moreover, Bengal and Tamil Nadu reached the third or fourth rounds of selection but Jharkhand’s case is different as we were out during the initial phase. So, there is no point raising any protest now,” he said, unwilling to be named. Jharkhand shot into the national tableaux limelight after the one on the terracotta Maluti temples of Dumka during the 2015 Republic Day parade bagged the second prize. Again in 2013, the state had showcased its flagship Dokra art. Jharkhand first debuted at the R-Day parade in Delhi in 2004 with a tableau on Birsa Munda. In 2007, it presented a tableau on Sarhul — a tribal festival.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jkhand-tableau-for-delhi-r-day-parade-rejected/articleshow/88983687.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Recoveries outnumber new Covid cases for 3rd straight day in Jharkhand||RANCHI: Jharkhand has started to report more recovered cases than fresh Covid infections in the last three days in comparison to the steep rise since late December last year. On Monday (January 17), the state recorded 4,266 recoveries compared to 2,499 new cases. A similar trend was visible during the two previous days, January 15 and 16. On January 15 (Saturday), 3,351 people recovered compared to 3,258 new infections whereas, on January 16 (Sunday), 4,114 were declared cured as against 2,776 fresh cases. Earlier, new infections were higher than the recoveries. For instance, on January 14, the state witnessed as many as 3,749 new cases as opposed to 2,807 recoveries. Experts welcomed the trend in the decline of new cases but said that it was too early to predict if the wave is getting flattened or not. A senior official in the state health department said, “If the recoveries continue to dominate for a considerable period, say for about a week to 10 days, then we may start to conclude that the current wave is probably on the wane. Hence, the next few days will continue to remain crucial.” A civil surgeon of a district, also maintained that it was too early to make any prediction citing lots of pendency of RT-PCR tests. For example, Bokaro alone has a pendency of about 4,000 samples according to reports. “The fall in cases are always welcome but one has to assess the trend taking several things into account like the cumulative samples that are tested daily, pendency and infection rate among others,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/recoveries-outnumber-new-cov-cases-for-3rd-straight-day-in-state/articleshow/88983689.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The hospital authorities claimed that this is arguably the first time that such technique is being used in the city. The operation is being performed by neuro-surgeon Dr Amit Kumar, who has recently joined the hospital, it said in a statement. Kumar said that so far neuro-endoscopic surgery has been performed on three patients in Medica. “As per my knowledge, this method is not practised anywhere else in the state,” he said. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) are responsible for 10% to 30% of all strokes. The (ICHs) have been commonly treated using conventional craniotomy in which a large part of skull is opened. Kumar said, “Neuro-endoscopic surgery as a minimal invasive treatment for ICHs is considered a promising approach. The endoscope-assisted keyhole approach is more efficient”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/city-hosp-begins-surgery-on-brain-haemorrhages/articleshow/88983690.cms||---

The industrial belt houses around 25 industries engaged in production of beverages, dairy products, paints and others.Rohan Saxena, executive director MPIDC, Indore said, “We have received an approval for Rs 17 crore for developing the Maksi industrial area. The industrial area was lacking basic infrastructure and this was hurting local industries but now with the upgrade, many units are looking to expand operations in this belt.”MPIDC has contracted with Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) to supply around 3 MLD water to Maksi industrial belt.Sanjay Neema, general manager at a local industry and secretary, Laghu Udyog Bharati, Maksi chapter said, “Water is one of the prime requirements of industries and lack of water hinders our growth. All industries in this area are dependent on tankers to meet industrial requirements which is a huge burden but now we are expecting direct water supply from NVDA and many infrastructure developments. This will help local industries grow and new ones to come up.”Neema said a few units in his company had to be shut due to lack of water but now the management is contemplating an expansion. Industries said power tripping is another jolt to industries for which they have demanded repair and new lines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/17crore-infra-upgrade-maksi-industrial-area-to-get-etp-narmada-water-supply/articleshow/88983706.cms||---

They also held protests in the core zone of the tiger reserve demanding proper compensation. After nearly ten days, the authorities finally managed to convince the tribal to return to their rehabilitation centre on Tuesday, assuring to address their grievances.As many as 43 families belonging to the Jenu Kuruba tribe who were rehabilitated in Shettihalli entered the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve around 10 days ago.As per the tribal department authorities, they entered the forest area with the permission from the foresters on the pretext of visiting their temple near Bogapura inside the forest area for performing puja to the deity. Ten years ago, the tribals were relocated from Bogapura Haadi inside the forest to Shettihalli Rehabilitation Centre.After they failed to return, the foresters started looking for them and found them camping inside the forest and holding protests demanding compensation. When the foresters tried to convince them, the tribals threatened to commit suicide if they are forced out of the forest without giving proper compensation.As the video clip of the tribals holding protest inside the core area of the tiger reserve went viral in social media, the foresters, who failed to convince them, were forced to camp in the area to protect the protesters from wild animal attacks. Tribal rights activist Prasanna told TOI that the tribals were forced out of the forest area more than a decade ago. “The government is yet to provide them rehabilitation. They have not been given land to cultivate nor financial help as part of the rehabilitation package. The forest and revenue departments blame each other for negligence. This has forced the tribal to protest demanding their rights,” he said.District tribal development officer Prabha Urs, who is also the head of the social welfare department, confirmed to TOI that the tribals held protests in the core area of the reserve demanding compensation. “Mysuru DC had given approval three months back to provide compensation to tribals who have attained 18 years. The matter was to be discussed during a meeting headed by the chief conservator of forests. However, before the meeting, the tribals launched a protest,” he said.Prabha Urs, who had also met the protesting tribals two days back, said some tribals are unhappy with the agricultural land given to them. “They say that land is not good for agriculture. Some complained that they are having health problems at rehabilitation centres, while some are in need of cash to construct houses in the agricultural land. We have managed to convince them to end the protest and on Tuesday, they returned to their rehabilitation centre,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/evicted-tribal-families-seek-compensation-after-10-yrs/articleshow/88983712.cms||---

Discrimination towards Covid-19 patients has come down significantly and people are now coming forward to help the patients who are in home isolation. Covid-19 cases have increased significantly in the last ten days. Positivity rate crossed the 22 per cent-mark on Monday and almost every colony and apartment complex in the city houses Covid-19 patients. People who initially discriminated against Covid-19-hit families and denied them help are slowly changing their mind and coming forward to extend help. Many apartment complexes and residential colonies have formed action forces to support the families which are in home isolation.  Housing societies have formed groups on messaging apps and are asking the patients to post what they want to get from the market. Available people will respond and deliver it to the needy.  “There are around eight families with Covid-19 positive people in our apartment complex. Initially, we were afraid of reaching out to those who have tested positive for Covid-19. But our attitude changed after the second wave of Covid-19. We are not letting the families step out of their homes and are delivering medicines, fruits, and groceries at their doorstep,” said Daram Naveen Kumar who lives in an apartment at Gurunanak Colony.  “Women in our apartments are voluntarily preparing food and delivering it to the Covid-19 positive families. This helps in speedy recovery,” he added. Meanwhile, the situation is same in urban slums in Vijayawada. Youth in colonies are forming groups and delivering essentials to the Covid-19-hit families. Psychiatrists say support from neighbours will help in speedy recovery of Covid-19 patients. “Stigma caused psychological issues in people affected by Covid-19 in the first two waves. Many patients concealed the fact that they were tested positive due to fear of discrimination. But the situation is slowly improving and people have started treating Covid-19 patients normally,” said Dr. K Narendra, a psychiatrist in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/familiarity-breeds-compassion-towards-patients/articleshow/88983726.cms||Venu Lanka

The century-old play is now banned in view of objections raised by some members of a social group on a certain character and dialogues. Chintamani, a Telugu film starred by late NT Rama Rao in the 1950s based on the play, was a box office hit. The film had received wide acclaim.Narayana Rao had penned the play in early 20th century to create awareness on the Devadasi system and how the flesh trade was ruining many families at that particular period.The play is named after the main character, Chintamani, a woman born into a family involved in the flesh trade. The play focuses on how she attained salvation after repentance. Subbi Shetty, a character in the play, loses his wealth to Chintamani and his character is utilised in a way that engages the audience.Chintamani play is popular across the state. It has been performed at thousands of places. The play continues to engage the audience even today. It has become a must stage play in villages during Dasara celebrations.Members of a social group has been agitating against the play for sometime and recently they represented the matter to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.Rajat Bhargava, principal secretary, issued the GO imposing ban on the play.Meanwhile, the government’s decision received mixed response from the public. While members of the social group hailed the move, experts in culture and littérateurs have flayed the decision.Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas thanked Jagan for banning the play. He said that no community should be portrayed in a negative way.Stage artiste Yadla Gopala Rao said government should remove objectionable dialogues and change the names of characters instead of banning the play. He said that a ban on the play will affect the livelihood of hundreds of artistes and technicians.Dr DAR Subramanyam, former EC member of Acharya Nagarjuna University, said Chintamani is a drama that questions the social evils in society. Writer Narayana Rao highlighted the issues in a satirical way to create awareness in masses. The drama was later modified with obscene dialogues and characters to create humour. No caste or religion was criticized in the original version of the play. One should object to the objectionable words and obscene content created later, instead of raising demands to ban the drama which has been in the hearts of people for more than a century. Cultural freedom should not be controlled in this way.Konakalla Vidyadhar Rao, president, Chamber of Commerce, Vijayawada, said Chintamani drama was used to make fun of a social group. Subbi Shetty, who resembles a person of a particular community, is used to portray the social group in a bad way. Obscene dialogues are added to the play in the name of creativity. One should not hurt the sentiments of groups in the name of cultural freedom.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ban-on-100-year-old-play-evokes-mixed-response/articleshow/88983729.cms||Venu Lanka

She has appeared as a non-regular candidate from Maharaj Sanskrit College affiliated with JJRSU to score highest among 31 colleges. “I would love to speak in Sanskrit with my eldest sister—Rubina Parveen and sisters-in-laws Tasleem Parveen and Husna Parveen who are graduates in the subject. We four of us discuss and interact in Sanskrit which has helped me input grammar concepts in practice,” said Ismat. She aspires to pursue a PhD in Sanskrit vyakaran with a larger aim to get into academics to uncover the ancient theories in Sanskrit. “The correct interpretation of Sanskrit can be done only if you have a great understanding of its grammar. I have how a wrong pronunciation or diction can change the entire meaning,” said Ismat, who is eyeing to pursue research from either Benaras Hindu University or JJRSU. Motivated by her achievement, her sisters in law and elder sister has also decided to pursue a masters degree in the subject.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/muslim-girl-all-set-to-receive-gold-medal-in-sanskrit-vyakaran/articleshow/88983751.cms||Shoeb Khan

The university has taken up the project for Kalady Rice Millers Consortium Pvt Ltd (KRMC), a consortium of 36 rice mill owners founded to serve as a common facilitation centre for the rice milling industry. The centre was established under the ministry of MSME's flagship scheme micro small enterprises- cluster development programme (MSE-CDP). The project will draw on the expertise of the faculty members from across the university's associated colleges. The project is being facilitated by the university's industry attachment cell. Rice husk is being considered as an alternative source for cement manufacturing which is costly, energy intensive, and depletes natural resources. Large-scale disposal of rice husk, such as open-field burning and unregulated dumping, has also raised environmental problems; the reason why rice husk cement has quickly acquired appeal in construction industry.

The demand for products like garments, gem and jewellery generally goes up in January because of Valentine day in February. But with week-end curfews in place in many cities of the country, companies have put on hold some of their orders.Gaurav Jain, president of Gem and Jewellery Association of Sitapura, said, “Most of the workers in the industrial areas have been vaccinated by special camps after the vaccine became available. Following Covid protocols of masks and social distancing has become a part of operation now. That’s why we don’t have any operational problems.”However he said that there has been a dip in demand in recent weeks. “Some institutional buyers have become a little apprehensive and put on hold orders. But it’s small as of now,” said Jain.Garment exporters also expressed similar concerns but they are facing additional headwinds from rising fabric prices which have gone up by at least 50% in recent months.Vimal Shah, president of Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan, said, “While there is no problem on the manufacturing front, the challenge we are facing is demand side and rise in raw material costs, especially fabric prices. Buyers have become tentative for placing new orders as they want to wait for another couple of weeks or little more.”Shah said that rising cotton prices, speculators in the market and price jack up by spinning mills have contributed to the abnormal increase in fabric prices.In services sector, especially in IT, the employees were starting to return to their workplaces just before the third wave started. Now, most of the staff are working from home.Puneet Mittal, promoter of a leading IT company in Jaipur said, “Work from home has become a habit and it does not affect the productivity. In future, it’s going to be a hybrid model where employees can come to office for certain days a week and work from home on other days.”Mittal said that generally employers want their employees to work from the office so that the apprehension of data security is not there and control over human resource does not get diluted.In most corporatized offices, work from home has been the preferred mode now and it does not cause any disruption to the operation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/no-disruptions-in-mfg-but-3rd-wave-chokes-demand/articleshow/88983757.cms||---

---||Delhi||Marriage not sufficient ground to spare husband for ‘rape’, Delhi high court told||NEW DELHI: The status of marriage cannot be a “sufficient’ reason to deny a woman the ability to prosecute her husband for rape, Delhi high court was told on Tuesday. Senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae in a batch of petitions challenging the legality of the marital rape exception in IPC, told a bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar that it was time to give the provision “the burial it deserved”. “To say Parliament has enacted it and it will take care of it should not be the course. Parliament had the opportunity to do it after the Constitution was enacted and the mandate under Article 13(1) came into play. Parliament had the opportunity to do it after reports of several law commissions but it did not do it,” the senior counsel added. Rao submitted that when Supreme Court read down the same exception in a judgment, it had said it was not creating an offence since it already existed under Section 375 (rape) of IPC. “There can be no doubt that the courts cannot create an offence. However, there can be no doubt that by partly striking down Section 375, no new offence is being created. The offence already exists in the main part of Section 375 as well as in Section 3 and POCSO Act. What has been done is only to read down exception 2 to Section 375 to bring it in consonance with the Constitution and POCSO,” he said. When HC asked ASG Chetan Sharma to be ready with his submissions, he said the consultative process has been fast-tracked by the central government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/marriage-not-sufficient-ground-to-spare-husband-for-rape-high-court-told/articleshow/88982534.cms||---

The team will be responsible for creating awareness on source level waste management and can undertake installation of biogas plants to process waste at the community level. At present, 443 members have started work in 41 wards in the city covering 14,375 houses. The survey is underway in 82 wards. The city corporation had earlier approved the decision to launch Haritha Karma Sena workers in all the hundred wards for the collection of non-biodegradable waste.  In the council meeting held on January 7, the health standing committee proposed that the workers shall collect an amount of Rs 4,000 per month as user fee and that their monthly remuneration shall be fixed as Rs 10,500. In case of deficit, the additional amount will be allotted from viability gap fund for a period of six months. It was proposed that the hike in salary would be considered after six months. It was also decided that Haritha Karma Sena workers shall cover 40% of houses in one ward on a monthly basis. During the council meeting BJP councillor Girikumar had expressed reservations regarding mandatory collection of Rs 4,000 as user fee. He cited that such a clause shall be taken off from the proposal. The amount being collected on a monthly basis will be deposited in the joint account of the group secretary and president and salary will be taken from that account.  As per the document prepared for the functioning of Haritha Karma Sena workers, income from user fee, amount collected from sale of scrap and other items are the sources of monthly income. The department has directed that special wages shall be disbursed for the workers if local bodies engage them in services other than door to door collection and segregation of non-biodegradable materials. The department has, however, pointed out that VGF shall not be given in local bodies where basic duties were not fulfilled in spite of ideal circumstances. In 2018, the government had permitted local bodies to utilize a specified amount from plan funds to provide VGF for six months for the activities of Haritha Karma Sena. The amount was approved at rates of Rs 23,175 per ward in gram panchayat, Rs 46,350 per ward in municipalities and Rs 92,700 per ward in corporations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/haritha-karma-sena-begins-collection-of-dry-waste/articleshow/88981958.cms||---

Dileep, who was named as the sixth accused in the case, is the one arrested by the crime branch. He was produced before the court on Tuesday. The case pertains to the alleged murder of Satnam Singh, a law student hailing from Bihar, at government mental health research centre, where he was admitted shortly after he was taken into custody by the police for creating a ruckus at Amritanandamayi Math in Kollam in 2012. According to the police, Dileep had secured bail in the case and gone absconding. After he repeatedly failed to appear for court sessions, the court declared him as a wanted person in 2018. The crime branch had completed the investigation and filed the chargesheet in the case. As per the chargesheet, Satnam was murdered by six men, including two staff of the mental health research centre and four inmates who were undergoing rehabilitation at the centre. The staff involved are attender Anilkumar and warden Vivekanandan. The crime branch finding is that the two men tortured Satnam Singh in his cell using a cable wire when he turned violent on August 4, 2012. The other four joined them witnessing the torture. The death had become a controversy as the alleged murder took place just two days after he was taken into custody by the police. Allegations of custodial torture were raised against the police. Out of the six accused in the case, the fourth accused had allegedly died by suicide. With the arrest of Dileep, the trial of the accused is expected to commence soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/sixth-accused-held-in-satnam-singh-murder-case/articleshow/88981954.cms||---

A senior department official said the contact details of the buyers will be given to the health department.Proprietors of several drug stores and pharmacy businesses said they had got the circular. However, district health officer Dr Kishore Kumar M pointed to a problem that could arise after the data collection. Kumar said that through the additional drug controller, who is the inspecting authority, names, addresses and phone numbers of customers who have purchased these kits are being collected. If a buyer tests positive, he is expected to update the results on an app, that will reflect on the ICMR website. However, there was no mechanism in place to check if the results were indeed being updated, the district health officer said.Herald Monteiro, the proprietor of Health Care Medicals, told TOI he had got a call from the drugs control department, asking for the details of customers. On Tuesday, he sold about 15 kits to a social services organisation, he said.A representative from Ganesh Medicals said that the demand for the kits had increased in the last 15 days. “We are selling an average of 20-25 kits per day, costing Rs 250,” he said.Manohar Shetty, the managing director of the Sai Radha Group, said the sales are not as high compared to Mumbai or Bengaluru. “About 8-10 home testing kits are sold per day. These days, the awareness level is high, and people get themselves treated for cold and fever immediately, due to which recovery is high,” he said.Mohammed Kunhi, the proprietor of Unity Medicals, said the kits were sold for the first time in the second wave. “We got complaints that the results are not accurate. Whenever a customer asks for a kit, I suggest they go to a nearby public health centre and opt for an RT-PCR test. We have sold only about two kits so far,” he said. He added that he too had received the circular from the drugs control department asking for buyers’ details.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/drugs-control-dept-collects-details-on-covid-test-kit-buyers/articleshow/88983782.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Currently, there are 60 ventilators in the Covid wing and a provision is being made to add another 15 to 20 ventilators considering the probability that if the number of patients increases, the severity of the infection could also increase. Against this backdrop, all the necessary arrangements are being made at the Covid wing. Rohan Borse, the nodal officer of the Covid wing at the civil hospital said that at present, 23 patients have been admitted to the Covid wing and as of now, most of the Covid-19 patients are not requiring oxygen.Borse said that their aim is to ensure that the Covid wing has all the necessary infrastructure in place to provide the best possible treatment to the patients coming to Nashik civil hospital. He added that they are not facing any medicine-related issues as the line of treatment remains the same. During the first and the second wave, a large number of patients infected with Covid-19 were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Now that the cases have started increasing again, all the necessary equipment are being put in place at the civil hospital. On the brighter side, the rural hospital and the Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHCs) have also been provided with the necessary infrastructure so that patients in the rural areas get treatment in their talukas itself rather than coming all the way to the Nashik city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-civil-hosp-to-get-15-20-more-ventilators/articleshow/88983784.cms||---

Mandhare expressed concerns over the slow pace of vaccination in Manmad town of Nandgaon taluka, which is an important Central Railway junction. It also has a higher number of cases in the entire taluka. The collector noted that the vaccination pace is slower in Manmad as compared to the Malegaon town and asked the authorities to take measures to increase the same. “When Malegaon has a better vaccination pace, why is the vaccination pace slow in Manmad town. The people should come forth and take their vaccines that are due at the earliest to ensure protection against the infection,” said Mandhare. In the Nandgaon taluka, 77% of the eligible population have taken the first dose, and 35% have taken the second dose. While other rural areas of the taluka have a better vaccination performance, in Manmad, the vaccination pace is a bit slower. Of the 49,000 population here, more than 22,000 people have still not taken their first dose. Mandhare also pointed out that most of the people who were admitted to the hospitals were unvaccinated and hence, people should understand the importance of the same to ensure safety against the infection. Over the rising cases in taluka, the officer asked the health officials to take up additional measures to ensure beds and oxygen backup across the taluka as it may be required for the hospitalisation. “It is good that the number of people requiring hospitalization is low, but we need to be ready to face any situation,” the collector added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/collector-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-nandgaon-taluka/articleshow/88983789.cms||---

During the ongoing third wave of the pandemic, as many as 946 children, aged up to 12 years, in both Nashik city and rural Nashik have been detected with the infection so far, according to the data provided by the district health department.Of these 946 children detected with Covid, only 11 had been hospitalised.

They should consult doctors for every signal of distress in the child,” Dr Gajare.Stating that most children got the infection from their parents, pediatrician Ravindra Sonawane cautioned parents against leaving their children in the care of grandparents at such times. “Let children be with you and follow protocols strictly. If the aged parents get the infection and if they have comorbidity, they you may be inviting trouble,” he said.

Girish Palve, the BJP city unit president, said Patole insulted the PM of the country and the act has hurt everyone’s sentiments.“The statement is insulting to the PM of the country and against the norms of democracy. Every person has the right to criticize, but that should be done in a parliamentary manner. Here, the Congress president has stooped low to criticise the BJP and its leaders as he is not able to find any grounds to criticise the party,” Palve said. The letter presented to Sarkarwada police urged the police to carry out an in-depth investigation and register a complaint against Patole. Meanwhile, in Satpur, BJP workers, led by MLA Seema Hiray and Palve, protested and raised slogans against Patole. Hiray also demanded immediate action against Patole.BJP protests in M’wadaElsewhere, BJP MLA and former Maharashtra minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar demanded that Patole disclose the identity of the person he was referring to in his controversial remarks. Patole should disclose “details with a photograph of the ‘goon’ he is talking about," Nilangekar said in a statement. Congress was promoting violence in politics, he alleged. BJP workers also staged protests against Patole in Aurangabad, Nanded and other districts of Marathwada. — with PTI inputs||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-city-bjp-chief-wants-case-registered-against-nana-patole/articleshow/88983796.cms||---

Though no casualties were reported in the attack, a police vehicle parked on the premises of the station suffered damages. According to the police, the incident happened around 11 am on Tuesday. The police have recovered visuals from surveillance cameras installed at the station and identified the suspects. A hunt has been launched to nab the assailants. In the visuals, two youths who were riding on a motorycle could be seen throwing two petrol bombs, made of beer bottles, at the station. While one of them landed on the ground, the other hit the rear windshield of one of the two official vehicles parked on the premises of the station. Aryancode station house officer inspector P Sreekumaran Nair said that they suspect the attack to be retaliation to a series of raids the police conducted during the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday to nab a person who had allegedly stabbed and injured a higher secondary student at Chemboor on Monday evening. “The suspect in the case is a known drug and ganja peddler and he had allegedly stabbed the 19-year-old student on his arm,” the inspector said, adding that the identity of the suspect cannot be revealed before the arrest. He said that it was a personal rivalry that resulted in the attack and the police launched a search for him. The search teams of the police visited his house, but he was absconding. Hence the police conducted raids at the residences of his close friends too. This action might have provoked him and his friends to launch the attack on the police, the inspector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/men-hurl-petrol-bombs-at-police-station/articleshow/88981967.cms||---

On Tuesday, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said the Centre, following an unwritten rule, selects only 12 tableaux each year to be showcased at the parade. “This unsaid rule was framed during the Congress tenure and we are just following the same. Barring exceptional cases, only 12 tableaux are selected each year for the parade. There are lies being spread that the Centre rejected Kerala’s Sree Narayana Guru tableau and demanded a Shankaracharya one. We respect both the great personalities,” he told reporters in Hubballi. The same was earlier reiterated by BJP ministers from the coastal belt, including Kannada and culture minister V Sunil Kumar and social welfare minister Kota Srinivas Poojary. The ministers said not all 36 states and Union territories can have their tableaux at the parade each year, with the rule stating every state will get a chance once in three years. Kerala got its chance in 2018 and 2021, they said.In fact, Poojary went on to add that the controversy has been raked up by the Kerala government and Karnataka Congress for political reasons. The JD(S), which is in alliance with the LDF in Kerala, accused the BJP of putting out “half-truths”. “While BJP claims it rejected Kerala’s tableau based on some rule, what reasons are being attributed to rejecting Tamil Nadu and West Bengal’s tableaux? It gives rise to speculation that the Centre is trying to squeeze out regional party-led governments” it said on Twitter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/lies-spread-about-guru-tableau-govt/articleshow/88983800.cms||---

Notices are put up at the entrance and at other places about the rule in Mahaveer Petrol pump in New Cotton Market. The petrol pump had enforced the same rule during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The pump’s owner Santosh Muttagi said, “It is our responsibility to join hands with authorities to create awareness about Covid norms. As hundreds of people visit the petrol pump in a day, we decided to motivate them to wear masks, and launched the 'No Mask-No Petrol' campaign, which is quite effective.” “Some percentage of business got hampered during the earlier campaign, but it is not a matter of business. It is the responsibility of everyone to adhere to Covid rules. Covid cases are on rise in Dharwad district and we too must assist the authorities in controlling the situation,” he added. Ashpaq K, a manager at the petrol pump, said, “While filling fuel, we request motorists to wear masks and they comply. If they don't have masks with them, we distribute masks, and with folded hands request them to wear masks, maintain social distance and use hand sanitiser. Sometimes people argue with us, but we request and convince them to wear masks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/petrol-bunk-starts-no-mask-no-petrol-campaign/articleshow/88983809.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Katti, who attended a public function organised by the state forest department in Athani, about 140km from Belagavi on Monday evening, was taken aback when some reporters asked him why he was not wearing a mask. Former deputy CM and BJP MLC Laxman Savadi had also shared the dais with Katti. His reply took everyone there by surprise. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated that there will be no restrictions on anyone and wearing of masks is left to one’s responsibility. It is left to the discretion of an individual. So, I didn’t feel like wearing it,” he said. The casual statement of the minister drew sharp criticism from various quarters. Soon Katti took to social media to issue a clarification claiming that his statements were misinterpreted in the media. “Every individual should adhere to the mask policy, understanding their responsibility. My stance is no different to that. I did not tell anybody not to wear a mask. I am completely aware of my onus. But my statements were reported in the media with wrong interpretation. In the prevailing pandemic situation, we are all aware of our duties. Hence, let us all strictly follow the guidelines,” he wrote on Facebook. Katti had earlier drawn flak when he declared families with TVs and two-wheelers should surrender their below poverty line (BPL) cards or face action. He also had made headlines when he told a farmer-activist, who enquired about the foodgrain allotment, to “go die” and followed it up by adding it is a “good time for farmers to die”. In further embarrassment to the ruling BJP, a video of the deputy speaker of legislative assembly Anand Mamani celebrating his birthday surfaced on Tuesday. Anand Mamani, BJP MLA from Savadatti constituency in Belagavi district, celebrated the day with hundreds of party workers at his residence in Savadatti town. Neither the party workers nor the deputy speaker were wearing masks or maintaining social distance. The government has filed three FIRs against 142 Congress functionaries for taking out a padayatra for four days in violation of Covid guidelines. The opposition party is now demanding the government to book cases by listing out 10 separate instances where the ruling party MLAs and ministers were found violating the rules.

---||Chandigarh||6 years on, Panjab University fails to act on NAAC recommendations||Poviet Kaur CHANDIGARH: Six years ago, a team of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), suggested that each department in Panjab University should have at least six teachers. However, PU did not act on it and the condition of these departments is the same as before. Only one to four teachers have been posted in more than 30 departments.  This has raised questions on the functioning of the varsity over the past six years. Although recruitment of teachers was proposed, nothing has been done on the ground so far. With the next visit of the NAAC team expected in July, the university is in the same position as before, which may have a bearing on its ranking.  Ashish Jain, director, Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) said, “The NAAC has pointed out a few issues and things are in the pipeline. We hope that by the time NAAC visits the university, things are sorted out, which will hopefully help improve the ranking of the university. We do not expect the visit of the NAAC team before the year-end, so we think that by that time, issues raised by the NAAC team are resolved.” Depts worst affected by teacher shortage Departments of Guru Nanak Dev Sikh Studies, Music, Russian, Sanskrit, German, Urdu, Medical Physics, Nuclear Medicine, Stem Cell etc. of PU are being run through a single permanent teacher. According to sources, the departments of human rights, police administration, social work, ancient Indian history, Chinese and Tibetan, Gandhian and Peace Studies, Indian Theatre, Punjabi etc. have been handed over to two teachers. There are only three to four teachers in departments like French, Microbial Biotechnology, Physical Education, Psychology, Forensic Science, Systems Biology, Women Studies, Human Genome, Environment Studies, Information Science, Philosophy, Public Administration, Nano Science etc. NAAC recommendationsThe NAAC team suggested that smaller departments be merged into larger departments. These include centers which have one to two teachers or three teachers. PU also formed a committee on the merger of departments, but the proposal was not implemented and the offer is on hold. Senior teachers have expressed concern about the delay. PU administration officials said that proposals are in the pipeline and work on teacher deployment and merger of departments will be done.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/6-years-on-pu-fails-to-act-on-naac-recommendations/articleshow/88983823.cms||---

His 28-year-old sister, Iqra Hasan, has now stepped up campaigning for the upcoming polls on his and the party's behalf. Iqra returned from London recently, where she is studying, to garner votes for her brother. Nahid was arrested on Saturday while his motorcade was approaching the sessions court in Kairana. He was on his way to surrender, he claimed. He had been evading arrest since he, along with his mother Tabassum Hasan, were booked under provisions of the Gangsters Act. Iqra's door-to-door campaigning set off rumours that the SP had replaced the Kairana candidate and issued a fresh ticket to his sister instead. This prompted a statement from the deputy chief minister of UP and BJP leader Keshav Prasad Maurya, who said, "I have heard that under severe criticism, the SP replaced its tainted candidate from Kairana with his sister. This is unacceptable as the BJP believes that fielding a tainted individual or any of their family members is wrong." Iqra rubbished the "insinuation" and said, "It's an emergency for me as the incumbent government has slapped fictitious cases against my brother and my mother because of which they are both unable to campaign. I am representing my family in their absence. My brother is the SP candidate. I have no political aspirations and BJP is spreading rumours." Iqra plans to pursue a PhD in electoral politics. She has a master's degree in international law from London University. Nahid's close aide Rajan Jawla, who is currently working with Iqra, said, "Iqra is a hit among the voters and is getting a lot of emotional support because of the injustice meted out to her family." On February 12, 2021, former Kairana MP Tabassum and her son Nahid, along with 38 others, were booked under relevant sections of the Gangster Act by the Shamli police. In the FIR registered at Kairana police station in the district, Nahid had been named the gang leader. The FIR by Kairana SHO Premveer Rana claimed that "the terror of the gang is prevalent in the region and people don't come forward with complaints due to fear."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/court-rejects-mlas-bail-plea-sister-steps-in-during-emergency/articleshow/88986302.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Chandigarh||Panchkula-Morni road: High court asks Haryana to explore options to save trees||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Haryana government to explore all possible alternatives to save the trees while undertaking widening of Morni-Panchkula road. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli, passed these orders while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate HC Arora. As per the order, which was released on Tuesday, the HC recorded a statement of the additional advocate general of Haryana that the representation dated January 6, submitted by the petitioner, would be considered by the authorities and all possible steps for saving the trees standing on the either side of the Morni-Panchkula road would be taken. Now, the final decision has to be taken by the Haryana chief secretary. In his PIL, Arora said Haryana was going ahead with uprooting and cutting of 1,137 trees, which include 175 pine trees and remaining khair trees, for widening of the Morni-Panchkula road. He said he had submitted a representation on January 6 to the Haryana chief secretary, requesting that all steps and alternatives be considered to save maximum trees, but the respondents started going ahead with uprooting and cutting without first considering other options. He said it was necessary to maintain a balance between environment and development, but unfortunately Haryana was considering only development. He added that the state authorities were going ahead with road widening without conducting a study on traffic volume.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pkl-morni-road-hc-asks-hry-to-explore-options-to-save-trees/articleshow/88983828.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Make autos safer, accountable: UT women||Akansha Srivastava & Vaishali ThakurChandigarh: Most women who travel by autos, especially in the evening, don’t feel safe and want the UT administration to regulate the auto service, especially in the wake of the recent rape of a woman passenger by an auto driver in Chandigarh.Women passengers say their biggest fear is that they could be harassed while travelling in autos. Due to lack of bus services at night in most sectors of Chandigarh, women rely on autorickshaws and cabs to reach their destinations. For most women who return from work late at night, finding a safe mode of transportation is a recurring challenge.Khushbu, a 25-year-old resident of Mohali, who works in Sector 15, said she never felt secure taking an autorickshaw after 7pm. “I was late from work one day and took an auto-rickshaw for Mohali. After some time, I realized that the driver was not taking the road to my house, so I told him to stop. Since he didn't listen to me or slow down, I had to jump out of the auto,” she said.She added that regulation of autos in the Tricity was direly needed as passengers needed to know who they were travelling with. “There should be some database of drivers available with the police and administration,” she suggested. “One day, I was travelling from Sector 17 in an auto around 9:30pm when some boys on motorcycles gathered around me and started singing lewd songs. I requested the driver to speed up and he told me that I could go out if I didn’t feel safe,” said Leela, a 36-year-old city resident.Women also complained about male co-passengers harassing them. “Passengers in a shared vehicle purposely sit next to you and tend to touch you. If I complain, all I get to hear is that I am a girl should not be traveling alone at night, least of all in a cab or shared auto,” said Rohini, another city resident. A few women said they felt safer on bicycles than in autos. “I prefer to commute by bicycle rather than auto-rickshaws since it keeps me safer and I advise my daughter to do the same,” said Sunita, who works in Sector 22.The expense of hiring a private auto is too high for many, who are forced to take the cheaper but unsafe option. “We prefer independent autos since they are safer but auto drivers have started charging more, so we often have to take shared autos. This can be frightening, but we have no other option,” said Ragini, a 25-year-old woman working in Industrial Area.Activist Harman Singh Sidhu feels that incidents of rape involving auto drivers happen because authorities fail to take stern action against culprits.“The administration must take steps to ensure safety of women passengers travelling by autos. The UT launches drives against illegal plying of autos from time to time. But that’s not enough as it has failed to deter criminals. We need a policy to regulate autos in the city. UT should start by collecting a database on auto drivers,” Sidhu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/make-autos-safer-accountable-ut-women/articleshow/88983829.cms||---

The Tricolour will be hoisted, followed by a march-past by police contingents and an address by the chief guest. A final meeting will be organised by UT deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh soon. UT adviser Dharam Pal also said Republic Day function will be a subdued affair. All participants and officials involved in the preparations of the programme will have to undergo thermal temperature scanning, maintain social distancing and wear face masks. No city tableau This year, too, the city will not have its tableau at Republic Day parade at Rajpath. This will be the sixth consecutive year when the UT administration has failed to impress the selection committee. Chandigarh showcased its tableau at the Republic Day parade for the first time in 1989. City’s tableau got selected for R-Day only on four occasions in 1989, 1999, 2014 and 2016. On two occasions, the theme was Rock Garden. In 2014, with the Rock Garden themed tableau, the city participated in the parade after a gap of 13 years. In 2016, the tableau highlighting Chandigarh’s architecture, elements of green and smart city took part in the parade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-at-home-function-r-day-to-be-a-low-key-affair-this-time/articleshow/88983833.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Chandigarh||Watch out, this Egyptian Pharaoh may be an Uzbek!||Chandigarh: The catastrophic decline in certain vulture species has not affected to that extent the smallest of the vultures found in India, the endangered and quaintly named, Egyptian vulture or Pharaoh’s Chicken. Bird photographers encounter them in the Tricity hinterland, as close as the Saketri scrublands and Panchkula’s dumping grounds. It would come as a surprise to bird enthusiasts that a component of this vulture species is not resident but migrates to India from Central Asia to winter here, as revealed by a first-ever study using satellite tags. The study tracked a specimen from Uzbekistan who wandered over Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, savouring the richness of waste dumps associated with tourism’s Golden Triangle. The Uzbek guest even ogled India Gate and the Taj Mahal by flying low over the iconic monuments!This juvenile vulture, nicknamed Arys by a multi-national team of researchers, was tracked closely. “Arys travelled 1,500 km from southern Uzbekistan to India. He crossed the border into Rajasthan on September 18, 2021, arriving at Bhadriya (60 km east of Jaisalmer). He moved to Bikaner on September 25 to the famous carcass dump, and stayed there till October 21. He travelled to Delhi by October 21. He then spent a month south of Delhi near Faridabad and Nuh, Haryana. During this time, he took a two-day trip in a loop south to Jaipur, passing directly over the city at a height of 1.5 km on October 29. Arys arrived at Agra on December 29 flying 600 m above the Taj Mahal,” researcher, Dr Robert J Burnside from the University of East Anglia, the UK, told the TOI.His colleagues, Anna Ten and Valentin Soldatov from the Institute of Zoology, Uzbekistan, and Vladimir Dobrev from the Bulgarian Society for Protection of Birds, receive four updates every day on their cellphones pinpointing the location of Arys and two other tagged vultures, Anya and Timur, who are wintering in the Thar desert and Yemen, respectively. The Egyptian vulture is the smallest of the nine vulture species encountered in India. It can be sighted at spots such as the Siswan dam backwaters, patiently waiting its turn at the sambar carcasses in deference to larger vultures such as the Eurasian griffon, Himalayan vulture and the White-rumped vulture. It is so named because they were worshipped by Egyptian civilizations. The queer, alternative common name, ‘Pharaoh’s Chicken’, stems probably from the yellow mane around the neck, lending them a Pharaoh’s bearing.Profiling the objectives of the pioneering study, researchers, Anna Ten and Valentin Soldatov, told the TOI: “The Egyptian vulture is a Red Data book species and available evidence suggests it is declining in Uzbekistan. We need to understand the movements and migration of birds from Uzbekistan to better plan for its future in Asia. Migration is an extremely dangerous time for birds; Egyptian vultures face a range of threats when flying across sea and land such as drowning, hunting, poisoning and electrocution. So far, we have learnt that the picture is much more complex than we anticipated. Although these three birds are just the beginning, the results from this ground-breaking research are absolutely invaluable for their future conservation.”Since the three satellite-tagged juvenile vultures (just about three months old each) made it to their wintering sites flying long distances in the year of their birth, the question arises: did they accompany adults who knew the routes or did they fly alone utilising evolved, embedded knowledge in their genes? Dr Burnside offered a perspective to the TOI, “It is known that some Egyptian vulture juveniles follow adults in small groups. But the degree to which innate programming of migration routes vs learned routes prevails, is a matter still under investigation. Juveniles can migrate alone, but don't benefit from the prior experience adults have. This is the experience from people tracking these vultures in Europe/Africa.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/watch-out-this-egyptian-pharaoh-may-be-an-uzbek/articleshow/88983839.cms||VIKRAM JIT SINGH

Police raided a rented premise located close to Saurashtra University and caught the doctor Mukesh Toriya and his staff red-handed conducted the sex determination test on Monday night. Toriya’s assistant Avesh Pinjara, who was also arrested, used to work as a nursing assistant in Dhoraji, and was arrested by Rajkot taluka police station in 2020 too for a similar offence. Then, he used to carry out illegal tests in the Mavdi area. The machine used to remain in the possession of Avesh and he was responsible for finding customers.  The pregnant woman, Naina Kumbhar, who had come for the test, was also arrested. “Nainaben is a native of Thangadh down of Surendrangar district and she has five daughters. She desperately wanted a boy,” said Manoharsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police. Kumbhar came in contact with a woman named Jigna Jhala, who works as a nurse at Sanjivani Hospital near Metoda GIDC on the Rajkot city’s outskirts.

---||Jammu||Won't let in leaders who left party: PDP chief||Jammu: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday said she is not taking back those leaders who have deserted the party even though many of them are willing to return. Dozens of senior PDP leaders including former ministers and legislators left the party after the BJP withdrew its support to the Mehbooba-led coalition government in July 2018 and most of them joined the Apni Party led by Altaf Bukhari or the Peoples Conference led by Sajjad Lone. “I have made it a principle that those who have left us will not be taken back. Many of the leaders who deserted the party are eager to return but I am not going to take them back,” Mehbooba said addressing a function at party headquarters here. The function was organised by the PDP to welcome dozens of new entrants including supporters of Bushan Lal Dogra, a former minister who rejoined the PDP last month. “Dogra is like my younger brother and is a thorough gentleman whom I respect the most. His case of rejoining the party is exceptional,” Mehbooba said, expressing hope that he along with other workers would work tirelessly for strengthening the party at the grass-roots level. Launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led central government, she alleged that the ruling party is using Jammu and Kashmir as a laboratory for experimenting and has destroyed the erstwhile state. “My request to the people is to stand up to save Jammu and Kashmir. If you are able to save J&K, you will save the country. They started destruction of the country from J&K,” the former J&K chief minister said. pti||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/wont-let-in-leaders-who-left-party-pdp-chief/articleshow/88983852.cms||---

Now, it can be seen that the BJP is rejecting the participation of the states where it was finding it difficult to get a foothold.“They were trying to utilise history and data, in their favour. The fact that Tamil Nadu’s tableau was not allowed to participate in the Republic Day parade in New Delhi, is a humiliation to Tamil Nadu’s history. Sidelining of Velu Nachiar cannot be accepted and the Tamil Nadu chief minister should take a stern stand on the same,” Karti said.The Union government’s attitude is the reason why the students of north India do not know much about the freedom fighters from south India. They seem to think that only freedom fighters who followed the Hindutva ideology, should feature in the history of India. They never gave importance to the freedom fighters from Tamil Nadu, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/tn-mps-would-be-forced-to-boycott-r-day-parade/articleshow/88983853.cms||---

In the order, the court said that the instances of alleged violation of gag order pointed out by the petitioner cannot be brushed aside. The court asked the state police chief to conduct an inquiry and take action if the allegations are found to be true. A gag order was issued by the trial court at the beginning of the trial in the 2017 sexual assault case on a petition filed by the actor. The trial court had directed that nobody should print or publish the proceedings of the case except as allowed by the Supreme Court through a 2018 judgment (Nipun Saxena vs Union of India).

The MP said that the district has achieved a milestone in granting education loans across the country even as there has been a fall in students getting loans. Addressing mediapersons, Venkatesan pointed out that in the academic year 2021-2022, it became difficult for students to continue education due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Across the country, granting of education loans for students has seen a decline by 54%. However, in Madurai, Rs100 crore has been sanctioned by banks the same year. Camps were held at 357 higher secondary schools in Madurai to create awareness among students. Meetings were also held with all stakeholders, including district administration, education department and corporation officials and banks and we analyzed the reasons behind education loans getting rejected,” said the MP. Out of the Rs 100 crore, Rs 91.1 crore was sanctioned through 12 national banks while Rs 38.2 crore was sanctioned through 28 private banks. The MP said that for the first time on October 20, 2021, an ‘education loan mela’ was organized at The American College campus and 1,355 students had registered. “There was incredible response for the mela. On the same day, Rs11.81 crore was sanctioned as education loans for students. As many as 319 requests are still pending and they are also being looked into and hopefully we can even achieve Rs 150 crore target. Madurai should be a role model,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/100cr-sanctioned-as-education-loans-in-madurai-mp/articleshow/88983858.cms||---

---||Madurai||Civic poll: Party bigwigs try tickets for kin||MADURAI: Talks for shortlisting female candidate to contest for the mayoral post of Madurai Corporation began inside party circles from Monday as soon as it was announced that Madurai was allocated for a female candidate. It was already known that Madurai and Dindigul in the south would have female mayor candidates, but as local body elections were getting postponed it was not given much thought. The DMK would field its own candidate for the Madurai mayor’s seat as allies would not have much say in this. Meanwhile, party bigwigs in Madurai are trying to push for women from their families for the position. Sources said that Madurai North MLA Ko Thalapathy was trying to push the ticket for his daughter. Annaiyur DMK branch secretary Bomma Devan and former councillor Sasikumar, both who are close to minister P Moorthy, and DMK Madurai north general body member Pon Sethu are trying to get the ticket for their wives. It may be recalled that Madurai’s first female mayor Thenmozhi Gopinathan was elected from the DMK in 2006. Her husband Gopinathan was a close aide of chief minister M K Stalin’s brother M K Alagiri, who was then known as the strongman of Madurai. Earlier, there have been instances where Alagiri proved his might by fielding his candidates independently, when they were denied seats from the DMK. “But, it is not going to happen this time,” says K Isakkimuthu, a former three-time councillor and Alagiri loyalist, who has decided to field his wife I Annapoorani independently in the local body polls. Though BJP is also said to be eyeing the mayor’s seat from Madurai, AIADMK cadres have ruled out the possibility. “This would be our final chance to prove ourselves, so it will not happen,” said a former councillor. Former minister Sellur K Raju is eyeing the seat for his daughter Ramya and former mayor V V Rajan Chellappa for his daughter-in-law, but AIADMK cadres say they would stand a chance only if an AIADMK cadre who has done a lot ground work is fielded. Meanwhile, former zonal chairperson Shanmugavalli, an OPS loyalist, is also trying to get her name in the list. In Dindigul too, sitting ministers and former ministers are trying to make women in their families get the seat. Sources say that minister I Periyasamy’s daughter Indira Dwarakanathan and daughter-in-law Mercy Senthilkumar are strong contenders for the position. Both these candidates have been pushed into full-fledged public life as image building exercise. Former Dindigul mayor V Marudharaj is also said to be trying to field his daughter for the mayor’s position.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/civic-poll-party-bigwigs-try-tickets-for-kin/articleshow/88983860.cms||---

Asked about significantly lower number of cases reported on Monday, Pratyaya said, “Less number of samples is tested on Sundays. Hence, Monday’s figures remain relatively less when compared to other days. If we see the trend, the cases were comparatively less on January 10 and January 17 than the previous day because of less number of tests on Sundays.” Pratyaya added even though a “declining trend” is being seen, there is no room for complacency as far as Covid is concerned. “We are seeing the declining trend because of strict monitoring of safety protocols. The positivity rate of Bihar has declined from 3.67% on January 14 to 2.96% on Tuesday,” he added. Meanwhile, of the 4,551 fresh cases recorded on Tuesday, Patna accounted for 1,218. Other districts which reported significant number of Covid cases on Tuesday included Samastipur (399), Muzaffarpur (217), Purnia and Begusarai (192 each) and Darbhanga (157).

The first incident took place in Rikha Pakadiyadeewan village at around 6 pm when victim Ramtej Kishan (9) was dragged by a leopard into the forest area while he was playing in the courtyard of his house. While the villagers were trying to find Ramtej, they came to know about another leopard attack. This time the victim was four-year-old Aditya Kumar, the resident of village Jhala Matera. Residents of both the villages carried out a joint rescue operation with the support of the forest department the whole night but in vain. On Tuesday morning, Ramtej’s partially eaten body was retrieved from a cane field, while Aditya’s head was recovered in the forest. The forest officials are of the view that there were two different leopards behind these attacks. Divisional Forest Officer Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary Akashdeep Wadhawan told TOI, “Prima facie it appears that there were two different leopards behind the attack. We have collected the pug marks and are trying to match the samples. The locals have been advised not to allow their children to venture out when dark. We are combing the area and have placed cages in both the villages. Efforts are being made to ensure that such incidents don’t get repeated. The kin of the deceased have been advised compensation under the state government’s scheme.” The big cats-human conflict is common in the region. Early this month, a 10-year old boy was rescued by his brother after a tiger attacked him near the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. Located on the Indo-Nepal border in Lakhimpur district in Uttar Pradesh, Dudhwa Tiger reserve is a protected area in Uttar Pradesh comprising the Dudhwa National Park, Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. The reserve has sizable populations of big cats-- including tigers and leopards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/in-two-hours-two-minors-killed-in-leopard-attacks-near-dudhwa-forest/articleshow/88983864.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Patna||Patna University senate passes Rs 525 crore deficit budget||PATNA: The Patna University senate on Tuesday passed a Rs 525-crore deficit budget for the next financial year (2022-23). The budget will now be submitted to the state government for its inclusion in the annual state budget for the next fiscal. PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary presided the online meeting. Presenting the budget, PU pro-vice-chancellor Ajay Kumar Singh said the budget estimates envisage an expenditure of Rs 561 crore against an income of Rs 35 crore from all sources. The expenditure is likely to be met with grants from the education department (Rs 536 crore), science and technology department (Rs 8.84 crore), directorate of distance education (Rs 4.01 crore), and vocational and self-financing courses (Rs 12.52 crore). He added due to non-receipt of statutory grants from the state government to the tune of Rs 27 crore for the last 17 years, the university was facing difficulties in clearing its outstanding liabilities, including payment of electricity charges, municipal taxes, maintenance of laboratories and other infrastructural facilities. Singh added the university has been facing an acute dearth of teachers and non-teaching staff, hampering all its activities. There are only 270 teachers working in the university against 869 sanctioned posts. The university has appointed 114 guest faculties to manage its academic activities somehow. Similarly, only 576 non-teaching staff are working against 1,506 sanctioned posts. A sum of Rs 7 crore has been proposed for appointment of non-teaching staff against sanctioned vacant posts on contract basis through outsourcing. Earlier, the vice-chancellor announced that elections to the Patna University Students’ Union (PUSU) would be held in the last week of February as all the admissions of students in the current academic session are likely to be over by mid-February. Chaudhary announced that efforts are being made to digitize all the workings of the university by resorting to complete automation of its admission, examination and accounts. CCTV cameras will be installed at all strategic points throughout the campus for ensuring full safety to the boys and girls. He added the construction work of a first-of-its-kind Dolphin Research Centre on PU campus is likely to be started soon and a new building of Population Research Centre would also be constructed at a cost of Rs 6.9 crore. He said the PU would be the first university in the state to introduce CBCS at undergraduate level from the next academic session. The senate approved the admission ordinance and examination regulations of as many as 13 UG courses besides amendments in BLib Science and MLib Science courses.It also approved proposals with regard to an MoU with Zoological Survey of India, extension of the maximum two years’ limit for Ph D registration, adoption of NCC as an elective paper at the undergraduate stage, and weightage to Scout and Guide candidates in admission. PU syndicate member S B Lal presented the annual report. Student representatives Manish Kumar, Ashish Sinha, Aamir, and others highlighted students’ grievances.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-varsity-senate-passes-525cr-deficit-budget/articleshow/88983865.cms||---

Movement of vehicular traffic remained paralysed for more than an hour as the students also tried to scale the boundary wall of the PU office.The students were protesting against enhancement of BEd course fee from Rs 1800 to as high as Rs 1.5 lakh as per the decision of the PU Syndicate meet held on January 11. They demanded immediate restoration of the old fee structure in the larger interest of poor and meritorious students. The university is not a business house and, hence, it must not arbitrarily raise its tuition fee for any course. All the expenses of the university are met by the state government, they added.Ultimately, the Senate decided to fix the BEd course fee at Rs 25,000 which is equal to the course fee being charged in all government teachers’ training colleges in the state.PU students’welfare dean Anil Kumar told the newspaper that the proposal regarding enhancement of BEd course fee passed by the Senate will now be forwarded to the state government along with the university’s budget estimate for the next financial year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/students-protest-bed-course-fee-hike/articleshow/88983868.cms||---

Hence, Monday’s figures remain relatively less when compared to other days. If we see the trend, the cases were comparatively less on January 10 and January 17 than the previous day because of less number of tests on Sundays.”Pratyaya added even though a “declining trend” is being seen, there is no room for complacency as far as Covid is concerned. “We are seeing the declining trend because of strict monitoring of safety protocols. The positivity rate of Bihar has declined from 3.67% on January 14 to 2.96% on Tuesday,” he added.Meanwhile, of the 4,551 fresh cases recorded on Tuesday, Patna accounted for 1,218. Other districts which reported significant number of Covid cases on Tuesday included Samastipur (399), Muzaffarpur (217), Purnia and Begusarai (192 each) and Darbhanga (157).Also, four more Covid deaths were reported by the health department on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/state-registers-4551-fresh-coronavirus-cases-4-deaths/articleshow/88983869.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Bihar: Barbigha officer held for taking Rs 48,000 bribe||PATNA: The Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) sleuths on Tuesday arrested the executive officer of Barbigha, Vijay Kumar, when he was allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs48,000 from a contractor at his office at Sheikhpura. Vijay, a resident of Kajichak under Sarmera police station area in Nalanda district, was posted at Barbigha office. He had demanded bribery for clearing the bill and necessary process for construction work. He is an officer of Bihar Administrative Service. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said Vijay was arrested under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988, for demanding Rs48,000 as bribe from Sambhu Kumar, a contractor, for clearing his bill against the execution of work awarded to him. “On Tuesday, during a follow up action the accused Vijay Kumar has been caught red-handed while demanding and accepting bribe from the complainant. Further legal action is in progress,” he said. The sub-divisional police officer of Sheikhpura said the SVU team arrested the executive officer. He will be produced before the special court in Patna on Wednesday. According to the information received, Shambhu, a contractor of the Barbigha Municipal Council, had complained to the SVU about the demand for money by Vijay. “According to Singh, Vijay had threatened to deny him any further contract if he did not pay him the bribe,” the sources said. A trap team led by the SVU DSP Divesh arrested the executive officer soon after one Sambhu Kumar handed over the bribe money to him. “Further legal action in this regard and search of his house will be conducted by the team,” he said. Khan said in the last six months, seven disproportionate assets cases have been registered by the SVU and all the accused were arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-barbigha-officer-held-for-taking-rs-48000-bribe/articleshow/88983871.cms||---
---||Meerut||RLD leaders in open revolt after 8 'party seats' go to SP leaders||Meerut: RLD leaders and cadre have come out in open revolt after it transpired on Tuesday that eight Samajwadi Party candidates -- and not RLD leaders -- would be fighting assembly polls from a clutch of constituencies in west UP on the RLD symbol. This is out of the 32 seats given to the RLD by the Samajwadi Party (SP). Senior RLD leaders told TOI that "this could even put the alliance between Jayant Chaudhary and Akhilesh Yadav in jeopardy". Several seats so far in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, considered to be a stronghold of RLD backed by a resurgent Jat constituency after the farm protests, have technically gone to the SP. On Tuesday, SP leader and former MLA Ghulam Mohammad was given the ticket from Siwalkhas constituency of Meerut while Manisha Ahlawat got Meerut Cantonment. Both have been awarded the RLD symbol. Senior RLD leaders openly criticised party chief Jayant Chaudhary for "not being firm" regarding the ticket distribution. "Our chief should have been able to deal with this firmly. We are a junior partner in the alliance but are strong in west UP and hold sway in the region in the prevailing circumstances. But it seems our chief has succumbed to the SP pressure," said national general secretary (minority wing) and veteran RLD leader Anudin Shah. Several party workers led by state president of Rashtriya Jat Mahasangh Rohit Jakhad protested at the statue of former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh in Meerut. "The seat distribution has given a walkover to the BJP. We have nothing to lose. It is Akhilesh Yadav who dreams of becoming the chief minister but if he cannot honour the rules of alliance, we know how to defeat such a mindset," Jakhad said. He added: "At least eight seats out of 32 haveactually gone to SP but on the RLD symbol so far. And all these were winnable seats for RLD. It was the party cadre led by veteran leaders who fought against farm laws, but when it comes to rewards even senior leaders like Raj Kumar Sangwan and Anudin Shah serving the party for several decades have been sidelined. This cannot be tolerated." The protest is not confined to Meerut and has spread to other regions. "Resentment is widespread. SP has fielded its candidates on the RLD symbol where Jats are in majority and were considered safe seats. For instance, Sanjay Laatar in Mathura (though Jat but an SP leader on RLD symbol), Rajpal Saini in Khatauli, the list goes on," said an RLD leader. Abhishek Chaudhary, west UP spokesperson for RLD, said, "Muzaffarnagar has six assembly seats and five have gone to RLD, but in reality four out of these five candidates are from SP fighting on the RLD symbol. We have been cheated." According to party leaders, in 2017 the alliance between RLD and SP had broken due to the same reason. "Akhilesh Yadav is trying to hijack the benefit of all the hard work done by RLD in creating a strong narrative against the BJP," a senior leader said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/rld-leaders-in-open-revolt-after-8-party-seats-go-to-sp-leaders/articleshow/88981333.cms||Sandeep Rai

A division bench comprising chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar, while hearing a batch of PILs, expressed its displeasure over sluggish execution of the 90km project. The court was informed that the deadline of the project had lapsed on December 19, 2021 and it was further extended to June 2023 due to obstructions caused at several points by locals. Responding to the allegation, additional advocate general Anjani Kumar contended that if such allegations are submitted through the affidavits, the administration and police will take action. NHAI’s counsel Dr Maurya Vijay assured the court on behalf of his client that 50% of work on this project would be completed by June this year. The court will now hear the matter on January 25. The court also expressed dismay over the delay in shifting of a bus stand from Ramashish Chowk on Hajipur-Muzaffarpur four-lane and delay in acquisition of identified plots which have narrowed the highway at certain patches. Munger-Mirzachowki NH-80: The Patna high court on Thursday asked the state road construction department to file an affidavit detailing the status of maintenance of Munger-Mirzachowki NH-80. The court also asked the state transport department to seek a plausible alternative for the passage of heavy vehicles on the highway. AAG Anjani Kumar sought a two-week time to furnish the requisite data but orally indicated that the maintenance work would be completed by March. Illegal BEd college: The Patna high court on Tuesday asked the state government to furnish an action taken report within the next 48 hours in a matter of existence of an “illegal” college, Er Upendra Sharma Teachers Training College at Telhara Khurd village in Dhaka block of East Champaran district. The petitioner has alleged that the college was running “on papers” only.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/delay-in-widening-of-a-section-of-nh-70-hc-seeks-nhai-reply/articleshow/88983872.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Sitting in New Jersey, engineer catches burglars at Kanpur home in tech web||KANPUR: Technology saved a house from being burgled when a resident of Kanpur, who was in New Jersey, USA, informed the local police after watching live the CCTV footage of miscreants breaking into his residence at Shyamnagar area of the city on Monday night. Responding to the call, police rushed to the house when burglars were still inside. As the cops tried to zero in, the intruders opened fire. In retaliatory firing by the cops, one miscreant got injured and was nabbed while others escaped. It was around midnight on Monday when Vijay Awasthi, 38, a software engineer in New Jersey, received an alert on his mobile phone. The signal was from the CCTV cameras and sensors he had installed at his ancestral house at D-Block, Shyamnagar under Chakeri police station, to save his house from burglars. When he checked the footage, Vijay was shocked to find some intruders inside his house named Harihar Dham. "He saw one miscreant trying to break the lock of a room. Vijay used the mic option to warn the intruders. But his warning had no impact on them. Instead they broke the CCTV camera and entered the house," police said. Vijay then immediately called up his neighbour in Shyamnagar, who informed the police control room. A patrolling team of local police reached the site within five minutes, says inspector of Chakeri police station, Madhur Mishra. Soon, police commissioner Vijay Singh Meena, DCP, East, Pramod Kumar, and police forces of half-a-dozen police stations also reached the spot and cordoned off Vijay's house from all sides. The miscreants who were on the roof and hiding behind the water tank, were warned and asked to surrender. However, they opened fire on the police. In retaliation, the police also opened fire, in which one of them, Sonu, a native of Hamirpur district, was injured. "The police climbed the roof from the neighbour's terrace and took out Sonu, but no other intruder was found. Probably they jumped into the vacant plot on the rear side and escaped," police said. Sonu was admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital. The entire operation took over three hours. DCP, East, Pramod Kumar, said that as a precautionary measure, police force has been deployed at the house. The condition of the injured miscreant is improving. "A Police team has been dispatched to the hospital to interrogate him to find out about his aides," the DCP added. The locals of the area were in panic due to the sound of gunshots and the blockade raised in the entire area to prevent the miscreants from fleeing. The neighbourhood was awake after midnight to witness the action and heaved a sigh of relief when it ended around 3.30 am. Police said a tenant and care-taker were also living in Vijay's house. But the tenant had gone to his village a few days ago. On Monday night, the care-taker had also gone to his native place. Vijay's two sisters Poonam and Preeti live in the Barra area of the city. The keys of the house remain with both of them. The police called them immediately to cross- check the belongings. "Overwhelmed by the quick response, the family from New Jersey America thanked the Kanpur Police," Inspector Chakeri police station Mishra said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/man-in-us-watches-burglary-live-at-his-kanpur-house-alerts-policemen/articleshow/88983663.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Patna||Amid rumours, Bihar deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad denies any move to amend liquor law||PATNA: Amid rumours of a move for fresh amendment in the provisions of the prohibition law that is caught in crossfires in the wake of frequent hooch deaths, the main opposition party, RJD, on Tuesday claimed that it would move a no-confidence motion against the government in the budget session if the proposed amendments are not in the interest of the people or in tune with its principles. The last amendment to the prohibition law was made in 2018 to set free a person caught drinking liquor for the first time on the payment of a fine of Rs50,000. However, it was put in abeyance. As per the new unconfirmed reports, the proposed amendments have been mooted by the state excise and prohibition department and sent to the home department for clearance to pave the way for its scrutiny and final approval by the law department. Subsequently, it will get the cabinet nod for the amendment in the coming budget session. However, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad on Tuesday denied any such proposal. “There is no proposal at the level of the NDA for an amendment to the prohibition law. The entire NDA is united in favour of it,” Prasad told mediapersons, almost reversing the stand of state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, who had called for a review of its provisions. When reminded of the demand by Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi for its review, Prasad said, “He is like our guardian and his party is also an important component of the NDA. What he has said is a suggestion.” Incidentally, in the light of the unconfirmed reports regarding the government’s likely move, HAM(S)spokesman Danish Rizwan said that the amendments sought to be made should first be discussed in the public and, if people favour, the law should be repealed. As for the RJD, its senior MLA Bhai Birendra also took a relatively strong line. “If the amendments proposed are not in the interest of the people or in tune with our party’s principles, then we will bring a no-confidence motion against the government,” he said. It immediately put the BJP and the JD(U) on the offensive. BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi challenged the RJD to announce that it will repeal the prohibition law. JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar also said: “I don’t know what they (read RJD) will do in the future. They should bring a no-confidence motion against the prohibition law itself, asking for its repeal. Then, they will come to know what people think about the law.” Meanwhile, it is being said that the likely amendments are meant to address the concerns of the Supreme Court and the high court regarding the dramatic increase in the liquor-related cases pending in the state courts. The apex court has already observed that the laws were made without anticipating the additional side-effects in the future and, therefore, the prohibition law had practically resulted in sheer wastage of time of the courts in attending to hearing the bail petitions, besides incarceration of people under various provisions whose number has gone up and is beyond the capacity of the jails in the state to hold. As per the rumours, the government is mulling over dividing the offences in two groups – ordinary (liquor consumers, that pertain to the drunk or those caught drinking) and serious offences (liquor manufacturer, hoarder, distributor, supplier). Further, the provision regarding the vehicle seizure will also be attended to by letting them to be released on the payment of a fine to be fixed. Similarly, provision will be made to let off persons accused of ordinary offences after the payment of fine, which, in turn, is expected to bring down the number of liquor-related cases by 40% of the total. However, the common point on which both the ruling and opposition parties have hammered on is that those arrested and charged for committing crime are poor and the majority of them also belong to the poorer sections. Therefore, the quantum of fine to be fixed will be an additional vexatious problem, it is being felt.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/amid-rumours-dy-cm-denies-any-move-to-amend-liquor-law/articleshow/88983875.cms||Abhay Singh
