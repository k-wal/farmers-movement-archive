A total of 351 positive cases were detected on Monday, which is almost 200 more than 156 positive cases reported the previous day. Amid Omicron scare, testing was increased to 36,613 on Monday and the positivity rate has scaled up to 0.96 per cent from Sunday’s 0.79 per cent. In Kamrup (Metro) district alone, 164 positive cases were detected on Monday even as foreign travellers coming to Assam for New Year celebrations, along with tourists, have emerged as a major concern. While 29 foreign travellers tested Covid positive in Assam between December 1 and 30, the number of positive cases among international fliers has suddenly gone up to 47 in just about the last three days. On Monday, the first foreign traveller, found entering through the rail route, tested Covid positive. The passenger arrived in New Delhi from Dubai by air but boarded a train to reach Guwahati. “If anyone is found Omicron positive, the biggest challenge will be to isolate and test the passengers who travelled along with any such positive case. Tracking both fellow travellers on flights and trains is going to be very difficult as compilation of whole genome sequencing reports, which is necessary to confirm Omicron, is taking several days,” a health department’s surveillance official said. Samples of positive cases among travellers are being sent to the North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) at Jorhat in upper Assam for genome sequencing. Till Sunday evening, a total of 2,837 foreign passengers entered the state and the number is expected to go up further in January when Magh Bihu, one of the biggest festivals of the state, will be celebrated. “Many international fliers have come as tourists who will be back soon,” the official added. Notably, 28 provisional “Omicron positive” cases have already been detected through in-house developed Omicron detection kits at ICMR-RMRC, Lahowal, in Dibrugarh district. These are Covid cases, which includes domestic and foreign travellers , who mostly arrived in upper Assam districts. However, the NEIST is yet to confirm any of the samples sent from Lahowal as Omicron positive after whole genome sequencing. “Without confirmation through whole genome sequencing, the state health department won’t declare any case as Omicron positive,” a health department official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/surge-in-infection-assam-covid-19-cases-double-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88674282.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Parray from Hajin in north Kashmir's Bandipora was one the most-wanted terrorists associated with the group led by Burhan Wani, whose killing in a 2016 anti-terrorism operation triggered widespread public unrest in the Valley. Kashmir range IGP Vijay Kumar said the Parray’s death was a big success for security forces as he was involved in the murder of a dozen people in 2016, the year he became active as a Lashkar operative and came to be identified as a dreaded throat-slitter. Parray committed more murders in the subsequent years—including that of the Dar brothers Bashir and Ghulam, and Hilal Ahmad Parray, all in Hajin in May 2018. The other LeT terrorist killed in Monday’s operation was identified as Hafiz alias Hamza of Pakistan. He had killed two policemen in Bandipora in December 2021 and then shifted to the Harwan neighbourhood of Srinagar, the IGP said. The officer said a team of Srinagar police and CRPF cornered Parray during a search in Shalimar, well-known for the Mughal Garden on the outskirts of Srinagar. He fired at the security forces and got killed in return fire. Soon after, another operation was carried out by police, CRPF and Army personnel in the Gusu area of Shalimar and terrorist Hamza of Pakistan was gunned down. Parray was known for his ruthlessness, abducting civilians he suspected to be police informers. They were often tortured to death. “He was involved in slitting the throats of many civilians in Hajin. He provided logistic support to terrorists operating in the area,” the IGP said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/let-commander-known-as-throat-slitter-among-two-terrorists-killed-in-srinagar/articleshow/88674298.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||UK PIO woman becomes first ‘woman of colour’ to make solo trip to South Pole||LONDON: A British-born Indian Sikh woman has made history by becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo expedition to the South Pole. Captain Harpreet Chandi (32), from Derby, reached the South Pole on Monday, the 40th day of her unsupported 700-mile trek across the Antarctic wilderness in temperatures of up to -50 degrees Celsius and wind speeds of up to 60 mph. Chandi, who named herself "Polar Preet" for the trek and is a physiotherapist in the British Army, said in an audio blog after arriving: "I made it to the South Pole where it is snowing. It feels so surreal to finally be here. This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves without being labelled a rebel. I have been told ‘No’ on many occasions and told to just do the normal thing. I don’t want to just break the glass ceiling. I want to smash it into a million pieces." UK defence secretary Ben Wallace congratulated her, saying "her history-making expedition is an inspiration to all of us and a phenomenal achievement". Chandi joined the Army Reserves when she was 19 and joined the regular Army about six years ago having never camped in her life. She began the journey on November 24 from Hercules Inlet after being dropped off by a Twin Otter plane. She travelled with a pulk (Nordic small sled) carrying a cooker and freeze-dried meals weighing 87 kg without any resupply. Every day she skied for up to 11 hours per day, wearing carpet-like material on the bottom of her skis to help her grip the snow, and each night put up a tent, melted snow to drink, and cooked dishes like pork pasta. She sometimes fell on icy terrain and on Boxing Day vomited and had diarrhoea. Some days she had a "whiteout", and she did not see anyone for days on end. Bhangra music by the likes of Diljit Dosanjh and Jay Sean, audio books as well as listening to 45 voice notes she had stored on her phone from friends, and daydreaming about her upcoming wedding to partner David, kept her going. She wore a rakhi tied on her by her two elder brothers for protection, a reminder "to anyone that it is okay to change traditions". In her blogposts she often reflected on her life. "It can often be those closest to us that hold us back. I am often called a rebel for doing things out of the norm, for pushing my boundaries," she said. Listening to Bhangra "made me think of my Punjabi roots and all of the things I love about them", she said. She explained how she used to be embarrassed about her Indian roots — "having eggs thrown at me and people spit at me when I was a teenager because I looked different," she said. "It took me a while to appreciate my culture and my roots, so when I describe myself as a ‘woman of colour’ it is because I am finally proud of my skin colour, my roots, my culture. Having been told on many occasions that I don’t look like a polar explorer… let’s change the image you expect to see." One of her blogs is dedicated to her grandfather who moved to the UK when she was born and raised her. "He always made me feel just as important in a community where I sometimes felt as though I was less. I always used to think he looked like an Indian Santa Claus," she said. She also commented on how many people from the Indian community thought she was going to Southall. "I can still imagine them thinking why I’m making such a big deal about heading to Southall. I think it might be just a little bit colder here," she said. Her preparation included various extensive training exercises, such as dragging tyres, and earlier in the year she headed to Greenland for a warm-up expedition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pio-woman-becomes-first-woman-of-colour-to-make-solo-trip-to-south-pole/articleshow/88674372.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Appreciating their contribution as members of surveillance committees during the Covid peak, Adityanath said for the entire coronavirus-affected period from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022, every anganwadi worker and mini anganwadi worker would get an additional monthly encouragement allowance of Rs 500 and helpers Rs 250. "Anganwadi workers gave their services diligently during the peak of Covid-19 peak, and because of their efforts, the most populous state contained the spread efficiently," the chief minister said, addressing a convention of anganwadi workers. He also laid the the foundation stone for anganwadi centres among others. "At present, 3,06,829 anganwadi workers, mini anganwadi workers and helpers are serving in the state. All have been equipped with smartphones, growth monitoring devices etc. Departmental training is also being conducted," he said. The chief minister said with the combined efforts of the state and the central governments' performance-linked incentives, anganwadi workers will now be getting Rs 8,000 per month instead of Rs 5,500, mini anganwadi workers Rs 6,500 instead of Rs 4,250 and helpers Rs 4,000 instead of Rs 2,750.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/contribution-of-anganwadi-workers-in-providing-basic-healthcare-unparalleled-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/88674377.cms||---
---||India||Pakistan intruder shot dead along international border in Jammu and Kashmir's Arnia, infiltration bid foiled along LoC in Rajouri||JAMMU: BSF troops early Monday killed a Pakistani intruder trying to breach the international border in Jammu’s Arnia sector, a day after the Army foiled an attempt by the Pakistani military’s Border Action Team (BAT) to push a terrorist into India and gunned him down in the Keran sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Another infiltration attempt by a group of terrorists was thwarted by the Army late Sunday along the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district’s Bhimber Gali sector, confirmed Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand on Monday. Later in the day, BSF personnel foiled a narco-terrorism bid by recovering a huge cache of arms and ammunition — three AK rifles along with five magazines, four pistols with seven magazines, 14 rounds of AK-47, seven 9mm ball rounds — as well five packets of heroin from Chamliyal border outpost area in Jammu’s Ramgarh sector, said a BSF spokesperson. On Monday morning, BSF troops manning the international border noticed suspicious movement near the fence from the Pakistan side of the border near Bhule Chak post, BSF sources said. “Despite several warnings, the suspect continued to venture close to the fence and tried to sneak into the Indian territory. He was subsequently shot dead,” said a source, adding: “The intruder’s body is still lying close to the border.” Meanwhile, confirming the infiltration attempt along the LoC, Lt Col Anand said: “Around 8.30pm on January 2 (Sunday), a group of Pakistani terrorists were seen trying to infiltrate through the Bhimber Gali sector in Hamirpur area. Our troops foiled the bid and a subsequent search led to the recovery of ammunition and Pakistani currency left behind by the group.” Official sources said soldiers posted in the forward area noticed the terrorists who were challenged with an explosion triggered on the spot. “Following this, the infiltrators returned to the other side,” said a source. Later on Monday, BSF troops patrolling in the Chamliyal border outpost area found a white gunny bag hidden in wild grass, in which the arms and ammunition, and heroin packets were found. The bag had the markings of a Pakistan-based fertiliser company, said the spokesperson. On New Year’s Day, an Army stake-out along the LoC spotted the terrorist in a Pathani suit and black jacket. Armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, he was trying to break into India through the anti-infiltration obstacle system across the border. Ambushes were laid along routes the intruder was likely to take and he eventually fell into one. The route he took was similar to the one taken by infiltrators “on April 4, 2020, during Operation Rangadori Bhaikh in which five terrorists were eliminated,” the Army said in a statement on Sunday. The Army could make out that it was a BAT operation as a “search of the belongings — an AK-47, seven grenades, ammunition, ration suited for a long haul in cold weather, certificates and a photo that showed him in army uniform with the name tab — revealed a Pakistani identity card and vaccination certificates (issued by ministry of national health services regulation and coordination of Pakistan) that identified him as Mohammed Shabir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform wearing the name tab of Shabbir.” This “establishes that Pakistan continues to sponsor cross-border militancy”, the Army said. BAT comprises military regulars and mercenaries from terrorist groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). They carry out surprise attacks on Indian positions along the LoC. Last month, BSF troops had shot dead a Pakistani woman intruder along the international border near Khuralla post in Jammu’s R S Pura sector. On October 7 last year, BSF had foiled a bid to smuggle weapons from Pakistan into the Samba sector by recovering four pistols, eight magazines and 232 rounds of ammunition. On September 27, 2021, BSF thwarted another narco-terrorism bid in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector and recovered a huge cache of arms, ammunition, narcotics and fake Indian currency amounting to Rs 2,75,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-intruder-shot-dead-along-international-border-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-arnia-infiltration-bid-foiled-along-loc-in-rajouri/articleshow/88674431.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Apple's shares have climbed around 5,800% since co-founder and former Chief Executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in January 2007, far outpacing the S&P 500's gain of about 230% during the same period. Microsoft and Amazon have each briefly eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company in the past three years, although Apple has recently pulled ahead. Microsoft's stock market value currently stands at about $2.5 trillion, while Amazon's is at around $1.7 trillion, having fallen behind Alphabet, now at $1.9 trillion. Several Big Tech firms saw their shares outperform Apple's 2021 gain of 34%. Microsoft and Tesla both rallied about 50% in 2021, while Alphabet jumped 65% and Nvidia soared 125%, putting the chipmaker's stock market value at over $700 billion. Apple now accounts for about 7% of the S&P 500, up from as little as 5% in June and back in line with where it started 2021. Following its 2.9% gain on Monday afternoon, Apple is trading at about 30 times its expected 12-month earnings, down from a multiple of 32 in early 2021 but still at highs not seen since 2008, according to Refinitiv data. As Apple's stock has climbed in the past several months, so have analysts' price targets. J.P.Morgan and BofA Global Research in December each raised their price targets for Apple's stock to a street high of $210, according to Refinitiv. That price target would put Apple's market capitalization at about $3.45 trillion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apples-3-trillion-market-value-follows-5800-gain-since-iphone-debut/articleshow/88674605.cms||---

Vaccination of the 15-18 cohort accounted for around 42% of the total doses administered till 10pm. The highest number of youngsters — over 7.7 lakh — turned up for vaccination in Madhya Pradesh, followed by Gujarat with a footfall of over 5.6 lakh, Andhra Pradesh (4.9 lakh), Karnataka (4.1 lakh) and Rajasthan (3.6 lakh). Among bigger states, Uttar Pradesh administered only 1.7 lakh doses. The Centre has asked UP to ramp up vaccination coverage among adults too in view of the approaching polls. Among other major states, Bihar vaccinated 1.7 lakh adolescents, Maharashtra 1.8 lakh, Tamil Nadu 1.9 lakh and West Bengal around 1 lakh on the first day of the rollout of the programme. In Delhi, 21,010 teens received the shots till 10pm. Registrations in the 15-18 category, which opened from January 1, jumped to around 53.6 lakh from nearly 8 lakh till Sunday. As walk-ins were allowed, most children were registered on-site. Health ministry projections put the number of teens in the 15-18 age bracket at 7.4 crore. With the Centre asking states to organise separate sessions for vaccinating these children to avoid any mixing of vaccines meant for adults, a total of more than 1.12 lakh sites administered the shots on Monday. These included sites that catered to adults as well. India is currently using only domestically-made Covaxin for inoculating children. Clarifying some reports alleging that expired vaccines are being administered in India under its national Covid-19 vaccination programme, the government said: “The shelf life of vaccines is extended by the national regulator based on comprehensive analysis and examination of stability study data furnished by the vaccine manufacturers.” The drug regulator had on October 25 last year approved the extension of shelf life of Covaxin from 9 to 12 months. Similarly, the shelf life of Covishield was increased from 6 to 9 months on February 22, 2021. The decision to prioritise vaccination in this age category of children is driven by the fact that almost 75% of deaths in children due to Covid-19 so far has happened in this age group. The government’s experts also took into account the advent of the more transmissible Omicron, which raises the risk of older children, fairly mobile now, bringing the disease home to the more vulnerable elderly family members. It was also felt that vaccinations will reassure parents worried about sending children to regular school. Vaccination of adolescents is expected to help normalisation of education and also reduce the risk of transmission through them. While younger children are likely to have better immunity against Covid-19 than adults, it is expected that the government will gradually expand vaccination to cover all age groups. Overall, India has administered over 146 crore doses so far. While more than 90% of the adult population has received at least one dose, around 65% have got fully vaccinated.

The reversal of foreign fund selling in the last few days, due to the ongoing holiday season in most developed markets, also helped the rally, market players said. The day’s session saw banking & financials and metal stocks lead the rally while healthcare stocks, despite the rising uncertainty because of the spread of the Omicron variant, witnessed selling pressure. As a result, BSE’s financial, banking and metal indices, all closed with gains of over 2% while the healthcare index closed marginally lower. According to Rahul Sharma of Equity99 Advisors, the expectation on the street is that the positive momentum would continue for a while. “However, investors are advised to keep some capital aside to take advantage of any major dips considering the rising Omicron infections. The pharma sector could be a great bet looking at the current scenario,” he said. The day’s session also made investors richer by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalization now at Rs 272.5 lakh crore. In the near term, the stock market is expected to witness some up move, supported mainly by local investors, both institutional and individual, but a definitive trend would emerge from the third week of the month, market players said. This is because that’s when most foreign fund managers would resume after their new year break. That would also be the time when leading Indian companies would start announcing their quarter results. In a surprising move, TCS, Infosys and Wipro, all three among the largest software exporters from India, would announce their quarterly results on the same day, on January 12. HCL Technologies, another leading software exporter, would announce its results on January 14. The results season will kick off with Q3 results from Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) on January 8, data from BSE showed. As it happens during the announcement of quarterly results, to some extent, this time too financial numbers from leading companies would impact investor sentiment on D Street, dealers said. The recent reversal in selling by foreign portfolio investors has also helped the Indian currency. From a multi-month low at about 76 to a dollar level in early December, the rupee on Monday closed at 74.26 to a dollar. In the bond market too, despite RBI’s recent decision to cancel some of its borrowing plans through government securities, the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts is hovering around the 6.45% level. On Monday, the yield closed at 6.46%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-starts-2022-with-a-bang-gains-929-points-to-59000/articleshow/88675184.cms||---

The department of personnel and training on Monday evening appointed Mittal to the post, 72 hours after it fell vacant when Subhash Kumar, who too held the charge since February 2021 in addition to his regular job as director (finance), retired on December 31. Mittal, currently the director (HR), has been appointed for six months, or till a regular chairperson is appointed, whichever is earlier. But yet, her ascent to the corner office in ONGC signifies increasing diversity in the ‘macho’ oil and gas industry that still remains one of the last bastions of male dominance. A postgraduate in economics and a doctorate in commerce, Mittal had broken the glass ceiling in ONGC by becoming the first woman to join the company’s board on November 27, 2018. She played a leading role in ensuring a safe working environment for 27,000-strong employees and thousands of contract workers, notably women employees and engineers deployed on offshore platforms and remote locations, to ensure uninterrupted operations through the pandemic. Her appointment comes at a time when ONGC is under pressure to monetise major producing fields by inducting private partners – ostensibly to induct technology and raise output. With long experience as the head of skill development in ONGC before becoming director, Mittal’s appointment coincides with the Modi government’s focus on skilling, creating conducive environment at workplace for women and improving corporate governance. With a penchant for training and mentoring, Mittal introduced a number of programmes to nurture talent and upskill the large workforce of ONGC, especially women. Before becoming director (HR) Mittal had trained more than 11,000 graduate trainees of ONGC since 2001 on corporate governance as part of their induction programme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/alka-mittal-first-woman-to-head-oil-giant-ongc/articleshow/88675288.cms||---

The meeting was attended by the heads of central intelligence agencies, central armed police forces, intelligence wings of the armed forces, and revenue and financial intelligence agencies. The police chiefs of all states and UTs joined the meeting via video-conferencing. Shah highlighted continuing threats of terror, particularly from global terror groups; terror financing; narco-terrorism; organised crime-terror nexus; illicit use of cyber space and movement of foreign terrorists among the major security challenges before the country and stressed on the need for better coordination and synergy among the central and state security agencies to counter the challenges. Senior officers indicated that the purpose behind Monday’s meeting was to have a regular interaction and sharing of information among the heads of central and state agencies engaged in handling various aspects of national security, as desired by the home minister. Institutionalisation of such discussions for assessing threats to national security and using the forum to share inputs is expected to enhance the quality of response of law enforcement, an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-reviews-threats-to-national-security-with-intelligence-and-police-brass/articleshow/88675418.cms||Bharti Jain

Over a dozen companies, including Hetero, Sun Pharma, Natco and Dr Reddy’s are in the process of rolling out the oral therapy developed by Merck and and its partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, at prices ranging between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 for the complete treatment, sources told TOI. The antiviral pill is being considered a potential gamechanger globally in Covid treatment as remdesivir used till now is administered intravenously, and in hospital settings. Mankind Pharma, which has tied up with BDR Pharmaceuticals. introduced its antiviral Molulife (200 mg) in Delhi and certain other parts of the country on Monday, a company official said. Further, Sun Pharma has priced the antiviral at around Rs 1,500 for the full course, and is making its ‘Molxvir’ available in markets where there are more cases, and gradually across India. The recommended dose of molnupiravir is 800 mg twice a day for five days. Given the stiff competition among the market players, the treatment cost will remain competitive and affordable for patients, experts said. Molnupiravir, is also the first oral anti-Covid pill approved by UK’s drug regulator, while recently the US Food and Drug Administration cleared it for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults, and for those who are at a high risk for progression to severe disease, including hospitalisation or death. Post the USFDA nod, Drugs Controller General of India granted permission for restricted use of molnupiravir for treatment of adult patients with SpO2 93%, and who have high risk of progression of the disease. Earlier in June, MSD signed licensing agreements with five generic companies including Sun Pharma, Cipla, Torrent, Emcure and Dr Reddy’s to manufacture and supply molnupiravir in India, and to over 100 low and middle-income countries.

Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is currently the only vaccine that has been included in the country’s vaccination programme for those aged 15 to 18 years. “The issue prevailed temporarily for an hour or two following the update of the CoWIN portal, as many scrambled to book the online slots. This led to some initial chaos and confusion at some centres on Monday. However, the glitch was resolved soon over the later part of the day,” Maharashtra immunisation officer Sachin Desai said. The glitch became evident soon after the online booking was made open for the public. “When people saw an online booking for Covishield, they booked the slot in a hurry and turned up to take the shot at the centres on Monday. They were told to book the slot again for Covaxin, as the problem was resolved immediately. Some of them who had inadvertently booked the slot for Covishield were given the Covaxin shot on the spot,” said Pune Municipal Corporation’s chief immunisation officer Suryakant Devkar. An official of the Union health ministry said, “The glitch stemmed from CoWIN’s update process and was immediately taken care of.” On December 27, the Centre had said beneficiaries aged between 15 and 18 years could self-register for vaccination through an existing account on CoWIN. They can also create a new account through a unique mobile number. People in this age group can also be registered on-site by the verifier or person administering the vaccine. They can book appointments online as well as at the vaccination centres. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya has advised states and Union Territories to provide separate vaccination centres, session sites, queues and different inoculation teams for the 15-18 years age group to avoid mixing up of vaccines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covishield-for-teens-on-cowin-sparks-some-confusion/articleshow/88675599.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Last month, the BMC had submitted that it hasn’t taken over a portion of land from Pratiksha bungalow plot as it does not have a contractor in place for the road-widening project. It has said that it would raze the compound wall and acquire the land in the next financial year when a road contractor is appointed for the purpose. In his order, Justice Kanade said: “In my view, the reason given by the BMC for not carrying out the demolition doesn’t appear to be correct. Whenever a road-widening project is undertaken, adequate budgetary provision is made by the BMC for implementation. It is obvious that the BMC is delaying the demolition of the boundary wall...by giving lame excuses. It is a matter of common knowledge that after May 30, no demolition work is carried out during monsoon. The work, therefore, would be delayed by at least one more year.” In 2017, the actor had been asked to surrender a portion of the land from Pratiksha, off Linking Road in Juhu, along with owners of neighbouring plots, to reduce traffic in the lane leading from Pratiksha towards ISKCON temple. The BMC will take the compound portion of the structures and widen Sant Dnyaneshwar Road from 40ft to 60ft.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bmc-delaying-razing-wall-of-bachchan-home-lokayukta/articleshow/88675638.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Gyanendra Singh Malik, a junior warrant officer in the IAF, told TOI that Anglo-Eastern, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, claimed his son, Shivam Malik, had committed suicide, but the postmortem conducted in India made it clear that “he was murdered”. In a letter to the family, Anglo-Eastern had said that “the ship’s staff found third officer Shivam Malik hanging in the bow thruster room” of MT Shangdone Zihe on October 1 en route to Gibraltar (a British overseas territory and headland on Spain’s south coast). “Shivam Malik was given immediate medical assistance, including CPR. However, despite the best efforts of the ship staff, he could not be revived and doctors from CIRM (which provides medical assistance to seafarers) confirmed that he had passed away,” the letter stated. After receiving Shivam’s body in India on October 23 22 days after his death, Malik, currently posted at the IAF base in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar, had a postmortem done by the local authorities in Ghaziabad. Malik told TOI that the examination contradicted the shipping company’s claims. The autopsy report, a copy of which is with TOI, says, “Hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage were fractured. Trachea rings were fractured and trachea was congested. The cause of death is asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem strangulation.” Filing a police complaint, Malik claimed that “during a WhatsApp call on September 21 last year”, Shivam had claimed that he had overheard some ship officials discussing the smuggling of a drugs and weapons consignment and had confronted him when they saw him in the galley. TOI made several calls to Rejish Chacko, welfare officer, at Anglo-Eastern’s Mumbai office but the phone remained unreachable. In a video posted on social media, Shivam’s sister Anchal, who runs a marketing company, claimed that the postmortem examination showed that strangulation as the cause of death. “There were also injury marks on his cheeks and nose and a bone near the neck was fractured,” she alleged. Anchal described Shivam as a cheerful boy with plans about marriage and house purchase. She said that since the family was financially stable, her brother had no reason for ending his life. The sister said though the external affairs ministry had assisted in expediting the repatriation of the body, the family wanted the Union shipping ministry and the central government to initiate a fair probe into his death. “We don’t want compensation, only tough action against the company and the guilty officials,” Anchal told TOI. All India Seafarers Union, which took up the cause of the family, is providing it all support in its “fight for justice”. In fact, union working president Abhijeet Sangle said that the union had been approaching different authorities since the death of Shivam was reported in October to get back his body and now to seek the truth behind his death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-man-says-his-sailor-son-was-killed-rubbishes-suicide-claim-files-complaint-against-shipping-firm/articleshow/88675691.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Maharashtra moves coal ministry to get forest clearance for Chhattisgarh block||NEW DELHI: Maharashtra has sought the coal ministry’s intervention in getting forest clearance for the Chhattisgarh government coal block allotted to its power stations in the Vidarbha region, becoming the second state to knock on the Centre’s doors over mining hurdles in a state that has the country’s third-largest coal deposits. MAHAGENCO (Maharashtra State Power Generation Company) MD Sanjay Khandare last week wrote to coal secretary Anil Jain, saying the utility had fulfilled the conditions for forest diversion for the Gare Palma-II coal block in October 2021 but the state government was yet to send its recommendation for Stage-I forest clearance to the Centre. Khandare requested the ministry to intervene in the matter as an early clearance was important to start production from the block, located in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, by October 2023 deadline. This the second instance of delays being faced by coal block owners in Chattisgarh. As first reported by TOI, Rajasthan was the first to knock on the Centre’s doors over Chhattisgarh government delaying clearances for starting two new mines and ramping up production from two others allotted to Rajasthan. As both states have the Congress in office, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot escalated the matter to party president Sonia Gandhi after his letters to Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel seeking prompt action went unheeded. The Gare Palma-II block was awarded in August 2015 to MAHAGENCO for fuelling the Koradi, Chandrapur-8 power plants, the largest generation complex in the state’s Vidarbha region. The block has peak annual production capacity of over 23 million tonne. MAHAGENCO had applied for forest clearance in 2016 for 214 hectares of forest land. But the application could not be processed due to unavailability of government land for compensatory afforestation. The utility reworked the mine boundary, obtained private land for afforestation and submitted the details to the district forest authorities in September last year. The district authorities cleared the forest diversion proposal and forwarded it to the state government in October for recommending Stage-I approval to the Union forest and environment ministry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-moves-coal-ministry-to-get-forest-clearance-for-chhattisgarh-block/articleshow/88675684.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||SC nod to urgent hearing in EWS quota criteria case||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday acceded to Centre’s request for urgent hearing on petitions challenging the validity of criteria for 10% Economically Weaker Section quota, judicial proceedings over which has held up admissions to PG medical seats leading to agitation by students. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta infomed a bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud that the committee headed by ex-finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, which was tasked to revisit the criteria for candidate’s inclusion in EWS category, has already submitted its recommendations and that the Centre has filed the report before the court. Justice Chandrachud said the matter would be required to be heard by a bench also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, the latter two sitting in different compositions during first week of New Year, when the court is scheduled to hear fresh cases. Justice Chandrachud told Mehta that he would consult CJI and that there would be an endeavour to get EWS quota case listed for hearing this week. The Centre on Sunday filed an affidavit in SC saying it would stick to the Rs 8 lakh annual income limit criteria for categorisation of EWS sections, entitled to 10% reservation in admissions to educational institutions, including medical colleges, and government jobs, but promised to tweak other EWS criteria a bit from next year. The government said it has accepted the Pandey Committee report, which recommended continuance of Rs 8 lakh income limit with riders, after a detailed analysis of the criteria and differentiated it from the income criteria adopted to disentitle creamy layer among OBCs for quotas. The committee said the “EWS may, however exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has 5 acres of agricultural land and above (as was included in the 2019 criteria which was challenged in the SC).” The change from the 2019 EWS norms would be exclusion of residential assets criteria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-nod-to-urgent-hearing-in-ews-quota-criteria-case/articleshow/88675712.cms||---

By late Monday night, the day’s case count stood at 35,565, with data from three states not yet available. Based on the trends of the last few days, the final tally is likely to be at least 36,500. The previous time the country had recorded a higher single-day case count was on September 10 last year, when over 37,868 cases were reported, as per TOI’s Covid database. Daily cases invariably dip on Mondays due to lower testing and detections over the weekend. This is the first time in over four months that the case count has defied this trend. The last time this happened was on August 23. Cases had risen on that Monday because of a huge dip the day before due to the Rakshabandhan festival. This Monday, the national test positivity rate (TPR) jumped to over 4.15%, from 3.11% a day earlier, as the number of tests fell by nearly 20% on Sunday to around 8.9 lakh. Monday was the seventh consecutive day of rising cases in the country. During this period, infections have risen nearly six times, up from 6,242 cases last Monday. Maharashtra continued to post the highest number of daily cases among states, with 12,160 new infections detected on Monday, a slight rise from the previous day’s tally of 11,877. Mumbai logged 7,928 cases, a slight drop from Sunday’s number. Bengal posted 6,078 new cases, a marginal drop from the previous day's count of 6,153. With reduced testing, the state's TPR zoomed to 19.59% from 15.93% on Sunday. Goa reported an even higher TPR of 26.43%, rising nearly 16 percentage points in a day as cases surged from 388 on Sunday to 631. Delhi cases numbers spiked to 4,099, up 28% from the previous day's tally of 3,194. Amid these soaring numbers, the death toll from the virus has not been rising much. India recorded 77 deaths on Monday, a marginal increase from 58 on the preceding day. Taking old deaths reported on Monday into account, the toll rose by 118, with data from three states yet to be counted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-monday-dip-india-records-36000-covid-cases-a-115-day-high/articleshow/88675772.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

---||India||States reimpose curbs, but most CMs rule out total lockdown||RANCHI: Jharkhand brought back pandemic restrictions on Monday by closing educational institutes, parks, tourist spots, gyms and swimming pools till January 15 as administrators of several states considered making real-time adjustments in response to soaring coronavirus infections and the threat from the Omicron variant. Schools and junior colleges in Mumbai too were directed to shut in-person teaching for Class I to XI till January-end. For Class X to XII, the hybrid mode can continue. Maharashtra has not come out with any fresh guidelines for schools. The Jharkhand government, however, decided against a night curfew. The new curbs will not affect temples and religious places outside containment zones. Shops and markets, except restaurants, bars and medical shops, will close at 8pm. Cinema halls, restaurants and shopping malls cannot take more than 50% of their seating capacity. In Karnataka, the state government is likely to continue with the night curfew beyond January 7 and is also considering more containment measures. Most states are signaling a need to stay flexible. Chattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel said on Monday that a third wave is imminent, but imposing a lockdown would be the last option. In Goa, where the tourist season is at its peak, CM Pramod Sawant said his government is considering imposing night curfew.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-reimpose-curbs-but-most-cms-rule-out-total-lockdown/articleshow/88675986.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Minister, MP clash on stage as CM Basavaraj Bommai looks on||BENGALURU: State higher education and IT-BT minister CN Ashwath Narayan and Congress MP from Bengaluru Rural DK Suresh on Monday came close to blows in public even as CM Basavaraj Bommai, who shared the dais with them, remained a silent spectator. The spat took place at a function organised to unveil statues of BR Ambedkar and Bengaluru founder Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda in Ramanagara, about 50km from here. The ruckus began when Bommai and Ashwath Narayan took along Ramanagara MLA Anitha Kumaraswamy (JDS), allegedly ignoring Suresh, whose supporters resorted to continuous sloganeering against the government.Narayan indirectly mocked the DK brothers, calling them "self-serving" politicians. "If you are a man, show it in your work. No one has done development. It is the BJP government which is doing development. The one who serves people is a nayaka (leader). What do you call the one who serves his self-interest?,'' he said, as the crowd screamed a derogatory word. An irked Suresh, brother of state Congress president DK Shivakumar, got up from his seat and rushed to Ashwath Narayan. They almost came to blows even as police tried to stop them. Suresh was joined by his relative and Congress MLC S Ravi who snatched the mike from Narayan. The situation was brought under control by police and others on the dais. "What is your contribution to the district's development?" Suresh asked Narayan. Suresh and Ravi squatted on the stage, while his supporters protested at the venue and on the streets. Bommai urged both of them to calm down. "I have come here to contribute to the development of the district. It is possible only when everybody joins hands," he said, urging people not to mix politics with development. He also assured that in two months, he would lay the foundation stone for the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) at Ramanagara. This was one issue that triggered the fight. After the programme, Congress workers tore the banner and pictures of Narayan in the town. BJP workers also protested in front of the DC's office. Home minister Araga Jnanendra condemned the incident and said he had sought a police report. "I strongly condemn the uncivilised conduct of Congress workers at Ramanagara. This cannot be tolerated," he said. Public Clash* I came here with hope as Ramanagara has everything it takes to be a model district as it's close to the state capital. I urge all parties to work towards development of the state for 59 months and play politics only during the last month of our tenure. This is not an election year. Ghoda hai, maidan hai (there is a ground, there are horses) should not be our attitude. Basavaraj Bommai | chief minister * During Ashwath Narayan's speech, I intervened to remind him not to make a political speech as it was a government programme. Both leaders' behaviour was condemnable. Anitha Kumaraswamy | Ramanagara MLA * I developed Ramanagara, and today two people are fighting to take credit. Both BJP and Congress stalled all projects that I initiated in the district in 2006. The Congress is nurturing goonda culture in our district. What happened today is a warning bell and a glimpse into what's in store if people vote for Congress. H D Kumaraswamy | Former chief minister * The speech by Ashwath Narayan is shameful. His statements showed lack of political maturity to handle a government event in the presence of a chief minister. This is a conspiracy by some BJP leaders to remove Basavaraj Bommai D K Shivakumar | KPCC president * The high-handed behaviour of Congress leaders is highly condemnable. The action by Congress MP DK Suresh and Congress MLC S Ravi is extremely shameful and we condemn it. This, in the CM's presence shows there is a dearth of wisdom in the Congress.

---||India||Relieved teens vax eloquent about tryst with first jab||NEW DELHI: Being a teenager isn’t easy — from acne to love to studies, life’s a smorgasbord of challenges. Monday may have made living in the time of a pandemic a wee bit easier for the over 40 lakh youngsters between 15 and 18 who got their first jabs against Covid amid a rush of enthusiasm, excitement and relief. “I was so eager to get my vaccine. I had been reading all about it and keeping myself informed,” said Shashank Shenoy of DPS East in Bengaluru, after getting vaxed on campus. “My message to my friends is to get vaccinated as soon as possible as this is the only way we can get the confidence to go out, get back to school and start our lives all over again.” Across government centres and campuses that had organised camps in collaboration with private hospitals in many cities, teenagers came in droves, bantered, took selfies and hashtagged their groupfies on the sidelines of getting jabbed. “This was like a vaccination festival for students. They were happy to be finally getting inoculated and that, too, in their school itself. With the Omicron variant now here, starting vaccinations for adolescents and allowing schools to be ‘self-centres’ was a wise and considerate move,” said Col KR Pratap Singh (retd), chairman of Colonel’s Central Academy in Gurgaon. “It is clear that if nothing major happens, boards are going to be offline. So, there’s clarity among parents and students that by the time (the boards are held), students would be fully vaccinated. So, this is a big psychological relief for us and our parents,” said Abhigyan Singh, a Class XII student. But not every parent seemed eager to get their wards to line up on the first day. In Bhopal, Harish Malviya, the father of a 17-year-old boy, said he chose to postpone his son’s vaccination because his Class 12 board exams would otherwise coincide with his second dose in February. “If he runs a fever for a day or two, he might get distracted. I didn't want to take chances with his studies." Fellow Bhopal resident Akash Bhargava, whose child is in Class 10, said he was “waiting to see the side-effects of vaccination on other children” before taking a call on whether to go ahead with it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relieved-teens-vax-eloquent-about-tryst-with-first-jab/articleshow/88676013.cms||---

This has prompted the state government to consider shortening the mandatory isolation period for infected healthcare workers from 10 days to five, so that they can rejoin work as soon as possible. Even as most infected health workers (doctors, nurses and support staff) have not needed hospitalisatio this time around, officials fear a manpower crunch as infected staff go into isolation. The health department has even asked hospitals to consider reducing planned surgeries in case they have manpower issues because of cluster infections. In the US, which has seen a near-vertical rise in infections over the last few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended reducing the isolation period to five days for those who don’t need hospital care.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/west-bengal-fears-manpower-crisis-as-health-workers-are-hit-may-cut-isolation-period/articleshow/88676055.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||7,500 teenagers get first dose as vax rolled out for 15-plus group in city||Gurgaon: In complete contrast to January 16 last year, when Covid vaccines were first rolled out, inoculation centres saw an overwhelming response from teenagers waiting on Monday as the window opened for Covid shots for the 15-18 age group. Gurgaon had targeted giving 7,700 doses at 77 session sites on Monday and administered 7,527 doses by the end of the day, achieving 98% of its target.Each session site for kids was allocated 100 doses to ensure that social distancing is properly maintained, district immunisation officer MP Singh said. Most sites exhausted their doses by mid-afternoon and teens were requested by vaccinators to return after booking an appointment. The city couldn’t achieve its target as two of its sites in rural areas, Ghangola and Mandpura, witnessed low turnout. In urban areas like Wazirabad, Sohna and sectors 31 and 49, however, long queues were witnessed.On the first day, around 25% of the total doses to be given were pre-booked while the rest were walk-ins. The number of doses per session site is unlikely to be increased because Covaxin is also needed for second doses of the rest of the eligible population.Asked why Gurgaon couldn’t achieve 100% target on the first day, chief medical officer Virender Yadav said, “There were some apprehensions among parents and children on the first day, especially in rural areas of the district, which resulted in lower turnout there. We are changing our strategies now. We will allocate 20% of doses for online appointments and 80% for walk-ins. We have been going door-to-door in rural areas to improve vaccination. The two rural sites have been told to intensify the vaccination drive for children.”The CMO added that they aim to get all children in the 15-18 age group in Gurgaon fully vaccinated by March 31. “We have 1.9 lakh children in this age group. If we have sufficient doses and carry out around 8,000 vaccinations per day for this group alone, we can achieve the target,” he further said.Haryana additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said the state gave 57,755 doses to children on Monday. “We don’t have any supply issue for Covaxin and have enough doses,” he said.Meanwhile, many recipients were excited to get their first dose of Covaxin. At DAV Public School in Sector 49, a waiting area had been set up where parents and their children were seen waiting from early morning on Monday for the drive to start.Gurleen Kaul, a Class 12 student who had turned up at the school in support of her friends, said she has registered for vaccination on Tuesday. “Many of my classmates are getting the jab and I will get it too. My sister, who is in Class 7, will also take the shot when the government allows inoculations for her age group,” she said.Preeti Yadav, a Class 9 student, got inoculated at the government school in Wazirabad. “We often go out and it is risky without vaccination. I have been reading a lot of news online saying children are getting Covid in other countries across the world. I’m happy to finally get the jab,” she said.Manyank Dagar (17), who got inoculated at Sohna government school, said: “I went to a mall on Sunday and I was asked to show my vaccination certificate. I told them that I am 17 and will get vaccinated on Monday. Now, vaccination is compulsory at several places. So, I decided to get inoculated on the first day.”Some of the schools have called students on a class-wise basis so that vaccinations are conducted smoothly and crowding in the premises is avoided. The Daultabad government senior secondary school (GSSS) began vaccinations with only students of classes 9 and 10, while at the Sirhaul GSSS, students of classes 10 and 12 were the first to take the doses.Anju Paruthi, principal of the Daultabad school, said: “We held counselling sessions two days ago to allay the students’ concerns and encourage them to get themselves vaccinated.”Students made the most of the day by clicking selfies after vaccination and enjoying the company of their friends. Many teenagers, however, were left disappointed as they couldn’t get the jab. At Surat Nagar, vaccinators had to turn away several children as they had exhausted the doses reserved for walk-in recipients. Parul Verma, (17), a student of the Government Girl’s College, Sector 14, said: “I was looking forward to getting vaccinated on Monday, but it was disappointing as I couldn’t get it. My friends have already taken the shots.”According to the health department, Panipat (8,062), Ambala (7,612), Gurgaon (7,527), Hisar (7,012) and Palwal (5,093) carried out the maximum vaccinations in the state for this particular age group on Monday. A total of 15.4 lakh children are eligible for vaccination in Haryana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/7500-teenagers-get-first-dose-as-vax-rolled-out-for-15-plus-group-in-city/articleshow/88676061.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The district has 207 vaccination sites for an eligible population of nearly one lakh teenagers.The three health care centres TOI visited on Monday looked deserted. Meanwhile, people were roaming without masks, and there were rampant rumours of the vaccination causing infertility. Around 11am, only three teenagers had shown up for vaccination at the Nuh Civil Hospital. With hardly any teenagers turning up for vaccination, even at the Panchayat Ghar in the Mewlikalan village, it transformed into a makeshift vaccination centre for villagers on Monday.Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) Kripa Sharma, who vaccinated the villagers, had earlier earned the “best vaccinator” title in Nuh for administering the highest number of doses. But, on Monday, she was idle, mostly, sitting on her chair and staring at the entrance.Sharma said that not even a single teenager had arrived at the centre since the morning and cited “ignorance among locals” as a reason. “The locals think that vaccination will cause infertility.There is a lot of superstition, but we have sent out ASHA workers for door-to-door campaigns to convince all parents to send their children here,” she said.At the centre, Mohammad Aslam, whose wife is an Anganwadi worker, said that he would not let his two teenage daughters, Najo (16) and Sana (18), get vaccinated. “Days after I got myself vaccinated, I started having joint pains. These doctors will not say, but there are side effects to the vaccine. I don’t want my daughters to go through the same,” he said.However, Shakti Singh, deputy commissioner, Nuh, refuted the claims of vaccine hesitancy. “We believe that we will be able to cover teenage vaccination,” said the DC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/only-862-teens-vaccinated-in-nuh-on-day-1/articleshow/88676062.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Tamanna Dhingra said her parents, who are both fully vaccinated, motivated her to get the vaccine and she in turn would motivate her peers to do the same. Her younger brother, who is in Class 7, is not yet eligible for the vaccine.Tamanna didn’t have to book an appointment online and simply walked into her school to take the shot. “I wanted to wait a bit longer to get the vaccine, but my mother insisted that I get the Covaxin jab at the earliest, keeping in view the rise in Covid cases,” the Class 12 student added.She was visibly excited as she became the first to get a dose of Covaxin on Monday as part of the vaccination drive for children between 15 and 18 years in the city. “It is very important to get the vaccine. Everyone should take the jab when their turn comes,” she said.Asked how she will contribute to the inoculation drive, she said, “I will motivate others to take the jab by setting an example. Many of my friends have registered themselves on the Co-WIN portal and will soon get the jab. I hope we all can lead a normal life after this.”A 16-year-old Class 11 student of the same school was the city’s second kid to get vaccinated. Ayan Lohehab said he had mixed feelings about vaccination, but his mother, a teacher, helped him understand its importance. “I initially had some doubts, but I got clarity from my mother. She has already got both her doses and she told me to go for it. I will inspire others to do the same.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/motivated-by-parents-17-yr-old-first-in-15-group-to-get-jab-in-city/articleshow/88676063.cms||Ipsita Pati

The launch of Covid vaccines for the 15-17 age group saw teenagers poised for their next big career steps — some waiting to write board exams, some to get into college and some looking to go abroad — come out in large numbers for the shot of assurance they needed.At the centres, especially those set up within their own schools, the mood was breezy as youngsters queued up, many of them bunched up with friends or chaperoned by parents. The familiarity helped ease any trepidation about the vaccine. There were enough samosas, steaming cups of tea and ears buzzing with chatter from friends to distract the mind anyway. Seventeen-year-old Abhigyan Singh, a class XII student at Colonel’s Central Academy, was eager to get his first Covaxin dose on Monday. “My parents were initially apprehensive, but our teachers reassured them. I was particularly eager to take the jab as our coaching classes have resumed offline teaching and I didn’t want to be left out,” he said. Meeting his friends, he said, even if for some time, was “fun”.Knowing they would complete their vaccination schedule by the time the board exams are held was also a big relief, Abhigyan said. “This is a big psychological relief for us and our parents. That’s why you find everyone cheerful and having a fun time,” he added.In space with large gatherings of teenagers, could it be anything else? The infectious smiles had got to Ravinder Kumar, a parent, too. “It’s like a picnic. When my wife and I got vaccinated, we were nervous. Thankfully, our kids don’t have to face that rush and chaos. We really appreciate that the schools turned it into a light-hearted activity,” said Kumar. Parents said half their worries were gone when schools had expressed keenness to be appointed self-centres for the vaccination drive. “The fact that my daughter could get the vaccine on the premises of her own school came as a big relief to me. We trust the school authority and it is much better than visiting PHCs that are crowded,” Suman Lamba, mother of 17-year-old Khushi, a class 12 student at DAV Public School in Sector 14, said.From separate entries and exits to dedicated observation rooms, most schools had worked out elaborate mechanisms to avoid overcrowding on their premises while leaving room for a post-vaccination 30-minute observation period.At DAV School, the administration had allocated 60-minute slots, allowing only 15 students on their premises per hour. “We allocated hourly slots to students and invited only batches of 12-15 students so that there was no overcrowding. We had trained our staff in the registration process to minimise the hassle for parents. While there were separate seating areas for parents, three observation rooms were set up for students where they were made to wait for at least half an hour after the jab,” DAV School principal Aparna Erry said.To streamline the process, a few schools had called students from 10.30 am onwards, instead of 10 am when the drive was scheduled to commence. While each school had an upper limit of administering 100 jabs on the first day, almost all of them had exhausted their quota by 2 pm. However, it was not just the jabs. The excitement of meeting friends after a gap was also palpable among students. At most centres, students were seen huddling for a selfie or two, while parents sipped hot beverages and relished on samosas.The entire atmosphere was light and fun-filled, said Drona Public School director Nitish Bharadwaj. “We organised the vaccination drive at the assembly hall. Once inoculated, students along with their parents were directed to move to the ground. To see our grounds and assembly hall come alive with banter was really heart-warming, but we did occasionally remind students not to get too close and keep their masks on,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/jab-done-samosas-selfies-in-this-picnic/articleshow/88676066.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Teens rush for jabs as vax for 15-18 rolled out, city reaches 98% target||Gurgaon: In complete contrast to January 16 last year, when Covid vaccines were first rolled out, inoculation centres saw an overwhelming response from teenagers waiting on Monday as the window opened for Covid shots for the 15-18 age group. Gurgaon had targeted giving 7,700 doses at 77 session sites on Monday and administered 7,527 doses by the end of the day, achieving 98% of its target.Each session site for kids was allocated 100 doses to ensure that social distancing is properly maintained, district immunisation officer MP Singh said. Most sites exhausted their doses by mid-afternoon and teens were requested by vaccinators to return after booking an appointment. The city couldn’t achieve its target as two of its sites in rural areas, Ghangola and Mandpura, witnessed low turnout. In urban areas like Wazirabad, Sohna and sectors 31 and 49, however, long queues were witnessed.On the first day, around 25% of the total doses to be given were pre-booked while the rest were walk-ins. The number of doses per session site is unlikely to be increased because Covaxin is also needed for second doses of the rest of the eligible population.Asked why Gurgaon couldn’t achieve 100% target on the first day, chief medical officer Virender Yadav said, “There were some apprehensions among parents and children on the first day, especially in rural areas of the district, which resulted in lower turnout there. We are changing our strategies now. We will allocate 20% of doses for online appointments and 80% for walk-ins. We have been going door-to-door in rural areas to improve vaccination. The two rural sites have been told to intensify the vaccination drive for children.”The CMO added that they aim to get all children in the 15-18 age group in Gurgaon fully vaccinated by March 31. “We have 1.9 lakh children in this age group. If we have sufficient doses and carry out around 8,000 vaccinations per day for this group alone, we can achieve the target,” he further said.Haryana additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said the state gave 57,755 doses to children on Monday. “We don’t have any supply issue for Covaxin and have enough doses,” he said.Meanwhile, many recipients were excited to get their first dose of Covaxin. At DAV Public School in Sector 49, a waiting area had been set up where parents and their children were seen waiting from early morning on Monday for the drive to start.Gurleen Kaul, a Class 12 student who had turned up at the school in support of her friends, said she has registered for vaccination on Tuesday. “Many of my classmates are getting the jab and I will get it too. My sister, who is in Class 7, will also take the shot when the government allows inoculations for her age group,” she said.Preeti Yadav, a Class 9 student, got inoculated at the government school in Wazirabad. “We often go out and it is risky without vaccination. I have been reading a lot of news online saying children are getting Covid in other countries across the world. I’m happy to finally get the jab,” she said.Manyank Dagar (17), who got inoculated at Sohna government school, said: “I went to a mall on Sunday and I was asked to show my vaccination certificate. I told them that I am 17 and will get vaccinated on Monday. Now, vaccination is compulsory at several places. So, I decided to get inoculated on the first day.”Some of the schools have called students on a class-wise basis so that vaccinations are conducted smoothly and crowding in the premises is avoided. The Daultabad government senior secondary school (GSSS) began vaccinations with only students of classes 9 and 10, while at the Sirhaul GSSS, students of classes 10 and 12 were the first to take the doses.Anju Paruthi, principal of the Daultabad school, said: “We held counselling sessions two days ago to allay the students’ concerns and encourage them to get themselves vaccinated.”Students made the most of the day by clicking selfies after vaccination and enjoying the company of their friends. Many teenagers, however, were left disappointed as they couldn’t get the jab. At Surat Nagar, vaccinators had to turn away several children as they had exhausted the doses reserved for walk-in recipients. Parul Verma, (17), a student of the Government Girl’s College, Sector 14, said: “I was looking forward to getting vaccinated on Monday, but it was disappointing as I couldn’t get it. My friends have already taken the shots.”According to the health department, Panipat (8,062), Ambala (7,612), Gurgaon (7,527), Hisar (7,012) and Palwal (5,093) carried out the maximum vaccinations in the state for this particular age group on Monday. A total of 15.4 lakh children are eligible for vaccination in Haryana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/teens-rush-for-jabs-as-vax-for-15-18-rolled-out-city-reaches-98-target/articleshow/88676067.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||‘Motivated by parents’: 17-yr-old student gets ‘muhurat’ vax shot||Gurgaon: A 17-year-old girl from DAV Public School, Sector 49 was the first teenager to get the Covid jab for children in Gurgaon. Tamanna Dhingra said her parents, who are both fully vaccinated, motivated her to get the vaccine and she in turn would motivate her peers to do the same. Her younger brother, who is in Class 7, is not yet eligible for the vaccine.Tamanna didn’t have to book an appointment online and simply walked into her school to take the shot. “I wanted to wait a bit longer to get the vaccine, but my mother insisted that I get the Covaxin jab at the earliest, keeping in view the rise in Covid cases,” the Class 12 student added.She was visibly excited as she became the first to get a dose of Covaxin on Monday as part of the vaccination drive for children between 15 and 18 years in the city. “It is very important to get the vaccine. Everyone should take the jab when their turn comes,” she said.Asked how she will contribute to the inoculation drive, she said, “I will motivate others to take the jab by setting an example. Many of my friends have registered themselves on the Co-WIN portal and will soon get the jab. I hope we all can lead a normal life after this.”A 16-year-old Class 11 student of the same school was the city’s second kid to get vaccinated. Ayan Lohehab said he had mixed feelings about vaccination, but his mother, a teacher, helped him understand its importance. “I initially had some doubts, but I got clarity from my mother. She has already got both her doses and she told me to go for it. I will inspire others to do the same.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/motivated-by-parents-17-yr-old-student-gets-muhurat-vax-shot/articleshow/88676068.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Active cases near 2k as infections see another jump||Gurgaon: New Covid infections reported in a single day rose sharply again on Monday, to 460 from 358 on Sunday.The city now has 1,827 active cases, but hospitalisations so far have been few. Just 13 of these patients are in institutional care, health department data shows. With the daily positivity rate also escalating towards worrying levels, testing has also been stepped up. Monday’s positivity rate was 6.8%, which is expected to rise with the number of new Covid infections, suspected to be driven by the Omicron variant, jumping up every day.Like in the second wave, the city accounts for a bulk of new infections reported in Haryana and has 605 of the state’s active cases. Faridabad has the most active cases after Gurgaon, followed by Ambala and Panchkula.Four new Omicron cases, two men and two women, were also reported on Monday. All four had recently travelled abroad. Their test reports were negative when they arrived at IGI airport, but they tested positive when they underwent another Covid test around seven days after they reached Gurgaon. So far, the city has reported 39 Omicron infections. Of these patients, 37 have recovered. The health department has been sending 2% of all Covid test samples for genome sequencing to detect the presence of the Omicron variant.Meanwhile, in the wake of the rise in cases, the health department proposed seven more containment zones on Monday. At present, Gurgaon has 21 containment areas. The proposed new zones include Pioneer Park (Sector 61), BPTP Mansions Park (Sector 66), Ridgewood Estate (DLF-4), tower 16 in Central Park Resorts (Sector 48), tower 6 in Tata Primanti (Sector 72), tower 2 in Uniworld Gardens (Sector 47) and a house in Sector 51.Teams from the health department will carry out door-to-door screenings and the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon will regularly sanitise these areas. The phone numbers of patients in home isolation have been geo-tagged and police are monitoring their movement to ensure they stay at home. Containment zones are considered de-notified after two weeks if there is no further surge in cases.The city’s paediatric bed capacity has been strengthened in case there is a spike in Covid cases in children. At present, there are 900 paediatric beds, out of which 228 are oxygen facilities without ventilators and 106 are equipped with ventilators. Earlier, Gurgaon had 809 beds for paediatric patients, including 89 with ventilators.In the second wave, the city reeled from an acute shortage of oxygen in hospitals for treatment of Covid patients. Hospitals were later directed to upgrade their infrastructure to prepare for the possibility of another wave hitting the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/active-cases-near-2k-as-infections-see-another-jump/articleshow/88676069.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Your commute may get better as many infra projects lined up for launch this yr||Gurgaon: Travelling in the city may become easier this year, with several infrastructure projects set to be opened to commuters during the course of the year.Among the biggest projects is the Dwarka Expressway, which is being constructed at a cost of Rs 9,000 crore and is expected to reduce traffic congestion along the current routes connecting Delhi and Gurgaon by providing commuters with an alternative. The 29km-long expressway will link Shiv Murti on NH-8 and Kherki Daula.Apart from factors like the lockdowns due to the pandemic and construction bans imposed amidst high pollution levels, work on the expressway had been complicated by the collapse of a section of an elevated road being built as part of it, following which construction was suspended. With work having resumed, officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) anticipate that they will be able to complete the project in “eight to ten months”.Moreover, NHAI officials are hopeful of completing another major project — the Sohna elevated road, which is being built at a cost of Rs 1,700 crore — by March. The project aims to ease congestion between Rajiv Chowk and Sohna through the construction of flyovers and underpasses at various points.“Although work was held up for almost a month recently because of the construction ban, we are hopeful of making up for lost time. Both the Dwarka Expressway and Sohna elevated road should be opened within the coming year,” said a senior NHAI official.2022 will also bring the revamp of multiple major junctions in the city, including Huda City Centre, Atul Kataria Chowk and Mahavir Chowk.While the Rs 43-crore project to revamp Huda City Centre entails the construction of a unidirectional underpass from Signature Towers towards Subhash Chowk, a bidirectional flyover between Hussain Marg and the road towards Signature Towers, and two foot overbridges, the Rs 58.4-crore Atul Kataria Chowk decongestion project involves the construction of an underpass between Sheetla Mata Mandir and Maharana Pratap Chowk, as well as a flyover between Gurgaon bus stand and Kapashera.The Rs 23-crore project to revamp Mahavir Chowk, meanwhile, involves the construction of an underpass between Old Delhi Gurgaon road and the bus stand, an elevated walkway, as well as service roads.All three projects, officials from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said, are likely to be completed within the next three months.“Although we had a deadline of December 31 for all these projects, work was suspended for around one month because of the construction ban. Additionally, the pandemic and delay in shifting of utilities also complicated our work. We expect to complete all three projects within the next three months,” a senior GMDA official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/your-commute-may-get-better-as-many-infra-projects-lined-up-for-launch-this-yr/articleshow/88676071.cms||Sakshi Dayal

They submitted a memorandum to the MCM commissioner and sought immediate action, saying their commute to other parts of the city has been affected owing to the slushy road. They also threatened to stage more protests, if the problem is not resolved in the next 15 days.The residents alleged that they have been facing the problem for the past three years as wastewater from nearby villages keeps getting accumulated due to lack of a proper drainage system in the area, causing hardship to motorists and pedestrians. Residents claimed to have submitted several complaints to the civic body, closed their main entrance a few months ago as a mark of protest to draw the attention of authorities, but the officials have turned a blind eye to their grievance. Ravi Yadav, a social worker and a resident of the society said, “Due to accumulation of wastewater in front of the colony, more than 1,200 families of the society and 5,000 families of the village have been forced to brave the slushy road while commuting for the past three years. It seems all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. We have submitted the memorandum to the MCM commissioner and if the problem is not resolved in the next 15 days, we will hold an indefinite protest.” They added that the officials are submitting false reports to close their complaint filed on the CM Window. Satinder Bhatia, RWA member of the society said, “We could not even access the road on car or bike, forget about the problem faced by the pedestrians. With continuous water accumulation, road has become slippery and stinky, making our lives miserable.” Meanwhile, the senior official of the MCM said that they have already initiated the tendering process for the construction of the road along with drain. “The process is in the final stage of approval and once we get it we will allot the work order. We are expecting to start the construction work by early February.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/sewage-flows-on-to-road-stagnates-residents-protest-warn-of-more/articleshow/88676072.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||FIR filed in row with M3M, MGF files petition in court||Gurgaon: After three consecutive court orders and a warning on contempt proceedings, Gurgaon police on Monday filed an FIR against real estate company MGF, minutes before the deadline of 1pm set by the court.The case is related to a land deal between M3M and Emaar-MGF (Emaar exited its joint venture with MGF in 2016). In a span of four days, the court of the judicial magistrate (first class) had issued three orders for registration of FIR. M3M, also a real estate company, alleged in its complaint Emaar-MGF had approached them with an offer of selling their land parcel of 31 acres at Choma village and it had paid Rs 88 crore in November 2016 but came to know in December 2021 that the land had been sold to another developer.“Without our knowledge or consent, they filed for cancellation of agreement (with M3M for sale of the land). The language of the cancellation agreement is one-sided and the security deposit of Rs 88 crore has been made non-refundable,” said M3M lawyer Ekta Yadav.A spokesperson for MGF said the land in question measures 31.3 acres and the company had objected to the application of M3M before the department of town and country planning for grant of licence for that land. Later, MGF moved the Punjab and Haryana high court, which passed an order on December 23, directing status quo. “Despite status quo directions from the high court, M3M filed a police complaint on December 28 and another application before court on December 30 for registration of FIR against MGF and its officials,” said the MGF spokesperson.The spokesperson added MGF had filed a revision plea before the sessions court on Monday. “While the hearing in the matter was on, at 1pm January 3, the M3M counsel informed the court that an FIR has been registered,” the MGF representative said. It was found during the hearing at the court of the additional sessions judge that the FIR was registered at 12.58pm. The court adjourned the hearing for January 14.The case was registered under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 and 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 467 and 468 (forgery) and 471 (using forged documents) of the IPC at City police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/fir-filed-in-row-with-m3m-mgf-files-petition-in-court/articleshow/88676073.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Noida||NTPC to purchase 500 kl treated water from GNIDA||Greater Noida: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) and the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) have signed an agreement where the latter will purchase 500 kilolitres (KLD) of treated water from GNIDA's sewage treatment plant (STP) at sector Ecotech 2. This move will be significant in protecting the depleting groundwater level of the city.For this project, the NTPC will bear the cost of laying a 20-metre pipeline and installing pumps at the authority’s STP at sector Ecotech 2. The work is expected to be completed within a month and the water supply will commence from February.The treated water will be used by the NTPC for irrigation, horticulture and for its internal use at its research centre located nearby. The authority, in turn, will earn a fixed income of about Rs 50,000 per month.“Negotiations were on with NTPC for nearly a year to buy treated water from the STP at sector Ecotech 2. NTPC had to take a decision to meet the cost of using treated water which was finalised over the weekend. It is a big step in the path of groundwater harvesting,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO GNIDA, who also appealed to more companies and institutions of Greater Noida to use STP treated water for irrigation and non-drinking use.According to Kapil Dev Singh, officer in-charge of sewer department GNIDA, there are four STPs in Greater Noida. These include the current 85 MLD capacity Kasna STP which can treat sewer water up to 135 MLD daily. Others include the 15 MLD capacity STP at sector Ecotech 2, the 5 MLD capacity STP at sector Ecotech 3 and 1.5 MLD capacity STP at Badalpur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ntpc-to-purchase-500-kl-treated-water-from-gnida/articleshow/88676074.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Recipients said that now, they would be able to attend schools without any fears, and also, the chance of exams getting postponed or cancelled would be less. Many hailed the decision, saying vaccination should start for younger children, too.Vipul Agarwal (17), a class 11 student and resident of Noida Sector 12, said, “I was a little bit afraid before taking the jab, but the whole process got completed soon. I had already booked the slot online and did not have to wait at the centre (Child PGI). Three of my siblings also took Covid shots with me. None of us experienced any pain or reaction.”Parth Mishra (17), a student of class 12 and resident of Noida Sector 74, said, “It is not about my choice but a necessary act at this point of time when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is quickly spreading. Everyone in my family had taken the vaccine, and I was the only one left. I feel safe now.”Ghaziabad has a target of inoculating 2.34 lakh teenagers, and GB Nagar is targetting 1.15 lakh. Health officials said that the response was good on the first day, and the numbers would likely go up from Tuesday. However, the Cowin portal worked slowly for a considerable period due to the new entries of schools, they added.With only 50 slots opened for online booking at each centre, most children who turned up for vaccination got registered at the centres. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, GB Nagar, said, “I would request parents to get their kids’ registrations done at home and then come to centres. We have made special arrangements for the children, and they do not need to take time slots. Only self-registration on the portal is required.”GB Nagar has 27 vaccination centres for teenagers, including five government hospitals and 22 schools. Nearly 15 private hospitals also administered the vaccine.Meanwhile, 165 vaccination centres, including 81 schools, have been set up in Ghaziabad. Vaccination started around 9 am in most of the centres. In some centres such as MMG District Hospital, teenagers stood in long queues in the morning hours. Health officials said that no child reported trouble getting vaccinated.Schools that are now vaccination centres also welcomed many teenagers. Many had already registered online, while others got vaccinated on the spot by registering through Aadhar card and school ID card, among others.Kashish Sharma (17), a class 12 student, said, “Now, we have a protective cover against Covid.

---||Noida||Noida, Gzb report 135 new Covid cases each; 13 patients in hosps||Noida/Ghaziabad: Breaking records of the past several months, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar reported 135 new Covid cases each on Monday. Over the last two weeks, the number of cases in both districts has gone up sharply. While GB Nagar reported a total of 54 cases between December 21 and 27, as many as 416 cases were reported in the subsequent week (December 28 to January 3). Ghaziabad, which had reported 47 cases between December 21 and 27, saw at least 372 cases this week. The daily positivity rate has been recorded at 1.6% and 1.2% in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad, respectively, between December 28 and January 3. This is up from the overall 0.2% recorded in both the districts in the preceding week. On Monday, the positivity rate was recorded at 3.25% and 4.1% in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, respectively, officials said.GB Nagar, meanwhile, has continued to top the state’s chart with 466 active cases, while Ghaziabad comes close second with 392 cases and Lucknow third with 360 such cases.So far, only six of 466 patients are undergoing treatment at hospitals in GB Nagar, officials said. In Ghaziabad, seven patients have been hospitalised. According to doctors, most patients have mild symptoms of fever, cold, cough and sore throats, while a few have complained of loss of smell or taste. So far, no patient has required oxygen therapy, they said. With a spurt in cases, both districts have ramped up contact tracing. Since March 1 last year, Ghaziabad has been tracing at least 28 persons per patient whereas GB Nagar tracing 17 contacts. Currently, district health officials said, about 45 contacts of positive patients are being traced.Meanwhile, Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union minister of heavy industries, was admitted to Yashoda Super Specialty Hospital, Kaushambi after he tested Covid positive. Pandey (64) had complained of fever, cold, cough, sore throat and chest pain for the last three days, doctors said.As 572 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in UP in the last 24 hours, experts warned people to exercise caution as the cases are doubling in less than two days. The number of new cases on December 30 was 193 which went up to 385 on New Year’s Day.According to the official bulletin, nearly 64% of the new cases reported on Monday, surfaced in just four districts – Ghaziabad (130), Gautam Budh Nagar (101), Lucknow (86) and Meerut (49).Covid-19 data for December showed a six-fold increase in the number of active cases in the state. “Lockdown comes at a price while prevention is easier. Omicron, the new variant, may appear to be less lethal than the Delta strain, but it will cost lives when the pandemic peaks,” a senior health officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-gzb-report-135-new-covid-cases-each-13-patients-in-hosps/articleshow/88676076.cms||Aditya Dev

Officials are of the opinion that such digitized data will help them resolve such complaints and monitor the activities of the private schools. While data of teachers and staff working with the state government schools is available on a government portal, such data is not available for the private schools.Officials said the direction comes after the department took cognizance of several complaints of expulsions of teachers and staff by private schools coming to fore during Covid pandemic across the state."The department has issued these directions for all the public schools of the entire state. The private schools have now been directed to upload the details of their teachers and staff hired and working with the schools on the UDISE+ portal on which the data of teachers and staff of all the government schools is uploaded," said Dharmendra Saxena, GB Nagar Basic Shiksha Adhikari.

Recipients said that now, they would be able to attend schools without any fears, and also, the chance of exams getting postponed or cancelled would be less. Many hailed the decision, saying vaccination should start for younger children, too.Vipul Agarwal (17), a class 11 student and resident of Noida Sector 12, said, “I was a little bit afraid before taking the jab, but the whole process got completed soon. I had already booked the slot online and did not have to wait at the centre (Child PGI). Three of my siblings also took Covid shots with me. None of us experienced any pain or reaction.”Parth Mishra (17), a student of class 12 and resident of Noida Sector 74, said, “It is not about my choice but a necessary act at this point of time when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 is quickly spreading. Everyone in my family had taken the vaccine, and I was the only one left. I feel safe now.”Ghaziabad has a target of inoculating 2.34 lakh teenagers, and GB Nagar is targetting 1.15 lakh.

However, the Cowin portal worked slowly for a considerable period due to the new entries of schools, they added.With only 50 slots opened for online booking at each centre, most children who turned up for vaccination got registered at the centres. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, GB Nagar, said, “I would request parents to get their kids’ registrations done at home and then come to centres. We have made special arrangements for the children, and they do not need to take time slots.

---||Noida||Confession video of 2 accused surfaces days after eatery owner shot dead||Greater Noida: Days after a Greater Noida-based eatery owner was shot dead for refusing to serve food during night curfew, an alleged confession video of the two men, arrested in the case, has surfaced on social media.Bulandshahr natives Aakash Gurjar and Yogendra, aged 30, who were arrested on January 1, just hours after they allegedly shot Kapil Rana, the owner of SR Food Service at Omaxe Arcade near Pari Chowk, for refusing to serve parathas during night curfew hours (11 pm to 5 am), imposed due to rising Covid cases, had allegedly recorded the clip on an isolated stretch soon after committing the crime and uploaded it from one of their Facebook accounts.The video, which has since been circulated several times on social media, has been removed from the internet, police said. The clip, however, will be used as evidence against the two men, they added.“On Sunday, we came across the video on Aakash’s Facebook account in which the two accused confessed to the crime. We will be using the video in court as evidence now,” SHO Beta 2 Anil Kumar said. Police have also moved an application in the court to question the accused about the video. In the video, the accused allegedly claimed to have shot Rana and invited their loved ones to visit them in jail, police said, adding that the men did not express any remorse for their actions.According to police, the accused had reached the eatery around 1.30 am on Saturday and ordered parathas, but Rana had denied serving them food as it was post 1 am. “Rana had also called the police helpline number 112 when the two men started creating a ruckus. While Aakash and Yogendra left at the time, they returned to the eatery around 3.30 am and shot Rana dead. The victim had sustained three gunshot wounds and died after reaching the nearest hospital,” Kumar said. Police have arrested them under IPC Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and Section 25/27 of the Arms Act. An illegal pistol and two live cartridges were also recovered from the men. “We have found that the pistol used in the crime belonged to Yogendra, who had procured it from Bihar around two years back. Yogendra, who works as a driver, had been earlier arrested in a liquor smuggling case. The two are currently lodged in jail,” the SHO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/confession-video-of-2-accused-surfaces-days-after-eatery-owner-shot-dead/articleshow/88676079.cms||---

Police said he considered the child an “obstacle to their marriage”.The accused, Hemant Singh, is originally from Bulandshahr district. After he was nabbed from Sector 88, he was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. The girl’s grandmother was also detained for questioning.“In her complaint filed on December 24, the woman said the child had gone missing while playing outside her house in Bisrakh block, after which a case under IPC Section 363 (abduction) was registered at Phase 2 police station,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women’s safety), Gautam Budh Nagar.On December 28, the girl’s body was found just 100 metres from her home in an abandoned under-construction building. There were injury marks on several parts of her body, said police. A medical examination confirmed that she was sexually assaulted and then murdered.“During investigation, it came to light that Singh frequently visited the child’s house. He was picked up for questioning and revealed that he was in a relationship with her grandmother and wanted to marry her. However, the woman had told Singh that she needed to take care of the child,” the DCP said.The girl used to live with her grandmother as her father is in jail in connection with a murder case for the past two years while her mother lives in Budaun. “The woman had promised Singh she would marry him once the child's father was released from prison. On the day of the crime, he took the child to a secluded location, assaulted her and then killed her,” Shukla said, adding that Singh has a criminal history.The DCP further said police are trying to ascertain if the girl’s grandmother was involved in the crime too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/girl-raped-killed-by-grandmothers-lover-in-noida/articleshow/88676080.cms||---

---||Noida||Another protest by farmers, this time against ‘inflated’ bills, power theft cases||Noida: Buoyed by the success of two protests – against the central farming laws on Delhi’s borders and for abadi land in Noida – a farmers’ group on Monday began a similar agitation outside the office of the Noida Power Company Limited (NPCL).Kisan Ekta Sangh said this would be an indefinite dharna demanding withdrawal of “disputed” electricity bills, whose penalties it claimed now runs into lakhs, and FIRs against farmers. The protesters locked the main gate of NPCL for hours and squatted outside another.The farmers alleged corruption in the electricity department and rampant power theft in many villages had led to genuine connection holders being victimised. They claimed several complaints had been filed by villagers whose power connections had been snapped because bills had not been cleared. Among those who had joined the protest were those who claimed to have received bills to the tune of Rs 17 lakh, Rs 4 lakh and Rs 1 lakh. They alleged the discom had served them several notices to pay up.Jitendra Singh of Kanarsi village, whose father Rajvir Singh received a notice on November 23 last year, said, “In 2013, we got a connection of 5hp connection. The bill for two years got accumulated and came to around Rs 71,000, which we paid. After that, we complained that the bill was inflated. Subsequently, I got a bill of Rs 40,000. Officials claimed this (inflated bill) could be because an old reading was pending. However, we refused to pay the bill and asked them to disconnect power supply. It has been over two years that the meter was been removed in 2019. The total bill then was about Rs 9 lakh. Now, we have received a notice stating the due is Rs 17 lakh,” he said.Others who claimed to have received notices included residents of Kanarsi, Chachula, Samaspur, Kanarsa and Bajpur. The protesters alleged theft of power via hooks (chungi) was widespread, inflating the charges for people being billed through meters. At the same time, farmers with power theft cases against them have demanded want the FIRs withdrawn. “Even women have got cases lodged against them. How will they, especially widows, fight such cases?” asked Shoran Pradhan, president of Kisan Ekta Sangh. Officials led by DGM Subodh Tyagi held talks with the protesters and assured them they would forward their demands to the state government and the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC).NPCL spokesperson Sarnath Ganguly told TOI that while farmers want that all the cases lodged against them to be withdrawn, it cannot be done as a blanket rule. “Further, if they feel that they are getting accumulated bills due to power theft, there are only few such cases which can be taken up during camps at each village. However, villagers are demanding that billing via meters should be done away with and a fixed charge should be taken from them, which is not based on units consumed. This demand can only be looked into by the state government and UPERC and we have assured them we will forward their demands to the government,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/another-protest-by-farmers-this-time-against-inflated-bills-power-theft-cases/articleshow/88676085.cms||Shikha Salaria

Sharing the outcomes, YEIDA chairman Arvind Kumar, who presided over a board meeting of the authority on Monday, said, “We offered the scheme to all categories of allottees, except private developers. Allottees who had taken industrial, institutional and commercial plots, as well as built-up houses, mixed-use and abadi plots, have availed the benefits." Allottees with Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Noida Authority are likely to be brought under the scheme after discussions with the government, said sources.YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh said that the authority got 2,593 applications, and the scheme would bring in Rs 416 crore in revenues. Meanwhile, YEIDA would pass on benefits of Rs 350 crore to the applicants. Out of the 38,000 allottees with units along the Yamuna Expressway, YEIDA introduced the scheme to cater to 32,000. Officials said that YEIDA had offered zero period benefits to several industrial and residential allottees who could not get land due to legal issues. They did not avail of the OTS scheme.Rishabh Nigam, president, Yamuna Expressway Entrepreneurs Association, said, “We did not participate in the scheme because the authority had already offered zero period benefits to us. Other allottees, who had not made payments, said the authority was asking for additional compensation for farmers at the time of applying for the OTS benefits and did not apply either.”Arun Vir Singh said that the matter of additional payments to the farmers is pending before the Supreme Court, and for now, allottees would have to pay up their dues.On the other hand, during the board meeting, the deadline for executing the lease deed got extended till March 31 for all allottees, except group housing. Even those, who have received notices on executing the lease deed immediately, will be given additional time.Additionally, YEIDA has decided to purchase six four-wheelers and hand them over to the police department for increased patrolling on the Yamuna Expressway. It will also standardise payments to civic work contractors, according to the rates prescribed by the UP public works department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ots-scheme-2-6k-responses-in-3-months/articleshow/88676086.cms||---

Over a dozen companies, including Hetero, Sun Pharma, Natco and Dr Reddy’s are in the process of rolling out the oral therapy developed by Merck and and its partner, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, at prices ranging between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 for the complete treatment, sources told TOI. The antiviral pill is being considered a potential gamechanger globally in Covid treatment as remdesivir used till now is administered intravenously, and in hospital settings. Mankind Pharma, which has tied up with BDR Pharmaceuticals. introduced its antiviral Molulife (200 mg) in Delhi and certain other parts of the country on Monday, a company official said. Further, Sun Pharma has priced the antiviral at around Rs 1,500 for the full course, and is making its ‘Molxvir’ available in markets where there are more cases, and gradually across India.The recommended dose of molnupiravir is 800 mg twice a day for five days.

For several months, officials at the finance ministry have maintained that LIC would be a listed entity before fiscal 2022 ends. The IPO size is expected to be worth about Rs 1 lakh crore, which will make it the biggest ever equity offering in India.Among a host of other information that LIC officials shared with those investors was the life insurance major’s increasing focus on non-participating products like ULIPs, pension, annuity and health insurance products, sources said. This is part of LIC’s efforts to diversify its product mix and increase sales of existing non-participating products as well as launching new non-participating products, they said.As part of its growth plans, the life insurance major also wants to recruit more millennial agents to keep pace with the changing demographic pattern of India. According to some estimates, about 67% of India’s population are in the age group of 15-64 years and the median age is nearly nine years. Additionally, LIC officials told investors that the insurer wants to increase its market share of the bancassurance channel as it’s in the process of tying up with more partners. The life insurance major is also pushing for increasing digital adoption for its bancassurance partners to improve productivity, sources said.Officials further told investors how LIC wants to increase up-selling and cross-selling to individual customers, expand average ticket size of the products it sells and also increase the productivity of its intermediaries. In earlier presentations to prospective investors in the LIC IPO, its officials had told them how the insurance company wants to leverage its digital strategy to grow its business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/lic-looks-to-file-for-ipo-by-jan-3rd-week/articleshow/88676092.cms||Partha Sinha

---||Mumbai||Sensex starts 2022 with a bang, gains 929 pts to 59k||Mumbai: The stock market started 2022 on a strong note, despite rising cases globally of infections from the Omicron variant of Covid. The sensex surged 929 points, or 1.6%, to 59,183, supported by financials and Reliance Industries the most. The reversal of foreign fund selling in the last few days due to the ongoing holiday season in most developed markets also helped the rally, market players said.The day’s session saw banking & financials along with metal stocks lead the rally while healthcare stocks, despite the rising uncertainty because of the spread of Omicron, witnessed selling pressure. As a result, the BSE’s financial, banking and metal indices closed with gains of over 2%, while the healthcare index closed marginally lower.According to Rahul Sharma of Equity99 Advisors, the expectation on the street is that the positive momentum would continue for a while. “However, investors are advised to keep some capital aside to take advantage of any major dips considering the rising Omicron infections. The pharma sector could be a great bet looking at the current scenario,” he said.The day’s session also made investors richer by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 272.5 lakh crore. In the near term, the stock market is expected to witness some up-move, supported mainly by local investors — both institutional and individual. But a definitive trend would emerge from the third week of the month, market players said. This is because that’s when most foreign fund managers would resume after their new year break. That would also be the time when leading Indian companies would start announcing their quarter results.The recent reversal in selling by foreign portfolio investors has also helped the Indian currency. From a multi-month low at about 76 to a dollar level in early December, the rupee on Monday closed at 74.26 to a dollar. In the bond market too, despite the RBI’s recent decision to cancel some of its borrowing plans through government securities, the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts is hovering at the 6.45% level. On Monday, the yield closed at 6.46%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-starts-2022-with-a-bang-gains-929-pts-to-59k/articleshow/88676094.cms||---

In a separate order on Digit Insurance, the regulator said that non-life companies cannot provide a death benefit in their policies.This clarification puts to rest any speculation over the admissibility of claims arising out of the new variant. Last year, the regulator had told insurance companies that health policies must cover Covid infection even though worldwide some companies rejected claims on the grounds of pandemic exclusion. “Insurance companies shall put in place an effective coordinating mechanism with all their network providers (hospitals) to make available seamless cashless facility to all policyholders in the case of hospitalisation if any and render speedy services to all policyholders,” Irdai said.Regarding the ‘Digit Group Total Protect Policy’, Irdai said in its order that according to the Insurance Act, 1938, no insurer shall carry on any class of insurance business in India unless it has obtained from the authority a certificate of registration. Digit Insurance chief distribution officer Adarsh Agarwal said, “There is a difference in views of what is health insurance and what is life insurance. This is a legal interpretation issue and Digit will be reviewing this order with our legal team.” He added that the company had stopped offering this life feature according to Irdai’s advice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/health-covers-must-include-omicron-costs-irdai/articleshow/88676095.cms||---

The bank has also ended an impasse with key shareholders over the appointment of an auditor. However, the bank will need to require its shareholders’ nod for raising capital. Dhanlaxmi Bank MD & CEO J K Shivan said the lender has managed to crack the small-sized corporate market. These borrowers have a triple-A rating but have a low funding requirement of around Rs 100 crore. As a result, the bank has managed to grow its share of corporate loans from 25% to 29% as of December. It has grown its overall loans by a 10.5% year-on-year as of end December — the highest in 10 quarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dhanlaxmi-bank-loans-grow-11-highest-in-10-qtrs/articleshow/88676096.cms||---

An HUL spokesperson said, “In response to the request we had received from AICPDF, company representatives met them to understand their concerns and feedback about the evolving ‘Route to Market’ (RTM) models.” The development comes even as AICPDF intensified its stand by threatening to extend the blockade of HUL’s products in four other states after Maharashtra, where it first decided to stop supplying the multinational’s products from January 1 after it received no response from the company. AICPDF’s grievance is the price disparity between traditional trade and business-to-business (B2B) retailers.The maker of brands like Lifebuoy soap and Lipton tea has reiterated that general trade (GT) continues to be its largest channel. “Our distributors (redistribution stockists) are and will remain our valued partners in our quest to serve the needs of our consumers across India. HUL remains fully committed to ensuring that our distribution partners earn a fair return on their investments and work collaboratively in enhancing their capabilities to make them future-fit. As an organisation committed to the highest level of customer centricity, HUL will make all efforts to address any specific issue bilaterally with its distributors to mutual satisfaction,” the company said in reply to TOI’s query.In a recent report, Edelweiss Research said, “These issues have happened earlier also, and we expect HUL and distributors to come to an agreement soon since both need each other.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hul-meets-sellers-amid-threat-to-expand-strike/articleshow/88676097.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Consumer commission directs bank to recompense 4L for deficiency in service||MUMBAI: The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission of Central Mumbai District has held the Standard Chartered Bank guilty of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice, while providing banking services to two complainants. The Commission directed the bank to pay Rs 4 lakh as compensation to Pankaj Goyal and Sachin Goyal towards mental agony suffered due to the negligence of the bank. The Commission also directed the bank not to process any report of the credit of the complainants to CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd and to withdraw any negative reports, if they have already been furnished. The bank, according to the Commission, had acted in an arbitrary and one-sided manner. It stated that even if the complainant had consented to the bank’s terms and conditions, the bank could not amend them arbitrarily, without considering applicable banking regulations and guidelines. The complainants had availed a home loan of around Rs 36 lakh in 2004. In their complaint filed in 2016, the home buyers, who were represented by advocate Dharmendra Damani, alleged that the bank, contrary to the undertaking in the loan agreement, that the rate of interest would be reviewed every six months, informed that interest rates would be reviewed every three months, even before the completion of the first review cycle. The bank also kept changing interest rates for the loan and removed the reference of Home Loan Regular Rate to a term called Mortgage Variable Reference Rate (MVRR). The complainants alleged that the MVRR underwent changes from 10.50% to a peak of 20.25%, besides, the loan tenure increased from 192 months, as well as the EMI from Rs 31,627 to Rs 38,341. The bank, according to complainants, did not give any maturity date for the loan. The bank, however, claimed that the loan sanction letter mentioned that in case of any unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances or sudden changes in market conditions, the bank may at its sole discretion change the rate of interest. It also stated that the complainants had opted for the variable mode of interest rate. The Commission rejected the bank’s claim that the complaint was barred by limitation The Commission said that the bank had failed to substantiate reasons for not giving a maturity date for the loan, on account of the nature of interest of the loan, by citing any RBI guideline or regulations related to banking in India.  If the bank was entitled to act at their discretion, then the bank had to substantiate under which rule or guideline of RBI, they took the steps, the Commission said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/consumer-commission-directs-bank-to-recompense-4l-for-deficiency-in-service/articleshow/88676102.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

---||Mumbai||Maha’s revenue mop-up 56% of its target till Dec||Mumbai: The pandemic continues to leave its mark on the cash-strapped state government’s revenue. The government has collected only 56% of its revenue target by the end of December, with just three months to go before the close of the financial year. The state’s revenue has also dipped by Rs 3,055 crore between November and December. The latest data shows that till the end of December, Maharashtra had raised Rs 2.07 lakh crore of the annual target of Rs 3.69 lakh crore. The state’s revenue collection had improved after the lockdown-style restrictions were lifted in June. However, officials said that chances of high revenue generation in the last quarter of the financial year is not expected owing to the concessions granted by the government and the possibility of restrictions following the Omicron variant.Data shows that the state’s revenue collection was Rs 29,227 crore in November and declined to Rs 26,172 crore in December. During this period, there was a decline in the funds received from central taxes and grant-in-aid from the Centre, but a rise in the funds received for centrally-sponsored schemes. Maharashtra also has to receive pending GST compensation worth Rs 31, 624 crore from the Centre.In December, stamp duty and registration fees collection, which reflect real estate transactions, was higher (Rs 3,594 crore) than in November (Rs 2,614 crore). However, vehicle tax collection dipped from Rs 855 crore in November to Rs 775 crore in December. Observers said that vehicle purchases were impacted by the rise in fuel prices.State GST collections soared in December, recording the second-highest figure for the year. Collections rose by Rs 800 crore from November.Officials said that revenues have seen a decent recovery so far, but the Omicron variant and its impact could well dampen collections in the last quarter of 2021-22.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mahas-revenue-mop-up-56-of-its-target-till-dec/articleshow/88676105.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The civic-run jumbo centres are racing against time to add beds, while private hospitals have started reconverting many of their non-Covid wards to Covid sections. On Monday, 574 people were admitted to various city hospitals, up from 503 on Sunday, 389 on Saturday and 497 on Friday. A few hospitals have started recording a rise in ICU admissions, including many directly coming with low oxygen saturation levels. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe BMC’s Monday figures showed that 12.2% (3,735) of the 30,565 Covid-19 beds in Mumbai are occupied. Of the 2,720 ICU beds, 14% are filled up. The city has been witnessing a surge in cases for the past two weeks and a rise in critical cases is typically seen from the second or the third week onwards. A lion’s share of the Covid beds in the city is in the public sector. As on Monday, the private sector had just 5,192 Covid beds, of which 838 (16%) regular beds and 180 (3%) ICU beds were occupied.

Around 510 beds out of the 1,172 ready ones were occupied on Monday noon. Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said they are planning to activate all 2,738 beds by January 10 and are recruiting healthcare workers every day. The ICU occupancy has risen to 20 from five a week ago, filling up 42% of the 48 beds. Andrade said they admitted three patients on Sunday which doubled to six on Monday. They were expecting four more ICU referrals by evening. “Patients are requiring oxygen support, but nobody is on a mechanical ventilator,” she said, adding a majority of ICU admissions has been of people who are unvaccinated and have multiple comorbidities. The jumbo centre at BKC that opened on Sunday has more than 100 admissions. Dean Dr Rajesh Dere said it included positive people as well as asymptomatic positive international travellers. The centre has finalised an agency to and expects to start the ICU in the next few days.

---||Mumbai||1st day, poor show: Only 6,115 of 15-18 yr olds get jabbed in city||Mumbai: Over 1.75 lakh teenagers in Maharashtra came out to get vaccinated against Covid-19 on the first day of the rollout of the drive for the 15-18 age-group. Mumbai, its biggest district, however, saw a poor turnout, clocking barely 6,115 vaccinations — not even 1% of its target.  State data revealed 1,76,552 children took the shots till 6.30 pm on Monday, covering around 3% of the target population of 60.63 lakh in Maharashtra. Thane vaccinated nearly 20,000 (19,829) children, highest among districts, followed by Pune (17,276). In Thane, sessions were held majorly within 16 school and college campuses to reduce travelling hassles for students. Mumbai’s vaccination turnout was about a third of the best performing districts.  Civic officials blamed poor numbers on the strategy to restrict the drive to nine jumbo vaccination centres, whereas other districts vaccinated by setting up booths at schools and colleges. “Our initial plan was to vaccinate at schools and colleges, but the Covid task force advised against it for fear of adverse events,” said AMC Suresh Kakani.  There were no side-effects reported on Monday among the vaccinated children. “If we don’t see any adverse events in another week, we will take the drive to campuses,” Kakani said, adding the city had the resources to finish vaccinating this group in a month. Mumbai has an estimated 6,12,461 adolescents in the age bracket of 15-17 years. In addition to 6,115 vaccinations in this age-group, another 1,043 were done among those who are 18, which have been added to the adult turnout figures, BMC said. CoWin too appears to have segregated children between 15-17 years from those in the 18 category. The drive was inaugurated by Aaditya Thackeray, minister of tourism and environment, virtually at an event held at BKC jumbo centre. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, said since Mumbai is seeing a surge in cases, many children must have got infected themselves or have infected people at home. “Children should get vaccinated at the earliest since it’s a safe vaccine,” he said.  The 9 jumbo centres were decorated with balloons and funky selfie stands to welcome the young beneficiaries. The sessions started around 11 am at most centres due to glitches in the CoWin portal. Students from BMC schools were brought in batches of 25-50 by their teachers and headmasters.“We had sent consent forms to parents 8 days ago and almost all signed in favour,” said Gayatri Wagh, shikshan sevak at MPS municipal school in Goregaon. The school vaccinated all 245 students. But not all schools saw that kind of response. A teacher from a Kalina school said many parents haven’t given consent. “We plan to counsel all of them,” she added. Dr Sachin Desai, state vaccination in-charge, said turnout was impressive in most districts. As more sessions are added, turnout will improve, he said. Ten districts had low turnout and vaccinated less than 1,000. Chandrapur (237) and Washim (224) saw lowest turnout.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/1st-day-poor-show-only-6115-of-15-18-yr-olds-get-jabbed-in-city/articleshow/88676110.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC floats tender for first Covid pill Molnupiravir||MUMBAI: The BMC has floated a tender to procure the first anti-viral Covid-19 pill Molnupiravir that got approval from the Indian drug regulator on December 28. The drug is already being prescribed in the private sector since it became available last Friday.  Thirteen Indian drug makers are set to manufacture the oral drug that has been developed by US-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in collaboration with Merck. In India, it has been approved under emergency use authorisation for treating adults with Covid-19 “who have high risk of progression to disease”. It is mainly for mild to moderate cases. “The Central Purchase Department has already placed an order for 10,000 bottles,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Some municipal Covid centres are getting the drug under corporate social responsibility shortly. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco Covid Centre in Goregaon, said she has been assured of doses that can support the treatment of 15 patients. “We should have the drug with us in a day or two,” she said. The treatment is a five-day course where a patient has to take four pills every day. It is not authorised for use in patients younger than 18 years.  Dr Vasant Nagvekar, an infectious diseases consultant at Lilavati Hospital and member of the Covid task force, said he has prescribed it to 20 patients since Friday. A five-day course of Molnupiravir is likely to cost Rs 2,500-Rs 3,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-floats-tender-for-1st-covid-pill-molnupiravir/articleshow/88676111.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: College attendance sees a dip post vacation as cases up||MUMBAI: City colleges opened to fewer students on Monday after the winter break. Amid rising Covid cases in the city, attendance of students, which had slightly improved last month, could drop, say principals. A few colleges are contemplating going back to online teaching if cases continue to rise in the coming days but are awaiting the government’s directive. Some colleges, including Mithibai and N M, have scheduled their postgraduate exams offline in the coming days. Several students are opposed to it, given the increasing number of cases. At Ramnarain Ruia College, attendance had gone up to 50% in some classes before Christmas. On Monday, though, fewer students reported to the college, said principal Anushree Lokur. “Some of the classes have exams, which are being taken online. For the rest, the attendance had dropped. We are following all Covid protocols strictly,” she said. Students from St Xavier’s College have their exams scheduled from Tuesday. “We are taking the exams online. Our teachers will be proctoring the exams from the college. At least for the next 10 days, we are not worried about having students on the campus,” said principal Rajendra Shinde. At C H M College, Ulhasnagar, attendance was poor even before the winter break. “On Monday, when we opened, we largely only saw science students coming for science practicals. Those are the only students,” said a senior faculty member. In the case of Birla College of Arts, Science and Commerce, director Naresh Chandra said there was 25% attendance on campus and most others were attending classes virtually. “Most parents are anxious and we are awaiting directions from the state government,” he said. Principals of several engineering colleges discussed their opening plans on Monday. Engineering colleges open on January 9 and with the rising Covid cases, they are wondering if they should hold classes virtually or throw open gates to students. “We will wait for guidelines from the government as the response from students is that it may not be safe to come to campus. There was some thought the upcoming exams could have been conducted in person. But that may not be possible, and we will have to continue online exams only,” said management council member and senior professor Vaibhav Narawde. Colleges under Vile Parle’s S V K M group have scheduled their postgraduate exams offline, which students are opposed to. Lords Universal College, too, has issued a schedule for offline exams for second- and third-year students. Student activist Chaitanya Prabhu said students have raised concerns ranging from increasing Covid cases to not being fully immunised. “Some have themselves tested positive and some are out of station. Students from Mithibai appealed to the college authorities to cancel offline exams,” he said. College officials were not available for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/college-attendance-sees-a-dip-post-vacation-as-cases-up/articleshow/88676112.cms||Yogita Rao

As a vast majority of breakthrough cases are mild or asymptomatic, people with breakthrough infections may not even know to get tested and can transmit the virus unknowingly. Hence early diagnosis is the key...,” stated the BMC circular. Some of the guidelines include an under 24-hour turn-around time for labs (from the time a swab sample is collected by a lab till declaration of the result to the BMC) and labs should post real-time entries of the results on the ICMR site. Objecting to it, Colaba corporator Makrand Narwekar wrote to the BMC chief, saying: “There is a Bombay High Court, Nagpur bench, order wherein pathology laboratories are directed to send RT-PCR test report to a patient on WhatsApp or hard copies immediately without waiting to upload on the ICMR portal.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/give-rt-pcr-results-in-24-hrs-bmc-to-labs/articleshow/88676113.cms||Richa Pinto

And so, we have sought additional doses from the Centre,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. The state has also demanded the Centre step in and reduce the cost of the monoclonal antibodies cocktail, which is around Rs 1.2 lakh. “The medicine which is expensive and will be required for patients should be provided to us at a subsidized rate,” Tope said. He said that the state has also demanded adequate supply of the newly approved anti-viral drug molnupiravir. The state has also requested the Centre to ensure supply of the S-gene drop out testing kits which will allow early detection of the Omicron variant. The Maharashtra government has also asked the Centre to review testing protocols at the international airports as there are no longer only a few nations where the variant is present. “There are no high-risk nations now. The variant is present in most countries, and so the testing protocols in which only passengers from a few countries are tested need to be reviewed,” said an official. After states like West Bengal and Haryana issued lockdown-like curbs in their states, the state has asked the Centre to issue standard protocols of curbs to check the spread of infection. “The definition of lockdown is different in different states. We have set a criteria of 40% bed occupancy and 700 metric tonnes of oxygen consumption for the lockdown. I have come to know that a lockdown has started in Haryana, and there are strict restrictions in Delhi. We have requested that a standard protocol of restrictions be issued by the Central government,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-asks-centre-for-90-lakh-more-vaccine-doses/articleshow/88676116.cms||---

The HC passed the order while granting bail to the accused in the Pocso case on a bond of Rs 25,000. The HC order said that once request of an investigating officer comes before a magistrate, “the magistrate shall not delay proceedings of recording of statement but for reasons to be recorded in writing, and shall complete the process, in any case, within seven days of receipt of such request.”Narration of delay by Manjunath Singe, deputy police commissioner, Zone-IX, in his affidavit “really reflects disturbing facts,” said Justice Nitin Sambre in his order last year. The HC directed the registrar to issue appropriate directions to all magistrates to expeditiously record statements under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC).A man accused and arrested by the Oshiwara police under Pocso for rape on October 15, 2020, had approached the HC to seek bail. His lawyer Meghna Gowalani argued that he was falsely implicated as there was no direct evidence to link him to the alleged crime.Additional public prosecutor J S Lohokare said following a fight with her mother, the minor met the accused who took “undue advantage of the situation” and committed the offence.The prosecutor said the fact is that the survivor was a minor and even if she was in love with the accused, it cannot support his claim of false implication as her consent would not be considered valid in law.The HC said, “it is apparent that the victim had a quarrel with her mother and voluntarily left home, met the accused and travelled in his car with him where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.” From case record, it can be inferred that she tried to commit suicide, a claim supported by medical evidence, the HC noted. When she parted ways with the accused, instead of going home she stayed out, and when police apprehended her, her mother lodged an FIR of rape under Pocso.Her conduct “prima facie narrates that she voluntarily joined company of the applicant,” said the HC. The HC was informed that the magistrate is now scheduled to record statement on January 5, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/record-statement-of-sexual-assault-survivors-in-7-days-hc-to-magistrates/articleshow/88676118.cms||---

This will bring it close to its target of electrifying 50% of the entire fleet in the near future. What is significant is that BEST is now going for 1,400 “bigger” single decker AC electric buses which measure 12 metres in length (as against 9 metre Midi and 7 metre Mini buses). This will increase the carrying capacity of office-goers and reduce wait time at the stops. “We have had enough of smaller buses that can access any lane and bylane of the city. We now want to focus on expediting journeys for office-goers and carrying maximum people in a single ride,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra. The 12-metre buses will be deployed on longer routes, arterial roads and also on all office-going routes during peak hours, he added. The other buses scheduled to be ordered in early 2022 are 400 AC electric Midis and 100 AC electric Minis, besides 200 AC electric double deckers. Commuters who spoke to TOI said introducing more electric buses should be coupled with “proper planning and deployment”. “The buses should not be bunched in close proximity on the same route, and the frequency should be such that there is a reasonable gap of at least 5 minutes between every bus. Otherwise, if 3 buses arrive together, one has to wait for 20-30 minutes for the fourth,” said Vikram Shukla, a regular bus commuter from CSMT to Colaba. Another office-goer said the new AC electric buses are operated by private agencies who provide the drivers. “These drivers need to be sensitised by BEST and trained not to drive rashly,” he said. On Wednesday, BEST also floated tenders to invite bids from private contractors for setting up 55 new public e-charging stations which will come up at the bus depots and bus stations across Mumbai in 2022. Sources said the contracts will be signed for 10 years; the e-charging stations on BEST plots will have charging points for buses, cars and two wheelers. “In future, we have decided to use only solar, solar-wind or hydro-based energy to power our e-buses,” Chandra said. He said that the undertaking will procure adequate solar energy by June 2023, to cater to over 2,100 electric buses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bests-electric-bus-fleet-to-see-sixfold-increase-this-year/articleshow/88676119.cms||Somit Sen

The surface road will be entirely removed on a 2.3km section of the 4.5km stretch between Fountain Hotel on the intersection with Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway and Gaimukh that has forests on both sides. The elevated section—spread in four stretches—will help prevent wildlife, especially leopards, from being run over on the road and allow free vehicular movement on the elevated road. “It is for the first time that a project is being altered anywhere in the world, specifically for the leopard,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust. “To enable heavy vehicles to go up the elevated road, the length of the ramp will be extended from 300m to 500m or even more. This section gets walled to help channel the animals to the underpasses.” He said forest chowkies will be set up near the underpasses for patrolling and to curb poaching. V Moppalwar, MSRDC managing director, said work on the elevated stretch will begin whenever the government grants permission. The forest department did suggest mitigation measures like large-box culverts and 16 hectares of compensatory afforestation. It even invoked a penal afforestation clause under Forest Conservation Act as Ghodbunder Road was widened using land from Sanjay Gandhi National Park without nod, three decades ago. With neither side relenting, the CM, in October, set up a panel with Wildlife Institute of India and Andheria as members. Ten days ago, the panel, MSRDC and forest departm-ent decided that there’ll be no surface road in stretches meant for animal underpasses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/for-safe-leopard-passage-no-surface-road-on-2-3km-of-ghodbunder-section/articleshow/88676120.cms||Clara Lewis

The civic-run jumbo centres are racing against time to add beds, while private hospitals have started reconverting many of their non-Covid wards to Covid sections. On Monday, 574 people were admitted to various city hospitals, up from 503 on Sunday, 389 on Saturday and 497 on Friday. A few hospitals have started recording a rise in ICU admissions, including many directly coming with low oxygen saturation levels. The BMC’s Monday figures showed that 12.2% (3,735) of the 30,565 Covid-19 beds in Mumbai are occupied. Of the 2,720 ICU beds, 14% are filled up. The city has been witnessing a surge in cases for the past two weeks and a rise in critical cases is typically seen from the second or the third week onwards. A lion’s share of the Covid beds in the city is in the public sector. As on Monday, the private sector had just 5,192 Covid beds, of which 838 (16%) regular beds and 180 (3%) ICU beds were occupied. At the Nesco jumbo centre in Goregaon, daily admissions have increased from seven on December 26 to nearly 120 on Monday. Around 510 beds out of the 1,172 ready ones were occupied on Monday noon. Dean Dr Neelam Andrade said they are planning to activate all 2,738 beds by January 10 and are recruiting healthcare workers every day. The ICU occupancy has risen to 20 from five a week ago, filling up 42% of the 48 beds. “Patients are requiring oxygen support, but nobody is on a mechanical ventilator,” she said. The Richardson and Cruddas jumbo hospital in Mulund is admitting between 70 and 90 patients daily. Dean Dr Pradeep Angre said till a week ago, they were admitting half that count. Ten of the 60 ICU beds are currently occupied.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitalisations-up-15-in-4-days-mumbai-in-bed-dash/articleshow/88676122.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The bank has also ended an impasse with key shareholders over the appointment of an auditor.However, to sustain the growth momentum, the bank will need to require its shareholders’ nod for raising capital. Currently the bank, which is run by a six-member board including two from the RBI, is engaged in a legal tussle with high net worth shareholders seeking board representation. The bank has no identifiable promoters. The RBI has taken the stand that shareholders cannot directly vote directors onto a bank’s board.Dhanlaxmi Bank MD & CEO J K Shivan said that the lender has managed to crack the small-sized corporate market. These borrowers have a triple-A rating but have a low funding requirement of around Rs 100 crore. As a result of lending to this segment, the bank has managed to grow its share of corporate loans from 25% to 29% as of December 2021. It has grown its overall loans by a 10.5% year-on-year as of end December — the highest in 10 quarters. The private lender had been struggling with credit growth because of its relatively smaller size and cautious approach. “We have got an approval from the board for co-lending with finance companies but we have not yet got into this. The next step is the business correspondent model for the microfinance segment, which we are approaching with caution,” said Shivan.Shivan expressed hope that the shareholders would approve the capital-raising. “Our business has picked up with credit-deposit ratio crossing 60% after a very long time. The only agenda is growth. There is no other agenda,” said Shivan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dhanlaxmi-bk-loans-grow-10-highest-in-10-quarters/articleshow/88676127.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Bengaluru||No takers for Kannada engineering course this year||BENGALURU: Not a single student in the state has opted for the Kannada medium engineering course, which was introduced for the first time this year. The last date to report to colleges was December 31. Overall, 23,001 seats are vacant in engineering colleges in the state. Engineering in the regional language was introduced as part of the National Education Policy from the academic year 2021-22. Three colleges in the state had offered seats from the first year; 72 seats were up for grabs. While there were students who had entered them as options in the initial rounds of counselling, not one of them reported to colleges. Visvesvaraya Technological University, the umbrella university for all engineering colleges, expressed surprise. “The colleges offering it were in rural areas. We were hoping there would be some takers. Maybe parents do not have confidence in the programme. We will strengthen it and introduce it in more colleges next year,” said Karisidappa, vice-chancellor, VTU. Overall, there are 16,457 seats that are vacant this year. While 64,484 seats were available through CET, 48,027 seats have been taken by students. Additionally, 6,544 students have not downloaded the admission order. Thus the total number of vacant seats are at 23001. “This year, the numbers are better than last year because of the number of students who passed out of II PU and the lack of cut-offs in CET. Many rural colleges have reported better intake. Streamwise, civil and mechanical engineering continue to suffer,” the VC said. While counselling for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, which allots seat for medical and dental courses, is yet to begin, KEA officials said there might be chances for students to leave the engineering seats once they have received the medical seats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-takers-for-kannada-engg-course-this-year/articleshow/88676138.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Culpable homicide cases on the rise as cops vet accidents due to negligence||Bengaluru: On the night of December 1, 2021, a youth driving his father’s car under the influence of alcohol ploughed into a group of seven women sitting by a roadside near Talaghattapura, killing three of them. On December 31 night, a truck driver mowed down a 37-year old motorist on Magadi Road in Byadarahalli.Traffic police promptly invoked IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the car driver. The truck driver was booked under IPC 304A (causing death due to negligence). Police officers said the car driver was guilty as he knew driving drunk could have fatal consequences for others and hence drew the sterner charge, whereas the truck driver was guilty of sheer negligence. IPC section 304 entails imprisonment up to 10 years, while section 304A draws a maximum sentence of two years. Under 304A, suspects can walk out on station bail. But in case of 304, court has to grant bail. Cops from Karnataka are vetting every case of death caused by negligence to assess the culpability of the accused and are not hesitating from invoking IPC section 304 wherever there is case for one.According to Karnataka police records, 70 cases were booked under IPC section 304 in 2019, while the number fell to 60 in 2020. Police attributed the dip to lockdown and other curbs on activities in the open. In the first 11 months of 2021, 76 cases were booked under the section across the state. About 90% of the cases booked under it relate to road accidents and the rest are cases of negligence with fatal consequences (deaths at construction sites and other places).When it comes to section 304A, 10,303 cases were booked in 2019. The number fell to 9,379 in 2020 and 8,632 in the first 11 months of 2021.However, there has been one acquittal in Section 304 cases during 2019-2021, while the rest are pending trial. According to DCP (west-traffic) Kuldeep Kumar Jain, there will be more convictions in future owing to the scientific evidence gathered from the crime scene. “We are focusing more on scientific evidence like drawing blood samples of the suspect to establish he is drunk, and collecting CCTV footage to prove how recklessly the suspect was driving/riding. With such evidence, we are confident of securing more convictions,” he said.Public prosecutor HS Satyavati opined that lack of eyewitness statements affects cases. “Also, police sometimes help parties go for out-of-court settlements and when such things happen, the case falls flat. Cases booked under section 304 largely occur during night and it is practically difficult to get eyewitnesses. Even if we do, most of them fail to appear during trial. If police succeed in getting FSL report confirming alcohol in blood and CCTV footage clearly showing rash driving, convictions can happen,” she said. Jain is confident of getting a conviction in the Talghattapura case. “We have drawn blood samples of the suspect and sent them to FSL. Prima facie, it has been proved through medical tests that the suspect was under influence of alcohol when the accident took place. A report by FSL will strengthen our chargesheet and help in getting the conviction,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/culpable-homicide-cases-on-the-rise-as-cops-vet-accidents-due-to-negligence/articleshow/88676141.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

This will avoid unnecessary competition between the two agencies over ridership. This will also help the suburban users in nearby towns,” said an official. “For instance, Namma Metro is now reaching till Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). So suburban rail could start from there and extend till Devanahalli. Similarly, suburban rail could start from BIEC (Bengaluru International Exhibition Centre) to Tumakuru, Kengeri to Ramanagara, Whitefield to Kolar, Bommasandra to Attibele and Yelahanka to Doddaballpur,” he said. He said the 148km-suburban rail project is mainly focusing within BBMP limits where Metro is expanding. “The proposed project cannot be called as suburban rail like in Mumbai and Chennai since it is not connecting satellite towns. If they start from Metro’s terminal stations, people in peripheral areas will benefit since they can shift to Metro to reach the city with better multi-modal integration,” he said. In November 2021, Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), which is executing the suburban rail project (four corridors), floated the civil work tender for the Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara (Mallige) line. Civil work tender for Heelalige-Rajankunte (Kanaka) will be floated next. However, other two corridors KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli (Sampige) and Kengeri—Whitefield (Parijaata) which run parallel to Metro will be taken up only later. While sanctioning the project in October 2020, the Centre had stated that the entire project will be completed in six years (2026) and the airport corridor (KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli) in three years (2023). K-RIDE officials said they will need to extend their network from the city limits to its outskirts. “This 148-km network is only the first phase. We’ll need another 160-km network to connect satellite towns in the next phase. Suburban rail will also have AC coaches and stations like Metro but the fare will be cheaper. All four corridors will be over in six years,” said an official. However, a BMRCL official said: “We are not against the suburban project but Sampige and Parijaata corridors will be running parallel to our lines (Kengeri-Whitefield Metro and KR Puram-KIA). Why should two agencies kill each other? We’ve also asked K-RIDE not to poach employees.” BMRCL plans to expand the network from 56-km to 170-km by 2024. Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a rail activist, said: “Suburban rail is a mass public transport system so it cannot be considered as a feeder service to Metro. While Metro will have stations at every 1km, suburban rail will have limited stations. The average speed of a Metro is 30kmph but for a suburban it is 60-80kmph. Suburban rail is utilising the existing rail infrastructure for its expansion and it can also operate non-AC trains unlike Metro.” Rajkumar Dugar, founder & convener, Citizens for Citizens, an NGO, said: “Bengaluru is not a monopoly of Namma Metro and there should be multiple options for passengers. It depends who provides cheaper and faster options. The suburban rail’s airport corridor received approval from the Centre nine months before Metro’s KR Puram-KIA line, but it is not being taken up on priority due to pressure from BMRCL.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/suburban-rail-should-start-where-namma-metro-ends-says-bmrcl/articleshow/88676143.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Aside from the human space (Gaganyaan) and lunar (Chandrayaan-3) missions, the space agency also has its eyes set on three key missions: Disha, a twin-satellite system that will study Earth’s aeronomy, the uppermost layer of Earth’s atmosphere. Trishna, a joint mission with CNES, the French space agency, meant for accurate mapping of land surface temperatures. And a mission to Venus.While Trishna is scheduled for a 2024 launch, no immediate timeline is available for Disha and the Venus mission. Besides, some work is expected to happen on the NISAR and Xposat missions too. However, in terms of launch missions, Isro may only manage an uncrewed Gaganyaan mission and Chandrayaan-3 other than the regular earth observations, SSLV and commercial satellite missions. According to scientists from Isro, Disha will be implemented by the Physical Research Laboratory. Short for “Disturbed and quiet-type System at High Altitude”, it’ll involve twin satellites orbiting Earth at an altitude of 450km. “...Three new space science missions are in the pipeline: Disha, the Venus mission and the Isro-CNES joint mission Trishna. Trishna is meant for accurate mapping of land surface temperatures and will be the benchmark for temperature data at best resolution and repeatability globally,” Sivan said in his New Year address.Farming, Water Mgt & Land PlanningAccording to CNES, Trishna — Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment — will acquire imagery of Earth’s surface in the thermal infrared with a resolution and revisit frequency never seen before. “Trishna is designed to observe Earth’s surface in the thermal infrared domain. Temperature is an indicator of the energy budget of land surfaces — croplands, pastures, forests, urban areas, snow and ice — and yields a wealth of information such as plant water stress and evapotranspiration,” CNES’ description of Trishna, reads. Today, temperature measurements from space can only be obtained monthly at a resolution of about 100 metres, and daily global measurements are only available at a resolution of one kilometre, CNES said.Gaganyaan, Chandrayaan-3 & AdityaAs reported earlier by TOI, Sivan reiterated that Gaganyaan has completed the design phase and entered the testing phase. “Tests are in progress for human-rated L-llO Vikas engine, Cryogenic stage, Crew escape system motors and service module propulsion system. The S200 motor has been realised for ground testing too. Main parachute drop test has also commenced. Astronauts have completed the generic spaceflight training abroad,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/packed-22-for-isro-with-disha-trishna-venus-missions-work-on-gaganyaan-will-continue/articleshow/88676145.cms||---

Dismissing a petition filed by Malingappa from Raichur, justice HP Sandesh pointed out that in Banarsi Dad vs Teeku Dutta and another case (2005), the Supreme Court had already held that DNA test to determine paternity is not to be directed as a matter of routine but only in deserving cases. “There is no prohibition on ordering DNA test and the same is subject to facts and circumstances of the case,” the judge noted. The petitioner’s blood sample was drawn on January 5, 2017. While the first report came on February 27, 2017, the final opinion was out on March 30, 2017. The petitioner challenged the decision to subject him to DNA test last year. Justice Sandesh pointed out that the move to challenge the decision to subject him to the test four years after receipt of the report that the petitioner is the biological father of the child was nothing but an attempt to overcome the positive result. “It has to be noted that the magistrate has secured the accused and examined him (on camera) and explained the consequences and thereafter he gave the consent and the magistrate directed the CMO and investigating officer to follow the procedure as laid down under sections 53, 53A and 164A of CrPC. Only in compliance of the same and on the consent of the accused, which has been recorded in the order sheet, was the drawing of the blood sample ordered,” the judge added. The petitioner claimed the survivor had already married another person and the child in question had already died. He claimed the blood sample was drawn against his will and it is violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution and also amounted to self-incrimination. Article 20(3) (3) says that no person accused of any offence will be compelled to be a witness against himself. In the plaint dated October 4, 2016, the survivor had alleged that the petitioner raped her and threatened her life if she revealed it to her family. Taking advantage of this, he allegedly repeated the act 3-4 times and she became pregnant. The complaint was lodged when she was in the seventh month of pregnancy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dna-test-of-rape-accused-to-determine-paternity-not-self-incriminatory-hc/articleshow/88676146.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||IT giants may see strong QoQ growth in Oct-Dec||Bengaluru: IT companies, many of which will announce their December quarter numbers over the next two weeks, are expected to come out with strong sequential revenue growth figures. The December quarter normally is a weak one because of fewer working days. Motilal Oswal expects tier-1 IT companies to deliver 3.2-4.8% sequential, or quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), constant currency revenue growth, and tier-2 players to deliver in a wider band of 3.6-7.1%. The brokerage firm expects a strong initial outlook for FY23, with companies maintaining their view of multi-year growth tailwinds on the back of cloud migration. Guidance for the last quarter of this fiscal is also expected to be positive on the back of continuing deal wins. “Strong growth in Q3 should again result in Infosys increasing its FY22 revenue growth guidance,” it said in a note.Kotak Institutional Equities expects sequential growth rates between 2.6% and 6%. “Despite the impact of furloughs, we forecast extremely strong revenue growth led by high discretionary and continuing transformation spends. Wipro, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies will likely deliver 4.5% growth in constant currency. We forecast Infosys’s growth at 3.7% and TCS to deliver modest 2.6% QoQ growth. Mid-tier companies will likely deliver revenue growth rate at 5% to 6% in constant currency, healthy overall with YoY growth ranging 20-34%,” it said.Investment firm Emkay said it expects Infosys to revise its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 17.5-18%, from the current 16.5-17.5%. Wipro, it said, is expected to guide for 2-4% constant currency QoQ revenue growth for the fourth quarter of the current fiscal.Kotak Institutional Equities said mega-deal closures are down to a trickle as clients shun large consolidation deals. “The net result is a weak TCV (total contract value) number. A weak TCV number need not translate into weak revenue growth. The fact is that the market is buoyant with high velocity of continuing transformation deals that will take a few years to achieve but broken down into smaller packets.”It expects a 22-25% voluntary attrition for Bengaluru-based companies and marginally lower for others. Backfilling of attrition, it said, will typically cost more and will be either through use of subcontractors (that cost at least 30% more than own employees), and/or through lateral hires (that cost at least 30% higher). “Either ways, expect margin headwind on a quarterly basis even if the company does not have a wage revision that is due. Higher the attrition, higher the margin headwind. A few companies such as Infosys and Wipro may end with 24-25% attrition on trailing 12 months basis,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/it-giants-may-see-strong-qoq-growth-in-oct-dec/articleshow/88676148.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Initially, the flight crew stated that the generator was not functioning, but claimed the issue was resolved before the flight took off,” said Desai.He said the flight was fully packed with passengers, including senior citizens and kids. “There was a heated argument between flyers and the crew as the AC was not working during the entire trip. Passengers were wearing masks, so all were suffocated. Some even removed their masks and started fanning themselves with magazines,” said Desai. He said the crew claimed that temperature at ground level was high, which was the reason for the lack of AC. “But they didn’t resolve the issue even after the flight landed at Bengaluru airport at 10.10pm,” he alleged. “We were made to sit in the plane earlier as per the procedures. So we had to bear this torture for over an hour,” said Desai, who has complained to Directorate General of Civil Aviation, SpiceJet, and others through social media.No complaints: SpiceJet “There was no problem with the air-conditioning on SpiceJet flight SG 3009 on January 1. It was on time and the aircraft continued with its next rotation without delay. No complaint was raised by any passenger either on board with the crew or at the airport,” a SpiceJet spokesperson stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/passengers-sweat-as-flight-takes-off-with-faulty-ac/articleshow/88676151.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Congress to go ahead with Mekedatu padayatra even if lockdown is imposed||Times News NetworkBengaluru/Mysuru: A shadow hangs over Congress’ much-hyped padayatra to build pressure on the BJP government to start work on the Mekedatu balancing reservoir project, with the state government likely to impose restrictions on rallies and public meetings owing to Omicron fears. However, before holding a huge rally in Mysuru to galvanise party workers for the 160km padayatra, opposition leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president DK Shivakumar asserted they will go ahead with the event even if the government tries to stop them by imposing Covid restrictions. The 10-day padayatra, scheduled to start from Mekedatu on January 9 morning, will culminate with a public meeting at Basavanagudi grounds. Home minister Araga Jnanendra in Chikkamagaluru said Congress should postpone it considering the prevailing situation. “The opposition party has the freedom to organise such events but not when people’s lives are at stake,” he said. Jnanendra said imposing lockdown would be inevitable if the public doesn’t cooperate by following Covid-appropriate behaviour and the government will have to take tough decisions to avoid further spread of the infection. “It is the duty of the government to protect people’s lives,” he added.Dubbing the padayatra an election gimmick, cooperation minister ST Somashekar asked Congress leaders to drop it, saying the Covid infection rate is spiking in the state and the event could prove disastrous. “We all know what happened during the second wave. It should not repeat. In the interest of the people, the padayatra should be deferred,” he said. “They didn’t implement the project when they were in power. Now, for political gains, the padayatra is planned,” Somashekar alleged.Water resources minister Govind Karjol said Congress leaders are taking out the padayatra to “lose belly fat” and claimed he has documents to prove laxity of then Congress government (2013-2018) in the implementation of Mekedatu project. He also alleged Congress has no moral standing to take out the padayatra when it has an alliance with the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu as the latter is opposing the project. However, Congress leaders seem firm. “We have information that BJP is attempting to stall the padayatra citing Covid. The government may forcefully impose a lockdown too to stop us. But we would rather go to jail than drop the padayatra,” Shivakumar said.He said the party has made all preparations to conduct the padayatra by adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing masks, using sanitisers etc. The party has placed an order for one lakh masks, and will sanitise activists staying in choultries and mutts along the padayatra route, deploy 100 doctors from the KPCC doctors’ cell and set up 10 mobile health check-up units to ensure safety of the participants, the Congress leaders said.Siddaramaiah advised party workers to be mentally prepared to get arrested during the padayatra as the BJP government could disrupt it by using police force.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/congress-to-go-ahead-with-mekedatu-padayatra-even-if-lockdown-is-imposed/articleshow/88676152.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Even as border row hots up, enrolment in Karnataka’s Marathi schools surges||BENGALURU: Amid the border and linguistic conflict between Karnataka and Maharashtra, a stark reality is that enrolment in Marathi medium schools in Karnataka has increased. Over 1.09 lakh students currently study in as many as 1,272 government, government-aided and private schools in the state. Of these, 69,339 students are studying in as many as 950 state-run Marathi schools, with the rest being government-aided or private schools in the same medium. Though a recent study by the education department shows a significant decrease in admission in several minority schools, including Urdu medium schools, which has the highest enrolment, Marathi continues to be the preferred medium primarily due to strong influence of the language in border districts of Belagavi, Vijayapura and Bagalkot, all adjoining Maharashtra. While in Belagavi for the winter session of the assembly, primary and secondary education minister B C Nagesh had visited some Marathi government schools. But he found it difficult to interact with the students as most of them could not converse in Kannada, and the minister could not speak Marathi. “A Marathi-speaking local block education officer who was conversant in Kannada acted as translator for the minister,” said a close aide of Nagesh. While efforts are on to provide basic Kannada education to kids in minority schools, most of them are unable to pick up the language as the mode of communication between kids is not in the state language. Department of public instruction commissioner R Vishal says they have had several requests from minority schools to introduce Kannada as a language. “While there may be politics involved in minority language schools, parents of children studying there now want Kannada education as they will require at least a functional knowledge of the local language for further studies and jobs,” said Vishal. Other language schools like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam are seeing a significant drop in enrolments. There are zero enrolments in Malayalam medium secondary education schools and only 233 kids in the same language primary schools.  “Many linguistic minority families are shifting their children to English medium schools,” said an official in the education department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/even-as-border-row-hots-up-enrolment-in-karnatakas-marathi-schools-surges/articleshow/88676154.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai’s maiden budget looks to double GSDP by 2025||BENGALURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has set an ambitious target of doubling the state’s GSDP (gross state domestic product) from the present Rs 17 lakh crore to Rs 34 lakh crore by 2025. He is likely to propose new policies to that effect in his maiden budget to be presented in March. Experts, while seeing the potential in the state’s economy, have warned the government that the target cannot be achieved unless the chief minister brings much-needed reforms in terms of revenue mobilisation, growth-oriented policies and plugging loopholes in the administration. Officials in the CM’s office said Bommai, who holds the finance portfolio, has already begun preparation for the budget for 2022-23 and is looking to propose game-changing policies to drive exponential growth in the GSDP. “We’ve prepared a paper detailing the steps to be taken to make Karnataka a 500-billion dollar economy by 2025. It contains the blueprint of policies to achieve the target. The CM is likely to emphasise on this and his new ideas are going to be reflected in it,” said N Manjunath Prasad, principal secretary to the CM. Prasad said the government is looking at policies to improve the contribution of all three sectors — services, manufacturing and agriculture — to the GSDP. The focus is on the service sector and plans are afoot to ensure its contribution is enhanced from 54% to 66% in three years, he added. The manufacturing sector will see more policies like the ease-of-doing business, while those meant for agriculture aim at increasing income of farmers. “One such policy is to establish a secondary directorate of agriculture that focuses on agriculture-allied activities. An order is expected on Monday,” said Prasad. ISN Prasad, additional secretary, finance, said the preliminary exercise of the budget preparation began in early November and data from various departments was being collected. A final discussion will be held in February. Meanwhile, experts said serious efforts are needed in bringing reforms to the taxation policy and changing the structural administration to achieve the target. M Govind Rao, economist and former director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, described GST as a revenue machine and opined that states and the Centre should make use of its potential to achieve faster economic growth. “All petroleum products, liquor, real estate and services like electricity supply should be brought under GST and rationalisation of tax rates into two slabs is essential,” he added. Bommai heads a group of ministers (GoM) on GST rate rationalisation and the hope is that he will ensure consensus among the states for rate rationalisation in the GST council. S Sampathraman, chairman of All-India Manufacturing Organisation, Karnataka Council, said the government should focus on bringing down skyrocketing prices of raw materials and manage the pandemic without curbs like lockdown. “Otherwise, the doubling of GSDP will only be a pipe dream,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cms-maiden-budget-looks-to-double-gsdp-by-2025/articleshow/88676156.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

District collectors are already engaged in identifying suitable sites in areas other than corporations and municipalities, said sources. “Installation of solar energy power stations would help reduce dependency on high-cost power purchase from private power producers. The plan is to set up 20,000MW of solar energy power stations and 10,000MW battery storage systems over 10 years. It will help that state supply uninterrupted power to consumers,” electricity minister Senthil Balaji told TOI. In the first phase, the government is planning to establish solar energy power stations of 4,000MW and 2,000MW of battery storage system. Tamil Nadu’s existing installed capacity of solar power generation is 4,561MW. Each district collector has been told to identify land to an extent of 20 to 200 acres suitable for setting up 5MW to 50MW solar parks in one or more locations. Even some government departments like Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments and Salt Corporation are being roped in to implement the project. Balaji said the capital investment for setting up solar parks would primarily be made by the government. The private solar power generators would continue to be encouraged. Private solar power generators sell power to Tangedco at Rs 3.30 per unit. The growing power demand and the necessity to purchase power from the exchange at high cost to ensure uninterrupted power supply have forced Tangedco to look at renewable energy as a permanent solution. Sources say the agency’s plan is to supply solar power to the agriculture sector in a phased manner, given that the state has 3,200 agriculture feeders and 21 lakh agriculture service connections. Installation of solar parks in all districts will come in handy for the power managers. It will also minimise transmission loss. The discom is also set to procure 1,500MW from Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited under the Union ministry of new and renewable energy at Rs 2.54 per unit to meet its solar renewable purchase obligation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/state-govt-asks-collectors-to-identify-sites-for-solar-parks/articleshow/88676160.cms||Julie Mariappan

The clerk, Tikka Ram, 28, of Rajasthan, told police that he had spent the night at the ticketing office as he had to open for business by 4.30am.  Ram told police that he stepped out of the ticket counter room around 4.15am to open the main gate for the public. When he was returning to the room, the trio accosted him. One of them pointed a gun at him and took him inside the ticket counter and tied him up with the help of another masked intruder. While the third man kept watch, the others emptied the safe and all three fled. Around 4.30am, a man who wanted to travel by the first train to Chennai Beach railway station found the ticket counter empty. He peeped inside and found Ram tied up, police said. The man went inside and released Ram and informed the city police control room. Ram, who’s still being questioned, told police the masked intruders spoke in Tamil and abused him. He said they had a gun, but was unable to describe it, police said. A sniffer dog brought in to scent-trail the suspects crossed the road and ran towards a commercial complex housing a software firm behind Tidel Park. Police were questioning three security guards there. The station has no CCTV cameras, so police don’t have footage of the culprits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mrts-clerk-says-armed-gang-robbed-1-3-lakh-cops-smell-a-rat/articleshow/88676162.cms||A Selvaraj

Some candidates with high scores in NEET 2021 have already joined other courses while other toppers are worried about the possibility of having to study along with their juniors due to the extraordinary delay in medical admissions this year due to pending court cases and the pandemic. Around 42,000 students have registered online for MBBS, BDS 2021-22 counselling while 33,000 students have sent their applications so far for the medical admissions. The last date for registering online is January 7. Ranjitha from Mylapore who scored above 600 marks in NEET 2021, has joined Anna University as a back-up plan. "Now, we are about to complete the first semester and reach the stage of assessment. It adds an extra-pressure to decide whether to continue in engineering or to join MBBS. There are many students like me," she said. Students also worried about rushing through the first-year syllabus of MBBS due to the delay in the counselling. Anirudh, who has secured more than 650 marks in NEET 2021, said there was no information about the counselling though it had been four months since the NEET exam was held. "If the counselling starts now, we can plan accordingly," he said. Dharani, a topper among government school students in NEET 2021, has already lost several months. "My brother is in Class XII. It seems both of us will start going to college at the same time," she said. PV Ramachandran, course coordinator for medical programmes, FIITJEE, Chennai, said students who had done very well in NEET were now under stress due to delay in medical counselling. "Due to uncertainty, many parents are pressuring students to join other courses as a back-up," he said. The National Medical Commission has postponed the counselling for all-India quota till the case regarding following EWS quota for all-India quota (AIQ) seats is decided by the Supreme Court. "We normally start counselling after the first round of counselling for AIQ seats is completed. This will give toppers an opportunity to choose seats from AIQ. So, it will give more seats to Tamil Nadu students," an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/med-aspirants-anxious-over-long-wait-for-counselling/articleshow/88676165.cms||A Ragu Raman

The farmer, Neelamegam, suffered a heart attack and died on Sunday after being harassed by the officials of the finance firm for signing a bond.Police said Neelamegam had signed a surety for his friend Ravi, who took a loan from a private finance firm to buy a truck and an earth mover last year. Since Ravi suffered losses in his business due to the lockdown, he was unable to pay the loan interest on a regular basis. The company officials seized his farm equipment, besides abusing him citing non-repayment of interest. A couple of minutes later, he collapsed and died of a heart attack. A probe is on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/farmers-death-kin-hold-protests/articleshow/88676166.cms||---
---||Chennai||Only intention of some univs is to mint money: HC||Chennai: Terming a Salem-based private deemed to be university a ‘commercial broker,’ the Madras high court has observed that the real intention of such universities is to mint money by giving certificates without providing quality education. “Such universities must realise that education is different from qualification,” a division bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice A A Nakkiran said.The court made the observations on an appeal moved by a group of engineers working in Tangedco challenging the order of a single judge granting re-designation of posts of junior engineers who have obtained engineering degree through distance education as assistant engineers.All the junior engineers obtained a degree in mechanical engineering through distance mode from Vinayaka Mission University, Salem. Since their representation for re-designation was not considered they moved the high court.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court suspended their degrees in a similar batch of petitions and said that the university was not justified in introducing any new courses in technical education without the approval of AICTE. The apex court directed the AICTE to conduct an appropriate test to the degree holders giving them two attempts to clear the exam. Since the junior engineers cleared the exams in the second attempt, a single judge of the court directed the Tangedco to re-designate them as assistant engineers.Aggrieved, a group of engineers who obtained degrees through regular mode have moved the present appeal. They contended that as per TNEB Service Regulations degrees obtained through distance mode are not recognised. They further added that the re-designation has also shuffled the seniority. Concurring with the submissions, the court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the single judge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/only-intention-of-some-univs-is-to-mint-money-hc/articleshow/88676168.cms||---

Exits by value grew fivefold from $7 billion in 2020 and the number of exits jumped 72% from 157 in 2020, according to data from Venture Intelligence.Many marquee investors with long-term bets in India clocked double-digit returns last year, analysts said. The increased number of exits in 2021 is likely to have a domino effect as LPs (limited partnerships) flush with funds will reinvest actively, they added.Venture Intelligence data showed that exits via strategic sales stood at $14.5 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2020. About $11-billion worth secondary sales were made compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Public market sales zoomed to $12 billion. In terms of investments, PE-VC firms invested a record $63 billion (across 1,202 deals) in 2021 — a 57% rise over the previous year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pvt-investor-exits-hit-record-38-7bn-in-2021-due-to-ipos/articleshow/88676175.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The airport is rated among the top 10 airports in the world for punctuality in the large airports category by an air travel data and analytics company. Ontime departure was 89.32% for 49,923 flights on 70 routes and the airport is ranked number eight, the only one in the country, after airports in Japan, Russia, Peru and Panama. Airport director Sharad Kumar said that "ontime departures were ensured with the help of multiple agencies including airlines, airport staff, CISF and others who worked as a team." This helped in quick turn around and ontime departure, he added. Chennai Airport has worked out detailed plans to enhance operational capacity. AAI has already commissioned one rapid exit taxiway and two parallel taxiways which has helped in quick handling of flights. Plans are afoot to shape up additional facilities to enhance the per hour handling capacity. "We are anticipating increased footfalls and are accordingly augmenting our facilities and services. Traffic figures indicate more than 80% recovery in domestic traffic," said Kumar. The airport currently handles around 330 flights per day, including international flights. The firm has reported that the data is collected and curated from more than 600 sources of real-time flight information, including airlines but also airports, global distribution systems, positional data, civil aviation authorities or air navigation services, proprietary data partnerships and the web, said a statement from AAI.

The victim, identified as Eswaran, was employed at a fuel station in Thathangkuppam shut the bunk around 11 PM. He was counting the day’s collection before returning home for the day. A bike-borne duo came to the petrol bunk and asked Eswaran to refuel their bike for 50. When Eswaran told the two men identified as Sham and Prashanth that the bunk had closed its services while leaving, the duo got into an argument with him. In a fit of rage, they attacked him and fled from the scene. An injured Eswaran informed the owner and manager of the petrol bunk before alerting the cops. He was admitted to Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for treatment. A team led by Rajamangalam inspector of police A Kannan traced Sham, 26, of Kolathur, and Prashanth, 25, from Bhagavathi Amman Koil Street using CCTV footage. Eswaran told the cops that he refused to refill their vehicle as he had turned off the bunk meters and other motors. The duo, who seemed in a hurry, kept insisting that he refills their bike.

---||Chennai||Sewage fills pits dug for Skywalk project at T Nagar terminus||CHENNAI: Ongoing work of the city corporation’s Skywalk bridge project has led to sewage pools outside the T Nagar bus terminus, at the Madley Road junction. In a bid to expedite the works on the long-pending 30 crore ‘Smart City’ Skywalk bridge project, that connects T Nagar bus terminus with Mambalam Railway Station, the civic body weeks ago dug up three portions outside the T Nagar bus terminus to erect pillars connecting to the bridge. Ward-level engineers said while digging up, they had to open sewage lines, which resulted in a nonstop flow of sewage in the pits. On Monday, when TOI visited the spot, the civic body was seen pumping out the sewage water into nearby drains to remove the pool, but sewage kept flowing. “Only after pumping out a considerable amount of sewage, we can close the entry point,” said a ward engineer. The stench in the area has inconvenienced both motorists as well as bus passengers. The pits also pose a threat to pedestrians who can fall them. GIS consultant Dhayanand Krishnan, who has worked on projects for the city corporation, said it is important to find out if the erected pillars have damaged the underground drainage lines which run beneath the central median of the road. If the sewage does not overflow from the drainage, then the civic body must find out if illegal sewage lines are connected to the nearby stormwater drains along the road. “T Nagar is a commercial area, and the small-scale shops may have illegally connected sewage lines into the SWD,” he added. When TOI visited this place, most parts of the drains along Usman Road and Madley Road were filled with sewage, indicating entry. The sewage flowing from Usman Road through Madley Road is now entering into the dug-up pits in the junction. The skywalk pillars erected on the Usman Road are right on the stormwater drain, breaking the structure as well. All the shop owners on the Usman Road have placed temporary wooden boards for the visitors to enter their stores. Corporation’s smart city officials said works on Skywalk Project were started post-Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. “We are expecting to complete it by 2022 end. The sewage overflow from nearby drains will be plugged soon once the pits are cleared,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sewage-fills-pits-dug-for-skywalk-project-at-t-nagar-terminus/articleshow/88676178.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Hatchbacks continue to rule big on automart||Chennai: Call it the hatch hurrah. Hatchbacks, which comprised 4 out of the top 10 models in calendar year 2021, command 50% of the 14 lakh units sold by the top 10 models. The hatch hold has in fact played out over the past 7 years even as SUVs more than doubled contribution. Since 2014-15, the hatchback segment has continued to hold its own contributing between 45%-47% of the passenger vehicle sales even as the SUV contribution has gone from 14.5% in FY14-15 to 32% in FY21 and 47% in the year-to-date fiscal. Auto consultants say that the jump in SUV volumes is also due to the sub-4-meter compact segment. “It is because of compact SUVs in the Rs 9- Rs 10 lakh category that the overall SUV share has gone up — without it, the SUV share is not so high,” said Hemal Thakkar, director, CRISIL Research. According to industry estimates, SUVs comprise 38% of calendar year passenger vehicle sales of which entry SUVs comprise 21%. The reason why compacts — SUV and hatch — rule the market is because of affordability. And Maruti Suzuki has managed to retain its market leadership thanks to its hold on the sub-4 metre models. “In calendar 2021, Maruti Suzuki has 8 out of 10 top models, the highest in the last 10 years,” said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director-marketing & sales, Maruti Suzuki. Auto consultants say there is a reason why the hatch numbers have grown so sharply even within the top 10 lineup – these are affordable cars. Also the SUV growth has not eaten into the hatch share. “The hatchback segment continues to constitute a healthy proportion of sales on account of affordability, but the sedan segment has seen numbers dwindle with recent new launches also being in SUV category,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP & sector head ICRA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hatchbacks-continue-to-rule-big-on-automart/articleshow/88676181.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Robbery exposes lack of security at MRTS stations||CHENNAI: Monday’s early morning robbery at the Thiruvanmiyur MRTS railway station exposes the lack of security at the sprawling complex that extends for half a km on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR). There are four official entry and exit points, but at least half-a-dozen more escape routes are available. There are no CCTV cameras at the station, which is also ill-lit. A railway official said the daily collection is around 30,000 from ticket sales. The money was apparently kept in the drawers of a few tables in the ticket counter rather than in the safe. Railway officials said there was some much cash (1.3 lakh) as the collection since December 29 could not be deposited because of bank holidays. The cash is normally deposited in the SBI once or twice a week under the escort of one RPF constable. The staff at the MRTS ticket counters sit behind locked grill doors because they are not comfortable working alone at the stations, which hardly see footfalls for the most part of the day. "There is some movement of people during peak hours. But hardly anyone walks in during the forenoon and in the afternoon. We sit in the counters with the doors locked," said a staff member. The huge MRTS stations with multiple exits offer easy escape routes for culprits. A senior RPF official said, "We have beefed up security at MRTS stations by deploying more personnel. Most of the stations have RPF presence as the entire stretch is considered sensitive. We have already told personnel on duty to be on the move inside the stations. They cover the platform, come down to the ground floor where the counters are and then go up to the platforms. The personnel are deployed based on the daily passengers and availability of staff. We are planning to bring in more people." A railway official said, "Chennai division has finalised a tender install a video surveillance system at all MRTS stations. Around 20 CCTV cameras are to be installed in the Thiruvanmiyur station by June 2022." The CCTV system is being installed using the Nirbhaya fund.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/robbery-exposes-lack-of-security-at-mrts-stations/articleshow/88676185.cms||V Ayyappan

N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD said while the minimum temperature along coastal areas may drop a degree, it is likely to reduce further in interior districts. While mercury may rise again during night time towards the end of week, meteorologists said there are chances of rainfall in coastal areas early next week, as wind directions are likely to change to warm southeasterly winds from the sea. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast temperatures to be around a maximum of 30°C and a minimum of 23°C in the city and the surrounding areas with skies likely to be partly cloudy. On Monday, Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 23.1°C and 22°C minimum temperatures which were 1.6°C and 1°C above normal. But they may drop in the next two or three days. “It may be only a marginal dip in temperature but there are also chances of haze or mist because of the convergence of warm easterly winds and cold northerly winds,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather. After two or three days, a change in wind direction could bring rain back to the city. Experts said a western disturbance or a low pressure area moving from the west over India could bring rain to many places in north India. It may change the wind direction over TN from northeasterly to southeasterly leading to a rise in minimum temperature and some wet spells as well due to convergence of opposing winds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/winds-from-north-may-bring-back-nip-in-air-for-three-days/articleshow/88676184.cms||---

On December 14, 2021 the court passed the interim orders and said that using the national emblem after retirement and completion of tenure by officials and MPs is a violation of the Emblem and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.“Rules were framed allowing only the sitting MPs, ministers and judges to use the national emblem on their official cars. However, after retirement even a subordinate rank government employee is using the national emblem on their cars,” the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/1-5l-cases-booked-for-misuse-of-stickers-dgp-informs-hc/articleshow/88676186.cms||---

While the Centre was asking the states to follow all the Covid 19 guidelines, the BJP MP himself violated them. “If he (Sanjay) wants to stage a dharna or deeksha, he should do it infront of the PM's house in Delhi demanding one crore jobs for youth. This deeksha is nothing but for political gains," Kamalakar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bandi-deekhsa-nothing-but-drama-gangula/articleshow/88676190.cms||---

Later, when it sought a renewal, industries department secretary pointed out there is no provision for renewal. As the company did not utilise the first lease, its renewal was rejected. Raghuram Cements remained the sole applicant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-quid-pro-quo-cbi-has-no-case/articleshow/88676192.cms||---

None of the TRS leaders adhere to Covid-19 protocol and they do not wear masks in public.” The Union minister said that Sanjay started the protests over GO 317 after discussing the issue in the party and asked, “How come TRS is afraid of his protests?”Objecting to police cutting through grills to enter the party office where Sanjay and supporters had locked themselves in on Sunday night, he said, “Is it the right thing to do? What is wrong with fighting for the rights of employees? West Bengal-style politics will not suit here.” Condemning Sanjay’s arrest, senior BJP leader Gudur Narayan Reddy said, “Police are working like activists of TRS. Ever since TRS lost in Huzurabad, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is feeling insecure.” Gudur said: “We will continue to fight on behalf of the people and would see to it that TRS is chased away from the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kishan-mocks-cops-for-citing-covid-rules-at-bjp-protest/articleshow/88676193.cms||---

Although the government had discontinued their salaries within months of their absenteeism, holding up of posts by these doctors affected the functioning of institutions. “Many of these doctors may not have been interested in government duty and took up better opportunities somewhere. People just disappear from their duties without informing anyone. In that case, we have to follow due procedure, seek explanations and then terminate based on that,” said K Ramesh Reddy, DME, Telangana. Soon after taking up the health portfolio in November, 2021, health minister Harish Rao instructed the DME to act against doctors running their private clinics by staying absent from government hospitals. He decided to assess the performance of each and every government doctor and instructed the concerned district officials to prepare a list of all government doctors running private clinics and assess their performance and time spent with patients at the government hospitals. Following this, the DME is now keeping a close tab on all such doctors who are indulging in such practices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/docs-left-govt-work-for-ownclinics-or-better-job-abroad/articleshow/88676196.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||38 ‘absentee’ doctors at govt hospitals shown door in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Amid fears of Covid-19 third wave, 38 truant doctors working at government hospitals and medical colleges across the state are being shown the door. The action has been taken by K Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education (DME), Telangana. The DME was notified that total 43 doctors were on ‘unauthorised absence’ in various institutions. Some of them have been absent since 2001. Many were from Osmania Medical College, Government Medical Colleges and Niloufer Hospital. Subsequently, an inquiry committee was constituted which sought explanations and rejoining dates from these doctors. The committee submitted the report recommending termination of 38 of the 43 doctors. Many of those pulling the vanishing act were assistant professors in key departments such as neurology, anaesthesia, paediatric surgery, opthamology, pharmacy, among others. “We have observed many of them were not on duty for almost two decades. Their absenteeism not only affected the day to day functioning of the institutions but also blocks seats for prospective and serious candidates for which no recruitment can be held until they are terminated. Now, that these people are terminated, we will show these posts as vacant and issue recruitment notifications for the same,” K Ramesh Reddy, DME told TOI. On December 28, 2021, the DME issued orders seeking explanations from these doctors as to why their services may not be terminated with immediate effect. If no explanation is submitted, their services will be terminated by January 4. The termination has been processed following due protocols of issuing show cause notices over the years. Now, the DME has instructed respective colleges to inform those terminated from their duties. Listing out the names of these doctors, the order reads – “The head of concerned institutes are instructed to communicate these orders to the official permanent address of the said 38 doctors and furnish the necessary compliance to this office.” This is not the first time that the DME has sacked doctors and medical faculty members from their jobs. In February 2021, 27 doctors found absent from medical duties were sacked by the DME. Before that, in 2017, 134 specialist doctors were found absent in area and district hospitals and community health centres and were terminated by the DME.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/38-absentee-doctors-atgovt-hosps-shown-door/articleshow/88676199.cms||Preeti Biswas

Owaisi said the Modi government is delaying census operations, maybe to avoid taking up caste census. Like 2011 census, even the census of 2021 would have busted the propaganda of population explosion or fears of large Muslim population taking over India, he said. In a series of tweets on Monday, Owaisi stated if data is likely to be inconvenient, the PM simply stops counting. “Please don’t be triggered by the word “minority,” it includes Hindus who speak minority languages also,” he said. He said census can’t be replaced with shady ‘guesstimates’ based on Aadhaar data. “Reports suggest vax data may be used instead of census. It’s laughable.

Inaugurating the vaccination drive for the 15-18 age group at an urban primary health centre in Banjara Hills, the minister appealed to managements of schools and parents along with parents to take up the responsibility to get teenagers vaccinated. The minister stated that teens taking the vaccine should be accompanied by their parents or teachers. “Any identity card, including Aadhaar, college identity card or birth certificate is sufficient for the children to be vaccinated,” the minister stated. Harish Rao reiterated that private vaccination centres have also been granted permission to administer the vaccine to teenagers. “With Covaxin, the advantage is that the second dose can be taken within 28 days. We have begun 1,014 additional vaccination centres, especially for children,” he said. “The state has been appealing to the Centre to begin the administration of precaution dose for the elderly and vaccine drive for teenagers and finally that is launched now, still there are 20 lakh people overdue for the vaccine second dose, I appeal to everyone to get vaccinated,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ensure-kids-take-their-dose-harish-to-schools-parents/articleshow/88676202.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Hyderabad||Omicron Lurks, Teens & Parents Cold To Vax||Hyderabad: The state government’s commencement of the Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 15-18-year-old age group saw a lukewarm response in the city and across the state on Monday. Health minister T Harish Rao launched the vaccination initiative at a Banjara Hills primary health centre with 1,014 centres across the state opening vaccinations for the age group simultaneously.As against the overall target of 18.4 lakh, only 24,240 took their first dose on Monday, accounting for just over one per cent. Officials were hoping to cover a target of five to seven per cent on the opening day. In fact, Hyderabad saw less than 2,000 beneficiaries in this age group take the dose, while districts like Nagarkurnool, Vikarabad, Medak and Nalgonda saw around 100 vaccinations only. Rajanna-Sircilla had the lowest administration of doses among districts, with only 36 vaccinations.At Banjara Hills, only around 150 from the age group turned up for their first dose. The response was slightly better at private centres at corporate hospitals which saw around 500 turn up with most hospitals alerting parents of the initiative. At Medicover Women & Child Hospital, where the drive began at 8 am, 17-year-old Shreya Saxena became the first person in the state from the newly-eligible age group to take the Covid-19 vaccine.Most parents who had registered their children on Day-1 expressed concern over a third wave and ongoing physical classes. Meanwhile, officials also attributed the low turnout to the first day of the drive being a Monday, with many parents at work and children in classes. “Here at Hafeezpet urban primary health centre (UPHC), 147 teenagers have registered for the dose. The response is decent as majority of the parents are anxious and want to complete the vaccination as early as possible,” said Rajendranagar deputy district medical and health officer Dr G Srujana who had visited the centre to overlook the vaccination programme. Many who turned up on the first day of the vaccination programme also explained that an early administration of the first dose will mean an early chance of taking the second dose too.“I had been waiting for the roll-out of the vaccination programme for the last three months. The minute I learnt the government would commence the drive for the 15-18 age group, I booked a slot,” said Vishawanath Rao, the parent of a 17-year-old who took her first dose at the Ameerpet urban primary health centre. “I had to take an off from work and get a leave for my daughter from school. Now that infections are rising, I thought it was best to hurry,” Rao explained.Despite having concerns over side-effects, parents were more eager to have their children vaccinated as many were still attending school every day and constantly facing exposure. “We also don’t know whether other classmates have contracted the virus or not as school authorities keep this information guarded,” said Hafsa Begum, a teenager who took her first dose at the Hafeezpet centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/omicron-lurks-teens-parents-cold-to-vax/articleshow/88676205.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Mixing doses more effective, says study||Hyderabad: A pilot study by researchers at AIG Hospitals found that mixing Covishield and Covaxin during the first and second doses is more effective than taking a single vaccine. Spike-protein neutralizing antibodies were at significantly higher levels in the mixed vaccine groups than the same-vaccine groups, the study showed.Dr D Nageshwar Reddy, chairman, AIG Hospitals, said,“The third Covid-wave led by the Omicron variant has started in India. Although the initial data indicates that this wave will be milder than the previous ‘Delta one’ with less hospitalisation, still a large section of the population might get affected.”While adding that the Centre has approved precautionary doses for vulnerable population, Reddy said, “it is important to find out the cross immunity generated by mixing of available vaccines. It is also crucial that the safety profiles are well-established before administrating different vaccines as prevention or booster dose.”A total of 330 volunteers, who were not vaccinated and had no history of Covid infection, were selected and screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the study. Out of these, 13% were found to be seronegative and didn’t have Covid-related antibodies. “One of the incidental findings is the seropositivity among our population. It was found 87% participants who didn’t get vaccinated and never tested positive for Covid had Covid-related antibodies. This means our population might have developed significant antibodies against Covid because of huge Delta infection in the second wave,” said Reddy, chairman, AIG Hospitals. The study showed mixing of vaccines is absolutely safe as none of participants developed adverse effects. Reddy, who is also among the study’s researchers, said, “We found that when the first and second dose are of different vaccines, the spike-protein antibody response is four times higher compared to two-dose of same vaccine.” “This is important when considering third booster dose. Mixed doses...will enhance the vaccines’ effectiveness even against the Omicron variant,” Reddy added. AIG Hospitals has shared the data from the study with the Indian Council for Medial Research to be considered as a reference study for ‘Prevention’ doses starting January.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mixing-doses-more-effective-says-study/articleshow/88676206.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The regulator had also asked insurers to give approval for cashless in a stipulated period ensuring hassle-free process for hospitals as well as policyholders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-policies-will-cover-omicron-irdai/articleshow/88676207.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Many parents in wait & watch mode, to observe vaccine efficacy||HYDERABAD: Parents of many teens who are now eligible to take the Covid-19 vaccination are still hesitant over their children taking the dose, fearing side-effects. This was also a factor behind low vaccination numbers on Day-1 of the vaccination drive for the 15-18 age group on Monday. “I want to get my daughter vaccinated but I would like to wait for a month to see if there are side-effects reported as my daughter already suffers from asthma. I want to be sure that it will not worsen her condition,” said Macherala Raju. A similar rationale has been voiced by several other parents who, while they have registered their children on the CoWin portal, are yet to book slots. Some parents said they want to observe the efficacy of the vaccine on other children before having it administered to their own. Meanwhile, another group of parents called for information and awareness drive to encourage vaccinations to teenagers. “Vaccines should be administered only after educating parents and teenagers. It should not be forced. The government, school teachers, and other staff can take the initiative to run awareness campaigns to fill the gaps,” said Seema Agarwal, a parent. Some parents have also expressed their concern over reports of Bharat Biotech’s announcement in November to increase the shelf life of Covaxin doses to 12 months from the earlier approved period of nine months. “The expiry date of the vaccine has been increased by another three months. In such a scenario, I am not sure if the vaccine is even safe to be administered just as yet. I would like to wait for some more time before I get my son vaccinated,” said a parent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/many-parents-in-wait-watch-mode-to-observe-vax-efficacy/articleshow/88676213.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC notice to state, cops for using face recognition tech||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday issued notices to the state and Hyderabad police commissioner to respond to a PIL questioning alleged use of Face Recognition Technology (FRT) by officials without any sanction of law. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili sought counters from authorities while hearing the PIL filed by SQ Masood, a Hyderabad-based social activist, who contended that the police in May 2015 stopped him in traffic and took his photos without consent though he did not face any criminal cases. According to Masood’s counsel K Manoj Reddy, letters sent by the petitioner to the Hyderabad police commissioner to delete his personal and biometric information from the police data yielded no response. “The continued use of Facial Recognition Technology by the police violates the privacy of individuals which was upheld by the Supreme Court’s Aadhaar judgment. The use of such technology without any authorisation from the law should be declared unconstitutional and illegal,” he said. The petitioner in his plea said that the state has been deploying various agencies since 2018 for implementing FRT in the state. Citing media reports, he said that the installation of CCTVs at various places is meant for gathering such data. “States in coordination with the Union home ministry are implementing crime and criminal tracking networking and systems (CCTNS) across the nation. The data they collect and the way they use, store or retain such information is not known to the public. It is used exclusively by the police and law-enforcing authorities,” Shavili said. Describing this as unlawful, the petitioner said that his efforts to extract replies from Hyderabad police through the Right to Information (RTI) route has also yielded no results till now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-notice-to-state-cops-for-using-face-recognition-tech/articleshow/88676220.cms||---

Coronavirus in India: Live updatesEven as most infected health workers (doctors, nurses and support staff) are mostly not requiring hospital admission this time around, the state health officials fear a manpower crunch as infected health workers go into isolation. The health department has even asked hospitals to consider reducing planned surgeries in case they have manpower issues because of cluster infection. TimesViewIndividual hospitals and the healthcare system as a whole is coming under immense pressure because of this. Things may get worse before they get any better. Prioritising non-emergency procedures becomes that much more important in such a scenario.According to the current protocol, an infected person who does not need institutionalised care has to isolate for 10 days even if they are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and take an RT-PCR test on the 10th day. The person is considered “recovered” and “safe” if this throws up a negative result; if not, the person is considered safe after a subsequent RT-PCR test. Read AlsoMumbai: Isolation can be reduced to 5 days for Covid+ve health staffDistrict authorities can reduce the isolation period of Covid-positive healthcare workers from seven days to five if there is a severe shortage of manpower.It is this 10-day isolation period that the state government is thinking about reducing to five, in consultation with experts from the Union health ministry. In the US — where the Covid case growth has shown a near-vertical rise over the last few days — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency, has recommended shortening the isolation period to five days for those who do not need hospital care, followed of five days of strict masking around others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/staff-crunch-at-hosps-state-mulls-5-day-isolation-for-health-workers/articleshow/88676235.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

TMC, however, is not looking at any alliance with Congress either in Tripura or in Goa.Banerjee denied allegations that TMC’s recent political activities were harming the prospects of Congress and may help BJP. “Ours is the only party which can fight BJP politically. We do not want to harm the prospects of Congress anyway and that is the reason we did not go to Uttar Pradesh or Punjab. But the fight against BJP can’t indefinitely wait for someone,” he said. TMC has made significant inroads in Tripura replacing the Congress, which got decimated in the last civic poll. While Congress witnessed a downward spiral, TMC claimed to have bagged more than 20% votes in Tripura. Banerjee, who is on a two-day visit to Tripura, told party colleagues that they were not trying to break any party, but will accept anyone willing to join the TMC. According to TMC insiders, Banerjee said that had the TMC tried to weaken the Congress, then it could have made an entry into Congress-ruled states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Punjab. It has increased activity in BJP-ruled states like Tripura and Goa. However, the Congress will have to come out of its stupor. At a steering committee meeting in Agartala, Banerjee asked workers to fight the BJP on the field. Despite attacks on TMC workers in Tripura and leaders from Bengal, the TMC will not cower. He asked partymen in the northeastern state to gear up for the forthcoming assembly polls in the state. Banerjee said that Trinamool had no immediate plans to forge any alliance with Congress in Tripura.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/abhishek-tmc-fighting-bjp-not-trying-to-weaken-cong/articleshow/88676237.cms||---

The NHRC report to the Calcutta HC mentioned 64 rape and rape-attempt incidents. The CBI said it had registered 39 cases and was probing four others but sent back 21 cases to the West Bengal Police’s special investigation team for want of evidence. The CBI said it had also sent back two “murder cases” to the state’s probe team for want of evidence. The Calcutta High Court on August 19 ordered a court-monitored CBI probe into alleged cases of murder, rape and attempted rape during the poll process in Bengal and set up a special investigation team under the supervision of a retired judge to probe the other criminal cases. A five-judge bench, led by former acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, also directed the NHRC, the state government and all other commissions or committees that had received complaints to hand over all records relating to murder and crime-against-women cases to CBI. The Bengal government on September 1 moved the Supreme Court challenging the HC order. Allegations of rape and murder surfaced after the Bengal assembly polls that concluded with the result being declared on May 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/no-proof-in-21-rape-rape-attempt-cases-mentioned-by-nhrc-cbi/articleshow/88676240.cms||---
---||Kolkata||One airline curtails Del, Mum operations, others weigh options||Kolkata: IndiGo Airlines has decided to cancel all flights from Mumbai and Delhi to Kolkata, Bagdogra and Durgapur till March-end other than those scheduled to operate on Mondays and Fridays. The decision follows the state’s order on Sunday, allowing airlines to operate flights from these two cities to airports in Bengal only twice a week — Mondays and Fridays. It wasn't immediately clear if flights from Kolkata to Delhi and Mumbai would be cancelled as well but sources said a skeletal service of two-three flights could take off early morning or late evening.With IndiGo accounting for almost half the flights on these sectors, the decision will have huge ramifications on the travel industry. The IndiGo statement acknowledged as much, conceding that the limited capacity may lead to inflationary impact on airfares on these routes. Other airlines are still contemplating ways to operate the flights from the two metros via tier-I and tier-II cities, sidestepping the ban without flouting it. Air India officials said they are planning to deploy wide-bodied aircraft that are usually scheduled on international routes to Kolkata from Mumbai and Delhi on Mondays and Fridays to carry as many passengers as they can on these two days. While the narrow body aircraft has 180 seats, the Dreamliner Boeing B 787 has a capacity of 256 seats while the Jumbo B 747-400 has a capacity to seat 423 passengers.“Flights to Kolkata, Durgapur and Bagdogra from Delhi and Mumbai will remain cancelled on all days except Mondays and Fridays for next three months. Flyers can claim refund or book alternative flights,” said IndiGo in a press statement. An official of another private airline said they are still trying to fly at least 30% of scheduled flights out of Kolkata on these days to the banned cities and are trying to reroute incoming flights from these cities via Varanasi, Patna, Jaipur and Bhubaneswar. On an average, the city has around 15 direct flights from Mumbai and 25 from Delhi, daily. With the ban, around 195 flights stand cancelled per week from January 5.“With majority of international flights operating from Mumbai and Delhi, we are flooded with queries about the future of the flights on the non-allowed days,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) Travel Agents Federation of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/one-airline-curtails-del-mum-operations-others-weigh-options/articleshow/88676241.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

While Digha saw 80% tourists leave by Monday, less than 10% tourists left North Bengal since hotels, resorts and homestays have not been shut. The beach in Digha, that had been thick with tourists till Sunday afternoon, was deserted on Monday. However, since the order said tourism spots would be be closed, not hotels, visitors in North Bengal stayed back. A North Bengal tourism official said, “Tourism spots here are either hill stations or forests, not a temple or a park. How would we close them?” Niranjan Saha, the manager of Jaldapara tourist lodge, said, “We will operate with 30% occupancy since people are still travelling to different parts of North Bengal, mostly by car. We are careful about physical distancing and monitoring of health parameters of tourists.” Dibyendu Deb of Dooars Tourism Welfare Forum said, “Cancellations have been few. There is no rush for return as most come by train or plane. We have 450 hotels, resorts and homestays now running at 15% occupancy as the rush eased after December 31.”  Mandarmani and Tajpur tourists also rushed home on Monday. Hiyaj Kayal from Panchla said, “We had to buy tickets at Rs 300 instead of Rs 150 for our 18-member team.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/seaside-tourists-rush-to-return-home-but-hills-visitors-stay-put/articleshow/88676244.cms||---
---||Kolkata||25 micro containment-zones in city, 6 in Salt Lake & 3 in New Town||Kolkata: Twenty-five city addresses, six in Salt Lake, three in New Town and six in Lake Town were declared as micro-containment zones on Monday. On the Kolkata micro-containment list, barring two slums in Phoolbagan, the rest are complexes, a few standalone flats and even hostels inside the Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata. Ten major housing complexes in the city have found a place on the list. A portion of Silver Spring on EM Bypass, Active Acres complex at Tangra and Urbana have been included in this list. Several standalone properties — in the heart of the city like Loudon Street, Short Street and Shakespeare Sarani — are on the list. At least seven such properties have been identified at Loudon Street. At Urbana, which has 34 Covid-positive cases at present, including an Omicron patient who had returned from Nigeria last month, the facility management authorities rang multiple civic officials and local police personnel to know the exact norms they needed to follow. “We have been told to mostly rely on self-compliance and ensure family members of Covid positive patients in the complex remain in isolation. There will be no bar on entry and exit of residents and staff,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director of Urbana Facility Management. At Silver Spring, the association representatives called up the local police station to seek clarity. “As we still look for more clarity on the containment zone norms, we are trying to keep some of our maintenance and housekeeping staff stay back in the complex and are in talks to introduce some of the self-regulatory Covid norms,” said Indranil Chowdhury, the complex secretary. Mayor Firhad Hakim said standalone flats will be micro-containment zones and a few complexes and slums with multiple cases will be treated as containment zones. “Usually, cops barricade the containment zones. While this will not be applicable for micro-containment zones, we will ask associations to ensure that those affected are monitored. Those not infected can come out but in a restricted manner. We hope these measures will help us reverse the numbers by January 10-15,” said Hakim. The North 24 Parganas district administration on Monday came up with the micro-containment zone list for the district, mostly in the urban areas, with a total of 41 zones. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation tops with 12 zones, followed by Panihati Municipality with eight and South Dum Dum and Baranagar municipalities with six zones each. In Salt Lake, there are six micro-containment zones — two at FD Block, one at GD Block, five houses on the same lane in CD Block and two houses in AK Block. In New Town, a flat in Uniworld City housing complex, a flat in Akanksha cooperative society and a flat at Sapoorji housing complex in Action Area III are now micro-containment zones. The six zones under South Dum Dum Municipality are in Lake Town, Dakshindari, Golaghata and Bangur Avenue areas.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: In case surge season, Covid labs face demand heat||KOLKATA: The Covid testing laboratories are feeling the heat as the number of samples to test has spiked suddenly. Health officials on Monday told government-run labs to increase tests, asking private ones to take in samples within capacity. The directive was issued as complaints poured in that some labs were not giving the test results within 24 hours. The health department has asked all labs to be open on Sundays too. The number of increasing samples to test during rising cases of infection among the lab workforce has led to the facilities feeling tremendous pressure. “The pressure suddenly increased from Monday, when we got over 400 samples, including about 300 from our OPD. We knew this was coming after the festive revelry. Despite a capacity to run 550 samples a day, we will, for now, restrict it to 450 in the face of the manpower issue so that we can deliver the results within 24 hours,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, attached with the Covid lab at Peerless Hospital. The lab had handled over 600 samples on certain days during the second wave. But for the past few months, it has been testing just 30 to 40 samples a day. “If the need arises, we can increase our capacity beyond 400 by adding shifts to run the tests,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO, Peerless Hospital. Samples at private labs have gone up three-four fold in a matter of a few days. “The number of samples coming to our lab is more than double of what we were handling a week ago,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. Sources at AMRI group of hospitals said its central lab in the Dhakuria unit is under tremendous pressure and has decided to handle a maximum of 400 samples a day. “We intend to hike tests to about 80,000 a day. We got reports that some labs were taking 48 to 72 hours to deliver the results since they were collecting more samples than they could deal with. Government labs will conduct more tests,” said a health official. Most labs attached with teaching medical colleges in Kolkata can test 1,000-1,500 samples daily. These have been told to test patients from OPDs and emergency.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-case-surge-season-cov-labs-face-demand-heat/articleshow/88676246.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Till Sunday, the last buses — known as the “last car” among transport workers — were leaving their termini between 7.30pm to 8.30pm as these bus workers got time to complete their round trip and get back to their garages well before 11pm. Now, the last buses — especially those intra-city ones moving on north-south routes — are planning to slot the last bus between 6.30pm to 7pm. Shorter routes plan the last trip by 8pm.“Now that the Covid numbers are high, we do not want to bother the state till the numbers stabilize. Depending on where one stays, the last bus will reach its destination between 9pm-8.30pm,” said Pradip Narayan Bose of the West Bengal Bus and Minibus Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/last-buses-to-start-trip-early/articleshow/88676247.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 32 flyers turn Covid positive from negative in 48 hours, spark travel concern||KOLKATA: The detection of Covid-19 among 32 passengers departing for Dubai on Sunday and Monday has sent alarm bells ringing among health experts as the infection was contracted in Kolkata within two days prior to the flights. All flyers had cleared the RT-PCR test, for which swab samples were collected within 48 hours prior to the flight departures. But they still tested positive in Rapid PCR carried out at the airport six hours prior to departure on Sunday and Monday. Nine international flyers also tested positive on arrival on these two days. Of them, one was an Irish citizen who had taken the last direct flight into the city from London that now stands suspended. Among the rest were two French nationals, Two Swedes and the others were Indians. But it is the huge number of Covid cases among departing passengers that has left everyone worried. On Sunday, 16 passengers, all heading to Dubai, had tested positive. Six of them were to take the IndiGo flight while seven were to take Fly Dubai and three Emirates Airlines. But for one passenger, all are Indian nationals. The only exception is a British woman travelling by IndiGo. On Monday, another 16 flyers, all taking the Emirates flight to Dubai, tested positive and were unable to depart. Unlike most other countries that require one confirmatory RT-PCR test, Dubai requires two RT-PCR tests prior to boarding flights out of India to filter out individuals who may have contracted Covid very recently. Doctors said this proved that community transmission had begun at a rapid pace in the city and that people should limit stepping out of their homes unless absolutely necessary. “People are getting converted from seronegative to seropositive at a very rapid pace and the 16 passengers turning positive within 48 hours just proves that. As a cardinal rule of Covid-19, travelling activity should be limited at the earliest to prevent further spread,” said virologist Rahul Jain. Following the development, airlines are wary of the UAE again imposing a ban on flights from India as it had done ahead of the second wave. The Emirates had then acted swiftly and decisively, stopping repatriation of people from India to the country to shield itself against the Delta variant. The Omicron variant is said to be five times more transmissible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/32-flyers-turn-cov-from-ve-in-48-hours-spark-travel-concern/articleshow/88676248.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro footfall dips as pandemic curbs set in||KOLKATA: Metro Railway suspended token system from Monday, reduced operation hours to 9pm and ran six less trains, after the state government’s Covid-induced restrictions that allows it to ferry 50 % of its daily ridership. Station supervisors on the North-South corridor said that footfall seemed less on Monday compared to the past few days as only smartcard holders were allowed. Officials cited disruption in services from 12.30pm till 5pm as the other reason for less ridership on Monday. A snag in the third rail led to stoppage of service from Maidan to Dum Dum stations in the afternoon. Truncated services ran between Maidan and Kavi Subhas, and Dum Dum and Dakshineswar stations during this time. Metro is interpreting the state government’s 50 % cap as half the average daily footfall of pre-pandemic times when 6lakh to 6.2lakh rode on an average. To enforce the 50% daily ridership rule, Metro decided to withdraw the convenient tokens which cost a meagre Rs 5 for a 2km ride. Instead only smartcards, for which commuters must cough up at least Rs 120 (even for a single ride), keeping Rs 80 deposited for security, are back. The East-West Metro or Line 2, which registers only around 2,000 daily ridership, also has Quick Response-code (QR-code) tickets. Metro Railway is working to extend this facility on North-South corridor. For this, QR Code scanners are being installed and hardware of the AFC gates in the 26 North-South Metro stations are being upgraded. “We have stepped up our ‘no mask no metro’ drive over the past one month, ever since ridership rose to 4lakhs. But it’s not possible for RPF to keep an eye on someone as he pulls down the mask inside a coach when no one’s looking,” a Metro official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-footfall-dips-as-pandemic-curbs-set-in/articleshow/88676250.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||IIT sees curbs, IIM hostels C-zones||Kolkata/Kharagpur: Thirty-five people at Indian Institute of Management-Calcutta and 35 at Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur have tested positive for Covid, prompting stringent curbs on the premises. Following the Covid detectio, IIM-C prohibited students, teachers and non-teaching staff from leaving the Joka campus unless there is a medical emergency. The students, most of them with mild symptoms, have been accommodated in a guesthouse that has been converted into a quarantine centre. All offline activities, including classes, have been suspended. The state government on Monday declared three hostels—Ramanujan, Lake View and New hostel —and Tata Hall, where the infected students are quarantined, as containment zones.“Of the 1,100-odd students, who are currently on the IIM-C campus across various programmes, 35 have tested positive for Covid. They have been isolated and put under treatment. We have imposed stringent restrictions on their movements, particularly outside the campus to prevent the virus from spreading. Our campus is self-sufficient. Only in case of medical or some other emergency can someone be allowed to step out but it requires to be approved by the Covid committee,” said Prof Manish Thakur, dean (new initiatives & external relations), IIM-C.Though the business school had resumed offline activities, including classes, from November 15 following a go-ahead by the human resources development ministry, it has suspended all offline classes and gatherings and shifted to online mode after cases surged. “From Monday, even the staff strength in hostels and elsewhere have been reduced to half. They will work on alternate days,” said Thakur.At IIT-Kharagpur, students who have tested positive for Covid have been isolated in Asutsoh Mukherjee Hall, with the male members being housed on the ground floor and the girls on the first floor. Mingling of students on the campus has been restricted. “All the affected students and staff members have been kept in isolation. They are under treatment,” said Tamal Nath, registrar of IIT Kharapgpur. Close to 2,000 students had returned to the Kharagpur campus in the last week of December.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-sees-curbs-iim-hostels-c-zones/articleshow/88676251.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: At ground zero, local clinics show how cases have spiked since 25/12||KOLKATA: General physicians practising in various neighbourhoods across the city have received more Covid cases in the last three days than they have in the previous 30. Doctors said cases had shot up post December 25 to unprecedented levels since the onset of the pandemic early last year. “Before Christmas, I was getting one or two Covid patients per week. It has been this way for nearly four months now. But cases have suddenly spiked since Christmas. On Thursday, I had 20 Covid cases,” said Saroj Kothari, who sits in a clinic at Ganesh Talkies and at another in Beliaghata. The last time general physicians were seeing as many Covid patients in a day was in May-June when the second wave was at its peak. This time, though, experts say it is just the beginning of the third wave. TimesViewLocal dispensaries are often the first stop for people with flu-like symptoms; that they will see a steady stream of Covid cases follows. Patients visiting neighbourhood doctors and chemists must take every precaution to ensure they do not pass on the infection to doctors and their support staff. Closure of local dispensaries at this critical juncture can impact the total healthcare network.Unlike the first and the second waves when it took at least 72 hours from the onset of initial symptoms for the virus to be detected in Covid tests, confirmation is now happening within 24-48 hours. “I am getting tested when they are coming down with mild fever and cough, body ache and weakness. The results of eight out of 10 is confirming Covid,” says Satyaki Bardhan, who practises in the Bhowanipore-Lansdowne belt. Doctors have also noticed that the CT value in the confirmatory reports of most patients is below 30, hovering around the 25 mark with some even in the 16-17 range, indicating high virus load and infectivity and possibly Omicron. With labs sending these samples for gene sequencing, doctors say they expect Omicron count to rise sharply in the next few days among many without any travel history. Debabrata Saha, who practises in the Shyambazar-Kankurgachhi belt, says he saw indications of a slight rise in cases a fortnight ago but didn’t expect the surge to be so rapid as has been in the past four days when he has had around 70 Covid patients/suspects. Some have tested and confirmed Covid. Others have either gone in for tests or advised home isolation with symptomatic treatment. “If this is any indication, numbers will be overwhelming. But people should not panic if they learn half the neighbourhood has Covid. The infectivity is very high but the severity and criticality is low. Among the Covid patients I have had, none have displayed a drop in saturation or coagulation disorder. In the second wave, CT scans were revealing Covid jelly in lungs. But this time, it is not. Also, D-dimer value isn’t increasing indicating that patients are not experiencing cytokine storms,” said Saha. Pijus Banerjee, who practices in Salt Lake, agrees that nearly all patients who aren’t very aged or have no severe comorbidity will survive this wave. But he isn’t sure if that will be the case with doctors as well since they will get exposed to Covid a lot more than in the first and second waves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/at-ground-zero-local-clinics-show-how-cases-have-spiked-since-25/12/articleshow/88676252.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||I-League postponed by six weeks||Kolkata: The rapid rise of Covid-19 infections among the teams has led to suspension of the I-League by at least six weeks, it was announced on Monday. “The League Committee, abiding consensus of all participating clubs as per the suggestion of Dr Harsh Mahajan (member of AIFF Sports Medical Committee) ratified the decision to postpone the ongoing Hero I-League 2021-22 for at least 6 weeks,” the AIFF said in a release. The League Committee had earlier postponed the tournament’s year-end fixtures when about 15 members of four participating teams, including players, staying in a city hotel were found to have contracted the virus. However, it has now appeared that the fresh round of tests — conducted on the members of the teams — have revealed that number of infections now stands at “more than 40.” This prompted the organisers to call off the competition for more than a month when the League Committee sat for a meeting under the chairmanship of AIFF’s senior vice-president Subrata Dutta on Monday. The committee will again have a review meeting after four weeks to take stock of the situation. As the move came a day after the state government implemented several restrictions in curbing the recent rise in Covid-19 cases across the country, the league organisers have decided to carry out another round of tests on Wednesday. While players and officials who have tested positive will be quarantined and treated in accordance with the protocol of bio-bubble, the rest will be allowed to leave for their respective homes provided they test negative.Thirteen participating teams have been put up in three designated city hotels under strict bio bubble. However, while the organisers have plenty to ponder over how the virus breached the bubble, they insist that the latest setback won’t come in the way of finishing the tournament. “There is no question of compromising on the players’ health. But we are keeping all options open and we’re quite confident that the league will resume the moment the situation will be brought under control,” said an league official. Only six matches of the I-League season have been played so far — on December 26 and 27 — before it was suspended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/i-league-postponed-by-six-weeks/articleshow/88676253.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cov cases dip but positivity rises, docs say third wave may peak quicker than first two||Kolkata: Even though Covid cases dropped marginally in Kolkata and Bengal on Monday, positivity rate jumped to 19.5% even as the number of tests slid to 31,000 from 38,000 a day ago. While Bengal recorded 6,078 new cases on Monday, the city clocked 2,801 fresh cases. On Sunday, the state had registered 6,153 cases — the highest single-day spike since the second wave — and Kolkata had recorded 3,194 cases. Positivity rate was 15.9% on Sunday. Experts and doctors feel the numbers could gallop over the next fortnight as the third wave races towards its peak. While cases had been more virulent during the second wave, they have been mild so far in the third wave. Most have been recovering in 2-3 days, while the recovery period varied between a week to a month during second wave. “It’s almost certain that this wave is driven by Omicron which is far more transmissible than Delta, that was so far the dominant strain. While Delta led to a doubling of cases in six days at the peak of second wave, Omicron has been much faster. Over the last one week, we have seen cases shoot up more than 20 times in the state,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. “It seems that like other countries, we, too, will reach the peak quicker than the previous waves and then witness a plateauing of cases and a decline by mid-February. In South Africa, where the Omicron originated, the wave lasted about a month-and-a-half,” added Chowdhury.While Omicron could have led to the fast spread of the virus, Delta, too, existed, said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. “At this stage, both are present but Delta has lost its sting. Omicron, on the other hand, has come into existence recently and we are not yet sure if it will get more virulent,” said Biswas.From a mere 148 cases in Kolkata on December 27, the number leapt to 2,398 on January 1. Number of cases in Bengal, on the other hand, soared to 4,512 on January 1 from just 439 on December 27. “This time, Christmas-New Year period has been immediately followed by a massive spurt in transmission that caught everyone off-guard. Let us hope, the strain doesn’t get virulent,” said Chowdhury. Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain said, “While Omicron seems to be mild, the huge number of cases is worrying. Even if a small percentage need hospitalization, health system will find it difficult to cope.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-cases-dip-but-positivity-rises-docs-say-third-wave-may-peak-quicker-than-first-two/articleshow/88676254.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Colleges, univs allow limited lab, library access||Kolkata: Several colleges and universities have decided to allow restricted access to libraries and laboratories so that senior students and research scholars are not completely shut out and can avail of the facilities “when absolutely necessary” by following all Covid-safety guidelines. Also, most hostels were vacated for the New Year break but for those boarders who stayed back, some residential colleges are making arrangements for their safe return to home. “Some students were attending offline classes while staying in the hostel. But now, we arranging for their safe return home,” said a principal. The government has suspended all offline classes on campuses till January 15 due to the spiralling Covid cases but authorities at colleges and universities said it was important to provide at least limited access to labs and libraries to senior students, many of whom have completed a large part of their UG and PG courses without ever stepping into labs. “All classes and other educational activities in physical mode will remain suspended till January 15. Research scholars can use laboratories only when absolutely necessary by following Covid-safety protocols and with permission from HoDs,” said a Jadavpur University official. Calcutta University authorities are in the process of planning how to give students access to libraries. “We will issue the procedure, but students will have to take permission through their HoDs and follow strict Covid protocol,” said an official. At SM Jaipuria College, too, students will have to take permission from the principal or vice-principal through HoDs if they want to visit the campus for “very urgent purposes”. Principal of a south Kolkata college said students, particularly those from science, have suffered a lot. “Most of them have not been able to attend a single practical class in two years. Others got a few opportunities in the past six weeks but that is severely inadequate. We do not know how long campuses will be shut but there should be a way for senior students to have access to labs and libraries,” said the principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colleges-univs-allow-limited-lab-library-access/articleshow/88676257.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 403 booked in 5 hours at 40 night nakas for violating Covid norms||KOLKATA: The motorists and bikers of 403 vehicles were prosecuted between midnight and 5am on Monday after the government declared night restriction, allowing only emergency vehicles to ply on the road. About 40 nakas, put up from 11pm to nab the drunk drivers, were turned into night restriction nakas barely an hour later when the notification was announced by the government. The offenders were booked under penal sections, said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. In addition, local divisional cops arrested 347 people post midnight on Sunday for violating Covid norms. Another 374 people were prosecuted for not wearing masks between Sunday midnight and Monday noon. The checks from Monday, said Lalbazar sources, began at 10pm. “The numbers are expected to rise until motorists get disciplined,” said a joint commissioner. The East and Ultadanga traffic guards reported the maximum violations, together accounting for more than half of the prosecutions. While the East guard prosecuted 147 motorists, the Ultadanga Guard booked another 80 people. The East guard covers some parts of Park Street zone, the Park Circus zone and some parts of the Park Circus connector while the Ultadanga guard caters to the city borders and is the most important link with North 24 Parganas. Both the guards have been reporting a higher number of violations during night nakas in the past 18 months. The Garia and DH Road guards, handling traffic to and from South 24 Parganas, also reported a number of violations. “Many motorists claimed they were not aware of the announcement. Some of them claimed the order stated that prosecutions would start from Monday. The violators included both motorists and bikers. The east guard checked 167 vehicles and found that 147 were violating norms. Similarly, the Ultadanga guard checked 85 vehicles, of which 80 violated the norms. Cops said they checked 30 cars near Tiljala on EM Bypass and 20 of them violated norms,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/403-booked-in-5-hours-at-40-night-nakas-for-violating-cov-norms/articleshow/88676258.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NFAI starts restoration work of Satyajit Ray’s films||KOLKATA: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has begun the restoration work of Satyajit Ray’s documentary on Sukumar Ray, ‘Sonar Kella’ and ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’ after getting the original negatives from the state government. The work is now being done on a priority basis on the grand auteur’s centenary year as part of the National Film Heritage Mission. Ray’s son Sandip Ray is happy the restoration has begun. “While the Academy has restored some films, no restoration of these works has ever been done. I am glad that NFAI has taken up the project,” Ray said. Two months ago, NFAI director Prakash Magdum came to Kolkata and met officials of the state I&CA department. The Bengal government was the producer of both ‘Sonar Kella’ (1974) and ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’ (1980). In 1987, it also produced ‘Sukumar Ray’ the documentary that Ray made on his father. “Since we knew the Bengal government was the producer, we approached them for the original negatives. The government responded positively and I also visited the vault where the negatives were kept. In October, these three negatives were sent across to us in Pune,” Magdum said. The 4K scanning of the negatives have been done. According to Magdum, the condition of these negatives is ‘okay’. Sandip Ray has also been shown the basic grading of ‘Sonar Kella’. “They have done a good job of removing the spots and scratches. We have also given the original subtitle sheet of ‘Sonar Kella’ to NFAI,” he said. Restoration will now begin that will take at least two months to finish. “We are expecting the work to be over by Ray’s birth anniversary on May 2,” he added. During his visit, Magdum also approached the producer of ‘Pratidwandi’ for the original camera negative. “We met Purnima Dutta at her office. I was pleasantly surprised that she had kept the negatives in decent condition in her own custody for over 50 years. I am very thankful to her for entrusting NFAI to do the restoration of a very important Ray film. The negatives have been scanned by the state-of-the-art Munich-based ARRI scanner. Now each frame will have to be restored individually. One second that we watch is equivalent to 24 frames of a scanned film,” he explained. The NFAI has also approached the state to restore some short films and documentaries produced by them. Magdum came across a 1952 film called ‘Pasher Bari’ that was directed by Sudhir Mukherjee with music by Salil Chowdhury in this vault. “Apparently, ‘Padosan’ was inspired by this to some extent. This film is partly in nitrate. Having nitrate as a base was phased out in the 1950s. We will preserve it now apart from scanning it. We are arranging for this to be transferred from Kolkata to Pune,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/nfai-starts-restoration-work-of-rays-films/articleshow/88676259.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: State board kids face uncertainty ahead of exams||KOLKATA: The rise in Covid cases and the consequent restrictions, including closure of on-campus classes, could not have come at a more inopportune moment for state board students. While students at schools affiliated to CISCE and CBSE have finished their first term board examinations, state board students again face uncertainty as they barely have two months to go for X and three months for XII exams. The vaccination drive for students, distribution of books and mid-day meals will, however, continue. Madhyamik exams were cancelled in 2021 due to Covid spread and HS exams were called off even the year before that, when the pandemic had just broken out. “We are preparing for board exams and need to attend regular classes. Attending practical classes are important. But we don’t know if and when we can return to classrooms again,” said Class XII’s Sandipan Bhattacharyya. The school education department issued a notice on Monday, instructing schools to resume academics online and via alternative modes. Teachers have been told to visit houses of students “to oversee academic activities and provide suitable guidance”. School hostels will also be shut. In case some students are not able to vacate hostels, the authorities will have to ensure boarders’ safety. No visitor will be allowed in the hostels. Those just promoted to Class IX were looking forward to attending school after almost two years but are bitterly disappointed. “Those now in IX will have to wait for a few more days before they can return to school,” said Taki House headmistress Swagata Basak. Taltala High School headmaster Rittick Kundu said, “We need to complete various work first. We will switch to online classes a few days later.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-board-kids-face-uncertainty-ahead-of-exams/articleshow/88676260.cms||---

The last show will be at 6pm. The seven shows will be in three languages, English, Bengali and Hindi,” said a planetarium official .The facility had shut down on Monday to seek the government’s clarification on whether it should be clubbed with public entertainment facilities, which were ordered to close, or be treated on par with cinema halls and theatres that can operate with 50% capacity.

The sales further came down on January 3, the first day of restrictions on bars and restaurants, where footfall was 30% to 50% lower than December 24 and 25. Under night restriction rules, bars, restaurants and clubs are allowed to operate with 50% capacity till 10pm. The president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India, Sudesh Poddar, pointed out that on the first day of restrictions, there was a huge drop in sales. Poddar, the owner of Songhai, Manthan and MS Bar and Lounge, said that there has been a 40% drop in sales in the past two-three days. “There was very less crowd and we are also operating with 50% capacity,” he added. The former national president of FHRAI and owner of Walson Hotel and Xrong Place, T S Walia, said, “For us, the government has given the best possible solutions.” The owner of Waldorf, Moulin Rouge, Charles Mantosh, has been registering a dip in sales from last Friday. “There has been a 50%-60% drop now from peak Christmas sales. The state government should now consider some tax concessions for us,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh 1590 & Chapter 2 said, “Our dine-in is facing a drop down because of the increasing cases and restrictions. However, our delivery service has helped us to keep us at par.” Aminia director Kabir Azhar, said, “On December 24 and 25, the footfall was very high while online sale was low. But from January 1 the opposite is happening.” Nitin Kothari, owner of Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu, said, “There is a marginal drop in sales. The impact is not so severe for us”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bar-resto-footfall-drops-to-50-of-christmas-crowd/articleshow/88676262.cms||---
---||Business||HUL meets sellers amid threat to expand strike||TNN Mumbai: Leading FMCG company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has finally reached out to traditional distributors under the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) who were on a strike in Maharashtra. An HUL spokesperson said, “In response to the request we had received from AICPDF, company representatives met them to understand their concerns and feedback about the evolving ‘Route to Market’ (RTM) models.” The development comes even as AICPDF intensified its stand by threatening to extend the blockade of HUL’s products in four other states after Maharashtra, where it first decided to stop supplying the multinational’s products from January 1 after it received no response from the company. AICPDF’s grievance is the price disparity between traditional trade and business-to-business (B2B) retailers. The maker of brands like Lifebuoy soap and Lipton tea has reiterated that general trade (GT) continues to be its largest channel. “Our distributors (redistribution stockists) are and will remain our valued partners in our quest to serve the needs of our consumers across India. HUL remains fully committed to ensuring that our distribution partners earn a fair return on their investments and work collaboratively in enhancing their capabilities to make them future-fit. As an organisation committed to the highest level of customer centricity, HUL will make all efforts to address any specific issue bilaterally with its distributors to mutual satisfaction,” the company said in reply to TOI’s query. In a recent report, Edelweiss Research said, “These issues have happened earlier also, and we expect HUL and distributors to come to an agreement soon since both need each other. In our view, these kind of differences and tussles would further drive consolidation in favour of organised players and online players.” HUL services 15% of its demand digitally, which, Edelweiss Research said, is a significant advantage. “Overall, we do not expect significant impact on HUL as shops and consumers can easily buy from online and organised players,” the report said. The HUL spokesperson added, “HUL has a long-standing relationship with its distributors that is based on trust and mutuality of interest. Our distributors have overwhelmingly conveyed to us that they would continue to meet the needs of our shoppers and consumers in an uninterrupted manner.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hul-meets-sellers-amid-threat-to-expand-strike/articleshow/88674841.cms||---
---||Business||Dhanlaxmi Bk loans grow 10%, highest in 10 quarters||Mumbai: After struggling with credit growth for over two years, the Thrissur-headquartered Dhanlaxmi Bank has turned the tide. The bank has also ended an impasse with key shareholders over the appointment of an auditor. However, to sustain the growth momentum, the bank will need to require its shareholders’ nod for raising capital. Currently the bank, which is run by a six-member board including two from the Reserve Bank of India, is engaged in a legal tussle with high net worth shareholders seeking board representation. The bank has no identifiable promoters. The RBI has taken the stand that shareholders cannot directly vote directors onto a bank’s board. Speaking to TOI, Dhanlaxmi Bank MD & CEO J K Shivan said that the lender has managed to crack the small-sized corporate market. These borrowers have a triple-A rating but have a low funding requirement of around Rs 100 crore. This — along with home loans, vehicle loans and loans against property — has enabled the bank to expand its book. As a result of lending to this segment, the bank has managed to grow its share of corporate loans from 25% to 29% as of December 2021. It has grown its overall loans by a 10.5% year-on-year as of end December — the highest in 10 quarters. The private lender had been struggling with credit growth because of its relatively smaller size and cautious approach. “We have got an approval from the board for co-lending with finance companies but we have not yet got into this. The next step is the business correspondent model for the microfinance segment, which we are approaching with caution,” said Shivan. Shivan expressed hope that the shareholders would approve the capital-raising. “Our business has picked up with credit-deposit ratio crossing 60% after a very long time. The only agenda is growth. There is no other agenda,” said Shivan. Dhanlaxmi Bank is also looking at growing its credit card portfolio and EMI card portfolio through a fintech partnership. It is looking at secured credit cards, where even those who do not have adequate credit history can be given a credit limit in line with the fixed deposits they maintain with the bank. As of December 2021, its loan book stood at Rs 7,122 crore while deposits were Rs 11,712 crore (up 5.5% year-on-year). The bank has also roped in a digital consultant to advise them for onboarding fintech companies. “It will start with credit cards and then with an EMI card. We do not plan to go all out but we are currently paying for 45,000 cards and have only 15,000 active cards,” said Shivan. Other products include secured cards issued to customers against fixed deposits they maintain with the bank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dhanlaxmi-bk-loans-grow-10-highest-in-10-quarters/articleshow/88674860.cms||Mayur Shetty

The previous record was in 2018, when the Walmart-Flipkart deal had lifted exit value to around $26 billion. Exits by value grew fivefold from $7 billion in 2020 and the number of exits jumped 72% from 157 in 2020, according to data from Venture Intelligence, an agency that collates developments in this segment. Many marquee investors with long-term bets in India clocked double-digit returns last year, analysts said. The increased number of exits in 2021 is likely to have a domino effect as LPs (limited partnerships) flush with funds will reinvest actively into the ecosystem, they added. Venture Intelligence data showed that exits via strategic sales stood at $14.5 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2020. About $11-billion worth secondary sales were made compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. Public market sales zoomed to $12 billion. With digital transformation taking centre stage in 2021, Hitachi’s acquisition of tech engineering services firm GlobalLogic for over $8 billion was the biggest exit of the year. PE major Carlyle’s move to acquire over 90% stake in IT solutions firm Hexaware for $3 billion was another large tech deal giving exit to Baring Asia. Fintech firm PayU’s acquisition of payment gateway BillDesk was another large deal offering billions in exits to General Atlantic, Temasek, Clearstone, TA Associates, and others. Arun Natarajan, founder and MD, Venture Intelligence, said that the quantum of secondary sales, where both parties involved are large PE firms indicates the maturity of the ecosystem. “The IPOs, along with a string of successful liquidity events via secondary deals and strategic M&A will help establish the Indian PE-VC asset class on a firm footing on the global stage,” he added. In terms of investments, PE-VC firms invested a record $63 billion (across 1,202 deals) in 2021 — a 57% rise over the $39.9 billion (across 913 deals) invested in the previous year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pvt-investor-exits-hit-record-38-7bn-in-2021-due-to-ipos/articleshow/88674429.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Sensex starts 2022 with a bang, gains 929 pts to 59k||Mumbai: The stock market started 2022 on a strong note, despite rising cases globally of infections from the Omicron variant of Covid. The sensex surged 929 points, or 1.6%, to 59,183, supported by financials and Reliance Industries the most. The reversal of foreign fund selling in the last few days due to the ongoing holiday season in most developed markets also helped the rally, market players said. The day’s session saw banking & financials along with metal stocks lead the rally while healthcare stocks, despite the rising uncertainty because of the spread of Omicron, witnessed selling pressure. As a result, the BSE’s financial, banking and metal indices closed with gains of over 2%, while the healthcare index closed marginally lower. According to Rahul Sharma of Equity99 Advisors, the expectation on the street is that the positive momentum would continue for a while. “However, investors are advised to keep some capital aside to take advantage of any major dips considering the rising Omicron infections. The pharma sector could be a great bet looking at the current scenario,” he said. The day’s session also made investors richer by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 272.5 lakh crore. In the near term, the stock market is expected to witness some up-move, supported mainly by local investors — both institutional and individual. But a definitive trend would emerge from the third week of the month, market players said. This is because that’s when most foreign fund managers would resume after their new year break. That would also be the time when leading Indian companies would start announcing their quarter results. In a surprising move, TCS, Infosys and Wipro — all three among the largest software exporters from India — would announce their quarterly results on the same day, that is, January 12. HCL Technologies, another leading software exporter, would announce its results on January 14. The results season will kick off with Q3 results from Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) on January 8, data from BSE showed. As it happens during the announcement of quarterly results, to some extent, this time too financial numbers from leading companies would impact investor sentiment on D-Street, dealers said. The recent reversal in selling by foreign portfolio investors has also helped the Indian currency. From a multi-month low at about 76 to a dollar level in early December, the rupee on Monday closed at 74.26 to a dollar. In the bond market too, despite the RBI’s recent decision to cancel some of its borrowing plans through government securities, the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts is hovering at the 6.45% level. On Monday, the yield closed at 6.46%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-starts-2022-with-a-bang-gains-929-pts-to-59k/articleshow/88675075.cms||---

Hatchbacks, which comprised 4 out of the top 10 models in calendar year 2021, command 50% of the 14 lakh units sold by the top 10 models. The hatch hold has in fact played out over the past 7 years even as SUVs more than doubled contribution. Since 2014-15, the hatchback segment has continued to hold its own contributing between 45%-47% of the passenger vehicle sales even as the SUV contribution has gone from 14.5% in FY14-15 to 32% in FY21 and 47% in the year-to-date fiscal. Auto consultants say that the jump in SUV volumes is also due to the sub-4-meter compact segment. “It is because of compact SUVs in the Rs 9- Rs 10 lakh category that the overall SUV share has gone up — without it, the SUV share is not so high,” said Hemal Thakkar, director, CRISIL Research. According to industry estimates, SUVs comprise 38% of calendar year passenger vehicle sales of which entry SUVs comprise 21%. The reason why compacts — SUV and hatch — rule the market is because of affordability. And Maruti Suzuki has managed to retain its market leadership thanks to its hold on the sub-4 metre models. “In calendar 2021, Maruti Suzuki has 8 out of 10 top models, the highest in the last 10 years. The top 4 models in the lineup are hatchbacks contributing 14 lakh out of a total of nearly 31 lakh units sold by the top 10 models. In 2020, the hatch contribution was 6.4 lakh units while the top ten models sold 13 lakh units. Hatch is a big segment, but with sub-segmentation to cater to different types of consumers we can do that with our large portfolio,” said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director-marketing & sales, Maruti Suzuki. Auto consultants say there is a reason why the hatch numbers have grown so sharply even within the top 10 lineup – these are affordable cars. Also the SUV growth has not eaten into the hatch share. “The hatchback segment continues to constitute a healthy proportion of sales on account of affordability, but the sedan segment has seen numbers dwindle with recent new launches also being in SUV category,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP & sector head ICRA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hatchbacks-continue-to-rule-big-on-automart/articleshow/88674440.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

For several months, officials at the finance ministry have maintained that LIC would be a listed entity before fiscal 2022 ends. The IPO size is expected to be worth about Rs 1 lakh crore, which will make it the biggest ever equity offering in India. Among a host of other information that LIC officials shared with those investors was the life insurance major’s increasing focus on non-participating products like ULIPs, pension, annuity and health insurance products, sources said. This is part of LIC’s efforts to diversify its product mix and increase sales of existing non-participating products as well as launching new non-participating products, they said. As part of its growth plans, the life insurance major also wants to recruit more millennial agents to keep pace with the changing demographic pattern of India. According to some estimates, about 67% of India’s population are in the age group of 15-64 years and the median age is nearly nine years. Additionally, LIC officials told investors that the insurer wants to increase its market share of the bancassurance channel as it’s in the process of tying up with more partners. The life insurance major is also pushing for increasing digital adoption for its bancassurance partners to improve productivity, sources said. Officials further told investors how LIC wants to increase up-selling and cross-selling to individual customers, expand average ticket size of the products it sells and also increase the productivity of its intermediaries. In earlier presentations to prospective investors in the LIC IPO, its officials had told them how the insurance company wants to leverage its digital strategy to grow its business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-looks-to-file-for-ipo-by-jan-3rd-week/articleshow/88675041.cms||Partha Sinha

The case was heard by the single bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari. In the last hearing of the case, the HC had given four weeks to Rajguru to submit her response. Notably, 40 residents of Udham Singh Nagar’s Shivrajpur Patti area have filed a petition saying that trees were felled in the fields to lay an overhead power line of 33,000 KV. The affected landowners were given compensation in the range of Rs 200-Rs 500 per tree that was fallen. This is despite the Bareilly zone approving a compensation double to the given amount. So far, none of the landowners have received the revised compensation amount. They have asked the court to direct the district administration to pay them a compensation amount in line with what the Bareilly zone has approved. The HC had asked the district administration to take a decision in the matter in the last hearing. However, a decision in this regard is yet to be taken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/hc-issues-contempt-notice-against-us-nagar-dm-in-compensation-payment-case/articleshow/88673425.cms||Sonali Mishra

In comparison, the same amount invested in the sensex would have grown to about Rs 1.2 lakh. A growing number of Indians are investing in cryptocurrencies despite extreme volatility and lack of regulation. But the trend is not just due to the prospect of high returns. Some took to crypto to bet on blockchain technology, while well-designed trading apps attracted others. TOI spoke to young crypto investors to understand their goals, strategies, and fears as uncertainties persist in 2022. Blockchain — a secure, decentralised ledger that enables crypto — was the focus of many backers. “My family faced several issues in land transfer. Blockchain could help solve such ledger management problems,” said a Bengaluru-based app developer. Crypto investors TOI spoke to didn’t wish to be named. A law student said that crypto was much more than an investment option for him. “I like its focus on decentralisation. Blockchain can solve so many problems in terms of duplication and transparency.” Investors are aware that crypto won’t be allowed for payments. For them, it is simply a bet on a futuristic technology that governments cannot ignore. However, they are careful of their monetary exposure to crypto in case a ban is announced. Many said they invest only what they can afford to lose. The Bengaluru-based app developer has invested less than Rs 1 lakh, while another investor has allocated just 5% of his portfolio to crypto. For others, crypto is hard to ignore because of the ease of investing. “The technology crypto exchanges have created for UI/UX (user interface/user experience) makes it very easy for users to transact. Even the biggest banks are unable to simplify what’s on the screen when trading stocks,” an investor said. A 26-year-old Gurgaon-based investor said he opened an account with a crypto exchange after seeing a TV commercial in May. “First, it was just for investment. But once I started to understand the tech behind crypto, I invested more,” he said. The youngster, who works in his family business, has seen his Rs 3-lakh investment grow nearly threefold in less than a year. Most of these investors have similar strategies: Buy on dips and sell only when necessary. However, crypto investors don’t have a complaint-resolution mechanism. “Banks keep disabling services to crypto exchanges arbitrarily. As a result, it’s a nightmare to deposit or withdraw funds,” an investor said. Due to lack of regulation and fears of a ban, some Indians have even moved their investments to foreign crypto exchanges. Blockchain backers are also concerned about traps like ‘shitcoins’ — a term used to refer to cryptocurrencies that have no specified function or innovative quality. While the last two years saw strong rallies, 2022 may not be a good year for bitcoin. “On technical charts, Bitcoin is showing a bearish trend in both short- and medium-terms,” said Rajendra Agarwal, a technical analysis trainer and founder, Autus Investment.

They hid it in walls and our government is now sending bulldozers to their homes to retrieve this money. These people are accepting this is loot money because now they are requesting the election commission to ensure that these raids are held after the elections. These are the people who were a roadblock in the way of development, and our government will not spare them,” the chief minister said, referring to an income tax department raid against a Samajwadi Party MLC after which party chief Akhilesh Yadav had accused the government of vendetta politics. The CM said that when SP was in power, the marriage grant given by the government was taken by middlemen and beneficiaries got nothing. “When BJP came to power, it started the Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana under which each married couple was getting Rs 51,000 as financial aid,” he said, adding that his government was making arrangements for the education of the children of labourers and workers by setting up Atal Residential Schools, providing them with social security of Rs 2 lakh during the pandemic, houses, toilets and cooking gas. “The state also gave medical insurance of Rs 5 lakh to all workers in association with the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh,” Yogi said. “During the first wave of the pandemic, over 40 lakh workers were forced to return to the state. Our government immediately started work to help them find employment and now, most of these people are employed in local industries or have started their own businesses,” the CM said. Around 3.81 crore workers will be linked with the maintenance scheme of which accounts of 1.50 crore have been verified so far. These beneficiaries are being given maintenance money for two months in the first phase. In the next four months, assistance will be extended to the remaining beneficiaries. The chief minister added that sanitation workers will be incorporated in the scheme as well since they worked as front line workers during the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/1-5crore-workers-get-monthly-allowance/articleshow/88675464.cms||TNN
---||Business||E-pay up to Rs 500 without pin, network||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed all payment providers to facilitate small-ticket payments of up to Rs 200 each digitally, without internet or telecom connectivity and without additional factor authentication. There is an overall limit of Rs 2,000 for all transactions until balance is replenished. The payments can be done through any secure instrument including cards, e-wallets or mobile phones. While there is no compulsion for sending an alert for each transaction, providers will have to convey the details. According to payment service providers, this would be similar to how payments are made for transportation like in Metros through a prepaid e-wallet. “Since the transactions are offline, alerts (by way of SMS and/or e-mail) will be received by the customer after a time lag. They are subject to a limit of Rs 200 per transaction and an overall limit of Rs 2,000 for all transactions until balance in the account is replenished. Balance replenishment can only occur in an online mode,” the RBI said in a statement. For banks, the main advantage of such a system is that it will ease the pressure on their core-banking systems (CBS) and on other infrastructure. Today, if a customer sends even one rupee using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform, it hits the banks’ CBS. Also, it increases the number of entries in a customer’s passbook or monthly statement manifold. The offline low-value transactions will take place through an e-wallet. This will also help small businesses that are located in areas with poor telecom network. “Offline mode of payment can be enabled only after obtaining specific consent of the customer. Customers shall enjoy protection under the provisions of circulars limiting customer liability issued by the RBI. Customers also have recourse to the Reserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman Scheme for grievance redress,” the RBI said. The central bank’s concept of limited liability ensures that a customer does not lose money once he notifies the bank that their card is lost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-pay-up-to-rs-500-without-pin-network/articleshow/88675267.cms||---

In a separate order on Digit Insurance, the regulator said that non-life companies cannot provide a death benefit in their policies. This clarification puts to rest any speculation over the admissibility of claims arising out of the new variant. Last year, the regulator had told insurance companies that health policies must cover Covid infection even though worldwide some companies rejected claims on the grounds of pandemic exclusion. “Insurance companies shall put in place an effective coordinating mechanism with all their network providers (hospitals) to make available seamless cashless facility to all policyholders in the case of hospitalisation if any and render speedy services to all policyholders,” Irdai said. Regarding the ‘Digit Group Total Protect Policy’, Irdai said in its order that according to the Insurance Act, 1938, no insurer shall carry on any class of insurance business in India unless it has obtained from the authority a certificate of registration. Digit Insurance chief distribution officer Adarsh Agarwal said, “There is a difference in views of what is health insurance and what is life insurance. This is a legal interpretation issue and Digit will be reviewing this order with our legal team.” He added that the company had stopped offering this life feature according to Irdai’s advice. “All existing policies issued under this product will remain valid and any claim arising on these policies during the policy term will be honoured according to product terms and conditions,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-covers-must-include-omicron-costs-irdai/articleshow/88675300.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid protocols take a back seat at markets on first day of curbs||Kolkata: The members of market committees on Monday tried to enforce Covid safety guidelines that were found being flouted by traders and buyers at most of the community markets across the city. At these markets, there were crowds of people since morning and most of the people were seen without masks while maintaining social distancing also took a back seat. Some others had their masks hanging from their chins. Shop owners did not make any attempt in segregating the crowds in keeping with Covid protocols. A joint team of KMC officials and Kolkata Police has been formed to keep tabs on the markets like Ultadanga, Maniktala, Rashmoni Bazar in Beliaghata, College Street, Koley Market, New Market, Posta, Gariahat, Garfa, Garia, Bijoygarh and Bhowanipore. “There will be joint awareness drive every week. We are telling market committees to strictly adhere to no-mask-no-entry rule,” said an official of the team. Many market committees are also toying with the idea of shifting some of the stalls out in the open to reduce crowds. “We did this during the first two waves and it helped us. We are seeking the help of local cops in this regard,” said an office bearer of the Federation of Traders’ Organisation. Cops said that not less than 16 markets in the focus area of south Kolkata are in their watch list. “People are refusing to follow basic Covid norms after being vaccinated. Perhaps the biggest violators are those who visit the market each morning,” said an officer. Traders have also been asked to wear masks, otherwise they will have to face the “consequences”. “We are conducting meetings and awareness drives, which are leaving little impact on people. They are under the impression that they are safe after receiving two doses,” said the secretary of a community market in north Kolkata. Meanwhile, several markets were sanitised on Monday with the help of KMC and fire department. “We suffered a lot during the first two waves. Several members lost their lives to the virus while many others lost their livelihoods. We do not want that to be repeated,” said a trader.

---||Lucknow||Field Yogi from Mathura: BJP MP to high command||Lucknow: BJP Rajya Sabha MP Harnath Singh Yadav on Monday pitched for fielding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as party candidate from Mathura in the forthcoming assembly elections. The Mathura seat is currently represented by UP energy minister Srikant Sharma. In a letter to party president J P Nadda, Yadav claimed that “Lord Krishna inspired him to write this letter”. Yadav also posted the letter on Twitter, tagging PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “Although voters of each assembly seat want Yogi ji to contest from their constituency, people of Braj region have a special desire that the CM should contest from Mathura, the land of Lord Krishna,” said Yadav, who hails from Mainpuri and was once considered close to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. He joined BJP in 2014 and was made Rajya Sabha MP in 2018. The letter has surfaced when the demand for CM Yogi contesting the state elections is growing shriller. Yogi too has expressed his willingness in contesting from any seat decided by the high command. Speculations have been rife about Yogi being fielded from Gorakhpur or Ayodhya, the Hindutva nerve centre. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav too has been dropping broad hints of contesting the election if Yogi also joins the fray. The development comes amid growing voices within BJP vis-a-vis development of Mathura. CM Yogi recently said that after construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and renovation of Kashi Vishwanath temple premises, it is the turn of ‘Mathura’s development’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/field-yogi-from-mathura-bjp-mp-to-high-command/articleshow/88675482.cms||TNN

Teachers said that even few students who were not keen to vaccinate also took the jab.For the past several months, teachers were not limited to teaching in the class but they have been also motivating students to get the vaccination. Their efforts turned fruitful on the first day of the vaccination for the age group 15-18.“During both online and offline classes, students were taught about the benefits of the vaccination. Though it was not that easy to convince them as their parents were not convinced. Even during several classes, I had to talk to the parents also to convince them about the benefits of the vaccination,” said principal, Red Rose School, Farhat Hashmi.Teachers also said that even before the launching of the vaccination they were motivating the children about the benefits. “We were hoping that the vaccination for the children would come soon. I had instructed our teachers to interact with the students regularly about the benefits of the vaccination. This has made a big difference as several students have agreed to take the vaccination. We are organizing a camp in the school soon,” said principal NRI GDS, Archana Sharma.Even several students who were skeptical about taking the vaccination have now agreed to take it. “I was worried as people were talking a lot about the after-effects of the vaccination. However, my teacher played an important role in convincing me. I took the vaccination today only,” said class 11 student Ashish Nigam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/when-gurus-show-the-way-teachers-motivate-kids-for-vax/articleshow/88676294.cms||Ramendra Singh

The statement by CPI leader Binoy Viswam that the Left Front is no alternative if Congress collapses at the Centre is only his personal statement, he added. Talking to media persons in Kumily on Monday prior to CPM district meeting, Kodiyeri said that those opposing the K-Rail project are politically motivated and the government will not cancel the project due to it. “Congress and BJP are also trying to scuttle the Sabarimala airport project and the state government will not let this happen,” he said. “BJP created economic inequality in the country and the aim of RSS is to implement religion-based rule. Congress should clarify its stand on whether Hindus should rule the nation. Rahul Gandhi’s statement to this effect is aimed to help RSS,” he alleged. While presenting the party report at the meeting, district secretary KK Jayachandran criticized former MLA S Rajendran over his absence in the election campaigns in Devikulam. “Rajendran did not mention the name of the party candidate A Raja in the campaign functions he addressed. Rajendran did not obey the party leaders’ direction to mention the name. An inquiry commission suggested party-level action against him,” said the report. The party commission has already recommended that Rajendran be suspended from the party for a year. Meanwhile, Rajendran skipped the district-level meeting. “Rajendran attending the district meeting or not is his wish. The party will discuss the issue in the meeting,” said Kodiyeri. The delegates meeting will continue on Tuesday. At 4pm, water resource minister Roshy Augustine will inaugurate a tourism seminar at Kumily bus stand. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate a public meeting at Kumily bus stand at 3pm on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cpm-working-to-oust-modi-in-next-polls-says-kodiyeri/articleshow/88674168.cms||---

Former MLA Maal Chand and Uttarkashi zila panchayat chairman Deepak Bijilwan joined Congress in presence of senior party members in Delhi.  Meanwhile, ex-IPS officer Anant Ram Chauhan, who was the working president of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and head of the party’s Garhwal division, joined Congress on Sunday after a meeting with Priyanka Gandhi. Deepak Bijalwan joining CongressMaal Chand had won the Purola assembly constituency, a seat reserved for Scheduled Caste, in 2012 on BJP’s ticket. In 2017, Chand was defeated from the seat by Rajkumar, who had then switched sides from the BJP to Congress. However, Rajkumar has again come back to the saffron fold. He quit Congress a few weeks ago. Since Rajkumar’s re-entry into the BJP, there were speculations that he will be given the ticket to contest from the Purola seat. In the wake of these rumours, Chand has now joined Congress and he is expected to contest against Rajkumar again in the 2022 assembly elections. This time, however, Rajkumar will fight on a BJP ticket and Chand is most likely to be the Congress candidate. Meanwhile, Deepak Bilijwan, the other BJP leader to join Congress, also has a history with the grand old party. In mid-2000s, he was serving as a leader of the National Students’ Union of India, the student wing of the Indian National Congress. In 2006-07, Bijilwan was also given the key post of NSUI national general secretary. Later, he joined the BJP and rose to the rank of a zila panchayat chairman in Uttarkashi. Now, he has again joined the Congress. Although Bilijwan hails from Purola, he is being considered as a frontrunner for the Congress ticket from the Yamunotri assembly constituency. Apart from Chand and Bilijwan, AAP leader Anant Ram Chauhan has also joined the Congress. The switch is being seen as a major jolt to the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, which is making efforts to make inroads in the Himalayan state. Speaking on the induction of three new members, Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal said, “All three are prominent faces and their presence will definitely help the party. Maal Chand is a former MLA and has a stronghold in this area. He is a respected man and known for his commitment towards the people. On the other hand, Bijilwan is a young politician and has displayed his leadership skills in the last few years.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/ahead-of-polls-major-jolt-to-bjp-aap-2-senior-saffron-party-leaders-aap-working-prez-for-ukhand-join-cong/articleshow/88754984.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Lucknow||BJP kicks off exercise to gauge voters’ aspirations||Lucknow: Even as the raring opposition has started announcing tempting poll promises, the ruling BJP has also stepped up the spade work to assess the aspirations of people for including them in its election manifesto to be unveiled soon after the notification for the UP assembly elections is issued. Sources said the party has asked its functionaries to quickly go through the heap of suggestions put in the 30,000 boxes that had been placed across the state last year. The boxes were put up in over 27,000 Shakti Kendras — each being a conglomeration of five to six polling booths — after the party launched its feedback campaign ‘Sujhaav Aapke, Sankalp Humara’ on December 15. BJP also plans to roll out a key exercise in 19 key districts, including major cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Prayagraj, to speak to the intelligentsia and other voting classes to gauge the mood of the electorate before drafting its poll manifesto. “The process of compiling maximum suggestions is expected to be completed by the second week of this month,” said member of the election manifesto committee and head of the UP BJP research wing Pushkar Mishra. BJP’s election manifesto committee is headed by senior cabinet minister Suresh Khanna, while party’s Rajya Sabha MP and former DGP Brij Lal is the vice-chairman. Other members are MPs Rajesh Verma, Vijay Pal Tomar, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Seema Dwivedi and Kanta Kardam. The Congress party had set the ball rolling when its general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra released a women-centric manifesto in December promising smartphones for all Class 12 pass girls and an electric scooty to all graduates on being voted to power. Recently, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav also promised free electricity up to 300 units for domestic consumers and to farmers for irrigation. The SP announcement came close on the heels of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party promising 300 units of free electricity to all domestic consumers, waiver of outstanding bills of 38 lakh families and 24-hour power supply. SP’s ally, Jayant Chaudhary led RLD has announced one crore jobs with 50% reservation to women and establishment of high court benches in Purvanchal, Bundelkhand and western region. Meanwhile, the BSP, which stays away from releasing election manifesto, has been continuously slamming BJP, Congress and SP for misleading the people with promises before elections and forgetting them after coming to power. Experts said that BJP will have to effectively counter the opposition which has been wheeling out alluring poll promises, much to the chagrin of the saffron brass. The politics around the election manifesto has been attaining prominence after opposition upped the ante against BJP, accusing it of floundering on fulfilling the promises it made to the people before 2017 assembly elections. BJP, on the other hand, has been sending out pointed rebuttals claiming that ‘all promises were fulfilled’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-kicks-off-exercise-to-gauge-voters-aspirations/articleshow/88675488.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: 11,000 teenagers get Covid jab in district||COIMBATORE: As many as 11,008 children in the age group of 15-18 years were vaccinated in the district on the first day of paediatric vaccination on Monday. Of the 1.61 lakh children in the age group, the district administration had planned to cover 16,000 on the first day at 83 schools. Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) workers of the health department visited schools, government hospitals and public health facilities where people walked in with their children for vaccination. Vaccination of children evoked mixed response from parents, a school education department official said. While some were keen on vaccinating children in view of the new Omicron variant and believed that vaccination will keep children safe from virus, others were apprehensive. S Rangasamy, 45, of Karamadai said he wanted to wait for some more days to see the response of the vaccine before getting his 15-year-old daughter vaccinated. Though he is fully vaccinated, after some of his relatives developed post-vaccination fever, he is apprehensive. Chief educational officer N Geetha said some students were left out of the vaccination drive on Monday after their parents objected. “As it was the first day, we were expecting such issues. We will persuade apprehensive parents after most of the students are vaccinated,” she told TOI. Dr S Seralathan, chief medical officer of the government hospital in Periyanaikenpalayam, said the first day’s drive evinced lukewarm response. The GH was one among the many walk-in vaccination centres for the 15-18 age group. “Some parents demanded Covishield instead of Covaxin for their ward. But government has mandated only Covaxin for paediatric vaccination. Parents had the perception that their wards may not be able to travel overseas if they take Covaxin.” A senior health official expressed hope that vaccination for children would be completed before January 10 as booster dose for the frontline workers would begin on that day. It would be challenging to manage resources by having dedicated counters for paediatric vaccination and vaccinate those who need to be administered the third dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/11000-teenagers-get-covid-jab-in-dist/articleshow/88674165.cms||---

It is true that Left parties maintain a strong stand against BJP. But, if the Congress is pulverized, Left parties may not be ableto surge ahead in all states. This is what Binoy Viswam said, and it is a fact,” said Kanam.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that only the Left block could emerge as an alternative force against BJP is what CPM thinks. It was quite natural that Vijayan and Viswam have different opinions, said Kanam. “What Pinarayi Vijayan says is CPM’s outlook. He is the politburo member of CPM while Binoy Viswam is a member of CPI national secretariat. They both said the stand of the parties they represent. We remain as two parties because we have different opinions, said Kanam.However, CPM and CPI share the same outlook when it comes to the political stand on national issues. There could be differences of opinion in its nuances, but the general perception is the same, Kanam said. The CPI state secretary repeated that the state government was bound to clear concerns about the K-Rail project. “Government will do that. No need for more comments on that,” he said.Rajendran criticized governor Arif Mohammed Khan for recommending DLitt for the Indian President. “DLitt is not something that should be given on recommendation. It’s for the university to decide. Universities have autonomy. No recognition needs to be earned through recommendations,” he said. Kanam reiterated the CPI opinion that the governor post was an unwarranted one.Kanam also said that criticisms against the police was natural and the home department cannot be judged by such complaints. “Lower-rung officers may still be practicing several wrong things. Such things don’t happen with the knowledge or consent of the home department or the home minister,” he said. “When did the police force not attract criticism?” he asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kanam-backs-viswam-on-cpis-concern-over-cong/articleshow/88676326.cms||---

The fire was spotted at AS Traders at around 11am. Though residents spotted the fire and tried to douse it, they failed as the fire gathered strength.Around 25 fire force units from Thiruvananthapuram rushed to the spot. It took around five hours to extinguish the fire completely. The disaster would have gone out of hand if fire force officers had not been able to keep it under check. The fire occurred in a densely housed area filled with shops and houses. However, no casualties were reported as all residents from nearby houses were evacuated .The residents said that the fire occurred due to short circuit in the electric line. The AS Traders is owned by Sulfithkhar and his son Ishan Ahammed of Kallattumukku.The godown had materials, including iron, oil cans and other plastics, which caught fire and emanated thick black smoke. Mild blasts also occurred in the shop, posing further threat.“We have noticed sparks in the electric post from the past two days and I informed the KSEB. It was repaired on Monday morning just five minutes before the fire occurred,” said Haneefa S, one of the workshop owners.The shop is situated on a narrow road and the fire soon spread to the other side of the road, which includes workshops. There were three houses and a scrap shop near the godown. Among these, two houses were slightly affected by the fire. The door of one of the houses caught fire.“The accident has destroyed two coconut trees in my compound and also the air conditioner in the second floor is also damaged,” said Kumar D, one of the residents.The area was completely covered with black smoke. Medical workers were assigned at the spot to ensure the safety of people, especially to handle the breathing issues with smoke. Ambulance service was also available. Other than fire force officers, police, civil defence volunteers, doctors and staff nurses from the general hospital, and KSEB officials were present.“It was difficult to extinguish the fire as making way was difficult. Later, we sprayed water from the top of the houses,” said Shaji G S, a fire force personnel from Chenkalchoola unit.“When we arrived here, the fire was spreading fast. The plastic bottles and other things exploded and shreds were coming towards us and it was difficult,” said Mohanan J, a fire force staff. The shop owner said that they have suffered a huge loss. “It has caused a loss of around Rs 8 lakh for us. We had materials, including iron and plastics. We have not taken electricity connection to the godown to avoid dangers like this. Unfortunately, this happened,” said Ahammed. KSEB officials said that spark from the electric line did not result in fire.“When I contacted the electrical inspector, it was understood that no spark occurred in this electric line. So, the occurrence of this accident must because of some other reason. The works to restore electricity will start soon,” said an official from KSEB.“It would have been a big tragedy if we were not able to stop the fire. Another danger is the houses around the godown. People living in those houses were also evacuated at the right time. There was a lot of smoke due to the presence of tar and other compressors. We overcame the situation by placing the fire extinguishing vehicles in different parts of the area,” said Dileepan P, regional fire force officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/residents-evacuated-after-fire-breaks-out-at-scrap-godown-at-karamana/articleshow/88676329.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt ignored finance dept’s advice||Thiruvananthapuram: In a hurry to implement the SilverLine project brushing aside all kinds of opposition, the government ignored the recommendations from its own finance department too not to proceed with the project in the present form, considering the grave financial situation of the state.According to top government sources, the finance department had strongly recommended that the project be implemented in two phases, the first one being a line from Thiruvananthapuram to Kochi. Once the viability of the project is assessed and found successful, the project can be extended further in the second phase. The finance department also recommended that after the funds that have been released for the initial preparatory works —establishment costs and contingency charges— no funds for land acquisition should be released until the Centre gives the final approval for the project.From Thiruvananthapuram to Kochi airport, there are six stations, covering a distance of 212.32km of the total project length of 530.6km. These include Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Chengannur, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Kochi airport. The total project completion cost, including the price escalation, has been calculated as Rs 63,940.67 crore in 2025. The implementation of the project as two phases from Thiruvananthapuram to Kochi would bring down the cost by more than half the calculated cost.Even the consultant company, Systra, that prepared the detailed project report (DPR) for the SilverLine project, had mentioned in its report about undertaking the project in two phases. “Alternatively, the project can be phased out with the first phase between Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur and the second phase from Thrissur to Kasaragod,” the DPR had said. However, it strongly recommended that the construction and commissioning of the SilverLine can be done in one go for the entire 530.6 km from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod, if the funds are available for the full project. It said that the reason for implementing the project in one single phase is because the project viability and cost estimates have been worked out with a completion period of five years. At the same time, if undertaken in two phases, the completion period will be extended to seven years resulting in cost overrun and reduction in financial internal rate of return (FIRR). On the basis of cash flows accruing to the project considering revenues from fare box, non-fare box and value capture financing sources, the FIRR for the project has been estimated as 8.49% and the FIRR to the equity holders of the project has been worked out at 13.55%.The state is reeling from an immense financial crisis, so much so that several committed payments had to be deferred. The government had decided to defer the leave surrender of government employees to the next financial year (2022-23) in the wake of fund crunch. Similarly, the third and fourth installments of pension arrears after the pay revision came into force, that were originally scheduled to be distributed in August and November in the current financial year, have also been deferred to the next year. The pension arrears and leave surrender of government employees aggregate to about Rs 5,900 crore.The state received only Rs 47,671.98 crore from its own tax revenue in 2020-21, against the estimated Rs 67,420.01 crore. Similarly, there has been a reduction in the revenue earnings through GST in the state by 18.47% in the last financial year compared to the preceding year, while there has been a drop of 9.51% in the revenue through motor vehicle tax compared to the year before.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-ignored-finance-depts-advice/articleshow/88676330.cms||---

Peak turnout during the festive season brought good money for the museum and zoo as the daily collection, which hovered around Rs 1-2 lakh, jumped to Rs 4 lakhs towards the last week of December. The authorities recorded a cumulative collection of Rs 1.01 crore by the end of December.“In 2020, for an entire year we could collect only Rs 1.4 crore. This year, we crossed 1 crore in just around 50 days,” museum and zoo director said Abu S.The revenue collection from parking also increased considerably with many visitors opting for private vehicles and parking of vehicles on museum compounds yielded good revenue. With RKV Road being closed for parking as part of Smart City works, the museum compound was the much sought after parking zone for many visitors.While the city zoo is the favoured spot for visitors, natural history museum and museum gallery also gained from the visits to the city zoo.The zoo and museum were reopened in October. In October last week, the daily collection from the art gallery, the museum and the zoo had picked up from Rs 64,310 to Rs 1,69,075 in less than a week. In November, the collection has more or less been steady between 90,000-1 lakh and there were a few days when it crossed Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh.Group visits from educational institutions had been a major source of revenue for the museum and zoo. Owing to Covid-19, such visits from schools and other states have been completely halted.The renovated natural history museum, which was reopened for public in January 2021, is drawing attention from visitors. The museum was equipped with attractive and informative display systems and the project was completed at a cost of Rs 6 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/revenue-from-museum-zoo-crosses-1-crore/articleshow/88676331.cms||---

He was talking at the workshop for teachers, being organized by Kerala state chalachithra academy and department of general education at Kinfra film academy.“Cinema should be viewed as an art form with the gravity it deserves. It is unacceptable to limit film as a medium for short-lived entertainment. A film can be absorbed in its depth by watching it in theatres rather than enjoying a film being streamed on OTT platform,” he said. General education department director Jeevan Babu inaugurated the three-day workshop. He said that the teachers shall update their knowledge in tune with the changing times. “They shall always be aware of the fact that they teach a generation who was born into the world of visuals,” he said. Academy vice-chairperson Beena Paul said that film is a medium which gives knowledge about the life and culture of other countries. Sibi Malayil, Sunny Joseph, Vidhu Vincent, K B Venu, Vijayakrishnan, P F Mathews, G R Santosh Kumar, Fr Benny Benedict will conduct various sessions at the workshop.Malayil will distribute certificates in the concluding ceremony, which will be held on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/film-is-an-art-best-experienced-in-theatres-adoor/articleshow/88676337.cms||---

IUML state general secretary PMA Salam said the party will organize marches to collectorates in all districts on Jan 27 and an assembly march in February. IUML’s plan to hold a campaign against the LDF government over the issue inside mosques under the umbrella of Muslim Coordination Council fell flat after Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema, the influential body of Sunni religious scholars belonging to EK faction that traditionally aligns with the party, didn’t support the move. Following the development, IUML had organized a mega Waqf Protection Rally at Kozhikode Beach which was attended by thousands of people. Salam said the party has decided to conduct awareness campaigns at the local level by holding day-night stirs. The meeting opined that the Waqf Protection Rally was a big success. He added that the CM’s act of holding talks with Samastha leaders on Waqf board issue was to trick them as no action was taken a month after the meeting. “We don’t trust the chief minister and the party will continue its agitation till the decision on Waqf board appointments is revoked,” he said. IUML has also decided to take action against some party mandalam committee officials for their lapses which contributed to the party’s defeat in five assembly constituencies. IUML will give them an opportunity to provide an explanation before finalizing disciplinary action. Salam said disciplinary action would be taken after it is approved by the state working committee scheduled on Jan 10. The proposed action will include warning, censure or removing them from organizational posts. Party will organize a month-long membership drive online from March 1-31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/iuml-announces-phase-ii-of-agitation-from-jan-27/articleshow/88674183.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Congress leaders visit temples, Amethi only during polls: Yogi||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday attacked the Congress for pursuing “divisive politics” and falling back on “Hinduism” only at the time of elections. Addressing a public gathering after laying the foundation stone of Government Medical College in Amethi worth Rs 293 crore and inaugurating a 500-bedded district-level referral hospital there, Yogi said that Congress leaders who used to call themselves “accidental Hindus” have no right to be called “Hindus”. “They start visiting temples and come to Amethi only at the time of elections,” he said. Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani was also present on the occasion. The CM also took a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying that he does not even know how to sit in a temple and knows nothing about Hinduism or Hindutva. “During elections in Gujarat, the former MP of Amethi went to a temple and sat there in a position as if offering namaz. The priests corrected him and taught him how to sit in a temple,” Yogi said. "But this is not the case with us. When I was not the CM and now that I am the CM, I have no hesitation in saying this with pride that I'm a Hindu," he said. Yogi also accused the previous UPA government of bringing in a law to play with the faith of Hindus. “They wanted to imprison the Hindus of this country, wanted to play with their faith,” he said. He categorically criticized Congress, accusing it of being driven by lust for power. “They were eager to break Ram Setu. They used to instigate riots,” he said. Slamming Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for crying foul over the recent tax raids on his aide, the CM said that in the previous governments, public money used to go to the pockets of ‘babua’. This is the reason they are requesting the Election Commission to postpone the raids and conduct them after the elections, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/congress-leaders-visit-temples-amethi-only-during-polls-yogi/articleshow/88675496.cms||TNN

They, in fact, spurred her on. Between 2007 and 2015, the 25-year-old underwent seven surgeries in a Mumbai hospital to straighten her ‘S’-shaped spinal cord and retard its sideways growth. The result is there to see: Rachana put in the hard yards, and only five months after professionally taking up the sport, bagged a bronze medal in para badminton in the first-ever tournament she played in. Hailing from Mehsana’s Bahucharaji village and presently residing in Ahmedabad’s Gota area, Rachana won a bronze medal in singles in the SH-6 (standing/short stature) category at the recently-concluded 4th National Para Badminton Championship in Bhubaneswar. She shrugged off the loss of opening game to beat Maharashtra’s Latatai Umrekar 17-21, 21-16, 21-18 in the bronze medal playoff match. After winning the medal, Rachana, who stands tall at 4ft 3in, told TOI, “I dedicate this medal to my parents and my brother. Without the sacrifices made by my family, I would not have achieved anything.” She says her goal is to liberate her parents of the financial problems, which they had to face in order to give her a good life.“The disability has never been an obstacle to reach the heights I aspire to. In fact, I feel it has given me more opportunities to succeed. Wherever I go around, there have been talks about my dwarfism. But, I feel special and unique and this has spurred me to scale newer heights,” said Rachana, who is pursuing MBBS degree from China. During the lockdown, she took to planks and created a record that has been etched in the India Book of Records. “I was always interested in doing plank exercise as that aided my spine rehabilitation and recovery. I did a continuous plank for two hours, 29 minutes and 43 seconds and this record has found a mention in the India Book of Records,” Rachana says.The immediate goal, she points out, is to complete the final year of her doctoral studies and appear for the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE), which will enable her to get a licence and start medical practice in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/at-4ft-3in-rachana-standstall-with-bronze-at-nationals/articleshow/88676350.cms||Sabu Cherian

State health department officials said their primary focus is covering teens through schools. “Thus, all schools have been asked to coordinate with parents to get children vaccinated. Even those not associated with educational institutes such as schools, hostels or ITIs can get vaccinated at designated centres,” said an official, adding that they have walk-in arrangements with both online and on-the-spot registration on the CoWIN portal available.A medical officer in Bodakdev ward said parents and teachers were happy as it would reduce their worries about students’ movement for classes. Dr Trupti, a medical officer at a vaccination centre, said they expected to vaccinate 500-700 teens at three schools in her area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/day-1-5l-teenagers-vaccinated/articleshow/88676351.cms||---

The shortage of vegetables, not just in Gujarat but even in Maharashtra, has caused the prices to shoot up so much that most vegetables are priced around Rs 100 per kg. Sources in the APMC said, “Cauliflower, which was sold for Rs 10 in the wholesale market last year, is being sold for Rs 30 now. By the time it reaches, the end user, it costs almost Rs 150.”An APMC office-bearer, refusing to be named, said, "We do not expect prices to go down till Uttarayan as Amdavadis are going to consume a lot of vegetables till then. People will make undhiyu and consumption is likely to go up by at least 30%."APMC secretary Deepak Patel said, "The fluctuation in weather has affected production. Again, there is a forecast of unseasonal rain in north Gujarat which can affect production. The vegetable harvest in Maharashtra, especially in the Nashik belt, is low too. So, cauliflowers have been transported from Prantij to Mumbai."Javed Shaikh, a dealer at the APMC, said, "The city gets 360 tonnes of vegetables including potatoes and onions. Of this, 200 tonnes is green vegetables. Vegetables from the APMC here is transported to Rajasthan, Delhi and northern parts of the country. There is a demand from these areas and the traders are getting good price in Delhi and Rajasthan. This has led to a shortage in the city."However, the price hike has not benefited farmers, said an office-bearer of the APMC. "If a vegetable costed Rs 35 in the wholesale market, the farmer only got Rs 20 or Rs 25. The dealers took the rest as commission. Since the APMC does not control the retail market, the prices of vegetables in the city have spiralled out of control," he said.Giving an example, he said that tomatoes at Jamalpur are priced at Rs 35 per kg. "In the eastern part of the city, you can get it for Rs 45 to Rs 50. If you go to Navrangpura then it will be Rs 70 per kg but you will get it for Rs 80 in Satellite."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/winter-fails-to-chill-vegetable-prices/articleshow/88676353.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The woman, in her FIR at Sola police station, stated that she married a man from Gota in 2006, according to the wishes of her family members.

In his preliminary meetings with health and solid waste management teams, the newly appointed municipal commissioner Lochan Sehra stressed that he wants to implement the Indore model of solid waste management in Ahmedabad city. Back in 2018, the AMC made a similar attempt, concentrating on efforts designed to push the city up the Swachh Survekshan rankings. The civic body wanted to make Ahmedabad free of ‘visible garbage’. The AMC, like the Indore Municipal Corporation, back then employed 500 sanitation squad members to train residents and spread awareness in fixed pockets. But the effort did not pay off. Indore’s clean streets are the result of the efforts of 11,000 sanitation workers, more than 80% of whom are women who live within 1km of their service area and can manage their homes and work, said a senior AMC official. “Adequate manpower, capacity building of staff, and the acquisition of equipment including segregated garbage tippers are central to the Indore model,” the official said. “That model has other vital elements such as efficient waste segregation of recyclable waste, strong administrative control, and political will.” There’s a popular saying in Indore that “people fear the yellow garbage patrol vehicles more than police vehicles”. The sanitation inspectors or ‘daroga-jis’ in these jeeps have the power to fine litterbugs between Rs 100 and Rs 1 lakh on the spot. The AMC plans to run similar jeeps in the city. Indore’s ‘Sanitation Satyagraha’ began with a PIL in 2015 and the high court pulled up the city administration for all-pervasive filth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-picks-indore-model-from-2018-bin/articleshow/88676357.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: AAP’s Isudan Gadhvi arrested for allegedly drinking liquor||AHMEDABAD: Cops of the Infocity police station in Gandhinagar on Monday arrested Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Isudan Gandhvi, for alleged drinking of liquor at the times of the clash between AAP and BJP workers at Kamalam in Koba on December 20. Gadhvi was arrested after a forensic science laboratory (FSL) report confirmed the presence of alcohol in his blood on Saturday. An Infocity police official said, “Gadhvi was released on bail a couple of hours after his arrest in the liquor consumption case.” According to the FIR filed, the lab report found 0.0545% (weight by volume) alcohol presence in Gadhvi’s blood samples taken on December 20, just after his detention from Kamalam. Infocity PI P D Vaghela, the complainant in the case, stated that Gadhvi, who was drunk at the time, had become part of an unlawful assembly in an inebriated condition. The clash between AAP and BJP workers had taken place when AAP workers were protesting the leak of the question paper for the head clerk recruitment examination held by Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB). Some 20 AAP members were detained while police filed an FIR against Gadhvi, Gopal Italia, Shiv Kumar, Pravin Ram, Nikhil Savani, Hasmukh Patel and some 500 others, booking them under 18 sections of the IPC, including criminal trespass, molestation, unlawful assembly, causing hurt, conspiracy and destroying public property. Reacting to the police action, Gadhvi alleged that his forensic report may have been fudged at the instance of the ruling BJP and said he was ready to undergo a lie-detector test to prove that he is a teetotaller. Rejecting Gadhvi’s allegations, Gujarat BJP spokesperson Yagnesh Trivedi said every person accused of a crime always claims innocence before being proved guilty. “If Gadhvi thinks the BJP government is doing something wrong, he has the right to approach a court. He should not make such false allegations. Let the law take its course,” said Trivedi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/aaps-isudan-gadhvi-arrested-for-allegedly-drinking-liquor/articleshow/88676360.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Hospital liable to compensate for negligence even if treatment free||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered Kesar SAL Hospital to pay up Rs 8 lakh to a patient after the doctors left a mop inside his belly during a surgery. The hospital had claimed that the patient could not be considered a consumer since he was treated free of cost. The commission dismissed the hospital’s argument, stating that not all patients were being treated for free at the hospital and therefore the patient in question can be considered a consumer.According to case details, in December 2008, Pravinbhai Sonara from Dholka underwent an operation for appendicitis in the hospital which is now closed.After surgery, he continued to experience pain and was treated for the same for the next few months as well. However, it was not until he consulted another doctor and underwent another surgery at a different hospital in August 2009 that he found out the cause for his trouble — a mop left inside his large intestine.Sonara filed a complaint with Ahmedabad District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission and demanded Rs 15 lakh as compensation. His plaint was dismissed on the grounds that he cannot be considered a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act. This, because he was treated free of cost by the hospital which had a provision to treat the needy without charging them since the hospital was attached with a medical college.The patient then approached the state commission where the hospital denied the allegation that its doctors had forgotten the mop inside Sonara’s body.The hospital further argued that Sonara’s post-operative complication was because of a large infected appendix and adhesion of intestine etc. and it cannot be presumed that the pain in his abdomen was due to the so-called piece of cloth left in his large intestine. The state consumer commission refused to accept the argument that the patient cannot be considered a consumer according to the Trust Deed, for he was treated for free. It said that since the hospital was not treating every patient without charge and therefore the patient falls under the definition of consumer.The commission concluded that it was a case of gross medical negligence on part of the doctor and there is direct or vicarious liability on the hospital for the negligent act of its employees. Therefore, it ordered, Sonara was entitled to compensation for expenses he had incurred for the second operation to remove the mop from abdomen, and for the mental and physical anguish he suffered besides loss of income during the treatment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hospital-liable-to-compensate-for-negligence-even-if-treatment-free/articleshow/88676363.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Guj won’t seek extension in GST compensation period||Gandhinagar: Even as the major non-BJP-ruled states have demanded an extension of the ongoing GST (Goods and Services Tax) compensation for five more years, Gujarat’s BJP government has decided not to seek an extension. Other states have cited shrinking revenues due to the Covid-19 pandemic.A major financial crisis may hit the Gujarat government in the absence of GST compensation from the Government of India.The Gujarat government will look to spend money on various projects in a crucial election year. But it may be hard pressed in keeping voters in good humour as the uncertainty over GST compensation discontinuing from July 1 looms large. Also, there is a strong possibility of VAT on petroleum products being discontinued and these products being brought under the GST regime from July 1.Several states including Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, and West Bengal have demanded an extension of the ongoing GST compensation.Gujarat has been receiving about Rs 20,000 crore annually from the Centre in the form of GST compensation and its income from VAT on petroleum products is about Rs 25,000 crore a year.When asked about the Gujarat government’s views on the matter, finance minister Kanubhai Desai said: “The state government is of the view that the Government of India will take the best possible decision for Gujarat and for all other states.” He added: “We will work according to whatever decision is taken by the Government of India.”Key sources aware of developments said that the state finance department has started planning for the 2022-23 budget presuming that GST compensation will be discontinued from June 30. “If the state government does not get money from these two sources (GST compensation and VAT on petroleum products), we might have to cut down the budget size drastically or increase debt,” a source said.Gujarat government sources said that if petroleum products are brought under the GST purview, the revenue from GST on petroleum products will not even match half of the revenues that the state gets from VAT on petroleum products. “Right now there is serious concern over these issues. The government cannot afford to cut budgets for ongoing schemes in an election year,” said the source. “It is a tightrope walk for the government.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-wont-seek-extension-in-gst-compensation-period/articleshow/88676368.cms||---

The HC was told that after his arrest, Kumbharwadiya was paraded in public and assaulted by the cops. He sought action against the cops citing the Arneshkumar judgment by the Supreme Court, which laid down guidelines for treatment of an accused after arrest. He claimed that the police action of humiliating an accused in public was a blatant violation of the apex court’s order.During a hearing of the contempt case last month, the bench headed by Chief Justice Aravind Kumar asked the contemnor cops either to settle the dispute with the complainant or face framing of charges under contempt of court laws.However, as the complainant is behind bars, the cops have not been able to contact and negotiate with him. Their lawyers requested more time, which the court granted them on payment of Rs 10,000 by each of the contemnors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/5-cops-pay-10k-each-to-hc-for-adjournment/articleshow/88676372.cms||---
---||Surat||Indonesia bans coal export, South Gujarat industries feel the heat||Surat: With Indonesia banning export of coal in January, industries using coal are feeling the heat. Indonesia, world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, has suspended exports of the fossil fuel due to concerns over dwindling supplies for its domestic power plants. The export ban has already led to coal prices — both domestic and imported categories — going up by Rs 1,000-3,300 per tonne in the local markets, depending upon the calorific values of the coal, said industry players on Monday. According to trade estimates, around 40,000 tonnes of coal is supplied every day to various industries across south Gujarat from local ports. However, industries using coal claimed that they have stock of the fuel for a couple of weeks and they will not be affected by the price hike if the issue is resolved within a week. Coal distributors further claimed that the supplies will be hampered as Indonesian coal is widely used in the region as fuel. “The supplies will be impacted and those who stocks piled up will be at benefit. The importers whose coal is in transport will also benefit from the price hike," said Navin Suratwala, president of South Gujarat Coal Supplier Association (SGCSA). “The prices shot up to Rs 1,000 on the day Indonesia imposed the ban. Around 40,000 tonnes of coal is supplied to industries in south Gujarat from local ports on a daily basis,” said Suratwala. Coal is used as the main fuel in industries like textile processing, cement, steel, paper and chemical in south Gujarat. “At present we have sufficient stock of coal. But the heat will be felt if the supply is not restored within 15 days. Hopefully, a meeting between coal miners and the Indonesian government to be held on Wednesday will lead to some positive outcome,” said a processor. Apart from Indonesian coal, industries use Australian and Indian coal too. Due to the good quality of Indonesian coal, it is in high demand among industries in the region. “The Indonesian coal prices have shot up by Rs 3,300 per tonne. Depending upon the quality, the prices have suddenly increased in the past two days due to the ban,” said Jitendra Vakhariya, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/indonesia-bans-coal-export-south-gujarat-industries-feel-the-heat/articleshow/88674940.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

With the focus being shifted to schools, these students are left out as vaccination camps are not held in colleges anymore. “When the colleges reopened in September last year, at least 50% of students in the first year of under graduation were below the age of 18,” principal of Sri Ramakrishna Arts and Science College B L Shivakumar said. “Many of them would have attained the age of 18 year in the last few months and became eligible for vaccination. But a section of students would still be below 18 years. These students were not focused on the vaccination drive that began on Monday,” he said. Regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE) Coimbatore R Ulagi said that over 90% of the students in second and final year under-graduation and postgraduate students were vaccinated in colleges. “Only those who are below 18 years in the first-year may not have been vaccinated so far. We have asked for their details from the colleges,” she said. Ulagi said that the students can make use of walk-in vaccination centres set up across the district for vaccination without further delay. A senior official from the public health department said that some of the college students who were a few weeks short of 18 years were covered under vaccination drives in colleges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/students-below-18-yrs-in-colleges-left-out-of-drive/articleshow/88674182.cms||---

Welcoming Rakesh Pandey, Madhuri Verma and others, Akhilesh said the leaders and their supporters would strengthen the party and its resolve to replace the BJP government in the state in 2022 Assembly polls. “Their coming together is a sure sign that people have lost faith in the BJP and the Chief Minister. People have made up their mind and are waiting for the day when they will cast their vote and bring about a change that they are waiting for,” he said. Rakesh Pandey, who happens to be the father of sitting BSP MP from Ambedkar Nagar, Ritesh Pandey, is seen as the face of Brahmins in the district. His siding with the SP is being seen as a major blow to the BSP ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections. It has further strengthened SP’s position in Ambedkar Nagar as BSP MLA Ramachal Rajbhar and Lalji Verma from Akbarpur and Katehari constituencies, respectively, in Ambedkar Nagar have already joined SP in November. Prior to being elected as MP from Ambedkar Nagar in 2009 elections, Rakesh Pandey was elected MLA from Jalalpur assembly seat in the district on SP ticket. His joining the SP is being seen as more of a ‘ghar wapsi’. Sitting BJP MLA from Nanpara in Bahraich, Madhuri Verma, also joined SP on Monday. A Kurmi leader who won the 2012 assembly polls on a Congress ticket, Madhuri is the wife of Dilip Verma who was a close associate of late Beni Prasad Verma, one of the tallest Kurmi leaders of his times. Dilip Verma was also with the SP over a decade ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhilesh-says-people-ready-for-change-as-bsp-ex-mp-joins-sp/articleshow/88675505.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The drowning of four visitors at RK Beach in the city on January 2 has once again raised demands for safer beaches and focus on safety of visitors. The city has four major beaches, but these are unsafe for visitors. Strong rip currents, which are the main reason behind drowning deaths in the region, are not constant. Normally generated during high tides, they operate within a radius of 50 to 150 feet with speeds or power of suction between five to eight kilometres per hour. The rip current is a strong and narrow current of water moving away from the shore. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said drowning deaths have decreased in the past two years due to efforts of lifeguards at the beaches. Eighteen persons drowned in Vizag city in 201, 19. in 2020, and 13 in 2021, Sinha said. Drowning remains a largely unrecognised threat, a senior police officer said. Sometimes, retrieving bodies from the open sea poses difficulties and search operations need to be held with the support of the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard and can go on for days, he added. “Despite repeated warnings, some visitors venture deep into the sea for the fun and to take selfies, and they land in trouble. Sometimes, it’s not easy to rescue visitors from the waters,” said a lifeguard at RK Beach. Drowning deaths have also affected the reputation of the city’s beaches, raising calls for the district administration to strengthen beach safety by providing speed boats to lifeguards and lifejackets to visitors. Proposed watch towers to keep track on visitors who venture into danger zones in the open sea at remain in the pipeline. Residents said during the monsoon and low pressure, rip currents are high at the beaches, making venturing into the waters a dangerous proposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/beach-safety-back-in-focus-after-jan-2-drowning-deaths/articleshow/88676374.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Ahmedabad||Musical jab: Immunity against urban ennui||Ahmedabad: Ustad Shujaat Khan, the sitar titan from the Imdad Khani Gharana, “contains multitudes”. Walt Whitman used that phrase to reconcile contradictions, but in Ustad Khan’s case the multitudes assimilate artistic asceticism, the gift for annotating musical complexities, and a philosopher’s range of concerns. He performs at Saptak on January 4, Tuesday.Talking of philosophy, Ustad Khan told TOI: “Music is something for your soul. You cannot live without it.” Ustad Khan’s devotees will immediately realize that he is not dealing in abstraction. Socrates maintained that philosophers were doctors who prescribed treatment for souls which felt under the weather. But, as John Sellars says in “Lessons in Stoicism”, soul should not be thought to be “immaterial…supernatural.” Instead, Sellars writes, from the philosopher-doctor’s perspective we should “understand it simply as mind, thoughts and beliefs”. And Ustad Khan’s music repairs and fortifies all those three elements.For instance, when he rendered Jhinjhoti in the 2020 edition of Saptak, Ustad Khan not only presented the raga, but he also offered ruminations, banter, and commentary. Young rasikas were charmed and the aficionados felt the art’s stethoscope on their souls. Jhinjhoti can sound like dusk appraising the meaningfulness of all that it has been able to accomplish before its bedtime. But the raga can also radiate the thrill of sunrise that is looking forward to its long drive across mountains, oceans, deserts, and torrents of commuter traffic. Jhinjhoti’s effect perhaps depends on the condition of the listener’s soul. At any rate, Ustad Khan’s playing will offer a shot of immunity against urban life’s infection, the symptoms of which include consumerism, office rage, and pop-culture fog.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/musical-jab-immunity-against-urban-ennui/articleshow/88676375.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s total GST collection dips 2% in December||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s total collection of goods and services tax (GST) for December 2021 declined by 2%. The state’s GST mop-up was Rs 7,336 in December 2021, against Rs 7,469 crore, according to data from the Union finance ministry. Industry players attribute the decline in GST collection to reduced demand coupled with cuts in industrial production after Diwali. Indicating a decline in demand across sectors after the festive season surge, GST collection in Gujarat fell by 23% in December, when compared to November. In December, the state’s GST mop-up stood at Rs 7,336 crore, against the record-high level of Rs 9,569 crore in November 2021. Industry players say that demand came crashing owing due to high raw material prices and production being curtailed, because of which total tax collection declined. The state’s GST mop-up hit its record-high of Rs 9,569 crore in November. In November, GST collection in the state rose by 12% against that of October. Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said, “The prices of raw materials have been high over the past few months as a result of which industrial production has taken a hit. After Diwali, neither has production recovered nor demand. Consequently, overall tax collection has been affected in Gujarat in December.” State government sources said the tax mop-up was exceptionally high in November backed by pent-up demand. Tax collection dipped by a marginal 2% against Rs 7,469 crore in December 2020. Across India, Gujarat’s position plunged to the third highest in terms of tax collection, lagging Maharashtra (Rs 19,592 crore) and Karnataka (Rs 8,335 crore). Gujarat had the second highest tax collection in November.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarats-december-gst-collection-down-2/articleshow/88676377.cms||Niyati Parikh

The state’s exports stood at 1.04 lakh crore in 2019-20 and 1.24 lakh crore in 2020-21. Going by the current scenario, the state may exceed the previous numbers in 2021-22. Andhra Pradesh contributed to about 5.8% of the total exports of the country in 2020-21. The state occupies fifth place in the country in terms of the value of exported goods. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka take the first four places. East Godavari topped all the districts with about 31,000 crore worth exports in 2020-21, closely followed by Visakhapatnam (29,000 crore). West Godavari, Guntur and Chittoor also emerged as the key drivers by contributing to about 8,500 crore exports each. Kurnool accounted for only some 46 crore exports, the lowest among all the districts. From organic and inorganic chemicals and marine products in Visakhapatnam district, rice and marine products in East Godavari to cars in Anantapur, granite in Prakasam, tobacco in Guntur, and medicines in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh is exporting about 2,100 products to nearly 190 countries. The diverse product portfolio has helped the state pip several major states. For instance, omeprazole and lansoprazole drugs worth 111 crore were exported from Srikakulam in 2020-21. Anantapur exported cars/car engines worth more than 3,000 crore, while Kadapa was exporting barite. A substantial segment of insecticides and fungicides are also being exported from Srikakulam. The state is also exporting several handicraft products, textiles, ceramic products and glassware, leather products, spices, etc., to various countries. Andhra Pradesh was also a major exporter of fish and shrimp in India with a share of 42% in total value of seafood exports of the country during 2020-21. The Suvarnarekha mango variety was exported to South Korea and Germany for the first time last year. However, according to the Niti Aayog’s latest report on export preparedness, Andhra Pradesh leaves room for major improvements. Andhra Pradesh might have an enabling business infrastructure, but the state does not have a proper export ecosystem in place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/product-diversity-takes-ap-to-5th-spot-in-export-value/articleshow/88676379.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Based on the details of over 200 patients, the experts have concluded that the recent cases of Covid infection have certain different symptoms than earlier, mostly mild in nature.“In the absence of genome sequencing, we cannot describe them as symptoms of the Omicron variant, but whatever the new strain is, it is causing cold, cough and a sore throat sometimes accompanied by loose motion, fever and mild respiratory distress,” Jogesh Gambhir, president of APHI, Jharkhand, said. He added that in certain cases, vomiting and loss of appetite along with ear ache (middle ear infection) is being noticed.The panel of doctors has recommended use of paracetamol only underlining the fact that the present strain, unlike the ones in the second wave, is not affecting the lungs. “Case fatality is low in case of Omicron variant as per data available in Maharashtra and Delhi but the principles of Covid, namely isolation, testing and medical management with RT-PCR tests being the common standard of investigation must be followed,” Gambhir said.The APHI has appealed to families and individuals not to panic and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and reach for institutionalised medical help after consulting their doctors in case they experience distress symptoms. “Monoclonal antibody treatment is expensive but is suggested for elderly people with co-morbidities but only if necessary tests such as CRP, Feritin and D-Dimer indicate in that direction,” Gambhir said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/docs-panel-finds-milder-symptoms-in-new-strain-urges-people-not-to-panic/articleshow/88676384.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Around 19,000 teenagers received their first dose of Covaxin on Day 1. In Ranchi, vaccinations camps were held at DAV Helal, Zila School, Marwari School, Gauri Dutt Mandeliya School, Government Plus Two High School and ATI campus. Huge turnouts were seen at these camps where walk-in registration and vaccination were conducted after the beneficiaries enrolled themselves with the Co-Win app. The drive began at a time when the state is racing against time to achieve 100% vaccination coverage for the 18 plus age group by January 15 because of hesitancy among the beneficiaries. In stark contrast, the teenagers responded overwhelmingly on Day 1. Similar responses were reported from Jamshedpur, Bokaro and other districts. At the Zila School near Sahid Chowk, 150 beneficiaries were inoculated by 12.30pm. Rajiv Murmu, a Class X student who took his shot here, said, “I reached here at 9am with my friends to take the vaccine.

---||Ranchi||Over 300 gamhar trees worth 111 crore felled on IFP campus||Ranchi: At a time when environmentalists are raising their voice against felling of even a single mature tree, as many as 300 gamhar trees, each almost 16 years old, have been felled, exploiting the loopholes in existing laws.The felled trees were on the campus of the central government-run Institute of Forest Productivity (IFP) at Lalgutuwa which conducts research in forest productivity under the Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE). The gamhar (Gmelina arborea) is a fast-growing deciduous tree found throughout the country and known for its good timber value. The tree was planted on the campus of IFP in 2005-06 for studying the growth of the tree species on laterite soil.All the trees were cut down in December last year without any permission from the department of forest.The director of the institute, Dr Nitin Kulkarni, admitted that the trees have been cut. He, however, said, “We don’t require any permission because they were not part of any plantation. They were on our research plot and unless cleared where can we plant new varieties in case of requirement for other research projects?”According to a five-member panel set up by the Supreme Court in February last year, the true value of a tree is calculated by multiplying the remaining life expectancy of the tree with Rs 74,500. The panel recommended this value taking into account the benefits that it (a tree) would give to nature and mankind, including the cost of oxygen that it would emit into the atmosphere.Considering the trees survived for another 50 years and taking the average value suggested by the panel, the 300 trees hacked on the institute campus should be valued at Rs 1,11.75 crores.Principal chief conservator of forests P K Verma agreed that the felling of trees is a huge loss for the environment. “But whether it was illegal can be ascertained based on existing laws,” he said, clarifying that in Jharkhand, there is no rule for the protection of trees.DFO Ranchi Ashok Dubey said he had no information about the felling of trees. “A transit permit issued by the forest department is required only for transportation and unless they transport the tree trunks elsewhere, there is no violation of law,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/over-300-gamhar-trees-worth-111-crore-felled-on-ifp-campus/articleshow/88676387.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

While Tirkey was posted in Sahebganj, Kumar was posted in Chaibasa and he had not hurt the sentiments of the deceased in any manner, Kumar’s counsel argued. The court, after being satisfied with the arguments of the defence counsel, granted bail to Kumar.Soon after Tirkey’s death, her father Devanand Oraon had filed a writ petition before the high court seeking an independent probe into his daughter’s death.

Fighting all odds he had emerged as Gujarat topper in commerce stream in 2019 with 98.8 %, highest-ever marks achieved by a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) commerce student in Gujarat. Now, this Vadodara boy has again made his mark by securing 99.99 percentile in the Common Admission Test (CAT) 2021 – results of which were declared on Monday evening. “I dedicate this result to my late father Sudesh, who still serves as the constant and most intense source of my motivation,” said Parth, a student of Delhi Public School, Kalali, calling the CAT score as the first step towards stepping into his dream business school, IIM-Ahmedabad. Interestingly, like others, Parth too had first made the “safe choice of science” when it came to selecting a subject for class 11 after SSC. But just a fortnight before mid-term examinations in Class 11, he had decided to shift to commerce stream. This time again, his CAT score has come when he is pursuing a non-technical course. “I am currently studying BA (honours) economics from Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University. But I have never felt any disadvantage of coming from a non-engineering background,” said Parth, whose mother Rachna is a homemaker and contributes towards social welfare as well. “I have always felt that dreaming big is the first step. Working with well-equipped mentors since Class 11 helped me top many graduation entrance exams,” said Parth, adding that he never missed a single workshop and mock exam and constantly motivated himself for every mock test comparing CAT preparations to a marathon run.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/vadodara-boy-tops-in-gujarat/articleshow/88674913.cms||Prashant Rupera

Kejriwal was addressing AAP’s ‘Nav Nirman’ rally in the city's Parade Ground on Monday. Calling the Rs 1 crore assistance as “Samman Rashi”, he said, “Once AAP government comes to power in Uttarakhand, and if an Army, police or paramilitary personnel from the state is killed in the line of duty, then an ex-gratia amount of Rs1 crore will be given to their next of kin." He pointed out, “We have distributed cheques of Rs1 crore with our own hands to the families of those killed in line of duty in Delhi and we are going to do the same in Uttarakhand.” In another announcement for defence personnel, the Delhi CM promised to give jobs in government to Army jawans who retire after serving 17 years in the force. The AAP leader said, "The Army jawans do not get jobs after retiring at a relatively young age. We are going to give them reservation in government jobs, tap on their experience, and make them partners in the building of a new Uttarakhand.” Notably, ex-servicemen and their families constitute an important vote bank in the Himalayan state which can tilt the scales in favour of any party in the elections. Slamming both Congress and BJP, Kejriwal said both national parties “have destroyed” Uttarakhand in the last 21 years and people should give one chance to Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (Retd), who is AAP's CM candidate. He urged the public present at the rally to ring up their relatives in Delhi to take feedback on the work done by the AAP government there. “There are frequent power cuts in Uttarakhand, but everything is free in Delhi. Seeing us, now BJP and Congress are also talking about free electricity, but they can't do it,” Kejriwal said. Earlier, the AAP leader had promised an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 per month and Rs 1,000 per month allowance to women above the age of 18. The party also vowed to give free electricity up to 300 units, a free pilgrimage scheme for elderly and carve out six new districts in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/aap-promises-rs-1-cr-as-samman-rashi-to-kin-of-jawans-security-personnel-killed-in-line-of-duty/articleshow/88673488.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Lucknow||JP Nadda targets SP, calls it ‘KABZA wali’ party||LUCKNOW: BJP national president JP Nadda hit out at the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party calling it a “KABZA wali party”, in which `K' stood for Kushashan (bad governance), `A' stood for Atankwaad (terrorism), `B' meant Bhrashtachaar (corruption), `Z' signified `Zulm' (atrocity) and `A' meant Andhkaar (darkness). On Sunday, PM Narendra Modi had accused the previous government of allowing the mafia to grab people's properties. "Under the SP regime, all sorts of evil were given weightage," he said while addressing a gathering in Lucknow at the conclusion of `Jan Vishwas Yatra'. Nadda's swipe at SP came less than a week after Union home minister Amit Shah recast the alphabetical primer for ABCD saying A stood for 'Apradh', B for 'Bhrashtachar', C for 'Corruption' and D stood for 'Danga'. Nadda took a pointed swipe at Akhilesh, accusing him of initiating the process of taking back cases against 15 terrorists. "A CM tries to take back cases against terrorists. One can imagine the state of affairs in UP," he said. "When the court refused, four were given death penalty while the rest were sentenced for life imprisonment," the BJP chief said. "Rakshak hi bhakshak bana hua tha...," he said. Nadda pointed out that the previous SP regime floundered on giving utilization certificates for projects worth Rs 1 lakh crore. "Chhotey mote ghotale nahi karte they...ye bade ghotale karne wale log they," he said. The BJP chief also connected SP outfit to the haul of cash recovered from the perfume trader Piyush Jain. "Itr chahe jitna lagao khusbu nahi aa sakti...," he said. His stand also came two days after the IT department conducted raids on the premises of SP MLC Pushp Raj Jain, also a perfume businessman. He admonished SP for being an outfit afflicted with nepotism and casteism which can "never" think of people's welfare. Tossing up BJP's campaign tag line, "Farq Saaf Hai", Nadda said that while corruption, terrorism and discrimination was the hallmark of SP, the saffron party went by the principal of "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas". The BJP chief maintained that his party delivered the promises it made to the electorate before 2017 assembly elections and would again do so if voted to power after the ensuing assembly polls. The BJP president took on Congress and its poll catch line, “Ladki Hun Lad Sakti Hun” saying that the party, which ruled the country for 70 long years, never thought of the safety of women and their basic needs like toilets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/nadda-targets-sp-calls-it-kabza-wali-party/articleshow/88675514.cms||Pankaj Shah

Over 12 lakh people tried to put up their application through the website of the board, the first of its kind in the country. Once they register on the website of the board (www.kfwfb.kerala.gov.in) it has to be examined and approved by the agriculture department officials before sending it to the board for admission. According to the agriculture department officials, 30,000 applications are under process for registration. Muthalamthode Mani, general secretary of Deesheeya Karshaka Samajam, said, “In Palakkad district alone, more than one lakh farmers are eligible for registration. But only a few thousand could get it so far. Thus it has become a herculean task to get into the board. The farmers aged between 18 to 55 years are only eligible to apply to join the welfare board.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/getting-into-farmers-welfare-board-a-herculean-task/articleshow/88674202.cms||---

Breaking all previous records, home buyers pushed property sales to a new high in the calendar year 2021. Sales were led by demand from user customers for residential properties. During January-December 2021, revenue from sales of property in Indore was Rs 1,620 crore, up 42 per cent from the previous calendar year. Last year in 2020, revenue from property sales were Rs 1,140 crore, according to the official data.District Registrar, Balkrishna More said, “Despite pandemic, the property market has performed very well. Residential properties are leading the property market. This financial year also looks to end on a much higher note looking at the ongoing trend in the market.” Last year property registration was shut from April 20, 2021 to May 13, 2021 due to pandemic enforced rules. According to real estate players, a surge in demand for individual residential properties and an urge to own a house in a pandemic followed by reduction in home loan rates, boosted the property market. Developers said mostly driven by end users, enquiries for plots and residential properties have jumped in Bypass, Rau, Ujjain Road, Bicholi, Kanadia and Pithampur area. Sumit Mantri, joint secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (CREDAI), Indore said, “We have seen a new trend in the property market in pandemic. People are now wanting to shift from congested city areas to spacious properties. Demand from genuine home buyers is leading the growth in the property market.” CREDAI expects the property market to continue to grow in double digits in the coming year, bolstered by demand for residential properties. In the financial year 2020/21 that ended on March 31, a total of 1,07,000 properties were registered clocking revenues of Rs 1,325 crore, as per the official data.

Kalicharan was remanded in 14-day judicial custody on December 31.The arguments on Kalicharan’s bail plea lasted around 45 minutes during which defence lawyers challenged the charges brought about against him, claiming that IPC sections 153 A, 153 B (1) and 295 (A) do not apply in this case. They also argued that sedition is an offence against the state and not against an individual, but the case has been registered on the complaint of an individual. Questioning the manner of the arrest, they argued that Kalicharan was not produced in a court in Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh, where he was arrested, and said this is against the provisions of law. Public prosecutor K K Shukla opposed the bail application, arguing that it was not just a case of abusing an individual but an attempt to instigate trouble. Proper and timely action was taken to prevent any untoward incident, he said.After hearing both sides, the additional district and sessions court rejected Kalicharan’s bail plea.On the same day, another court in Raipur granted bail to a suspended food officer, Sanjay Dubey, who was arrested for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi on Facebook. The court of special railway magistrate Vijendra Sonwani granted bail to Dubey on two sureties of Rs 10,000 each and with a condition not to influence any witness. A police team from Pune is camping in Raipur and has moved an application in court for a production warrant to seek custody of Kalicharan in connection with cases registered against him in his home state, Maharashtra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/kalicharans-bail-plea-rejected-judge-says-sedition-a-serious-charge/articleshow/88676408.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bawankule to move SC for deferring civic polls||Nagpur: MLC Chandrashekhar Bawankule will be moving the Supreme Court to delay the civic body polls by at least three months. He would be praying for directives to the State Election Commission (SEC) to immediately withdraw its letter to all municipal corporations and councils to finalise multi-member wards for the forthcoming elections without reserving OBC seats. Speaking to the media on Monday, Bawankule said since the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had sought three months from the apex court to submit empirical data of OBCs, he would request the judges there to defer the civic polls till then. “The Maharashtra government did nothing till date to continue the OBC reservation. It only played football with the issue while passing the buck on NDA government at the Centre. The MVA was in slumber right from the first order on OBC reservations delivered by the top court on December 13, 2019, and second on March 4, 2021. It just wasted time in blaming the Centre for not providing the empirical data, despite the fact that it was not suitable for submission in SC.” Accusing the MVA constituents – Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena — of misleading the people on the issue, the former energy minister said they delayed OBC reservations for over one and half years. “Even chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar are not serious about granting reservation to the community. They want to provide seats reserved for OBC candidates to the rich and influential persons. I do not trust the MVA government on its assurance to submit empirical data on OBCs within three months in the SC. The former Kamptee MLA accused state food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal of indulging in ‘nautanki’ on the issue by allegedly instigating the Samata Parishad to protest the BJP government at the Centre. He also demanded property tax waiver for all small homes across Maharashtra like the Sena-led government had declared for Mumbai ahead of the civic polls there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bawankule-to-move-sc-for-deferring-civic-polls/articleshow/88672643.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

T Sandhya, a teenager who received the vaccine in Jalaripeta in Visakhapatnam on Monday, said that extending the inoculation drive to school/college-going people has instilled more confidence in them. “Other than minor localised pain, I did not experience any other after-effects,” said Sandhya.  A Divyansh, an intermediate student, said that his parents were finally relieved after he got the first dose. “Otherwise, they are somewhat hesitant to send me to offline classes,” he said. Vizianagaram district collector A Surya Kumari said the special vaccination drive would cover the students in 3,300 schools, 195 colleges and 35 industrial training institutions in the district spread in the limits of 88 primary health care centres. “About 20,000 people in the 15-18 age group have been vaccinated in the district by 6 pm,” said Surya Kumari.

Yogesh even moved a contempt petition as the state government failed to implement the Act even after giving an affidavit to the high court. Yogesh argued that the state government was dragging the issue just to buy time. He said that the state government told the high court that they will implement the Act in four weeks in the earlier affidavit. Now, they are saying that they will implement it from next academic year. About one lakh students are being deprived of their right to quality education since 2012 because of the inaction of the state government, he said. The government pleader for education, KV Raghuveer, told the high court that the state government is taking all measures to implement 25 per cent reservation to poor students from next academic year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-orders-25-quota-in-private-schools-from-next-academic-yr/articleshow/88676431.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Meanwhile, according to Met reports, Fatehpur remained coldest in the state with a minimum temperature of 2.9 °C. Attributing the rising temperatures and cloudy conditions in some parts of the state to the active upper air cyclonic circulation and western disturbances, Jaipur Met office stated that cloudy conditions will prevail in the state for next couple of days. Many places are likely to get hail storms from January 5-7. People in Jaipur too woke up to a comparatively warmer morning with a minimum temperature of 8.5 °C, almost 1 degree above the normal notch. It was much awaited relief from the shivering cold conditions as since December the minimum temperature in Jaipur has been fluctuating between 4 °C to 7 °C. “In the coming days, temperatures will further rise and there will be no shivering cold conditions,” said a Jaipur Met official. Since no fog and mist was seen during early morning hours, traffic on the highways connecting Jaipur to other cities and states have also been smooth. In its specific forecast on hailstorm and rainfall, the office stated that Bikaner, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Churu, Jhunjhunu, Sikar, Jaipur and Ajmer are likely to get hail storms on January 7. “As western disturbances are active in the state and will continue till January 7, it will bring showers and hailstorms in the next couple of days,” said a met official. The department further stated that a rise in shivering cold conditions is unlikely during this week. “From Saturday onwards it would be mainly clear skies when a mild dip in the mercury is expected,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/brace-for-hailstorms-rain-in-next-2-days-says-met/articleshow/88676430.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Minister faces flak from party MLAs over Urdu teachers||JAIPUR: Congress MLAs Ameen Kagzi and Wajib Ali have opened a front against education minister BD Kalla for sanctioning just 309 posts for Urdu teachers against the vacancy of over 2,000 seats. Both have written to chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleging the education department has deputed Sanskrit teachers in schools where the majority of students were Urdu speakers. The issue surfaced following the announcement of hiring 32,000 teachers for level I and II by Gehlot on December 31. The sanctoning of 309 teachers has sparked anger among the minority community who sees that it will further decline the number of Urdu students. Ali, who played a key role in striking a deal between para-teachers and the government, alleged betrayal of the community by Kalla by disregarding the promise made by Gehlot. “Gehlot Sahab had in budget 2021-22 announced the recruitment of 1,000 Urdu teachers. He also promised of providing Urdu teachers even if 10 students enrolled under the language,” said Ali. Kagzi went a step ahead by writing a detailed letter to the CM listing names of seven schools that had Urdu subjects once but not now. “The closure of Urdu subject from schools has angered the citizens of my constituency. I would urge you to follow the budget announcement made by Gehlot,” said Kagzi. Reacting to the letters, Kalla said, “Posts have been sanctioned as per the rules. Our government will not do any injustice. Concerns of everyone will be addressed properly.” Ameen Kaimkhany, president of the state Urdu Teachers Association, said at least 10 schools in Jaipur has Urdu students in requisite numbers up to 95%, but the government posted either Sanskrit teachers or left the post vacant. “A government school in Jalupura has 90% students who have chosen Urdu as their third language. But the government posted a Sanskrit teacher. This injustice cannot be tolerated and if Urdu teachers are not posted, we will hold an indefinite protest,” said Kaimkhany.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/min-faces-flak-from-party-mlas-over-urdu-teachers/articleshow/88676433.cms||---

Police have initiated an investigation into the matter and conducted a medical examination of the boy. Police said the boy had gone to school on December 29 when he was allegedly thrashed by his teacher, Ravindra Jangid (32). “The student’s mother said her son kept mum till he realised that his earache was not subsiding and he had difficulty in hearing things," said Vijay Kumar, the investigating police officer in the case. “Family lodged an FIR on Sunday evening. At Chirawa town, we don’t have ENT specialists, thus his medical examination could not be conducted on that evening. On Monday, we took the boy to the government hospital in Jhunjhunu and got it done,” Kumar said. “Whether the boy’s eardrums are damaged or not will be only ascertained after we get the medical report on Tuesday.

Recent decision of the state government to issue lease deeds for encroachments on these lands has also earned flak of the fraternity terming it not only a violation of the Supreme Court’s directions but also an injustice to the animals who are dependent on these pasture lands for food. According to the state incharge of the People for Animals Babulal Jaju, 4.86 lakh hectares of the pasture land in Rajasthan is under encroachment, which is about 25% of the total recorded pasture land. "Many people have built their houses and barns on these lands, while many have begun mining on these lands, which has forced the cattle to stray on the roads in absence of natural grazing land parcels," he said. As per the rules, if the government issues lease deeds for the encroachments on the oran and gochar land parcels in villages, it is bound by law to allocate same sized land parcel at other place to compensate the loss of the land by encroachment.But, unfortunately both the government and the administrative officials continue to turn a blind eye to the rampant encroachments on pasture land in entire state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/activists-urge-govt-to-prevent-encroachment-of-pasture-land/articleshow/88676439.cms||---

He alleged that raids were also being used as a tool to terrorise businessmen to donate funds to the party.The chief minister was speaking at the ‘Meet the Press’ programme at the Pink City Press Club on Monday.Gehlot said the income tax department had raided the house of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sister’s house. He said according to his information, she lives in a two-bedroom apartment. Gehlot said his family members were also targeted during the political crisis last year. The Enforcement Directorate had searched his elder brother Agrasen Gehlot’s residence in an alleged fertilizer scam. It was alleged that he had exported subsidised fertiliser for domestic use during UPA rule.The chief minister said it was not an NDA or BJP government at the Centre but the rule of just two people. He said under the present political dispensation at the Centre, people are even afraid to talk over phone fearing tapping.The chief minister said the opposition was being systematically weakened. He said under the electoral bond, 95% of the donation is being cornered by the ruling party. He demanded that the Supreme Court should give its verdict at the earliest on the electoral bond and Pegasus snooping charges. The chief minister has repeated the charge that the Centre had been weakening the financial condition of states. “It has not only reduced the basic excise duty on petroleum products which is being shared with the states but raised the additional and special excise duty to fill its coffers. Similarly, the Centre has reduced its share in the centrally sponsored schemes equal to the states’ share unlike earlier where the Centre used to bear major part of the cost of the scheme. Besides, the GST share of the states have not been fully paid on time,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gehlot-labels-modi-led-nda-govt-as-a-chhapewali-sarkar/articleshow/88676454.cms||---

These students had written special BCom second semester examinations in December, but the university has not declared their results yet. This would have prevented them from attending the counselling process as they do not have the course completion certificate. Ramya S, executive director, KEA, told TOI that they will accommodate those students who are yet to get their results. MU had scheduled special examinations for students who had missed out the second semester exams due to Covid-related and transportation issues from December 5-23. Shradhan Shetty, studying at Poorna Prajna College, Udupi, has completed his final semester and got a good ranking in PG CET. Though he expects a government seat for the PG-CET ranking he got, he is in a quandary. He was apprehensive whether he can attend the counselling or not due to his second semester results not being declared and not being able to present course completion during counselling. Like him, many were sailing the same boat and KEA has provided them relief. Shradhan had written to higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan regarding his dilemma with a request to resolve the issue which many students are facing. PL Dharma, registrar (evaluation), Mangalore University, pointed out it was special examinations conducted only for a few students, on their request, who had missed August exams due to Covid and transportation issues. “The exams were over on December 23. Evaluators were on leave till December end and they came for work on Saturday. Now we have to assign evaluation work and it will take two weeks for results to be announced,” he said, adding that all universities are facing a similar issue. “The PG-CET authorities have to take a call on postponing counselling to help students,” he added. When contacted KEA executive director Ramya S said the onus is on MU to declare the results expeditiously. “They can have a tight schedule of evaluation. They can put in more people, have extended hours and can declare results within a week’s time,” she said. In the interim, some students have taken admissions into MBA courses with a management caveat that the seats would be retained provided they clear the examinations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/students-awaiting-mu-results-get-kea-relief/articleshow/88676456.cms||Stanley Pinto

He assured that an underground cable system will be introduced in Subrahmanya temple town to supply power. “Mescom officials should prepare an action plan in this regard soon. The energy department is ready to implement this in this temple town where a large number of devotees arrive from various parts of the nation,” he added. The energy department has successfully fulfilled various demands of people in Sullia and Subrahmanya, he said. “Currently, we have no such hindrances that the department was facing about 10 years ago. We have been witnessing a sea of changes with various development activities being taken up through the department for the convenience of people. Out of five power supply companies in the state, Mescom has been taking up various innovative measures. Unlike other companies, Mescom does not show a loss in its turnover. The company is not incurring loss because of better coordination of people in this region,” Kumar said. On various impediments to development activities in the Western Ghats region, the minister said the government has decided to solve them through coordination between various departments. “Soon after assuming charge as energy minister, I started taking up various measures to improve the services of power supply companies with special emphasis for farmers, domestic consumers and industries. We have been facing several issues while developing areas abutting the Western Ghats including Sullia, Subrahmanya and Karkala. We must get a nod from the forest department before initiating each work,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mescom-to-get-1100cr-for-quality-improvement/articleshow/88676459.cms||---
---||Surat||Indonesia bans coal export, South Gujarat industries feel the heat||Surat: With Indonesia banning export of coal in January, industries using coal are feeling the heat. Indonesia, world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, has suspended exports of the fossil fuel due to concerns over dwindling supplies for its domestic power plants. The export ban has already led to coal prices — both domestic and imported categories — going up by Rs 1,000-3,300 per tonne in the local markets, depending upon the calorific values of the coal, said industry players on Monday. According to trade estimates, around 40,000 tonnes of coal is supplied every day to various industries across south Gujarat from local ports. However, industries using coal claimed that they have stock of the fuel for a couple of weeks and they will not be affected by the price hike if the issue is resolved within a week. Coal distributors further claimed that the supplies will be hampered as Indonesian coal is widely used in the region as fuel. “The supplies will be impacted and those who stocks piled up will be at benefit. The importers whose coal is in transport will also benefit from the price hike," said Navin Suratwala, president of South Gujarat Coal Supplier Association (SGCSA). “The prices shot up to Rs 1,000 on the day Indonesia imposed the ban. Around 40,000 tonnes of coal is supplied to industries in south Gujarat from local ports on a daily basis,” said Suratwala. Coal is used as the main fuel in industries like textile processing, cement, steel, paper and chemical in south Gujarat. “At present we have sufficient stock of coal. But the heat will be felt if the supply is not restored within 15 days. Hopefully, a meeting between coal miners and the Indonesian government to be held on Wednesday will lead to some positive outcome,” said a processor. Apart from Indonesian coal, industries use Australian and Indian coal too. Due to the good quality of Indonesian coal, it is in high demand among industries in the region. “The Indonesian coal prices have shot up by Rs 3,300 per tonne. Depending upon the quality, the prices have suddenly increased in the past two days due to the ban,” said Jitendra Vakhariya, president of South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/indonesia-bans-coal-export-south-gujarat-industries-feel-the-heat/articleshow/88676460.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Earlier also GFP has alleged corruption in the ongoing government recruitment. In the audio clips, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar is allegedly heard telling some job aspirants that he had to give some jobs in the departments headed by him to candidates recommended by other BJP MLAs and ministers. “I have to give jobs in my department to other ministers just as they keep some jobs in their departments for me,” the voice is heard saying. GFP said that the recording was taken on December 9 when Kavlekar met some candidates who had approached him for jobs. The list of candidates for the PWD technical assistant jobs was declared on December 10. GFP said the recruitment process should be cancelled and has threatened to send the clips along with transcripts to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The chief minister, his ministers and the BJP MLAs have sold jobs to their favourites and to those who they want. This is a big scam,” GFP functionary Vikas Bhagat alleged. GFP has alleged that candidates with poor academic records surprisingly topped the written exams conducted by various departments. The PWD department has selected technical assistants who include relatives of senior state BJP functionaries and private staff members from the chief minister’s office, Bhagat alleged. “We are compiling a list of all these candidates, their relations and we are going to expose them. We are going to send these recordings and translation to the Prime Minister and we are going to ask him if this is good governance,” Bhagat said. GFP alleged that PWD minister Deepak Pauskar and chief minister Pramod Sawant have directly taken money from candidates for government jobs. Bhagat said that the chief minister and PWD minister should resign at the immense corruption that is going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gfp-releases-audio-clips-alleges-scam-in-govt-recruitment/articleshow/88674991.cms||TNN

As many as 16 villages of Thullur mandal and three villages of Mangalagiri mandal will be part of the new municipal corporation. The government had already created a separate municipal corporation by merging Mangalagiri and Tadepalli municipalities. Following the instructions from the government, Guntur district collector Vivek Yadav on Monday issued a draft notification by constituting the Amaravati capital city municipal corporation. The collector directed tehsildars to conduct grama sabhas to elicit the views of the locals. The decision to constitute capital city municipal corporation came in the wake of the high court pulling up the government for not conducting panchayat elections in Amaravati region. The state government had constituted Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA) by replacing the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) after clearing the three capital bills by assembly last year. Subsequently, the government repealed the new Acts including repeal of CRDA Act and three capital cities Act in the recently concluded assembly session. The government also promised the high court that it was initiating a slew of developmental works proposed in the CRDA Act. It had already granted funds for construction of additional buildings for the high court. Chief Justice of High Court, justice PS Mishra had recently laid foundation stone for the new high court buildings in Nelapadu. The state government has proposed to take up the pending works in the capital city area with Rs 3,000 crore. BJP state president Somu Veerraju said that they would develop Amaravati with about Rs 10,000 crore if the party comes into power in the state. “Chandrababu Naidu had failed to keep his promises to develop Amaravati. Jagan wants to move out of Amaravati. Only BJP can protect and develop Amaravati,” said Veerraju.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/state-to-establish-capital-city-municipal-corp-in-amaravati/articleshow/88673534.cms||Samdani MN

The fire was spotted at AS Traders at around 11am. Though residents spotted the fire and tried to douse it, they failed as the fire gathered strength. Around 25 fire force units from Thiruvananthapuram rushed to the spot. It took around five hours to extinguish the fire completely. The disaster would have gone out of hand if fire force officers had not been able to keep it under check. The fire occurred in a densely housed area filled with shops and houses. However, no casualties were reported as all residents from nearby houses were evacuated . The residents said that the fire occurred due to short circuit in the electric line. The AS Traders is owned by Sulfithkhar and his son Ishan Ahammed of Kallattumukku. The godown had materials, including iron, oil cans and other plastics, which caught fire and emanated thick black smoke. Mild blasts also occurred in the shop, posing further threat. “We have noticed sparks in the electric post from the past two days and I informed the KSEB. It was repaired on Monday morning just five minutes before the fire occurred,” said Haneefa S, one of the workshop owners. The shop is situated on a narrow road and the fire soon spread to the other side of the road, which includes workshops. There were three houses and a scrap shop near the godown. Among these, two houses were slightly affected by the fire. The door of one of the houses caught fire. “The accident has destroyed two coconut trees in my compound and also the air conditioner in the second floor is also damaged,” said Kumar D, one of the residents. The area was completely covered with black smoke. Medical workers were assigned at the spot to ensure the safety of people, especially to handle the breathing issues with smoke. Ambulance service was also available. Other than fire force officers, police, civil defence volunteers, doctors and staff nurses from the general hospital, and KSEB officials were present. “It was difficult to extinguish the fire as making way was difficult. Later, we sprayed water from the top of the houses,” said Shaji G S, a fire force personnel from Chenkalchoola unit. “When we arrived here, the fire was spreading fast. The plastic bottles and other things exploded and shreds were coming towards us and it was difficult,” said Mohanan J, a fire force staff. The shop owner said that they have suffered a huge loss. “It has caused a loss of around Rs 8 lakh for us. We had materials, including iron and plastics. We have not taken electricity connection to the godown to avoid dangers like this. Unfortunately, this happened,” said Ahammed.  KSEB officials said that spark from the electric line did not result in fire. “When I contacted the electrical inspector, it was understood that no spark occurred in this electric line. So, the occurrence of this accident must because of some other reason. The works to restore electricity will start soon,” said an official from KSEB. “It would have been a big tragedy if we were not able to stop the fire. Another danger is the houses around the godown. People living in those houses were also evacuated at the right time. There was a lot of smoke due to the presence of tar and other compressors. We overcame the situation by placing the fire extinguishing vehicles in different parts of the area,” said Dileepan P, regional fire force officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/residents-evacuated-after-fire-breaks-out-at-scrap-godown-at-karamana/articleshow/88673541.cms||---

---||India||All cars will soon need to have 6 airbags||NEW DELHI: After implementation of mandatory fitment of two airbags for driver and passengers on the front seats across all models of cars, including in the cheapest ones, the transport ministry will now expedite the mandatory installation of four more airbags for the rear seat passengers. Sources said the market leaders have indicated that the cost of the four airbags and the necessary changes in vehicles would cost around Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000. They said this additional cost will go a long way in protecting passengers in the cars. The government had made the fitment of two airbags across all new models of cars from last year and this mandatory norm for all existing models came into force from January 1. Sources said the cost of each airbag would be around Rs 1,800 and the cost towards the necessary modification in vehicles would be around Rs 400 or Rs 500. The cost would be reduced for cars sold in large numbers. Last year, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had urged the car manufacturers to provide six airbags for all cars irrespective of their costs to improve occupant safety. The airbag manufacturers were asked to come up with the suggestive cost. According to the road accident data published by the National Crime Record Bureau, 17,538 car occupants died in road crashes, which accounts to around 13% of the total road fatalities in the country. While the ministry’s thrust to improve occupant safety in cars is seen as a progressive move what remains a concern is the poor compliance of seatbelt wearing by occupants on the rear seats despite it’s being mandatory as per law. This is because the efficiency of the airbags is more only when the passengers are wearing seatbelts. Globally, there is focus to improve vehicle safety by upgrading the safety features.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-cars-will-soon-need-to-have-6-airbags/articleshow/88676496.cms||Dipak K Dash

The emergence of the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus has prompted the district administration to re-open Covid Care Centres (CCCs) set up to treat patients who displayed mild symptoms of the infection. The district administration has also doubled its efforts to inoculate all those eligible to receive the vaccine in the rural pockets.Data sourced from the district administration shows that a total of 2,816 beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients across 76 government and private hospitals, of which 320 beds have ventilator support, while 1,103 are equipped with facilities to supply oxygen to the patients and 267 are in the intensive care unit (ICU).Until a few weeks ago, the number of fresh cases in Belagavi was in single digit, but it has now risen to two digits, with the active caseload standing at 112 as on Monday, as against 89 at the end of 2021. Beds have also been reserved for children, in the wake of experts predicting their vulnerability to the infection in the third iteration of the pandemic. In addition to 207 beds in the paediatric section of the ICU, 297 beds in the neo-natal ICU, 44 beds with ventilator support and 39 equipped with non-invasive ventilator facility.Meanwhile, 99% of the population in Belagavi aged above 18 – 33.3 lakh – has received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 82.8% - 29.5 lakh – have been fully vaccinated. The authorities have started the drive to inoculate teenagers aged between 15 and 18, with nearly 2.5 lakh teenagers in this group having been identified across Belagavi.Belagavi district health officer (DHO) Dr Shashikanth Muniyal said, “We have set up camps in 298 schools and colleges to vaccinate the teenagers. We are working in tandem with personnel in the education department to ensure this phase of the vaccination drive is a success.”During the second iteration of the pandemic, the district grappled with a massive shortage of oxygen, which aggravated the crisis. Belagavi deputy commissioner MG Hiremath said that, as a precautionary step, the government refilling/ manufacturing plants have stored more than 26 kilo litres of oxygen, while the private establishments have 42.4 kilo litres. Moreover, there are six laboratories across Belagavi to test swab samples, including one that is equipped to conduct genome sequencing tests.Police have stepped up vigilance at the border to ensure that people do not enter without furnishing the results of the RT-PCR test. On Monday, cops were forced to ask drivers to turn back when passengers could not furnish the report of the RT-PCR test.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-revives-covid-healthcare-infrastructure/articleshow/88676497.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Mayoral poll on January 8, likely to be direct fight between BJP & AAP||CHANDIGARH: The stage is set for the mayoral election to be held on January 8, but it is unlikely to be a three-way fight like in the civic body elections. The Congress might not file nomination papers for the three posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, leaving AAP and BJP as the two main contenders in the field and in fact, doing quite a lot in its absence. On Monday morning, the Congress took all its newly-elected seven municipal councillors to Rajasthan with their families. The Congress city chief, Subhash Chawla too went along with his family. “We are far away from the city. It seems it may not be possible for us to reach on Tuesday itself to file the nomination papers. But the strategy in this regard is being planned. We are unable to say anything about our exact plan in the mayoral poll, but filing nomination papers seems very difficult for us at this stage,” a senior Congress leader said. The date of filing the nomination papers is January 4 (Tuesday) for all three posts. A senior Congress leader said, “We all have pooled in money and gone to Rajasthan on a religious pilgrimage. Since the intense exercise of horse trading, making contacts and luring our councillors had started, we were left with no option but to leave the city for a few days. As Devinder Singh Babla and his newly-elected councillor wife Harpreet Kaur Babla who won on Congress ticket have joined BJP, we will not leave any chance to keep BJP, especially Harpreet, away from the mayor seat at any cost.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mayoral-poll-on-jan-8-likely-to-be-direct-fight-between-bjp-aap/articleshow/88676500.cms||Deepak Yadav

A complaint was lodged with Thorala police station on Monday after the woman was rescued by a team of Abhayam.

---||Chandigarh||Senior leaders’ exodus leaves Cong drained||Chandigarh: With senior leaders of the Chandigarh Congress on their way out, the party is weakening consistently. This showed in the MC elections, in which the Congress fared poorly, getting merely eight seats out of 35, which further reduced to seven after Harpreet Kaur Babla of the Congress shifted to BJP on Sunday. With parliamentary elections due in just two years, Congress leaders accept that they will have to overhaul the party completely.Several key leaders quit the party a few months before the Municipal Corporation elections, after which the Congress stood a poor third. Internal tussles of the party are also very much in the public eye, which has not helped. The result is that the Congress is struggling to keep its remaining seven councillors together for the upcoming mayoral election.Since the party’s senior leader and former Congress president Pardeep Chhabra, along with his associate Sandeep Bhardwaj, general secretary quit the Congress a few months before the MC election, Sheela Phool Singh, a three-time councillor who served in the MC from the Congress side for 15 years, shifted to the BJP. Besides, senior leaders Yadwinder Mehta and Prem Lata also left the party and joined AAP.Devinder Singh Babla’s exit has also dealt a major blow as he was one of the oldest leaders of the party. Babla and his wife won MC elections multiple times on the Congress ticket.A senior party leader said, “It is a fact that the party has been weakening over the past few months as many senior leaders, who were serving the party in the capacity of mayor, party president and other senior positions, quit the party. Therefore, there is a dire need to look into all aspects to strengthen the party before the parliamentary elections in 2024. Soon after the mayoral elections, all senior leaders will sit together and plan their strategy.”Congress former president and mayor Pardeep Chhabra gave a major jolt to Congress and played a vital role in the establishment of AAP in the city. Chhabra brought prominent Congress leaders into the AAP fold. These leaders brought in hundreds of their supporters as AAP contested MC elections for the first time in the city. Chhabra not only dented the Congress, but also played a crucial role to make AAP the single largest party in the civic body elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/senior-leaders-exodus-leaves-cong-drained/articleshow/88676505.cms||Deepak Yadav

In a protest held at Ronhat on Saturday, members of Haati community had threatened to boycott the coming elections and to impose “janta curfew” in Giripaar area to ban the entry of politicians in case their demand is not met at the earliest.Sirmaur Haati Vikas Manch chief advisor, Ramesh Singta said Haati community will intensify its agitation in coming days as such meetings are going on for last 55 years. He said instead of assurances now, the community wants results on ground. He said if government will fail to provide the Haatis their due right then they will not vote in the coming assembly election. He said government should not play with the sentiments of threelakh people as roads will get smaller if three lakh people will take to the roads for their rights and government will not be able to handle the influx of people.The delegation led by BJP MP discussed with the RGI the technicalities involved and ethnographic survey conducted to provide Scheduled Tribe benefits to Haati community. Central Haati Committee members who attended the meeting include its president Amichand Kamal, general secretary Kundan Singh and treasurer Atar Singh Negi.Kashyap said delegation clarified with RGI about all the objections raised in the earlier report, whose solution has been done in the ethnographic report sent by the Himachal Pradesh government on September 18 last year to the Union ministry of tribal affairs and the Prime Minister’s Office.He said RGI has assured that he would discuss the ethnographic report of the Haati community with technical experts and thereafter the report would be sent to the Union ministry of tribal affairs. Haati community are demanding scheduled tribe status for themselves since 1967. Trans-Giri and Jaunsar Bawar area both had remained the part of erstwhile Sirmaur princely state and both areas have unique similarity in all aspects. While the Jaunsar Bawar area of Uttrakhand has already got the scheduled tribe status in 1967 itself, the Trans-Giri is still struggling.Haati community has already held meeting in 144 panchayats of Giripaar area on December 25 and resolution passed has been forwarded to PM Narendra Modi through the governor of Himachal. In 1979, National Commission for Scheduled Tribe headed by its then chairperson Bhola Paswan Shastri had recommended the scheduled tribe status to Trans-Giri area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/bjp-mp-discusses-himachals-haati-community-with-rgi/articleshow/88676506.cms||---

---||Jammu||Pak intruder shot dead; arms, ammo, heroin recovered in Jammu||Jammu: BSF troops early Monday killed a Pakistani intruder trying to breach the international border in Jammu’s Arnia sector, a day after the Army foiled an attempt by the Pakistani military’s Border Action Team (BAT) to push a terrorist into India and gunned him down in the Keran sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district.Later in the day, BSF personnel foiled a narco-terrorism bid by recovering a huge cache of arms and ammunition — three AK rifles along with five magazines, four pistols with seven magazines, 14 rounds of AK-47, seven 9mm ball rounds — as well five packets of heroin from Chamliyal border outpost area in Jammu’s Ramgarh sector, said a BSF spokesperson.Early Monday, BSF troops manning the international border noticed suspicious movement near the fence from the Pakistan side of the border near Bhule Chak post, BSF sources said.“Despite several warnings, the suspect continued to venture close to the fence and tried to sneak into the Indian territory. He was subsequently shot dead,” said a source, adding: “The intruder’s body is still lying close to the border.”Later in the day, BSF troops patrolling in the Chamliyal border outpost area found a white gunny bag hidden in wild grass, in which the arms and ammunition, and heroin packets were found. The bag had the markings of a Pakistan-based fertiliser company, said the spokesperson.On New Year’s Day, an Army stake-out along the LoC spotted the terrorist in a Pathani suit and black jacket. Armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, he was trying to break into India through the anti-infiltration obstacle system across the border. Ambushes were laid along routes the intruder was likely to take and he eventually fell into one. The route he took was similar to the one taken by infiltrators “on April 4, 2020, during Operation Rangadori Bhaikh in which five terrorists were eliminated,” the Army said in a statement on Sunday.The Army could make out that it was a BAT operation as a “search of the belongings — an AK-47, seven grenades, ammunition, ration suited for a long haul in cold weather, certificates and a photo that showed him in army uniform with the name tab — revealed a Pakistani identity card and vaccination certificates (issued by ministry of national health services regulation and coordination of Pakistan) that identified him as Mohammed Shabir Malik. The belongings also include a photo of the infiltrator in army uniform wearing the name tab of Shabbir.” This “establishes that Pakistan continues to sponsor cross-border militancy”, the Army said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/pak-intruder-shot-dead-arms-ammo-heroin-recovered-in-jammu/articleshow/88676512.cms||---

Meanwhile, Trichy district saw a brisk response from the targeted population. Out of the total eligible population of 1.26 lakh students, 14,555 were given the jabs on Monday. Health officials said that the hesitation was low among students, yet they added that the situation must be watched closely further.Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar inaugurated the vaccination drive at Elango Corporation School. “A total of 1.41 lakh children in the age group of 15-18 years have been identified in Madurai district to be vaccinated by January 8.

Photographs of Muslim women were uploaded on the app for an auction and shared with the term Bulli deal of the day. “The commission had also highlighted a similar matter, which had come to light in 2021, wherein pictures of many Muslim women and girls were uploaded on the same GitHub app under the name Sulli Deals. While Delhi Police had registered an FIR in July last year after DCW’s intervention, it is yet to make any arrest,” said a DCW statement. The commission said not arresting culprits in this serious matter was “appalling” and “this callous attitude... has emboldened the culprits and others who are continuing to ‘sell’ women and girls online”. The commission has sought a list of arrests in both the crimes. “The commission has sought details of action taken against GitHub by Delhi Police along with steps taken in preventing (such) platforms from uploading such derogatory and illegal content in the future. Delhi Police has also been asked to inform whether any guideline with respect to such incidents have been formed.” DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said, “These incidents are happening due to the callous behaviour of Delhi Police in matters related to cybercrime.” Meanwhile, All India Student Association at JNU protested against Delhi Police’s inaction.

---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP protest stops buses, stalls traffic||NEW DELHI: The first working day of the new year became a nightmare for commuters as they had to face massive traffic jams in different parts of the city with the BJP staging a city-wide protest against the AAP government's new excise policy. The protesters deflated the front tyres of DTC buses which led to major arteries getting choked. Delhi BJP blamed “mischievous elements” for the vandalism and disruption. Massive traffic jams were seen at several spots, including ITO, Laxmi Nagar, Akshardham, Signature Bridge, Karol Bagh, Uttam Nagar and Aali Gaon. DTC drivers said they requested the protesters not to deflate the tyres as it would take a long time to get the buses moving but they paid no heed. According to a report prepared by DTC, in almost all instances, the two front tyres were punctured or the air let out. The areas where the buses were targeted included Madhuban Chowk, Peeragarhi, East Patel Nagar, Rajender Nagar, Rajender Place, Dwarka Mor and Kashmere Gate. “A total of 86 buses, including 39 DTC buses and 47 Cluster Scheme buses were damaged across the city during the 'Chakka Jam' on Monday. Not only were the tyres of these buses deflated, but the windowpanes of many buses were broken too,” alleged Delhi’s transport minister, Kailash Gahlot. This happened at a time when commuters are already facing a harrowing time due to restrictions on the seating capacity of buses due to Covid safety protocols. Under Level 1 (Yellow) of the Graded Response Action Plan, only 50% seating is allowed in public transport buses and no standing passengers are allowed to ensure social distancing. “This is absolutely irresponsible behaviour and seems to have been done to inconvenience people. Now fitness tests of all these buses will have to be carried out and the extent of damage reviewed. Only after these buses clear the tests can they be put back in service since public safety is involved,” Gahlot told TOI. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra claimed in a statement that several RWAs and traders associations had joined the stir. “Taking advantage of it, some mischievous elements joined and indulged in vandalism,” he said. “BJP's purpose was pious since it was to highlight the adverse repercussions of the new liquor policy. Yet, if some people have faced problems due to the ‘Chakka Jam’, we regret it,” he said. Around 2.30 pm on Monday, Rajender Sharma, along with other fellow bus drivers, was standing near their buses at Laxmi Nagar. More than half-a-dozen buses with deflated tyres were standing in both carriageways of the main road due to which there were traffic snarls in the area. Sharma and bus conductor Amit requested the protesters not to deflate the tyres but to no avail. Many passengers who were new to the city were clueless about how to reach their destinations. “Seventeen passengers were sitting in the bus. Most of them were new to the city and we were going towards the Anand Vihar ISBT when we got stuck in the protest," said Sharma. “We suspect that they had it all planned. They were carrying equipment that could easily flatten the tyres,” another driver, Dharmender Singh, said. Commuters expressed their disapproval. "What have they gained from doing this? We are the sufferers," said Amit, who was waiting for a bus in the Laxmi Nagar area. Another commuter, Ajay, pointed out that after the cap of 50%, it's not easy to enter a bus as the seats get filled quickly. "In the present scenario, if buses are getting damaged, then the poor people, who are dependent on the bus, are going to suffer,” he said. Rekha, another commuter, agreed. She said they were mostly dependent on buses for commuting as they can't afford autorickshaws. "Such incidents will only add to our problems," she said. DP Ratan, who was waiting for a bus with his friend, said “these kind of protests only cause harassment to the common people". According to Delhi Police, 10 people, including Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, were detained and released after an hour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bjp-protest-stops-buses-stalls-traffic/articleshow/88675032.cms||---

Because of non-availability of irrigation water they are forced to take only one crop in a year, claimed the farmers.The farmers held the protest under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Sangh. The Narmada water is provided for drinking purposes in Kutch’s Bhachau and Rapar. A farmer leader of Anjar taluka Radhu Ahir said: “We can take only one crop in a year. If we get Narmada water for irrigation we can take two to three crops. The government had promised to fill water bodies across Kutch with Narmada water. If the promise is fulfilled then the water table of the district will improve and we will get ground water easily for irrigation.”The arid land of Kutch is known for its Kesar mango and dragon fruit which requires a lot of water. The farmers submitted a memorandum to all mamlatdars stating that since the ground water level has reached 500-700 feet, it has become difficult to get water for irrigation. The farmers also demanded to be provided with sufficient quantities of fertilisers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/kutch-farmers-demand-narmada-water-for-irrigation/articleshow/88676516.cms||---

He was responding to a question on fuel price after garlanding the statue of freedom fighter Veerapandiya Kattabomman on his 262nd birthday anniversary on Monday.Annamalai said that many states that did not announce reduction in fuel price in their election manifesto have reduced the state government tax on fuel. But DMK as opposition promised to reduce it in its election manifesto. “One side T R Baalu wants to bring fuel under GST. On the other side, the finance minister says it will not be done. Let T R Baalu and P T R soon sit and talk about it, arrive at a conclusion and express the same view. Then the BJP will talk about it,” he added.Annamalai also said that the BJP will abide by all the Covid-19 protocol and norms of the state government in organizing party events including Pongal in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to participate. “That is what the PM will also wish, as we are in the government and want to curtail the spread of Omicron,” he said.To a question on Vaiko’s call to all opposition parties to unite and defeat the BJP, Annamalai said that this was tried by the opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh in 2019. “Then they realized that no matter how many parties unite, they will not be able to defeat BJP. So the Congress, Samajwadi party and BSP are contesting the assembly polls separately,” he said. He added that the BJP is keen on Madurai airport getting upgraded to an international status and that they are striving hard for the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/annamalai-tells-ptr-t-r-baalu-to-be-on-the-same-page-on-gst/articleshow/88676523.cms||---

However, only the Madurai Corporation and two panchayat blocks out of the 13 blocks record more than 80% first dose vaccination coverage. Two panchayat blocks, Chellampatti and T Kallupatti meanwhile recorded less than 70% coverage.“Despite our best efforts to survey and canvas people in rural areas, some are not coming forward to take the jab. Rather than hesitancy, some are just stubborn to not take the vaccine. It is a challenge for us,” said a panchayat official. Prevalence of various myths surrounding Covid-19 vaccination continues to discourage some from taking the possibly life-saving jab. “From thinking it will stop them permanently from consuming liquor to severe side effects, some absurd facts are given by the public as an excuse. A few youths told us they saw a YouTube video that says that the vaccine affects sexual performance,” said a village health nurse. Health officials, meanwhile, said that the mandatory checking for vaccination certificates at several public places has forced many to take the jab.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/only-80-2-have-taken-first-dose-vax-in-madurai/articleshow/88676524.cms||---

Rabri even said it was her party which had first raised the issue of special status to Bihar. When a mediaperson told Rabri that Nitish had stated that RJD had no idea of social reforms, the former CM replied, “Only he has the knowledge of everything as he was born before the Independence.” She then said her party had been raising the demand for special status and added everyone was aware of Nitish’s constraints. However, JD(U) condemned the language used by Rabri for Nitish. JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said, “First of all, the kind of language which RJD leaders use or what they upload to social media should not be taken into consideration. It is because of his good work that people have elected Nitish again and again.” Meanwhile, Rabri’s son and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, is gearing up for his Berozgari Hatao Yatra. The bus which Tejashwi had used earlier during a yatra was seen entering the 10, Circular Road residence of his mother on Monday. “On January 5, the entire schedule of his yatra will be prepared,” said an RJD leader, adding the Covid-19 situation or government’s decision may impact it. “As on today, it stands,” he added. RJD on Monday also announced that it will celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Jagdeo Prasad on February 2 at Bapu Sabhagar.

Three BJP workers, Shyam Sundar Nishad, Shubham Mishra and Hari Om Mishra, who were allegedly lynched by farmers in retaliation were also named as accused in this case. The SIT has not named the junior home minister in the chargesheet, nor questioned him so far. Sources in the SIT, however, said a supplementary chargesheet will be filed after enough evidence is collected against "some more people". A SIT member told TOI, “All those named in the complaint given by the farmers will be questioned. This is the reason why investigation in this case is still not complete.” Ajay Mishra's name, too, figures in the complaint by farmers. Virendra Shukla, who is the block chief from Palia in Kheri district and was identified as the owner of the Scorpio SUV that was part of Ashish’s convoy, has been charged under IPC section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence). 99 Kheri witnesses' statements recorded, next hearing on Jan 10Shukla, who is the block chief from Palia in Kheri, is yet to be arrested as the charge against him is bailable. Senior prosecution officer S P Yadav told TOI: "A chargesheet has been submitted by the SIT against main accused Ashish Mishra and 16 others. Three accused in this case are already dead and, hence, charges were framed against 14 accused. Of these, 13 are in jail, and their judicial custody was converted to trial custody. Shukla has been summoned to appear before the court on January 10, which is the next date of hearing. He can apply for bail even before this date...We have requested the court to impound important parts of the case diary under Section 173(6) of the CrPC. Investigation in this case is still under way, and a supplementary chargesheet is expected soon." The SIT member added: "Statements of 99 witnesses were recorded under Section 164 CrPC before the court, and all of them have submitted that Ashish was present at the spot. Testimonies of witnesses were verified." Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by Ashish's convoy on October 3, 2021. An FIR was initially registered under IPC sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly), 304a (causing death by negligence) and 120b (criminal conspiracy). On December 14, the SIT had said the incident was "a premeditated one and not an act of negligence". The court later dropped sections pertaining to "accident" from the FIR and included sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death), 34 (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC along with relevant sections of the Arms Act. Sukhwinder Singh, son of farmer Gurwinder Singh- who was killed during the violence - said: "We had withdrawn our protest in the belief that action will be taken...Ajay Mishra should also be sent to jail."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/mins-son-bro-in-law-among-14-named-in-chargesheet/articleshow/88676532.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

TDP legislator from Visakhapatnam East constituency, Velagapudi Ramakrishna, had moved a PIL in the high court challenging the redevelopment of Haritha resorts belonging to the tourism department by violating norms. Arguing on behalf of Ramakrishna, N Ashwani Kumar told the court that the Union government granted permission for construction of resorts in an extent of 9.8 acres on Rushikonda hillock. However, construction is now being carried out in more than the allowed area which is against the CRZ norms and will cause irreparable damage to the environment. He further said that Visakhapatnam coastline, which is an ecologically sensitive area, is getting affected due to the indiscriminate digging and razing down of trees on the hillock. As both CRZ norms and Environment Protection Act have been violated, he sought directions to the Union government to cancel the permissions given to the tourism department for construction of resorts on Rushikonda hillock. He also sought directions to constitute a committee to oversee the compliance of CRZ norms. Considering the arguments, the high court directed the state government to comply with the norms as directed in a similar petition on the same issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/court-tells-govt-to-follow-crz-norms/articleshow/88673567.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Meanwhile, the minimum temperature will rise, but the day time temperature will fall, and the air quality will improve due to rain and stronger easterly winds. Track the pollution level in your cityMonday recorded a slight rise in the mercury. Safdarjung, the city’s base station, saw a minimum temperature of 5.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average, as against 5 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature was 21.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above the season’s average, as against 20.4 on Sunday. “Two western disturbances of equal intensity are likely to affect the city on January 4 and 6, and then from January 5 to 9. The wind directions will change from westerly to easterly from Tuesday night,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “The city will receive light rain to drizzle from January 5 with possibility of stronger intensity on January 5 and 8, respectively. Due to clouding, the minimum temperatures will spike as the heat gets trapped in the atmosphere due to clouds. However, the maximum temperatures will fall.” The western disturbance is a flow of high moisture winds and clouds from Mediterranean Sea to Himalayas. During winter, Delhi often receives cold and dry northwesterly winds. However, in some cases, the wind speed also changes to easterly or southeasterly, leading to a rise in moisture. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures may hover around 22 and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday. On Monday, Delhi’s air quality improved to “very poor” category even as a number of areas of the city continued oscillating within the “severe” category. The air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 388, as against 404 a day earlier, while Anand Vihar, Rohini, Punjabi Bagh, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, DTU, Jahangirpuri, Mundka, Nehru Nagar, Patpargang and a few others remained severely polluted. According to the pollution monitoring agencies, AQI may improve due to better wind speeds. “High winds and intermittent rain are likely during January 5 to 8 that is expected to improve AQI significantly to the ‘lower end of very poor’ through strong dispersion and wet deposition,” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-to-see-rainy-week-air-quality-may-get-tad-better/articleshow/88675009.cms||---

He had allegedly taken Rs 2.25 lakh promising a Portuguese passport within four months. The court held that failure to honour a promise does not constitute an offence of cheating unless it is proved that the accused had dishonest intention. “From the evidence on record, the only allegation against the accused that he had assured to provide the said person a Portuguese passport within four months,” the court stated. Even if it is considered that the accused failed to honour his promise, it cannot attract ingredients of offence of cheating unless and until the prosecution proves that the accused had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise, the court held. The court, while acquitting Rodrigues, held that all the testimonies “clearly disclose that none of them have made any inquiries about the antecedents of the accused, including working experience. The money they paid was in installments, further, no proof of the work done and progress of the work was insisted on by the above persons from the accused, even before making payment of the last instalment”. “From the conduct of the above persons, it is very clear that they have not acted in a manner required by a prudent person. The payment of huge money to the accused for obtaining passport without signing any application form, without knowing antecedents of the accused and past experience and continuing making payment without knowing the progress of the work, appears to be highly improbable and the same creates doubt regarding the case put forth by the above witnesses. Nothing prevented the above persons from at least inquiring with the Portuguese Consulate regarding the fate of their application,” stated Ram S Prabhu Dessai, chief judicial magistrate, ‘A’ court, Panaji. It was the case of the prosecution that between 2018 and 2020, the accused on the pretext of providing a Portuguese passport/documentation induced the complainant to pay him Rs 2.25 lakh, however, the accused failed to provide the Portuguese passport or return the money to the complainant till date.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/panaji-court-acquits-man-in-portuguese-passport-case/articleshow/88675023.cms||---

With the coming of the new variant of the coronavirus, people who did not get themselves vaccinated earlier are turning up in large numbers. Moreover, the government has allowed vaccination for 15 to 18 years, which will add to the rush. Therefore, we request the administration and the government to start vaccination drives at the offices of the business associations that are centrally located.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/bizmen-hold-vax-camps-at-factories-offices/articleshow/88676565.cms||Mohit Behl

The Theka Mulazim (contractual workers) of 11 departments, under the banner of Punjab Theka Mulazim Sangharsh Morcha, had laid siege to the road around Sunday noon to press the government to fulfil their demands, mainly of regularisation of services.Satnam Singh, media adviser of the morcha, said on Sunday night, the deputy commissioner had got their meeting fixed with the chief minister on Monday and so they allowed traffic to ply on the two service lanes of the road. He added that on Monday they met the chief minister in Chandigarh and he assured them that their demands will be looked into. “After the assurance, we lifted the blockade of the road around 6pm,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/protesting-staff-lift-road-siege-after-meeting-cm/articleshow/88676566.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||‘Victims of Cong strife’, teachersto protest on Manpreet’s turf today||Ludhiana: The Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (PFUCTO) on Monday accused the state government of making a mess of the higher education system by delinking their pay from the UGC (University Grants Commission) system. They claim that the issue of pay scales has made them victims of the ruling party’s internal conflicts. Addressing the media here, the organisation’s office-bearers alleged that the Punjab government, led earlier by Captain Amarinder Singh and now by Charanjit Singh Channi, was destroying public-funded institutes of higher education at the behest of private universities. They claimed that the state government seemed to be working as an agent of the private educational institutes that exploited both teachers and the taught.PFUCTO alleged that Captain Amarinder Singh had not implemented the UGC pay scales because of reported differences with higher education minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and now Channi was doing the same, since the present higher education minister, Pargat Singh, was close to state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, and Channi and Sidhu were fighting their own battle for supremacy. The teachers, meanwhile, continue with their agitation programme. They plan to stage a protest march on January 4 in the constituency of Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal in Bathinda, while on January 6, they’ll protest outside the CM’s residence in Morinda.PFUCTO president H S Kingra said: "All these years, we tried to convince the government that it was under constitutional obligation to comply with the central legislation, as higher education is a subject on the concurrent list of the Constitution. The acts, rules, regulations, and statutes of the UGC have to be followed. However, under the influence of vested interests, the state government has not paid any attention to it."Organisation’s general secretary Jagwant Singh said: "We have written to the vice- chancellors of all the universities not to violate their statutes and UGC the regulations by affiliating substandard government colleges that will not qualify under section 2 (f) of the UGC Act. As a consequence, the students admitted to these colleges will not be entitled to even appear in the university examinations."Jagwant Singh said: "To ensure that innocent students do not get trapped, the teachers have cautioned three universities in advance. PFUCTO has also written to the chief minister that he should let no public money be spent on these colleges, as these will not be recognised by the UGC unless the state government takes appropriate action on the UGC Regulation dated July 18, 2018, and February 20, 2010."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/victims-of-cong-strife-teachersto-protest-on-manpreets-turf-today/articleshow/88676568.cms||Mehak Jain

---||India||No proof in 21 rape, rape bids mentioned by NHRC, says CBI||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court-monitored CBI probe into instances of alleged killings and sexual assault during post-poll violence in Bengal has found no evidence in 21 cases of rape and attempted rape that find mention in the National Human Rights Commission’s report. The NHRC report lists 64 alleged incidents of rape and attempted rape. In its status report to the court on Monday, the CBI said it had registered 39 cases and was probing four others after having sent back 21 of them to Bengal police’s special investigation team (SIT) for want of evidence. The agency said it had also sent back two “murder cases” to the SIT for the same reason. The CBI is probing 52 allegations of murder or unnatural death relating to post-poll violence. It has already filed charge-sheets in 10 cases while 38 more are in various stages of investigation. The NHRC had reported 59 murders, of which the state government acknowledged 29. The CBI probe was instituted on August 19 alongside the constitution of an SIT under the supervision of a retired judge to probe other criminal cases. A five-judge bench, led by former acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, also directed the NHRC, the state government and all other commissions or committees that had received complaints to hand over to the CBI all records relating to murder and alleged crimes against women during the wave of post-poll violence. The Bengal government moved the Supreme Court on September 1, challenging the HC order. Allegations of rape and murder surfaced in the aftermath of Trinamool Congress's landslide victory in the eight-phase polls, the results of which were declared on May 2. Several rights bodies, including the NHRC and National Commission for Women, sent separate teams to probe the allegations. Trinamool has repeatedly contested the allegations and accused the rights bodies of acting “like BJP teams”. A seven-member NHRC committee had claimed to have received nearly 1,650 complaints involving nearly 5,000 victims. Fifty-seven complaints relating to atrocities on women were registered with the NCW alone. The state police had informed the NHRC about 12 complaints of rape and alleged rape. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Kesang Doma Bhutia will hear the matter again on January 24.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-proof-in-21-rape-rape-bids-mentioned-by-nhrc-says-cbi/articleshow/88676577.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Ludhiana||Illegal skinning continues near Satluj, carcass unit lies defunct||Ludhiana: Even almost six months after its completion, the carcass utilisation plant at Noorpur Bet lies unused. With the Punjab assembly elections around (notification expected anytime), the start is likely to be delayed further, while illegal skinning near the Satluj river continues unchecked.The civic officials are reluctant to talk about the situation even as the villagers oppose this project and allege that they were kept in the dark about the project. The municipal corporation had scheduled the inauguration of the carcass plant on July 13, 2021, and invited local MLA and Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for it but when mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal went there before the ceremony, the villagers gathered there and started protesting. The officials tried to convince them with the argument that the project’s advance techniques will prevent water pollution but the protesters did not budge. Consequently, the authorities had to cancel that inauguration. Going by the MC’s calculations, the plant has a capacity to dispose of 150 dead animals (50 large and 100 small) a day. To start with, it was to skin 20 animals. Executed under the Smart City mission, the project is worth Rs 8.5 crore. City-based activist Jaskirat Singh said: "When the civic authorities plan things without taking suggestions from the public, you face this sort of a situation. The carcass plant is a mere waste of public money. The civic authorities should either shift it or convince the villager that it will prevent pollution of the Buddha Nullah." Council of Engineers president Kapil Arora said: "The villagers are against this plant and they claim that it was constructed without their knowledge. Looking at the intensity of the protest, it seems that the authorities will not be able to run it." However, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said: "This project is for the very essential task of disposing of dead animals but due to the resentment of a few people, we are unable to start it. We have taking up the issue with the higher authorities for a solution."The project hangs fire since 2013. Earlier it was the lack of money that stalled it. It came under the Smart City mission after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) objected to illegal ‘hadda rodi’ (skinning) near the Satluj, as it was polluting the water body. The NGT had also imposed penalty on the skinners who worked on the riverbanks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/illegal-skinning-continues-near-satluj-carcass-unit-lies-defunct/articleshow/88676578.cms||---

The state already has 40 lakh doses of Covaxin at its disposal. “The regular supply of Covaxin from the Union government will begin now. We have furnished the requisition for an additional 40 lakh doses of Covaxin to speed up the vaccination of the newly added age group this month,” said state immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai. The two doses of Covaxin are administered 28 days apart to achieve full immunization. Child specialists and paediatric task force experts in Maharashtra have been urging the Centre to expedite inoculation of children considering how Omicron, the new variant of Covid, affected children after senior citizens in countries such as South Africa. “While children, by and large, have only a mild disease themselves, a small number of them may get sick enough to require hospitalization. This has been lately seen in South Africa. The vaccination can mitigate the severity of disease in children so that they can be managed at home. This will prevent a load on the health services,” said Dr Pramod Jog, a child specialist and task force member. Elaborating on infrastructure capabilities, Dr Jog said, “Covid vaccination of children in the 15 to 18 years age bracket can be handled easily with the current vaccine infrastructure,” he said. Though the serosurvey pointed to some seropositivity in children as well, it is important to prioritize vaccination for children in the age group of 12-18 years. Children between the age of 12 and 18 years, particularly those in the age group of 15 to 18 years, are very much like adults.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maha-seeks-40-lakh-more-covaxin-doses/articleshow/88676584.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||Modi govt, RSS want to end reservation: Cong||Nagpur: Congress chief spokesperson Atul Londhe on Monday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government accusing it of working on a systematic agenda set by RSS to gradually do away with the system of reservation for all sections of society. Londhe said, “People from the backward classes voted for BJP and brought them to power in the centre. Now, the same BJP government is trying to uproot those people. After Marathas and OBCs, now even economically weaker sections (EWS) will be deprived of reservation. BJP government’s policies are aimed at depriving the backward class of its rights.” Speaking on the issue of Modi government filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court clarifying that those holding more than five acres would be ineligible for EWS reservation, Londhe said the anti-Bahujan face of BJP stood exposed now. He said people from Marathwada, Vidarbha who owe more than five acres will not be eligible for reservations now. “Both these are dry and drought prone regions where the farm productivity is low. Despite the large land holdings, farmer suicides are rampant here. With the new rule, children from these poor families will lose their rights,” said Londhe. Londhe, also the Congress general secretary, further said that since BJP cannot do away with the reservations directly, it had adopted such backdoor measures to fulfil its target. Pointing that the empirical data required for OBC reservation was not provided by the BJP, Londhe said as a result the political reservation of OBCs across the country, including Maharashtra, is in peril. “Recent panchayat elections in Maharashtra were held without OBC seats. The situation is the same in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Reservation above 50% has not been approved by the Centre and now the EWS quota is also being tinkered with. The Maratha community which was eligible for EWS reservation will also no longer be eligible for it,” he said while appealing to the masses to “recognize BJP’s hypocrisy”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/modi-govt-rss-want-to-end-reservation-cong/articleshow/88672777.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Ludhiana||Demand to cut GST on scrap from 18% to 5%||Ludhiana: After the Goods and Services Tax Council deferred the increase in the GST rates for the textile and garment business, the local industrialists now want the GST on scrap to be reduced from 18 to 5%.The industrialists had raised this demand a few months ago as well, when they had also requested state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal to try and convince the central government to reduce the GST. The businessmen argue that this reduction will curtail bogus billing that hurts genuine businessmen. Induction Furnace Association of North India general secretary Dev Gupta said: "The GST council took a big decision when it deferred the hike in GST on textiles and garments from 5 to 12%. Compared with that, the tax on scrap is 18%. If they cut it to 5%, the government will get several hundred crore more rupees in revenue."Gupta claimed that: Once the GST on scrap is fixed at 5%, it will put a full stop to bogus billing and, as a result, revenue will increase." Supporting his views, Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India president Narinder Bhamra said: "The present rate of GST on scrap is 18% while on several other input components, it is 5%. Organised gangs use this gap of 13% to do bogus billing, show fake sale, and purchase invoices to claim fraudulent input tax credit from the GST department, while those who do their business honestly also come under the radar."Bhamra said that in some cases, despite buying scrap, the businessmen get bills that somewhere down the supply chain have bogus suppliers, so despite no fault of theirs, the genuine businessmen get penalised by the department. We the Ludhiana industrialists, therefore, request the GST council to reduce the tax on scrap to 5%."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/demand-to-cut-gst-on-scrap-from-18-to-5/articleshow/88676589.cms||Mohit Behl
