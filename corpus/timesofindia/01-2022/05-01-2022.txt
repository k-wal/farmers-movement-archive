So I would like to tell everyone that we are here to work together as I am here to stay. Let us clear that doubt if anyone thinks I am moving anywhere. I have come back to my nest,” Monserrate said. The legislator on Tuesday said that the lion’s share Sattari has been taking as far as government employment is concerned, should be transferred to Panaji. He assured the youth of Panaji that he would fight to provide them with employment. In the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant at a public meeting in Panaji, Monserrate said parents have come for the meeting seeking jobs for their children and that they should tell their children that he would fight to get jobs for them. “I think many of the youth have elected me most because of employment. And I request the chief minister that the lion’s share which Sattari taluka is taking be transferred to Panaji,” Monserrate said even as he pointed out that most government offices are functioning from the state capital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-panaji-legislator-allays-talk-of-jumping-bjp-ship/articleshow/88697608.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Delhi||Weekend curfew in Delhi as fresh cases hit 9-month high||NEW DELHI: On a day the national capital recorded 5,481 new Covid-19 cases, highest in nearly nine months, and three Covid fatalities, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) imposed a weekend curfew in the city. It, however, allowed more passengers to travel by the Metro and buses to curb crowding outside stations and at bus stops. While the existing restrictions under Level 1 (Yellow) of the graded response action Plan (GRAP) would remain in place, some additional restrictions, including closure of Delhi government and corporation offices, have been taken keeping in mind the rapid increase in the number of cases and the positivity rate rising to 8.4%, said the DDMA order. Addressing a digital press briefing after the meeting, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that though the majority of cases are very mild, the decision to impose a weekend curfew was taken keeping in mind the spurt in cases. Sisodia requested Delhiites to stay at home as movement of only those in the exempted category would be allowed during the curfew. Sisodia said that only those government employees who are engaged in essential services would come to work and others would work from home. For private offices, the existing guidelines of operations with 50% staff strength remains unchanged. While a night curfew is already in place, the weekend curfew would begin from 10pm on Friday and remain in effect till 5am on Monday. Exempted categories include those engaged in essential services, all government and private healthcare workers, pregnant women and those who need health services, people coming from or going to the airport, railway stations and ISBTs on production of valid travel tickets and those appearing for examinations on production of ID and admit cards etc. In another major decision taken by the DDMA, Delhi Metro trains and public transport buses, which were running with 50% seating capacity, would now be able to operate with 100% capacity though standing passengers have not been allowed in either. Sisodia said that this has been done to avoid queues outside Metro stations and crowds at bus stops becoming superspreaders. While the weekend curfew imposes complete restrictions on the movement of individuals, the order doesn’t specifically mention anything about which shops would be allowed to remain open during the weekend. Shops dealing in essential goods and services, such as food items, including milk, vegetables, fruits etc, pharmacies and medical equipment may remain open though the order doesn’t specifically mention this. It also doesn’t mention if e-commerce delivery would be allowed or not or if only those of essential goods would be allowed. Sisodia said that on the basis of their experience so far, experts believe that this variant of Covid is not fatal. He said out of about 11,000 active cases, only 350 are hospitalised, out of which 124 are on oxygen support and 7 are on ventilator support.

Maharashtra continued to report maximum daily cases in the country even as BMC commissioner IS Chahal said in a TV interview that according to experts, Omicron was responsible for 80 per cent of the Covid cases in Mumbai, reducing the Delta variant to the remaining 20%. Chahal’s revelations came days after the seventh round of genome sequencing last week that had found that 55% of the people in Mumbai were infected by the Omicron variant, while the rest were mainly Delta and Delta lineages.

---||India||In two days, over 84 lakh teens given first dose of vaccine||NEW DELHI: Nearly 84.4 lakh teenagers aged 15-17 were vaccinated till 10pm on Tuesday, with the count inching towards the 1 crore mark in two days of the drive. Close to 42 lakh teenagers were vaccinated on Monday, and a similar number received their first dose on Tuesday. The government is aiming to achieve 85-90% coverage of first dose among adolescents in the age group in 15-20 days, a senior official told TOI. The health ministry has projected around 7.4 crore adolescents in the 15-17 age group. The government plans to gradually expand the coverage of Covid immunisation to all age groups. Currently, only Covaxin has been authorised for use in 15-17-year-olds. More than 98.9 lakh youngsters aged 15-17 years have registered for vaccination so far. Gujarat (nearly 11 lakh) and Madhya Pradesh (10 lakh) have vaccinated maximum number of youngsters. Other states that administered a substantial number of doses in the 15-17 age group include Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. Vaccination among 15-17-year-olds also inched up in Uttar Pradesh (4.5 lakh), Maharashtra (4.4 lakh) and Bihar (4.3 lakh), though with huge scope for improvement. Delhi received a footfall of 54,250, whereas West Bengal had administered vaccine to nearly 2.8 lakh adolescents till Tuesday night. The enthusiastic response from youngsters pushed the daily vaccination number over 95.6 lakh doses on Tuesday. The government decided to prioritise 15-17 years among children for receiving Covid vaccines as almost 75% of deaths in children due to Covid-19 so far has happened in this group. The government’s experts also took into account the advent of the more transmissible Omicron, which raises the risk of older children, being fairly mobile, bringing the diesease home to the more vulnerable elderly family members. Vaccination of adolescents is expected to help normalisation of education and also reduce the risk of transmission through them. The registration for this category of beneficiaries opened on January 1. Beneficiaries can register both online as well as onsite.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-two-days-over-84-lakh-teens-given-first-dose-of-vaccine/articleshow/88698782.cms||Sushmi Dey

The images show the Indian soldiers, armed with the latest SiG Sauer assault rifles, with the Tricolour as well as their Dogra Regiment flag at an observation post in the Galwan valley. “The post is near the site where rival troops had clashed in June 2020,” said a source in the security establishment. The release of the images came three days after China's state media played up a video of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers unfurling the Chinese flag and sending New Year greetings purportedly from the Galwan valley. Indian sources have already debunked the video, saying it was not filmed anywhere near the buffer or demilitarised zone there.

---||India||Covid: Daily cases in India surge 56% to 58,000, highest 1-day spike||NEW DELHI: Tuesday saw an explosion of Covid-19 infections in the country with the daily tally close to 58,000, registering a single-day rise of 56%, the highest during a period of surge since the pandemic began. Tuesday’s case count had galloped to 57,974 by late night and was likely to cross 58,000 after data from two remaining states came in. This was over 20,000 higher than the tally of 37,123 recorded on Monday and India's highest daily tally since June 19, 2021, when 58,570 cases were reported. Only once has the single-day rise in infections been higher than 56% — 63% on January 28, 2021 — and that was because the previous day’s count had fallen sharply due to disruptions in testing on Republic Day. That rise was anomalous since it came at the time when cases were falling. Tuesday was also the eighth consecutive day of rising cases during which the country has seen an unprecedented surge in infections, with daily numbers up nearly nine-fold since 6,242 cases were recorded on Monday, December 27. The sharp surge on Tuesday came on the back of higher testing on the previous day following a drop on Sunday. Over 11.5 lakh samples were collected for testing on Monday, up from 8.9 lakh on the day before. Still, India’s test positivity rate touched 5% on Tuesday, which is seen as a mark of a serious surge in infections. Daily deaths from the virus also registered a slight rise at 112, the highest in nearly three weeks and the first time since December 23 that the toll had crossed the 100 mark. Maharashtra continued to lead the case numbers with 18,466 fresh infections, up 50% from 12,160 on the previous day. Daily detections in Mumbai crossed 10,000, with 10,606 fresh cases emerging on Tuesday, the highest for any city in India. Bengal posted 9,073 new cases, again a 50% rise from Monday’s tally of 6,078. Kolkata accounted for 4,759 fresh Covid-19 infections, the highest ever for the city. The state’s TPR stood at an alarming 19% on Tuesday. Delhi reported 5,481 new cases, the second highest for a city after Mumbai even as the TPR stayed well above 5% for the second day. Several states reported a doubling of cases in a day. Punjab reported 1,027 fresh infections, up from 419 on Monday while Bihar posted 893, up from 344, and Telangana 1,052 from 482. Cases nearly doubled in Jharkhand from 1,481 to 2,681 and Gujarat (2,265 from 1,259). What’s now clearly the third wave of the pandemic in India and enveloped nearly all states and UTs of the country. Kerala, where cases were falling till the end of last week, recorded a spike on Tuesday at 3,640 fresh infections, the highest since December 15. Numbers are also rising in the northeast, with Assam posting 475 cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-daily-cases-in-india-surge-56-to-58000-highest-1-day-spike/articleshow/88698948.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

PM Modi, who flew to BJP-governed Tripura next to inaugurate the newly built integrated terminal of Agartala airport, said that the northeast joined the development race post-2014 after being hampered by decades of neglect. Beyond the rally ground largely packed by BJP workers and supporters, the PM's focus on a resurgent Manipur contrasted with near-empty streets as the proscribed CorCom's boycott call kept residents of the Imphal valley indoors. The group is an amalgam of various armed outfits. PM Modi lauded the BJP-led N Biren Singh government for initiating "rapid development" of Manipur through campaigns and schemes like "Go to Villages" and "Go to Hills". He said the current government had been able to integrate the hills and the valley, where opposing militant outfits hold sway, and create a path of hitherto unseen growth. The projects PM Modi inaugurated include the Barak bridge along the Imphal-Silchar highway, the Thoubal multipurpose project, water supply schemes in Tamenglong and Senapati and Imphal's renovated Govindajee temple. A cancer hospital is part of the new projects he announced. In Agartala, where he was joined by civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Prime Minister Modi batted for CM Biplab Kumar Deb, saying he hadn't quite got the credit he deserved. "Our friends in the media are not always giving due coverage to the good things done by the government. Double-engine growth means united effort towards prosperity, of which Tripura is an example," he said, alluding to the state lately making news more for alleged communal flare-ups and political vendetta than development. The major part of Modi's 24-minute speech at Agartala's Swami Vivekananda Stadium was dedicated to outlining how CM Deb and his ministry had crossed various milestones, including initiating a crucial change in the eligibility criteria for the Prime Minister Awas Yojana. "Biplab Deb came to me with his argument to consider semi-permanent structures as a kutcha house, and the central government reviewed his proposal and accepted it. Accordingly, the definitions of kutcha and pucca houses were changed. Around 1.8 lakh beneficiaries of Tripura got houses under PMAY in a year. The same benefits accrued to lakhs of people elsewhere in the country." Tripura, which is due for elections in 2023, suffered under the Left Front that governed the state for 25 years before BJP wrested the reins, Modi said. "After the last election, when BJP came to government, I promised you the HIRA model - highway, internet way, railway and airway. The results are now showing."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/double-engine-growth-way-to-prosperity-pm-modi-hails-tripura/articleshow/88699014.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

The city reported 1,041 cases on Monday, reports Sunitha Rao R. The last time Bengaluru saw 2,000-plus cases in a day was on June 10 (2,191 cases). However, the city had, then, accounted for 20% of the state's daily tally. On Tuesday, the city's infections made up for 83% of the state's 2,479 cases. The city conducted 72,121 tests during the day and reported a test positivity rate of 2.8%. The TPR in the city has been above 2% since January 2. The state's daily TPR was at 2.6 %, after conducting 95,391 tests in the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, health minister K Sudhakar acknowledged the beginning of the third wave. Speaking about the increase in the number of daily cases in Delhi, Maharashtra and Bengaluru, he said there's a need to implement special measures to control the spread. Experts pointed out that community spread of Omicron had already begun. However, there is no dramatic increase in hospitalisation rate, yet. As per health and family welfare department data on January 3, in the last 15 days, 371 Covid patients were admitted to private hospitals and 71 in government hospitals in Bengaluru. The city breached the 200-mark on December 26, 2021. In the 10 days since, it has seen 7,137 cases, nearly thrice the 1,920 cases reported in the previous ten days between December 16-25, 2021. "Omicron spread has begun and the cases will spike further. After a point of time, the genomic sequencing becomes insignificant when Omicron becomes the dominant variant in circulation," said a member of the Technical Advisory Committee. Bengaluru, epicentre of the second wave of infections in Karnataka, is once again pushing up the state's numbers. Agreeing there is a community spread of the Omicron variant, Karnataka Pulmonologists' Association president Dr K S Satish said, "The cases we are seeing are mild in nature. A majority of those turning positive now are not requiring hospitalisation. The need of ICU and ventilator beds is not seen yet. The infection is milder among both those who are fully vaccinated and those who earlier had natural exposure to Covid." According to Dr C N Manjunath, director, Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, the spike in cases can also be seen in sudden increase of cases seen among patients and healthcare workers. "In the last 10 days, we have seen 20 positive cases in the hospital including patients and hospital staff. The Omicron spread has definitely begun," he said. He added that the need of the hour is to procure the S gene target failure testing kits that can indicate Omicron infection which can help early detection and isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/new-cases-almost-double-in-bluru-hit-7-month-high/articleshow/88699083.cms||Sunitha Rao R

At its meeting on Monday, it suggested that asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic Covid-positive persons could be admitted to Covid Care Centres of the government or at private facilities for five days, reports Sunitha Rao R.They will be discharged from CCC only after obtaining a negative result of an RT-PCR test conducted on the fifth day. Also, they must be free of respiratory symptoms and their oxygen-saturation level should be over 94% during the preceding three days. After discharge from CCC, they must be in home quarantine for five days and no further testing is required. The committee has not suggested home isolation for air travellers turning positive on arrival and institutional isolation is still made mandatory. It has said Omicron patients, testing repeatedly positive even after 10 days, can be discharged on the 14th day and hospitals can monitor them further. As per the Union health ministry guidelines, international passengers, who are turning Covid positive on arrival and in repeat tests during quarantine, have to be admitted to designated Covid hospitals. If they are found to be infected with Omicron variant, ahead of discharge, they must test negative twice in 24 hours after 10 days of care. According to TAC, at least 6-8 international passengers arriving at the Bengaluru airport from high-risk nations are testing positive for Covid every day. They are, then, moved to Bowring hospital in Bengaluru and Wenlock Hospital in Mangalore for 10 days of isolation. "More than 90% of these persons are asymptomatic. Those who are mildly symptomatic have recovered in 1-3 days, and this includes those infected with Omicron variant. However, the flyers were hospitalized as per the Union government's norms as there was no clinical experience of Omicron," the TAC report reads. The experts have said these persons are "agitated" during their isolation in the hospital as they considered it was "irrational to isolate them when they are free of symptoms" as many had come on personal or business trips. The more vocal were those who paid for their hospitalization in designated private hospitals as it was considered a "sheer wasteful expenditure and avoidable," says the TAC report. The experts have mentioned that in the context of a spike in Covid, the hospital beds would be needed for deserving (moderate and severe cases) patients for saving lives. With an increase in Omicron cases, the experts have suggested the government to procure S Gene target failure testing kits that can indicate Omicron cases with RT-PCR tests. TAC suggested that these kits must be used in Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Belagavi. "We need to use these kits also in cluster cases reported from residential schools, hostels and apartments," sources said. WFH for high-risk groupsThe Covid committee has suggested to the government that employees falling under the special groups be permitted to work from home till February 2022 in both government and private sectors. This includes pregnant women in their third trimester, lactating mothers, persons on dialysis and cancer treatment, persons who are immunocompromised or who have undergone cardiac surgery or implant of stent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tac-says-isolate-asymptomatic-intl-flyers-for-five-days/articleshow/88699090.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: BJP chief JP Nadda pans TRS government over Bandi Sanjay’s arrest||HYDERABAD: BJP national president JP Nadda on Tuesday hit out at the TRS government for arresting party's Telangana unit chief Bandi Sanjay over alleged violation of Covid-19 norms even as a parliament privileges committee is set to probe the issue. During a politically-charged day, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Prakash Birla asked the parliament privileges committee to submit a fact-finding report on Bandi Sanjay's complaint on police high-handedness at his camp office in Karimnagar on Sunday night. According to BJP sources, a three-member party committee comprising three MPs from other states will also meet Bandi Sanjay. Nadda, at a press conference, said he had come to express solidarity with employees and Bandi Sanjay, but at the airport the joint commissioner of police told him that Covid-19 restrictions were in place. "When I asked him if I have permission for a rally, he said he does not know. That shows the shallowness of administration and the state of affairs in the state," the BJP chief added. A planned candlelight rally on Tankbund to protest Sanjay's arrest and judicial custody was called off as the police refused to give permission. Nadda, instead, paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at his statue in Secunderabad before coming down hard on Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. "All TRS ministers are convening meetings and rallies, but they are stopping BJP in the name of Covid-19 protocol. The CM lost his balance after the defeat in Huzurabad, he will receive more dhamakas like Dubbak and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in the coming days," Nadda said, referring to some big upset wins by BJP in the recent past. Nadda also claimed that the Kaleswaram irrigation project has turned into a cash cow for the TRS government. "Under the direction of the CM, the state is becoming one of the most corrupt in the country," he alleged. Nadda said his party would continue to protest against Bandi Sanjay's arrest and GO 317. "Today I came, tomorrow another person will see this through to the end. The party shall not back down. We are an ideological party and we know how to fight without violating democratic norms," he said. During the media conference, Nadda played an old video of KCR's speech during the early days of the pandemic in which he had downplayed Covid-19 fears in the state. Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy, who was scheduled to visit Uttar Pradesh, cancelled his trip and instead called on Bandi Sanjay at the jail in Karimnagar on Nadda's instructions. There were also plans for Nadda to visit Sanjay in Karimnagar. "We don't know who will come to Karimnagar, but the next 15 days will be action-packed for us," a top leader privy to the developments said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-chief-nadda-pans-trs-govt-over-sanjays-arrest/articleshow/88699123.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The protesters claimed a bulk of their business happened in the evening, between 5pm and 11pm, and the evening shudown would only encourage illegal sale of booze.Several liquor vend owners also handed over the keys of their shops as a mark of protest and submitted a memorandum urging the authorities to either allow them to operate till 11pm or cut licence costs.On January 1, the state imposed lockdown-like curbs in five districts, including Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ambala, Panchkula and Sonipat, which came into effect from 5am on Sunday. While the restrictions are currently in place till 5 am on January 12, traders are apprehensive that it might be extended further. In absence of any relaxation, the traders said, they would be left with only the option: to close their shops.“More than 80% of our sales are recorded after 5pm. It is not feasible to run the shop with the new timings, and if we do, we will not be able to pay 100% licence fee,” Vikram Yadav of Liquor Land said.During the Covid-19 lockdown, imposed last year amid the second wave of the pandemic, the state government had extended the number of days under the existing licence against the days for which shops were closed. “But with the new rule, there is no relaxation on the licence fee,” Yadav said.Another wine shop owner, Rohit Yadav, said the new rule would encourage the illicit sale of liquor. “We are associates of the government and pay a huge amount of licence fee, but we are put under restriction,” he said, adding that wine shops were like take-away points where a customer hardly spent 5-10 minutes. “On the other hand, hotels and restaurants, where a large number of people assemble, are being allowed to operate with 50% seating capacity,” he said.Deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) VK Beniwal told TOI that the traders’ representation has been sent to the head office. “The notification for closing shops by 5pm was issued by the Haryana Disaster Management Authority. We have no interference in it,” he said.Gurgaon is divided into two excise districts that together generate around Rs 800 crore in excise revenue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/liquor-traders-protest-evening-closure-seek-licence-fee-relief/articleshow/88699125.cms||Bagish Jha

The turnout was slightly lesser than that of the previous day, when 7,527 minors took the shots. While the target for both days was 7,700 doses, the city was able to achieve around 98% of this on the first day and 97.2% on Tuesday. Gurgaon, which has been leading in vaccinations in the state so far, is surprisingly lagging behind in inoculations of this age group in the past two days. Panipat had given the most jabs (8,062) on Day 1, followed by Ambala (7,612) and Gurgaon. On Tuesday, Hisar (10,618) topped the day’s chart, followed by Panipat (10,063), Yamunanagar (9,048), Ambala (8,146) and Gurgaon.Vaccinations were carried out across 77 sites in the city on Tuesday. Out of these, 39 were set up in schools and 38 in primary healthcare facilities. Each site was allocated 100 doses. According to the health department, several districts of Haryana are witnessing a slow pace in vaccination of children at present.“Initially, Gurgaon reported a slow vaccination pace in every phase. It will pick up gradually. There is no issue with vaccine supply. Gurgaon has been carrying out more than 7,000 vaccinations for this particular age group,” state immunisation officer Virender Ahlawat told TOI.He further added, “All districts are witnessing a slump in vaccinations for the 15-17 group. Usually, the drive takes a leap after around 10 to 15 days, as many still have apprehensions about the Covid vaccine."The department said that it will gradually increase the pace in Gurgaon. “Right now, we have fixed the number of doses at 100 for each site. We are studying the pattern and will increase doses according to the demand across sites,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said.There were long queues of children at several sites in urban areas of the city on Tuesday. “I was looking forward to this day. I have not been going out much because of the new variant. The vaccine will provide protection against the virus,” said Aarti Kumari (15), who took the shot at the government school in Bhangrola.Meanwhile, a total of 21,312 people in the 18-44 age group got inoculated on Tuesday in Gurgaon. In the 45-plus category, 2,396 people took the shots. As many as five healthcare staff and 40 frontline workers also received the jabs. A total of 28,757 doses were given at government session sites and 2,485 at private centres. According to the health department, 43,43,360 doses have been administered in Gurgaon since January 16, when the city started giving Covid shots.In Haryana, 57,755 doses were administered to the 15-17 age group on the first day, which rose to 96,524 on Tuesday. State additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said, “We have set the target of inoculating 15.4 lakh children in this category. We have already given jabs to 1.5 lakh recipients in two days. We plan to substantially increase this figure by January 10, when the next round of jabs for healthcare, frontline workers and those above 60 will begin.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/hisar-tops-15-17-vax-chart-in-hry-city-at-5th-spot-with-15k-jabs-in-two-days/articleshow/88699127.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||‘Wait & watch’ on booster jabs for Sputnik V||Gurgaon: While frontline and healthcare workers in the state will be administered booster doses from January 10, around a thousand of them who have taken the Sputnik V vaccine will have to wait longer.Unlike other vaccines that use the same composition for the first and second doses, Sputnik V uses two different components. The Russian-made vaccine has two types of adenovirus vectors — rAd26 for the first shot and rAd5 for the second. Since the Centre has clarified that “mix and match” of vaccines wouldn’t be allowed, recipients will have to get a booster shot of the same vaccine.“We will give a booster to only those who have got Covaxin or Covishield. There are no booster shots for Sputnik as of now,” said Virender Ahlawat, the state immunisation officer. “There are many frontline and healthcare workers who have taken Sputnik shots. We have written to the Centre about their concern but have not received any clarification yet. So, we have to wait and watch.”Mohan Lal, a 35-year-old hospital worker in the city, took Sputnik in July. “You can imagine how crucial it is for me to take the booster shot since we are again witnessing a rise in Covid cases,” he said. Veeni (36), a nurse who also took shots of Sputnik, said, “Many healthcare workers are getting infected again. We can’t be at peace unless there is clarity on the booster shot.”According to Sputnik V’s official Twitter handle, it has already developed a booster. “Sputnik Light is based on the Ad26 vector and is the universal booster for other vaccines against all mutations. Ad26 boosting produces growing antibodies & high T-cells against Omicron…,” a tweet said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/wait-watch-on-booster-jabs-for-sputnik-v/articleshow/88699128.cms||Ipsita Pati

Currently, the city has 2,311 active cases, with 12 patients in hospitals. A total of 2,299 people are in home isolation. The positivity rate jumped to 9.02%. It was 6.8% on Monday. The city also saw 150 Covid patients recovering on Tuesday. Tuesday’s new infection count is half of the total number of Covid cases the city recorded all of last month (1,264). The district administration declared 20 new containment zones in the city. The city now has 41 containment zones, where additional containment protocols will be followed, like sanitisation and screening. Patients in home isolation have been geo-tagged with their phone numbers, and officials said police will monitor their movement to ensure they stay at home. Anticipating a rise in hospitalisation, the health department on Tuesday also carried out a dry run of the oxygen plants at Civil Hospital, Sector 10. “We have added 44 beds to the Covid ward at the hospital and carried out a dry run of the oxygen plants at the hospital so that in case of any emergency, we do not get caught off-guard,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.According to officials, the city needed nearly 60 tonnes of oxygen daily during the second Covid wave. At the height of the pandemic in May, major city hospitals depended on plants in Gujarat and Rajasthan for liquid oxygen, supplied in tankers and even trains.Gurgaon had three oxygen booster plants then. The city now has 24 of them-12 each in private and government facilities. Two can produce 1,500 litres per minute (LPM) of oxygen each. Ten of them can produce 1,000 LPM each. The remaining have capacities of 500 LPM.On the containment zones, the health department informed, any can get denotified after two weeks if there is no further surge in cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/covid-cases-spike-again-to-634-1-day-tally-is-half-of-dec-count/articleshow/88699129.cms||Ipsita Pati

The GMDA at present has a helpline number as well as a mobile application via which people can lodge complaints. Officials said that for every complaint lodged, a ticket is generated and sent to the concerned engineer who resolves the same and reverts with a reply, which in turn is sent to the complainant. “If the complainant is satisfied then the matter is resolved, otherwise the ticket can be reopened,” said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. According to officials, this matter was discussed most recently during the 9th authority meeting of the GMDA, held in early December. At the meeting, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is also the chairman of the GMDA, directed that a monitoring system be created for both the GMDA and the MCG for handling public complaints and grievances in a “time bound manner”. He had further directed that this system be made visible to the public. The Chairman had also directed officials to link the helpline number where residents can lodge complaints with the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC). “The Chairman had directed that time limits be fixed for the disposal of each type of complaint, and responsibility of officials also be fixed for timely disposal of complaints,” said the official quoted above. Officials said that, taking this matter further, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sudhir Rajpal will also be holding a meeting with senior officials of the GMDA later this week to look into pending complaints.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gmda-to-ramp-up-monitoring-for-grievance-redress-in-city/articleshow/88699132.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Meanwhile, no approval was given to set up gates at Nirvana Country in South City 2.The DTCP, in its order, said that to provide a sense of security to the residents without hampering inter-colony and intra-colony movement, the gates will be allowed on the condition that security guards man the gates or boom barriers, 24x7."Also, CCTV cameras are to be fixed by the governing body of the colony, and there should be no hindrance to building service roads along sectors and dividing roads for the general public, and the gates cannot be permanently closed," the order read.At a meeting, recently held under the chairmanship of the deputy commissioner and attended by the DTCP officials and police, the decision to allow licensed colonies to install gates got taken. In a plotted colony being developed by Adani Brahma Synergy in Sector 60, the officials allowed the erection of gates on the 24m-wide internal road in the M Block of the colony.Federation of Malibu Towne Residents' Association had requested for approval of boom barriers and iron gates at six points, and the officials after a detailed discussion, allowed gates at five points at the intersections of internal roads. The officials, however, did not allow a gate at the sixth point as it is revenue road and cannot be blocked.Residents' Welfare Association of the Uppal Southend licensed colony in Sector 49 had requested for a gate near Sapphire Mall and it was allowed by the officials.Uniworld Garden Apartment Owners' Association had requested for three entry and exit gates at Uniworld Garden 1, Sector 47, Sohna Road. After detailed deliberation, the department allowed two entries/exits for smooth flow of traffic. The office of the district town planner (DTP) had received a representation from the RWA president, A-Block, Palam Vihar, Sector 2, requesting eight security gates, and the officials allowed the same. Palms apartments in South City 1 and Sector 30 were allowed to install one and three gates, respectively.Nirvana Country Residents' Welfare Association had requested for one security gate on the revenue road behind the S block of Nirvana County, South City 2, but the committee decided not to allow the same.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/7-townships-get-dtcp-nod-to-install-gates-guards-cctv-cams-a-must/articleshow/88699133.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Noida||New data centres to get space advantage||Greater Noida: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has decided to offer a higher floor area ratio and ground coverage of its plots to companies interested in setting up data centres.Officials said the Authority would not only increase the FAR from 2 to 3, but also allow 60% of the ground coverage against 40% earlier. They said YEIDA would allow 40-50% increased USE of land off the Yamuna Expressway than what is being offered to other industrial units. A floor area ratio of 2 means an allottee can build 2,000 sqmt of floor space vertically over a 1,000 sqmt plot.Arvind Kumar, additional chief secretary (industrial development) and YEIDA chairperson, said the state government had on September 24 last year framed a policy for companies setting up data centres and tweaked some of the building bylaws.The government is ready to offer up to 7% of capital subsidy for 10 years, interest subsidy for seven years, complete stamp duty exemption on the first transaction and electricity duty exemption for 10 years, among other benefits. Although increased FAR will allow buildings to grow vertically, their height will be restricted to 24 metres because the area is close to the upcoming Noida airport, YEIDA chief executive officer Arun Vir Singh said.YEIDA’s decision to allow more land use is likely to give it an edge over the two other authorities — Noida and Greater Noida. YEIDA, officials said, is planning to earmark Sector 28 for developing data centres and other such facilities and has reserved 100 acres initially. The size of the plots that will be offered will vary between 5 and 10 acres.“While incentives are likely to be the same for data centres operating out of Noida, Greater Noida and other parts of the state, higher use of the plot area will definitely attract companies towards the Yamuna Expressway region,” Singh said. Over the past two years, Noida and Greater Noida have attracted several domestic and international players. Adani Group and Hiranandani have taken plots in the cities to set up data centres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/new-data-centres-to-get-space-advantage/articleshow/88699134.cms||---

During routine public meetings with residents of Greater Noida (West), officials from GNIDA were apprised of a low water supply in C and D blocks of Sector 2 in Greater Noida. “The problem has persisted since long for the residents of these blocks as during supply time they are unable to store adequate water for their daily needs due to low pressure,” said a resident from the sector. Subsequently, a team from the water department led by senior manager of GNIDA Kapil Dev Singh inspected the sector and decided to lay a pipeline for about 50 metres from the water tank for blocks C and D of the sector. “The work of laying the pipeline from the water tank in the area is in progress. It will take about a month to complete the work. This will solve the problem of low-pressure supply for the two blocks,” said Singh.Apart from this, residents of Greater Noida (West) also demanded the opening of an Aadhaar card centre, repair of Balak Inter College auditorium and removal of illegal market around Gaur City area. ACEO Amandeep Duli assured to implement their demands as per rules at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/an-additional-pipeline-may-solve-water-woes-in-sec-2/articleshow/88699135.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

However, farmers on Tuesday refused to leave the protest site without any written assurance from NPCL. More farmers arrived at the site in their tractor-trolleys and started a panchayat at 11 am on Tuesday. With no agreement in sight, the farmers decided to lock up a second NPCL office in Alpha 2 around 2 pm."As reports of our decision to lock up the second office reached the NPCL officials, NPCL DGM (deputy general manager) Subodh Tyagi, ACP Brijnanadan Rai reached the spot and assured to hand over a written assurance," said a farmer at the protest site.Later, in a statement signed by the NPCL DGM, the discom told the farmers that their demands, including flat billing for farmer households and doing away with meter billings of electricity used in fields, will be sent to Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC). The protesting farmers had also demanded that the FIRs lodged against them for power theft be withdrawn.

One of the accused, arrested from Sector 168, worked as a delivery boy with Swiggy and police said that the company officials would face questioning about hiring a man without verification.The Sector 168 shootout took place on Monday night. "Checking was on near the Sector 168 police post. During the checking, we spotted two suspicious men on a bike. We asked them to stop, but they tried to flee. A team chased them, but they opened fire on the police party,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.During retaliation, cops inflicted a bullet injury on one accused, arrested later, but the other fled the scene. “The arrested accused is Vikas Chauhan, a native of Aligarh. Chauhan carried a reward of Rs 10,000 on his arrest for an earlier case and had been absconding for the past three years,” Singh said. Chauhan, he added, had been working as a delivery boy for the past few months. “We are going to question the company officials on how they hired someone without getting a verification or background check done. If they are hiring people without verification, they can put the lives of common people at risk,” he said.Chauhan had joined Swiggy on Dec 20, 2021, sources said.When contacted, a Swiggy official said, “The safety of the Swiggy platform and our customers is our top priority and we work closely with reputed third-party vendors to conduct background checks. We are continually working to strengthen these systems. We will extend our full support to the investigating authorities on this matter.” The second shootout took place in Ecotech 3 on Tuesday morning. "We were carrying out a routine check and spotted a suspicious motorcycle with two people and signalled them to stop. However, they opened fire at the police party," said Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police. After a brief shootout, cops arrested the duo.

TOI had on Monday reported how the 20-year-old lifeline between Noida and Delhi had been reduced to a pothole-ridden road due to lack of maintenance.The Noida Authority, which had called the DND management for a meeting last week, on Tuesday said that they have "nudged" the Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited (NTBCL) to pace up the maintenance work on the crucial link. “They have been pressured by the Noida Authority to carry out the maintenance work,” a senior official said. Jyotsna Yadav, the Authority’s officer-on-special duty, said a letter was shot off to the toll bridge company where they were asked to carry out the maintenance work properly as the condition of the road was “not up to the mark”. “A meeting was held with them about eight to 10 days back,” she said.An NTBCL official, however, told TOI that the work was “a part of the normal maintenance”. “This is not at the behest of anybody but it is a routine work being carried out as per the mandate that has been given to us,” the official said.Another official claimed that they had started replacing the dysfunctional streetlights on the loops and would repair such lights on the entire flyway.Commuters, however, claimed that the DND flyway needed major repairs and the hurried patchwork would not help much. “Filling up potholes and replacing streetlights is routine work but we need to ensure all the work is completed. The damaged toilets and signboards are still the same,” Rakesh Jha, a commuter, said.Noida-resident Brajesh Sharma, who commutes via the DND flyway regularly, told TOI that only the broken patches and the potholes were being filled even as the road required proper resurfacing. “The road needs proper resurfacing and not such minor fixes. Directional markings and repair of toilets are still pending,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/after-toi-report-work-begins-to-repair-dnd-potholes-fix-lights/articleshow/88699138.cms||---

He will distribute laptops among meritorious students of Noida and five other districts of Meerut division. The industrial development authorities, however, aren’t willing to miss out on the opportunity. They are gearing up to launch a few big ticket projects that day. At the main auditorium of Gautam Buddha University in Greater Noida, around 500 students from Noida and the other districts will participate in the event. Of them, five to six students will be called to the dais and felicitated by the chief minister. A total of 2,000 laptops will be distributed among students of Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat. “Some of these students will be called to the dais while others will get their machines later in the day,” said Meerut commissioner Surendra Singh. Officials said a higher number of laptops — around 500 — would be given to students from Noida and Greater Noida in keeping with the higher population. Meanwhile, the three authorities are vying with each other for the launch of their key projects. Officials in the Noida Authority said they had finalised 15 projects worth more than Rs 350 crore for launch on Thursday. These projects include the Noida city bus terminal in Sector 82, underpass at the intersection of sectors 51 and 71, a mini stadium in Sarfabad, a park in Sector 117, among others. Similarly, the Greater Noida Authority is gearing up for the Ganga water supply project. Officials in the authority said a plaque with details of the project engraved on it would be unveiled and installed at its facility in Jaitpur. The supply of Ganga water to households in the entire city could take a few more days, the officials added. Officials in the Yamuna Expressway Authority are also finalising the list of their projects that could be unveiled that day. Ahead of the chief minister’s visit, five new police stations in Noida will start functioning from the existing police outposts till the dedicated buildings are complete. Sources said Adityanath might even inaugurate these. While land has been allocated for the new police stations, the construction of buildings is yet to start. Since the chief minister is likely to arrive at the university in a helicopter, officials were yet to finalise the route plan.

A case has been registered against the employer.Purnima (28), a resident of Ghaziabad, had visited her employer’s flat in Panchsheel Greens on Monday evening and asked for her pending salary. “She was on leave for the past 3-4 days. On Monday evening, she went to ask for her salary but her employer, Sangeeta, started shouting at her. The two had a heated argument and Sangeeta was believed to have slapped Purnima,” said a senior officer of Bisrakh police station. Purnima, police said, had been working at Sangeeta’s house for the past two months but had allegedly not been paid for so long. Sangeeta has a six-month-old baby.“On Tuesday morning, a group of domestic staffers gathered outside the society and staged a protest against the attack on Purnima. A call from the society management was made to the police station and a team was rushed to the spot. The two parties reached a settlement and Purnima was given her pending dues. The employer also apologised for her behaviour,” the police officer said.Purnima, however, went ahead and lodged a complaint against her employer for allegedly slapping her. “Based on the complaint, we have registered a case against Sangeeta under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC. An investigation is underway,” he said. A dispute between a domestic staffer and her employer had taken a violent turn in July 2017. A 300-strong mob armed with sticks and stones had stormed Mahagun Moderne society in Sector 78, believing one of their neighbours — a 30-year old woman who worked as a help in one of the flats — had been held captive and thrashed by her employer after being accused of theft.The mob had not only vandalised a flat and the society’s guard room, but also hurled stones. One of the guards had to fire in the air to disperse the mob as the police took around two hours to reach.The employer’s family hid in the washroom during the hour-long violence. They denied assaulting the domestic staffer. A total of 13 persons were arrested the next day in connection with the violence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/protest-outside-condo-after-domestic-staffer-is-slapped/articleshow/88699142.cms||---

This is marginally higher than the 3,100 and 9,900 doses administered a day ago in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad.Harish Sharma, a class X student and a resident of Kavi Nagar, who took the first dose on Tuesday, said he was happy to finally get the jab. “We have been waiting for the vaccination drive for a long time. Ever since the Covid pandemic broke out in March 2020, our studies have been hit badly. After vaccination, we should be able to return to school.”In Ghaziabad, the health department expects to complete vaccinating over 2.3 lakh adolescents in the 15+ category by January 10. Thereafter, the district will start administering booster doses to health and frontline workers and beneficiaries aged above 60 years.Meanwhile, with fewer students turning up at schools for vaccination, compared to health centres, Ghaziabad health department is planning to write to the education department urging it to exhort children to take the jabs at their schools, vaccination nodal officer Dr GP Mathuria said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/day-2-12k-teens-jabbed-in-gzb/articleshow/88699144.cms||Aditya Dev

On Tuesday, the district also registered 140 new infections, while neighbouring Ghaziabad added 182 cases. According to GB Nagar health officials, the patient, a resident of Sector 137, had developed a fever after he had attended a programme organised by his office, a private firm in Gurgaon, on December 16. A Covid test, conducted by a private lab, had found him positive for the infection on December 21 and he had since been in home isolation, officials said. While the patient tested negative on December 28, a genome sequencing report confirmed that he had been infected with the new variant two days later, health officials said. On Tuesday, chief medical officer Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma confirmed that the report had been conveyed to the health department on December 30. The officer added that the patient had now fully recovered and his wife, who was his primary contact, had also tested negative for the infection. “The patient’s home in a high-rise apartment was earmarked as a micro-containment zone soon after he had tested positive. Health officials have also traced and tested his contacts as per protocol,” Sharma told TOI. Officials said the patient did not have a travel history and was fully vaccinated. On December 17, Ghaziabad had reported its first Omicron cases when an elderly couple — a 69-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife, residents of Nehru Nagar, was found to be infected with the highly contagious variant. At least 26 cases of Omicron have been reported across the state so far. Meanwhile, with 140 fresh Covid cases GB Nagar’s January tally breached the 400-mark to stand at 406, which is the highest since July last year when a total of 156 cases were recorded. Ghaziabad, too, has reported 405 cases in January so far, the highest since June (324 cases) last year. Currently, there are 597 active cases in GB Nagar and 560 in Ghaziabad. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “The district administration is following the state’s order of testing and tracking Covid patients and admitting serious patients to hospitals. However, the hospitalization in the present scenario is nil. The night curfew is already in place and people are being asked to strictly Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noidas-first-omicron-patient-man-who-attended-office-event-fell-sick/articleshow/88699145.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Mumbai||Dalit-Muslim outreach seen in Delhi govt advert||Mumbai: An advertisement by the Delhi government has stoked a debate on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s attempt to reach out to both Dalits and Muslims. January 3 was 19th century social reformer, Dalit icon and girl education activist Savitribai Phule’s birth anniversary. The AAP government commemorated it through the advertisement which, however, also featured Fatima Sheikh, who was a neighbour and associate of Savitribai and her husband, Jyotirao Phule, in Pune. They pioneered girls’ education in India. Sheikh’s birth anniversary is on January 9.At a time when Muslims feel their icons are being ignored -- exclusion of freedom fighter and first education minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad from the official ‘Azadi Ka 75th Mahotsav’ poster is being cited as the latest example — remembering activist Fatima Sheikh in the same breath as Savitribai is being seen as Kejriwal making extra efforts to woo Muslim voters.Kejriwal’s party had posted a landslide victory in February 2020, partly because Muslims virtually deserted Congress and backed AAP overwhelmingly. But, of late, there has been an impression that Kejriwal is perhaps playing a soft Hindutva card. Some observers feel that recognition of Fatima Sheikh, though belated, by a chief minister might persuade other non-BJP states to accord her similar recognition. “It is commendable that both Savitribai and Fatima Sheikh have been acknowledged together. You couldn’t have thought of Savitribai without Fatima Sheikh as they complimented each other,” said senior commentator Jatin Desai. Desai agreed that while a lot has been done to commemorate Savitribai—the Pune University has been renamed as Savitribai Phule Pune University and the Maharashtra government runs welfare schemes for girls in her name—Fatima Sheikh has been largely ignored.Former head of the Mahatma Phule chair at Savitribai Phule Pune University, Professor Hari Narke, saw the reason for marginalization of Fatima Sheikh, both by social historians and successive governments, as a sign of the country’s collective amnesia towards those who didn’t leave inheritors of their legacy.“First Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar hailed Jyotirao Phule as his teacher and in his writings and speeches acknowledged the things he learnt from Mahatma Phule. Secondly, Sahu Maharaj and Sayaji Rao of Baroda state patronized teachings of Mahatma Phule and Savitribai. Thirdly, Mahatma Gandhi publicly said the actual Mahatma was Phule though people lovingly called him (Gandhi) Mahatma,” explained Narke, who has researched and written extensively on the life of the Phules.Narke added that, except for social reformer Hamid Dalwai, no major Muslim leader tried to highlight Fatima Sheikh’s contributions. Significantly, when Jyotirao’s father turned him and his wife Savitribai out of his house because of their progressive and reformist ideas, it was Fatima Sheikh and her brother, Usman Sheikh, who sheltered them in their house in Pune. It is at the Sheikhs’ house that the first school for girls was started. Both Jyotirao and Savitribai acknowledged the services of Fatima Sheikh. In the letters that Savitribai wrote to her husband, she said that she could not have done her work without the support of Fatima Sheikh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dalit-muslim-outreach-seen-in-delhi-govt-advert/articleshow/88699147.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bengaluru man led police to Bulli Bai ‘mastermind’ in Uttarakhand||MUMBAI/DEHRADUN/ BENGALURU: A day after nabbing a Bihar youth studying in Bengaluru, the Mumbai cybercrime police, probing the ‘Bulli Bai’ app, arrested an 18-year-old key accused from Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district on Tuesday. Police are probing the teen, who’s preparing for engineering entrance exams, is the mastermind and created the app on which doctored photos of at least 100 prominent Muslim women were uploaded for ‘auction’. She was arrested based on the information provided by Vishal Kumar Jha (21), the Bengaluru engineering student, sources said. “During preliminary inquiry by Mumbai police, she claimed she created the fake Twitter account, jattkhalsa07, on instructions from a social media friend, a Nepal resident identified as Giyou. The account was used to post contents on ‘Bulli Bai’ app,” said Uttarakhand police spokesperson DIG Senthil A Krishna Raj. Bulli Bai: Uttarakhand girl was in touch with Vishal Kumar Jha, say Mumbai copsRudrapur city SP Mamta Bohra said Singh was in touch with Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a Bihar studying engineering in Bengaluru who was earlier arrested in the case. “Singh was connected with people behind the website (app) for past six months. They follow the same ideology that has led to this hate crime. She was continuously posting hate comments. Her handle on Twitter, jattkhalsa07, was involved in the crime of posting with wrong intentions objectionable photos of several celebrities and social media activists,” Bohra said. Singh, who has cleared her class XII, was produced before a local court that placed her on transit remand till January 5. “An additional team of the cyber cell arrived Tuesday night to take her to Mumbai,” Bohra added. Mumbai Police had registered an FIR in the ‘Bulli Bai’ case on January 1. The woman had lost her father, Anandpal, to Covid last year and her mother to cancer in 2011. She is second among three sisters—one is a commerce graduate and the other is in class X. She also has a brother who is in class VIII. The siblings survive on the Rs 3,000 they receive from the Vatsalya Yojana launched for Covid orphans in Uttarakhand and Rs 10,000 from the solar manufacturing unit where their father was employed. About Jha, a Bengaluru IPS officer said, “He uploaded objectionable pictures using his mobile and laptop. It looks like he is not the creator of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app. He has been uploading pictures of women from Muslim community and editing them.” On Tuesday, Jha was produced before the Bandra court in Mumbai, which remanded him in police custody till January 10. The court also granted permission to carry out searches at Jha’s room located near his college in Bengaluru. Jha’s lawyer Dinesh Prajapati told TOI that his client has been falsely implicated in the case and had no role to play in the creation of the app or any fake accounts. He denied that Jha knew Singh. The college authorities told TOI that Jha had called the institution on Monday, stating that the police had been calling him and he had “not done anything wrong”. An average student, he had an attendance of 63% On Monday, Maharashtra minister of state for home and information technology Satej Patil tweeted: “There seems to be a much bigger network behind such coordinated crimes and I am confident that Mumbai police will soon unearth the entire nexus that is enabling such hate crimes against women in our country.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-18-yr-old-girl-the-alleged-mastermind-held/articleshow/88699151.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The state must increase its speed of preparedness to avoid a rush tomorrow,” said Pawar, speaking after reviewing the Covid situation and the state’s preparedness. The surge in Mumbai is a worry and steps should be taken to curb the spread immediately. The Centre has left the decision on imposing restrictions like declaring micro containment zones to the states, she added. “Even before the states asked the Centre provided special funds, right from setting up of ICU beds to oxygen supply; now it is the responsibility of the states to ensure active management. I have not received a single letter from any minister in the state, saying they have not been given what they have demanded. I also represent Maharashtra and if there is any problem, they can approach me,” said Pawar. The state government had last week sought funds for hiring human resources under the National Health Mission and additional vaccine doses for the 15-17 age group and ‘booster’ doses for frontline workers and the elderly with co-morbidities from January 10. “If some minister gives me in writing what they have demanded and what the Centre has not given, it will be better. The question will arise regarding the budget given to the state and how it has been spent,” she added. State health minister Rajesh Tope said with a forecast of 80 lakh cases in the third wave, the requirement of human resources is significant. “I have raised the issue with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya regarding funds for hiring human resources. Currently, the Centre is only covering HR required for ICU management. With Maharashtra reporting a significant surge in cases, we will need more manpower in Covid centres and other hospitals too,” said Tope.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/centre-gave-funds-state-slow-in-preparing-min/articleshow/88699154.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Omicron cases 40 for second day, behind 80% infections, says IS Chahal||MUMBAI: The Omicron variant of SARS-Cov-2 is likely to be responsible for almost 80% of the current cases in the city and could grow bigger, civic chief IS Chahal said on Tuesday. His statement comes in the wake of Mumbai reporting 40 new Omicron cases for the second straight day. Maharashtra added 75 new cases of the highly transmissible variant on Tuesday, taking its overall count to 653. Mumbai’s tally of confirmed Omicron cases increased to 408, including non-residents who have tested positive at the international airport. Of the state’s Omicron cases, 259 have been discharged following a negative RTPCR test. Of the 75 new cases, 40 have been reported from Mumbai, nine from Thane, eight from Pune, five from Panvel, three each from Kolhapur and Nagpur, among others. The BMC said of the 40 new cases, four individuals didn’t have a travel history, suggesting local transmission. Three were fully vaccinated. While two are mildly symptomatic, the other two don’t have any symptoms. All four are hospitalised and stable. In a television interview, Chahal said he has been taking inputs from experts and members of the Covid task force who have told him that Omicron is the dominant variant now. “Experts tell me that Omicron is now making up 80% of the cases and the Delta variant is now reduced to 20% from its earlier existence. This 80% may also touch 90% in the next 5-7 days. Delta did not have the capacity to move from 3,000 to 8,000 cases in 24 hours,” said Chahal. The seventh round of genome sequencing last week had found 55% Omicron spread in the city, while the rest was mainly Delta and its lineages. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the task force, said Omicron was fast replacing Delta in Mumbai. “However, this transition phase can be crucial and that’s where it is important to watch out for the symptoms and severity,” he said. His advice to hospitals is to focus on those with symptoms who have a potential to deteriorate early.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/omicron-cases-40-for-2nd-day-behind-80-infections-chahal/articleshow/88699155.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Officials said currently there are 60 confirmed patients on board as six other patients had disembarked in Goa. The ship had 1,400-odd persons on board and was sent back at 11.30pm on Monday from the Mormugao cruise terminal in Goa as passengers were not allowed to disembark from the ship there. It reached Mumbai around 6.30pm on Tuesday . Assistant municipal commissioner Shivdas Gurav, in charge of the A Ward, said for all the positive patients, an ambulance will be sent to Green Gate in south Mumbai’s Ballard Pier area to shift them to either the BMC’s Richardson and Cruddas facility in Byculla or paid quarantine facilities as per their choice. All the other passengers are to stay put on the cruise ship till their RT-PCR tests are conducted by two laboratories. Their reports are expected on Wednesday at 9am. “Only once the reports are in, will disembarking of negative patients begin. Those negative will be stamped for seven-day home isolation,” said the BMC in a statement. Jurgen Bailom, CEO and president, Waterways Leisure Tourism, said in a press statement: “All guests who have tested positive are asymptomatic. I would also like to highlight that it was Cordelia Cruise’s exemplary proactiveness in not only conducting the rapid antigen test but also very responsibly informing the concerned authorities of the incident. One may hence mindfully arrive at the conjecture that the guests who have tested positive as of this morning were already infected with the virus prior to boarding. However, their tests showed otherwise, hence they were permitted on board. We are aware of several similar incidents on flights and trains. These are unfortunate and unexpected despite everyone taking utmost care.” The ship had left for Goa last weekend and during the journey one crew member showed flu-like symptoms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/no-one-can-leave-ship-with-60-cases-till-rest-are-tested/articleshow/88699156.cms||Richa Pinto

The BMC on Monday directed students from classes 1-9 and 11 to get back to e-learning this month. On Tuesday while students logged in from their homes, many schools asked teachers to get to empty classrooms and teach students online. “We have been coming to school since October when higher secondary students started attending physical classrooms. With rising cases we too should be allowed to teach from home,” said a class 7 teacher who travels from Mira Road to her Vile Parle school. Schools with smartboards feel that it is easier for teachers to be in the class and teach children online. “Teaching online from the classroom is more streamlined, especially as the number of students logging in is huge,” said the principal of a Chembur school. However, primary teachers said they can conduct classes from home instead of spending hours travelling to school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/with-classes-online-teachers-question-need-to-go-to-school/articleshow/88699157.cms||Sandhya Nair

Fresh cases in the state have doubled from 9,000 to 18,000 in three days. Mumbai, in all probability, will cross its second wave peak detection of 11,206 cases in the next 24 hours. Since the day the second wave surge had started, it had taken the city almost 50 days to reach the 11,000 mark. In the third wave, the level is likely to be breached in about 15 days. Senior officials said the state may impose curbs on restaurant and mall timings, on places of worship and on attendance in government and private offices. The government is mulling allowing restaurants and malls to stay open only till 8pm and shutting down places of worship as there is no implementation of crowd control measures in these areas. “We will take a complete review. The Central government has also reduced attendance in its offices to 50%. All these measures will be discussed and sent to the CM for finalising,” Ajit Pawar said in Pune. Senior officials said some felt curbs should be largely for cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune reporting a high positivity rate. There are many districts still reporting cases in single digits. “Why should they suffer ahead of time,” said an official. Tope said there is no requirement or even a discussion on imposing a lockdown as there are parameters like bed occupancy or oxygen use for a lockdown and the state is nowhere close to threshold level. “However, to ensure that cases do not reach that level, if need be, stricter restrictions may be added,” he said. Daily Covid hospitalisations in Mumbai increased by 45% on Tuesday compared to Monday. There were 834 hospitalisations, while on Monday there were 574, and the day prior, 503. Nearly one-fifth of ICU beds (507 of 2,577) were occupied by Tuesday. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nesco jumbo centre, said their ICU patient count went up from 20 to 48, while ward patients increased from 500 to 700 in a day. The centre is preparing to open another hall by Wednesday. While civic officials said of the new cases, 89% were asymptomatic, many took to social media to question why Mumbai was witnessing a sharp rise in hospital admissions if the majority were asymptomatic patients. AMC Suresh Kakani said people with comorbidities prefer to get hospitalised for better results. BMC has also got requests from individuals who didn’t have a support system at home. An elderly couple, for instance, preferred to get hospitalised after testing positive, Kakani said. “But duration of hospital stay is between 3-4 days. Most are symptoms-free by then and want to go home,” he said. Meanwhile, officials are certain Omicron is the predominant strain in the city. “We may scale down genome sequencing to some extent as we know Omicron is circulating in the community,” Kakani said. The total caseload in the state is now 67.3 lakh, with 1,41,573 deaths. Active cases in the state surged to 66,308. Cases in MMR too reported a surge. Navi Mumbai saw 1,072 cases, superseding the previous highest of 523 on Sunday. Cases in rural Thane surged to 151 from 46.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-likely-to-cross-2nd-waves-peak-of-11206-daily-cases-today/articleshow/88699159.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||As home Covid-19 testing surges, thousands of results may be going unreported in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Thousands of Covid self-test results could be going unreported in the city as scores opt for the convenient at-home testing kits over the more reliable RT-PCR tests but don’t relay the results to the health authorities. This has given rise to concerns of undercounting or missing cases in big numbers.  Latest BMC data bears testimony to that. According to it, barely 18,000 (17,841) self-test results were reported to them in December. Incidentally, similar numbers were reported in August when the city was going through a Covid lull. Three kinds of self-test kits are widely available in the market currently—Coviself by Mylab, Covifind by Meril and Panbio by Abbott. Interestingly, Mylab alone has sold 25,000 kits in Mumbai in December. Data for Panbio and Meril couldn’t be obtained. Read AlsoOmicron sibling can't be detected by imported RT-PCR kits: ExpertsThe elusive sibling (sub-lineage) of the Omicron variant, BA.2, cannot be picked up by the imported RT-PCR kit having an S gene drop, researchers involved in tracking the virus in India said on Sunday. Local chemists corroborated that Covid self-test kits are among their hottest selling products since cases began to surge in December-end. “We are selling 200-300 kits in a day. On certain days, we have sold more than 400 kits. The demand was such that there was a stockout for a few days, but we have received fresh stocks now,” said Ranjit Ranawat, owner of Red Rose Chemist in south Mumbai. He said a dozen chemist shops around him have seen the same frenzy. Read AlsoHealth ministry issues revised guidelines for home isolation of mild, asymptomatic Covid-19 patients: Key pointsUnion health ministry on Wednesday issued revised guidelines for home isolation of mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. In its updated guideline, the ministry has clarified the criteria, precautions that need to be followed by such patients and their families, signs that require monitoring andHasmukh Rawal, MD of Mylab Discovery Solutions, said they have witnessed a 200% jump in sales of self-test kit in December compared to November. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have seen the highest demand. “Mumbai followed by Delhi and Kolkata are the biggest buyers of self-test kits,” he said, adding CoviSelf can detect major variants, including Omicron. Coronavirus live updates At-home kits rely on self-reporting and don’t have a foolproof mechanism for reporting the results to authorities. The kits don’t require a prescription and are available online and in chemist stores. The cost of a pack varies from Rs 250 to Rs 325. While all the manufacturers have built an app where the users are supposed to upload their reports, that step is evidently skipped by many. “Several people don’t want to undergo an RT-PCR test as it is mandatory for laboratories to upload their reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research website and inform local authorities,” said a ward official. Once an individual comes positive, an entire set of civic protocols is set in motion. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said they will find out if people are avoiding reporting their results.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/as-home-testing-surges-thousands-of-results-may-be-going-unreported/articleshow/88699160.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Goregaon boy tops CAT with 100 percentile||MUMBAI: A change of course was never on Chirag Gupta’s mind. He gave up his IIT Kharagpur seat to pursue his passion in physics. But after a deep immersion in physics for almost five years, about 18 months ago, Gupta while conducting a physics project woke up to the harsh reality that he did not want to do physics for the rest of his life. Today, the highest CAT scorer, Gupta aced the competitive exam with his 100 percentile. In the elite club of nine cent percentilers, he bagged the highest score. A student of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, Gupta enrolled for an integrated five-year-long BS.MS programme from IISER, Pune, and graduates in May. His earlier plans were to pursue a PhD in physics. CAT 2021 results were released on late Monday evening. “I did a lot of physics projects. But about a year and a half ago, I felt this was not clicking. I am not as interested as I was when I joined IISER. I did a lot of research and opted for a career change to consulting,” he said. “There is always a certain bit of anxiety when you take such a drastic step. But in my case, it was easier as my family and friends were supportive,” said the resident of Goregaon who prepared for the test on his own. Preparation for the CAT was tough. “I had forgotten all the math formulae and had to go back to all my class XII books. After a while, it all started coming back to me. I would tell CAT aspirants to take as many mocks as they can if they want to crack the exam. In the case of verbal, people make the mistake of reading philosophy and psychology books. But they are boring. I started by reading novels,” said Gupta. But it was another deeper strategy that helped him in the exam. “Every time I took a mock test, I would not start attempting the paper for the first 15 minutes. This was meant to build more pressure. Last, always attempt the data interpretation questions even if they take more time, it is possible to arrive at an answer,” he said. Another dual degree mechanical engineering student of IIT Bombay Yash Mandhana who scored a 99.99 percentile credited his score to him being consistent with his preparation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/goregaon-boy-tops-cat-with-100-percentile/articleshow/88699161.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||15-17 vaccination marginally up on Day 2; 9,000 teens get shots in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Adolescent vaccination in the state and the city picked up marginally on Tuesday after a poor show on the first day.  Across Maharashtra, 2.5 lakh children in the age group of 15 to 17 years took the Covid-19 shots on Tuesday, up from a 1.8 lakh turnout on Monday. In Mumbai, 8,995 children got vaccinated on Tuesday, higher than Monday’s turnout of 6,115. The state’s target population for the age group is 60.6 lakh, while Mumbai’s is around 10% of that. In the two days, the state has vaccinated 4.36 lakh children, while Mumbai has covered 15,110.  Within Maharashtra, Thane district has vaccinated 48,088 children, while Pune has given shots to 44,270 in the past two days. Districts such as Sangli and Nagpur vaccinated more than 30,000 and 20,000 children, respectively.  BMC officials said that since adolescent vaccination is being carried out at designated BMC hospitals away from school and college campuses, their turnout has been low. Municipal schools have been linked with their nearest jumbo centres for vaccination. “We plan to expand the drive from next week and take it to campuses. There is a lot of enthusiasm right now. We want to take advantage of that and finish vaccinating the entire lot at the earliest,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Unlike other districts, Mumbai has not started vaccination centres on school and colleges premises on the advice of the state Covid taskforce that said it could pose a challenge in handling adverse events.  Meanwhile, the share of adult vaccination appears to have slowed down further in the state. On Tuesday, 7,58,809 doses were administered in Maharashtra, of which a third was in the age group of 15-17 years. The state had managed to cover around 88% with the first dose and 58% with both the doses before the end of the year.  Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the focus remains on vaccinating both adults as well as children. He said the state has adequate doses of Covaxin (more than 45 lakh) and more have been requested from the Centre to cover the adolescent drive in the shortest possible time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/15-17-vaccination-marginally-up-on-day-2-9000-teens-get-shots-in-city/articleshow/88699162.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Further curbs in Mumbai if daily Covid cases cross 20,000, says BMC chief I S Chahal||MUMBAI: With Covid case numbers increasing in Mumbai, BMC chief I S Chahal said on Tuesday that if daily cases in the city cross 20,000, the civic body may consider placing further restrictions. Chahal, in an interview with a TV channel, also said that in a meeting with the chief minister on December 30, the general consensus was that instead of positivity being the benchmark for placing restrictions or a harsh kind of a semi-lockdown, the new yardstick should be hospital bed availability, vacancy and oxygen requirement. “In the last few days, when cases in Mumbai went up from 3,000 to 8,000 per day, there has not been added stress on these two factors, namely oxygenated beds and ICU beds,” said Chahal, adding that the strategy will be reviewed on a weekly basis. The civic chief also pointed that while the BMC was keeping a strict watch on people coming from ‘at risk’ countries, the almost 5,000 ‘non-risk’ country passengers every day could also be carriers of the Omicron variant. “We have flights coming from all over the world into Mumbai airport, and as of now, we are having 43 flights coming into Mumbai daily. Of the 200-odd countries in the world, there are only 56 countries which are ‘at risk’, while another 100-odd are in the ‘non-risk’ category. For these non-risk countries there is no home quarantine prescribed as per the government of India guidelines if they have a negative RT-PCR report. We do only 5% of random sampling, so the assumption that Omicron cannot come from non-risk countries could not be true,” he said, adding that the city was in the beginning of the third wave. He said that from December 21, 2021, the city’s positivity rate has been ascending, so it was amply clear that a wave is building up, but it is difficult to predict at which stage we are. “However, even if we get 20,000 positive cases in a day and 5% average positive cases continue to require a hospital bed daily, the BMC would be able to manage. Luckily, the Omicron virus has a cycle of 5-7 days, so in 10 days we will need 10,000 hospital beds at that rate. So even if 20,000 cases come per day, Mumbai will not cross more than 12,000 occupied beds,” said Chahal. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar meanwhile said that the fight against the novel coronavirus has not ended. “None of us want a lockdown, but then we all need to ensure we follow Covid-appropriate behavior so that there is no need for it (lockdown) to be implemented,” Pednekar said. Pednekar was quoted by PTI as saying that if the daily cases here cross the 20,000-mark, a lockdown will be imposed in the city as per the Union government’s rules. She was talking to reporters at the BMC headquarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/further-curbs-in-mum-if-daily-cases-cross-20000-bmc-chief/articleshow/88699163.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Bulli Bai: Uttarakhand girl was in touch with Vishal Kumar Jha, say Mumbai cops||MUMBAI/DEHRADUN/ BENGALURU: The Mumbai cybercrime police, probing the ‘Bulli Bai’ app case, arrested an 18-year-old key accused from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district on Tuesday. Rudrapur city SP Mamta Bohra said the accused was in touch with Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a Bihar studying engineering in Bengaluru who was earlier arrested in the case. “The accused was connected with people behind the website (app) for past six months. They follow the same ideology that has led to this hate crime. She was continuously posting hate comments. Her handle on Twitter, jattkhalsa07, was involved in the crime of posting with wrong intentions objectionable photos of several celebrities and social media activists,” Bohra said. The accused, who has cleared her class XII, was produced before a local court that placed her on transit remand till January 5. “An additional team of the cyber cell arrived Tuesday night to take her to Mumbai,” Bohra added. Mumbai Police had registered an FIR in the ‘Bulli Bai’ case on January 1. The accused had lost her father, Anandpal, to Covid last year and her mother to cancer in 2011. She is second among three sisters—one is a commerce graduate and the other is in class X. She also has a brother who is in class VIII. The siblings survive on the Rs 3,000 they receive from the Vatsalya Yojana launched for Covid orphans in Uttarakhand and Rs 10,000 from the solar manufacturing unit where their father was employed. About Jha, a Bengaluru IPS officer said, “He uploaded objectionable pictures using his mobile and laptop. It looks like he is not the creator of the ‘Bulli Bai’ app. He has been uploading pictures of women from Muslim community and editing them.” On Tuesday, Jha was produced before the Bandra court in Mumbai, which remanded him in police custody till January 10. The court also granted permission to carry out searches at Jha’s room located near his college in Bengaluru. Jha’s lawyer Dinesh Prajapati told TOI that his client has been falsely implicated in the case and had no role to play in the creation of the app or any fake accounts. He denied that Jha knew the accused. The college authorities told TOI that Jha had called the institution on Monday, stating that the police had been calling him and he had “not done anything wrong”. An average student, he had an attendance of 63% On Monday, Maharashtra minister of state for home and information technology Satej Patil tweeted: “There seems to be a much bigger network behind such coordinated crimes and I am confident that Mumbai police will soon unearth the entire nexus that is enabling such hate crimes against women in our country.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-ukhand-girl-was-in-touch-with-jha-say-cops/articleshow/88699164.cms||Gaurav Talwar

A decision regarding moving college and university lectures online will be taken on Wednesday, Samant posted on social media. In view of increasing cases in Mumbai and in the state, attendance in colleges had dropped after the winter break. The minister met divisional commissioners, all district collectors and vice-chancellors on Tuesday, and added that an announcement regarding colleges will be made at 4pm on Wednesday. An official said most vice-chancellors were keen on moving to online classes due to the spike in cases. The minister is likely to discuss the feedback received from officials with the chief minister before making it public. When hybrid classes commenced in November, attendance in most city colleges did not exceed 30%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/decision-on-switching-to-e-lectures-for-univs-today/articleshow/88699165.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC plans tree house with sea view in Bandra||MUMBAI: After appointing a contractor for the construction of the Rs 22-crore elevated treetop walkway at Malabar Hill, the BMC is now keen to add one more tourist attraction in the city—a tree house in a garden in Bandra (W) with an unrestricted view of the Arabian Sea. On Tuesday, the civic body floated an expression of interest for the Rs 1-crore tree house project to be made on the lines of the popular Old Woman’s Shoe at Malabar Hill’s Kamala Nehru Garden. The tree house project, a brainchild of cabinet minister and guardian minister of Mumbai suburbs Aaditya Thackeray, is being implemented through the city’s planning department. “The funds for implementing the project will be from the district planning development committee (DPDC); BMC is only the executing agency,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal co-mmissioner in charge of the planning department. “The garden, located near Bandra fort, falls under jurisdiction of the maritime board, hence we are taking all mandatory no-objection certificates before initiating work.” Officials said that the structure will be constructed out of wooden material with restricted use of cement. “The concept of a tree house is popular among tourists world over. Since Mumbai does not have one, it was decided to build a two-storey tree house, that too with a grand sea view, in a prominent area in the suburbs,” said Dighavkar, adding that they are exploring the option of using the trees on the plot for the project. Civic officials said that the tree house would be a recreational facility constructed out of wooden material and restricted use of cement. Nidhi Chaudhari, Mumbai suburban collector, said, “The DPDC has approved some innovative projects for improving the quality of life and aesthetics in Mumbai suburban district, including the tree house. The BMC has been given funds for this work and the success of this project will be replicated in other gardens.” Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said if the project is self-sustainable, it would draw crowds automatically. “The garden is watered by the BMC, but does not have anything much on it. The idea is good, but we need to see how it would be implemented,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-plans-tree-house-with-sea-view-in-bandra/articleshow/88699166.cms||Richa Pinto

The video in which Ladwa said that the testing caused him to miss his father-in-law’s funeral has gone viral attracting thousands of viewers worldwide “The allegations made in this video are not based on facts but are completely false and misleading. In fact, he gave a self-declaration and chose the option of Covid test at the airport,” the BMC said in a statement. “The 54-year-old male passenger seen in the video arrived at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai from London on December 30, 2021. Passengers arriving from Covid high-risk areas, including Britain, are required to undergo Covid test. Each passenger is given the option to take one of the two tests. Of these, a rapid test report is usually available within half an hour.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rapid-test-bmc-refutes-claims-of-uk-passenger/articleshow/88699167.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The institute reported around 30 cases till Tuesday afternoon alone— the highest one-day spike on the campus in the entire pandemic. For the past five days, about 10 cases are being reported almost every day, taking the total active cases to around 100. Around half of these are students. The institute has decided to conduct lectures and all planned laboratory work online in the coming two weeks, after which the decision will be reviewed. In a series of mails issued by the institute in the past few days, it has listed guidelines for students and other campus residents. New sealing guidelines introduced by the BMC will be applicable to hostels too, it said. In other measures, the institute will restrict movement outside the campus. Permission of the hostel wardens will be required henceforth to step outside the campus, instead of the earlier self-approval leave portal. Students have been asked to eat in their hostel rooms and avoid eating in the mess. If they are in the mess, talking will not be permitted. The rules are being reviewed continuously, said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/after-highest-spike-in-cases-iit-b-reimposes-2nd-wave-curbs/articleshow/88699168.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Form medical boards mandated by MTP Act sans delay: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Though required to constitute medical boards under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act to diagnose any substantial foetal anomaly, the state hasn’t done so thus far, noted the Bombay high court last Friday. The HC noted that under the amended MTP Act of 2021, the limitation to terminate pregnancy, while extended from 20 to 24 weeks, carves out an exception in cases of foetal abnormalities. Observing that the failure of the state government to establish medical boards under the MTP Act “not only causes hardship to women seeking medical termination of pregnancy but also increases the number of petitions filed for such purpose”, a vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav directed the state to immediately proceed to constitute medical boards. Such boards would provide efficacious redressal to women seeking medical termination of pregnancy with foetal abnormalities, the HC said in an order while permitting a 30-year-old married woman with a 25-week pregnancy and foetal anomaly to undergo a procedure to end it. The HC directed that its order be forwarded to the advocate general “for further and prompt action in this regard”. Section 3 (2B) of the amended Act says: “The provisions of sub-section (2) relating to the length of the pregnancy shall not apply to the termination of pregnancy by the medical practitioner where such termination is necessitated by the diagnosis of any of the substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a medical board.” The medical board has to consist of a gynaecologist, a paediatrician, a radiologist and other members notified by the state, says the amended Act, which under Section 2 (c) requires every state to notify the board. The HC had on Wednesday directed setting up of a medical board panel of JJ hospital doctors to examine the pregnant woman after she showed medical reports of an ultrasound that her foetus showed microcephaly — smaller than normal head. Her lawyer Aditi Saxena said it was a fit case under the newly amended Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. “Microcephaly may be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life; since brain growth is correlated with head growth, people with this disorder often have an intellectual disability, poor motor function, poor speech, abnormal facial features, seizures and dwarfism,” said the order by the vacation bench seeking a report from the medical board by December 31. State government advocate Abhay Patki said that the burden cannot be shifted on the state in every case and submitted that an order of the HC earlier was when the woman was very poor and a victim of assault and abuse, but the case here was very different. The HC, after hearing both sides, permitted the woman to undergo the procedure on January 1, 2022, but said that in case the child born is alive and the parents do not want to look after it, it will be the state’s responsibility to take care of the child, and the hospital where it is delivered shall ensure all facilities to such child to save his or her life..||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/form-med-boards-mandated-by-mtp-act-sans-delay-hc/articleshow/88699169.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: College dropout extorts Rs 25 lakh from friend to fund hotel stays, trips, parties; arrested||MUMBAI: A college dropout, who extorted over Rs 25 lakh from his friend between 2019 and 2021 to splurge on hotel stays, hired SUVs and parties with friends, was arrested by the Andheri police on January 2. For the last two-and-a-half-months, accused Harsh Kamat (18) has been staying in an Andheri hotel where he booked a room to party with friends and mounted a bill of Rs 4 lakh, of which he settled Rs 2.5 lakh. Police have also arrested Kamat’s aide Arshad Shaikh who helped him sell gold ornaments worth Rs 13.13 lakh (excluding Rs12.05 lakh cash) that he had extorted from his old school friend during this period. However, luck ran out for Kamat when parent’s of the 17-year-old victim, a college student from Andheri-MIDC, questioned him on December 25 about the missing cash and jewellery. . “The victim confided in his father and told him that he was forced to steal the valuables from his own house as Kamat had threatened to expose him in front of his parents as a thief. Kamat was booked earlier, too, for duping various people of a collective Rs 30 lakh by promising higher returns from his BMC contract to make sanitiser and masks. Even then, he had splurged money to go on a trip, stayed in hotels for months, gifted i-phones to friends and bought high-end watches,” said DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. Kamat started committing such offences when he was just 16. “He first started off by convincing his friend to help him with Rs 25,000 for medical expenses of his grandmother in 2019. When his friend asked for the money to be returned, Kamat started blackmailing him saying he would expose him in front of his parents. His parents never checked the cupboard locker. They only learnt the valuables were missing when they opened the locker during Christmas to wear the gold for celebrations,” said assistant inspector Hanmant Shirsagar. The case was registered on December 30, after the victim’s parents, who run tuition classes, found the valuables missing. DCP Reddy supervised the team of senior inspector Rajkumar Hasbe, inspector Shivaji Pawade, assistant inspector Hanmant Shirsagar and detection staff, and nabbed Kamat from Amber Hotel in Andheri (East) where he had been staying for the last two-and-a-half months. Kamat had even booked the banquet of the hotel for the entire day on December 31, to celebrate with his friends. “He has taken his friends on a trip to Lonavala and Jammu and Kashmir with the money he extorted from the victim and through duping people on the pretext of paying high returns,” said the police. Kamat and his aide are in police custody. The police have managed to recover gold valuables worth Rs 13.1 lakh that he had extorted from the victim.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/college-dropout-extorts-25l-from-friend-to-fund-hotel-stays-trips-parties-arrested/articleshow/88699170.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to hear Nitish Rane’s bail petition on Friday||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday posted to January 7, a plea for pre-arrest bail by BJP MLA Nitesh Rane, son of Union minister Narayan Rane, in a case of alleged attempt to murder of Shiv Sena functionary Santosh Parab in Sindhudurg last December. Till the next date, however, he can breathe easy as special public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola orally submitted before Justice C V Bhadang that no coercive steps would be taken against him till then. Senior counsel Niteen Pradhan appearing for Rane said the whole case is a “reaction to a cat-call lampooning” in December 2021, by Nitesh Rane when BJP leaders were protesting outside Vidhan Sabha. Rane’s application says he and the co-accused being “falsely implicated to disgrace them publicly by their arrest, is a perfect example of the vindictive misuse of political power to settle scores over cat calling outside the Vidhan Sabha” and also the “hotly contested election” for the post of Sindhudurg District Co-operative Bank chairperson which the BJP won against the ruling party. The FIR with the Kankavli police states that Sena functionary Santosh Parab, 44, was allegedly stabbed in the chest on December 18, at 11pm by a man after being knocked down from his motorbike by a car. Parab heard the alleged assailant — an occupant of the car — saying they “should inform Gotya Sawant and Nitesh Rane”. Pradhan said Rane and a co-accused were called by the police on December 24, and interrogated for four hours and later allowed to go. On December 26, however, Kankavli police issued summons to Rane under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code — as an accused — after which he filed an anticipatory bail application on December 27, which was heard for a few days before it was rejected. Thus, on January 3, Rane moved the HC, said Pradhan. His application before the HC says that on December 18, 2021, four persons were arrested by the police and a fifth man was arrested on December 20. On December 25, all five were remanded to magesterial custody till January 6, 2022. “In the remand order, it has been observed that the medical certificate of the complainant shows the injury to be simple in nature,” said Rane in his petition adding that “it falsifies” the complainant’s allegations of “being dragged” and that it was added as “an afterthought”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-to-hear-nitish-ranes-bail-petition-on-friday/articleshow/88699171.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh files for bail in PMLA case||MUMBAI: Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has filed for bail before the special trial court in the city in an alleged money laundering case against him. The bail is being sought on the grounds that the special PMLA court did not take cognizance of the chargesheet filed recently against him before remanding him to further custody.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai Coastal Road’s Rs 2,000 crore spent, BMC eyes Rs 500 crore from its infrastructure fund||MUMBAI: As it has exhausted 2021-22 budgetary allocation of Rs 2,000 crore for the Mumbai Coastal Road project, the BMC plans to withdraw Rs 500 crore from special funds created for infrastructure projects to pay the contractors and consultants for the January-March period . The BMC has moved a proposal before the civic standing committee to allow it to dip into the infrastructure fund to make the Rs 500-crore payments. Civic officials said around 50% of the work on the 10.58-km coastal road from Princess Street flyover in Marine Lines to Worli has been completed. “The allocated funds for the project have been exhausted and payments for consultants and contractors for the already-completed work needs to be paid by the end of January. So, funds will be diverted from the special fund of infrastructure projects,” a civic official said. The Mumbai Coastal Road project consists of a tunnel, a road, and an interchange. The road will connect south Mumbai to the Worli-end of Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The BMC is targeting completion of the 10-km coastal road project between Nariman Point and Worli by December 2022, despite a five-month disruption last year. The Rs 12,721-crore project was originally to be completed in four years since commencement of work in October 2018. In 2021, BMC’s proposal to reclaim an additional 21 hectares of land was approved by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority with several conditions such as strict compliance with the provisions of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2021. Recently, 2km of tunneling work was completed. “BMC is constructing a 2.7km tunnel on both sides between Priyadarshini Park and Chhota Chowpatty under Package 4,” the BMC said in a statement. “The 2km phase of the first tunnel has been completed. Work on the remaining 70m is expected to be completed in 8-10 days.” The diameter of the tunnels is nearly 12.2m. “During excavation of these tunnels, concrete lining is done in a circular pattern on the inside. Therefore, after construction, the internal diameter of the tunnel will be 11m,” the BMC said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/coastal-rds-2k-cr-spent-bmc-eyes-500cr-from-its-infra-fund/articleshow/88699175.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Although Jasani did not share any specific numbers, he said Wunderman Thompson in India is powering significant growth for the global business.“The vision is to double our size in the next three years. Although lofty, it’s a vision which we feel is going to be possible by building on this amazing legacy that we’ve had,” said Jasani. A key part of what Jasani terms as ‘Wunderman Thompson Reboot’, is to evolve from being an agency to a partner to clients. “Over the next one year will be about how we can evolve in not just offering a great brand experience but also transforming our business into a consumer experience business by owning the entire consumer experience funnel for the entire business, and not just the brand. Every touchpoint of the consumer experience, even the post purchase journey, is critical. That evolves our discussions within clients — from the CMO to CIOs, CXOs and CEOs too,” said Jasani.One of Jasani’s mandates is also to evolve the India business to what Wunderman Thompson is globally, and to take assets that India is strong in and build it globally. The 1,400-strong Wunderman Thompson India, he added, can also fuel the growth globally in terms of talent. Jasani said the firm has a strong focus on strengthening its capabilities in digital as well.

The fragment splinters littering the carriageway have failed to draw the civic authorities’ attention despite causing inconvenience to motorists. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) road and infrastructure wing, which is responsible for roads, flyovers, underpasses, has done little to improve the state of this road, locals allege. The median blocks in some parts were broken after an accident. The Richmond Road flyover is one of the major ones in the CBD connecting Double Road, Residency Road and Mission Road. “With cement blocks in the middle of the road, riding back from Residency Road towards Double Road is an Herculean task at night. The streetlights too don’t work at times. Many times, my bike tyres have grazed against these blocks, but luckily I did not suffer a fall,” said Mallik Patel, an employee of a private company. Shankar Prasad, a resident of Shanthi Nagar, said his car has suffered dents due to these blocks. “In the night, if there is another two-wheeler next to my car, I end up driving to the extreme right of the median and hit the blocks,” Prasad said, adding: “My car’s front bumper has many dents because of this.” TOI visited the spot and noticed that over seven blocks have been broken. A senior BBMP engineer from the east zone said they weren’t aware of the problem. “Nobody has complained about it. Tenders for resurfacing the stretch have already been floated. In a day or two, the problem will be fixed,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/broken-median-blocks-on-flyover-trouble-commuters/articleshow/88699192.cms||Nithya Mandyam

The cost amount has to be deposited with the Karnataka state legal services authority within a month.“We are of the considered view that Jungle Lodges and Resorts, which has constructed the jungle lodge in Dubare forest in Kushalanagar range of Kodagu district, is a body created by the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation and no private interest is involved in its activities. The MD is a government servant belonging to the IFS cadre,” the bench noted in its order.The counsel for Jungle Lodges and Resorts raised preliminary objection regarding maintainability, saying the PIL was filed by petitioners with personal vested interests.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: RTI activist held for sexual harassment||BENGALURU: An RTI activist in his mid 60s has been arrested for allegedly sexually harassing a 40-year-old nanny. Nandini Layout police booked Thammanna Gowda, a resident of Parimalanagar near Kanteerava Studio, northwest Bengaluru, under IPC section 354A (sexual harassment). In her complaint, the nanny stated that Gowda befriended her a few months ago by voluntarily sharing his mobile number with her. “One day, I was heading towards a private apartment in Laggere near Rajagopalnagar, where I work as a nanny. Gowda was sitting inside a car and came out on seeing me. Introducing himself as an RTI activist, he said he could help me in many ways. Since he was an elderly person, I did not suspect any foul play. I too shared my mobile number with him. But as days passed, his behaviour changed. He started seeking sexual favours from me. I avoided him but he started harassing by repeatedly calling and sending lewd messages,” the woman stated in the complaint. Police said Gowda came to know that the nanny would be approaching police to file a complaint against him and is said to have requested her not to do so. Along with the complaint, the woman produced an audio record containing obscene talks by Gowda. He was arrested and released on station bail.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/rti-activist-held-for-sexual-harassment/articleshow/88699198.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Build organ transplant institute soon, says court||Bengaluru: The high court on Tuesday directed the state government to start the construction of the proposed Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplantation Institute and complete it in a time-bound manner. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi gave this direction while dismissing a petition filed in 2017 questioning the proposal to set up the institute on the campus of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD). “We have considered the submissions and gone through the records. There is no indication of what is the minimum requirement of a TB hospital. There is also nothing on record to indicate that in case a new hospital is constructed, it will adversely affect TB patients in the existing hospital. We are of the considered view that it is for the authorities concerned to take the opinion of experts in the field and decide the place and location of the hospitals they propose to construct. We, therefore, do not find any possible reason to grant indulgence. The writ petition is dismissed,” the bench said. In the PIL, petitioners R Chandrashekara, former vice-chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, and B Rudrappa, a retired senior specialist, had claimed that setting up another hospital would adversely affect the TB patients treated at RGICD and they wouldn’t get fresh air in case of a construction. On the other hand, the state government submitted that there is significant need for a gastroenterology and organ transplant institute as there are nearly 82,000 liver patients and about 17,000 kidney patients awaiting transplant in Karnataka alone. The court was told there is also a dearth of organ donors. Last year, 60 transplants took place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/build-organ-transplant-institute-soon-says-court/articleshow/88699200.cms||---

The project aims to provide tablets to around 2,000 school/college children of pourakarmikas, safai karmacharis, and others entrapped in the work of manual scavenging to enable them to attend online classes.They have taken exception to the scheme stipulation that eligible applicants need to upload a ‘Safai Karmachari ID’ or ‘Safai Experience Certificate’ or ‘Manual Scavenging ID’ on the website to avail the benefit. The scheme seeks to benefit contractual/casual/temporary labourers and not permanent workers on the rolls of government agencies like BWSSB. However, sanitation workers employed on contractual/casual/temporary basis do not get ID cards or certificates that validate their work. The 400-strong BWSSB Contract Sanitation Workers’ Union has pointed out that none of them has ever received an ID card or a certificate officiating their profession and hence, have been left out of welfare schemes even before. Bengaluru alone has over 5,000 sanitary workers, 1,600 of whom are said to be working with government agencies on an ad hoc basis. “If the ones with an appointment letter do not possess a state-sponsored ID card, what social security casual workers would have?,” asked Dr K Obalesh, state convener at Safai Karmachari Kavalu Samiti-Karnataka.According to a recent admission by social welfare and backward classes welfare minister Kota Srinivas Poojari, Karnataka is yet to complete an independent survey on the number of persons engaged in manual scavenging and has identified about 5,000 people from 12 districts engaged in this work, with 18 districts pending. “These identified persons have state-provided IDs, but there are countless more,” Dr Obalesh added.Suresh B, chief engineer, BWSSB, said their contractors had issued IDs to all sanitary workers. However, KB Mallikarjuna, MD at KSSKDC, clarified that a state-sponsored ID card recognising their role as a sanitary worker was a must.“Even if these labourers do not have ID, a letter with a single line stating that they are involved in this work is sufficient. But, without it they cannot apply for the tablets,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tablets-for-children-sanitation-workers-irked-by-id-mandate/articleshow/88699202.cms||Sanika Athavale

During the conference at Nandi Hills, about 45km from here, Shah was scheduled to hold a one-on-one meeting with ministers to review their performance. “We still have no confirmation about the participation of the brass, including Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda,” said BJP national general secretary CT Ravi. Sources said Shah and Nadda are unlikely to make it as they are busy with preparations for the upcoming assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh.The BJP plans to evaluate the performance of 29 ministers in Basavaraj Bommai’s cabinet. It is learnt that the leadership will remove non-performing ministers and induct new faces to beat anti-incumbency ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. This was done in Gujarat ahead of the assembly polls.Even the participation of national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh is uncertain and the functionaries said the baithak may now happen under the command of the chief minister, state president Nalin Kumar Kateel and general secretary incharge of Karnataka, Arun Singh. “The performance of the ministers, the government and the party will be assessed,” said BJP state general secretary S Siddaraju. “The outcome of the recent bypolls and MLC elections will be analysed to figure out what went wrong and what should be done in future. Short-term and long-term strategies for the assembly polls will also be discussed,” he added. The leadership has reportedly received complaints about some ministers sabotaging the MLC polls because of which the party candidates were defeated in constituencies, including Belagavi and Mysuru. Hence, it has asked the local leaders to come up with a foolproof strategy for the ZP-TP and BBMP elections. The party has already obtained the performance reports of individual ministers. “Shah and Nadda have got the details and they may seek further inputs online during the baithak,” said a functionary. There are also reports that the reshuffle may not happen till the polls in five states are held. However, Bommai’s close aides said the CM is keen on reshuffling the cabinet at the earliest and also inducting BS Yediyurappa’s ysounger son BY Vijayendra besides Pritham Gowda and DN Jeevaraj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/shah-nadda-may-skip-chintan-baithak/articleshow/88699203.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 67% of last year’s violations were helmetless riding||BENGALURU: City traffic police booked 57.2 lakh cases against helmetless riders between January and November last year. This constituted 67% of the 85.6 lakh traffic violation cases booked during the period. Of the 57.2 lakh cases, 35.9 lakh were for riding without helmet and 21.2 lakh were for pillion riders not wearing helmet. Statistics show that the number of helmetless riding cases in the city has been increasing over the years. It went from 20.3 lakh in 2019 to 31.8 lakh in 2020, and then to 35.9 lakh in 2021 (till November). Similarly, the number of pillion riders without helmets penalised rose from 12.9 lakh in 2019 to 19.1 lakh in 2020, and then to 21.2 lakh in 2021 (till November). Traffic cops are also booking cases for triple riding. The number of such cases increased from 84,276 in 2019 to 93,966 in 2020. In 2021, it was 1.02 lakh (till November). Transport department records show that around 70% of the vehicles registered in Bengaluru are two-wheelers. The city has more than 1 crore vehicles. Traffic police officers said one out of every four two-wheeler riders killed in accidents in the city between 2018 and 2020 was not wearing helmet. “Two-wheeler riders without headgear are more vulnerable to accidents, so we have decided to intensify enforcement. Helmets improve the chance of accident survival, but many riders are not using ISI-mark helmets. Some are wearing helmets without buckling them or are buying cheap-quality half/skull cap ones to evade fines,” a senior traffic cop said. According to the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, riding without helmet attracts a fine of Rs 1,000 and a three-month licence suspension. While the state government reduced the fine to Rs 500 after public outcry, the suspension rule is rarely enforced. MN Srihari, traffic expert and former adviser to the government, said, “Two-wheelers are prone to accidents because of road conditions and high-speed cars. Some people are ready to pay fine but not to follow the rules.” Meanwhile, some two-wheeler riders said they are being harassed by cops. Rajesh K, from Domlur, said, “Traffic police often hide near trees and catch only two-wheeler riders while ignoring other traffic violations. It’s also the easiest way to increase fine collection.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/67-of-last-years-violations-were-helmetless-riding/articleshow/88699205.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: After leaders’ scuffle, Congress-BJP political slugfest continues||BENGALURU: A day after higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan and Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh fought in public at a function in Ramanagara, members of the BJP and Congress youth wings protested and condemned each other’s conduct. Members of BJP Yuva Morcha staged protests in Bengaluru, Hubballi, Ramanagara, Davanagere, Mysuru and other places on Tuesday condemning Suresh’s behaviour at the programme, which was also attended by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. In Yelahanka, BJP MLA SR Vishwanath led the protest and urged home minister Araga Jnanendra to initiate legal action. “Suresh’s conduct was shameful and reflected Congress’ goonda culture,” he said. Congress also held protests in Bengaluru, Ramanagara and other places. They alleged that Narayan’s provocative speech at the function had led to the argument. KPCC working president and former home minister Ramalinga Reddy demanded that Bommai sack Narayan. Twitter battleThe state BJP, in a series of tweets, said, “There is no better example to prove the Congress’ goonda culture.” The party also used the hashtag #RowdyDKBrothers to attack Suresh and Congress MLC S Ravi. “The DK brothers might feel that Ramanagara district means ‘Kanakapura Republic’. It is not possible to remain silent at all times against such acts. Such behaviour at a public event is unpardonable,” BJP stated. The Congress countered by tweeting that Narayan’s behaviour had exposed the “RSS culture” before the people of Ramanagara. “They tried to get free publicity without giving a single rupee for the statue. They tried to promote the party at a government event. Using an expletive in front of the chief minister... all this exposes the real RSS culture,” the Congress said.  Bommai said such conduct is not part of Karnataka culture. “People can present their views in a gentle manner. This kind of behaviour is not good for anyone,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/after-leaders-scuffle-cong-bjp-political-slugfest-continues/articleshow/88699206.cms||---

Taking to Twitter, Palaniswami said the scheme was inaugurated to help the poor in rural and urban areas to get access to treatment in the neighbourhood. “The state government has only reaffirmed that it is a government which does not care about the welfare of poor people,” the former CM said, alleging political vindictiveness in the government's announcement to shut down the clinics, since the scheme was named after “Amma” (Jayalalithaa).TMC leader G K Vasan said the government’s move was unacceptable given that the clinics were benefitting mostly the poor with the efficient service of the health staff. The clinics were distributing monthly medicine as well. The government could resolve any issues in running the clinics and continue operating them, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-closing-amma-mini-clinics-due-to-political-vendetta/articleshow/88699209.cms||---
---||Chennai||CMDA to act against 216 flat owners in Anna Nagar colony for building violations||CHENNAI: In one of its biggest crackdowns, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will issue, within a week, de-occupation notices to the owners of 216 flats in an apartment complex at Anna Nagar Extension. This comes two months after CMDA served lock-and-seal notices to unauthorised constructions at the apartment complex. The owners will be given a maximum of ten days to vacate the deviated portions, after which demolition would start, sources said. It is probably for the first time that such a large number of de-occupation notices have been served against unauthorised constructions within a residential apartment complex in the city. The de-occupation notice is issued prior to the demolition of the unauthorised construction. Some occupants, however, have approached the planning authority with representation seeking relief. The largescale flouting of construction norms at the residential complex in Jeevan Bheema Nagar at Anna Nagar West Extension came to light following a litigation by Life Insurance Corporation of India in 2011, official sources from the CMDA said. While approval was given for a group development comprising 800 dwelling units spread over 50 blocks in 1994, deviations proliferated in 28 blocks, with additional constructions added illegally. Each block has 16 units on the ground. CMDA sources said the violations largely pertained to an extra room added to the units by taking over space ranging from 120 square feet to 150 square feet. Violations were found in the balcony area of a few units as well. Most units had unauthorised constructions on the ground floor. CMDA member secretary Anshul Mishra said site inspection was carried out by the planning authority in October and 216 flats were found to have been constructed deviating from the approval granted by CMDA. "So, locking, sealing, and demolition notices were issued on November 2, 2021, to the 216 flat owners," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cmda-to-act-against-216-flat-owners-in-anna-nagar-colony-for-bldg-violations/articleshow/88699211.cms||---

The court noted that no domestic inquiry was conducted and cited higher court verdicts to point out that the management is not supposed to act on its whims and fancies. Manish (name changed) of Perambur joined the firm in 2004 and became COO. On March 8, 2017, he was asked by a HR manager to resign failing which he would be terminated. When he withdrew his resignation which he signed due to force, a showcause notice was issued alleging the petitioner indulged in illegal gratification and misappropriated company funds of 1.2 lakh. The petitioner said the alleged incident happened in April 2015, but the showcause notice was issued after two years, which is an afterthought from the management and a fabricated charge. After perusing all submissions, presiding officer A Geetha held the domestic enquiry was not conducted properly and directed the management to reinstate the petitioner with back wages and also compensate him for the legal proceedings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/labour-court-asks-firm-to-reinstate-employee/articleshow/88699212.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Brother-in-law arrested after 26-year-old woman found dead||CHENNAI: After a 26-year-old woman was found strangled at her house in Thiruporur on Sunday, police on Tuesday found it to be a revenge killing and arrested her brother-in-law and his friend.  According to police, Shahinsha, of Kamarajar Nagar in Thiruporur, was married to a man named Vijay. He died in a couple of years after marriage and she had told neighbours that he died by suicide over a family dispute.  After Vijay’s death, she was living with her two sons aged 12 and 7. Meanwhile, Vijay’s brother Karthik (19) suspected that Shahinsha murdered Vijay. To uncover the ‘mystery’, he got cozy with her and frequented her in private at her house. Recently, he attempted to casually extract the details from her on the circumstances of Vijay’s death. However, the woman was evasive in her replies and decided to part ways with him. “One day, she warned Karthik that he would meet the same fate as his brother if kept pestering her about the incident,” an investigating officer said. Since the youth continued nagging her asking about her husband’s death, she moved to Kelambakkam 10 days ago. Meanwhile, on Sunday (January 2) morning, Karthik, along with his friend Anand (21), went to Shahinsha’s house. She was alone at home. The duo strangled her to death with a towel and fled the spot, the police said. The duo was allegedly inebriated.  Later, Shahinsha’s mother found her dead and informed Kelambakkam police. During investigation, the police found the involvement of Karthik and his friend Anand in the murder and arrested them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/brother-in-law-arrested-after-26-year-old-woman-found-dead/articleshow/88699214.cms||---
---||Chennai||TN: Turtle season begins, hatcheries ready at Besant Nagar, Neelankarai, Pulicat||CHENNAI: The forest department is setting up hatcheries for turtle eggs at Besant Nagar, Neelankarai, and Pulicat. The three hatcheries would be ready by Thursday, wildlife warden (Chennai) E Prasant said. Besant Nagar and Neelankarai used to have two hatcheries, with one belonging to the forest department and the other to conservation groups. However, this practice of having two hatcheries – one by the government and another by the conservationists – was abandoned two years ago after an announcement made in this regard by the then chief wildlife warden Sanjay Kumar Srivastava. Now, only the forest department establishes the hatcheries, but volunteers from conservation groups are allowed to patrol the coast with forest officials. The department has invited non-governmental organisations and conservation groups to join hands with it to protect sea turtles. Activists said the fisheries department should prevent trawlers from fishing within five nautical miles off the shore. Whenever such boats operate in these waters, they said, turtles get entangled in nets or injured, with many getting their flippers cut off. Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network volunteer Shravan said the fisheries department is expected to permit them to patrol the coast from Besant Nagar to Napier Bridge. “A couple of dead turtles have washed ashore along the coast in the city limits,” he said. Female sea turtles lay eggs on shore in January, and the eggs hatch in 45-60 days. Baby turtles are released into the sea by wildlife officials at night. Releasing them during the day may result in the hatchlings falling prey to birds and dogs. “It is to ensure their safe entry into the sea that the hatchlings are released at night,” said a wildlife official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/turtle-season-begins-hatcheries-ready-at-besant-nagar-neelankarai-pulicat/articleshow/88699215.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Railway clerk, wife held for ‘robbery’ in Chennai||CHENNAI: Monday’s robbery at the Thiruvanmiyur MRTS station has turned out to be a case of the ticket clerk stealing the money and concocting a tale that three masked men took away 1.3 lakh at gunpoint. The government railway police (GRP) on Tuesday arrested the clerk, Tikka Ram Meena, 28, and his wife, Saraswathi, 27. The couple’s three children, one a 10-month-old baby, are in the care of the child welfare committee until relatives can come from Rajasthan . The GRP said Meena owed friends and colleagues 2.5 lakh, which he had borrowed to gamble online and lost. He then decided to rob the ticket collection and roped in his wife. The GRP was on to the game after scanning CCTV footage from nearby cameras — MRTS stations don’t have them — that showed a woman entering the station around 4 am and leaving with a bag and taking an autorickshaw. The GRP traced the auto driver using its registration number. He told them he had dropped the woman at Urapakkam; the place turned out to be near Meena’s home. The GRP found the money hidden near a well behind Meena’s home and the coat the woman in the CCTV footage was wearing in the house. Confronted, Meena told them he had called his wife around 1am on WhatsApp and asked her to come to the station. He later deleted his call records. Saraswathi arrived in an auto and asked it to wait behind Tidel Park, which is opposite the MRTS station. She walked to the station, tied up her husband in the ticket counter and left with the money he had packed in a bag. An early bird passenger found Meena trussed up in the counter and alerted the police. Meena then spun the story about three Tamil-speaking masked men forcing him to part with the money at gunpoint. Police said the charge sheet against the couple, who are in judicial custody, would be ready in days. State police chief Sylendra Baby commended the GRP team that cracked the case. The railways have placed Meena , a Group D clerk who joined service in 2014, under suspension pending further action.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/railway-clerk-wife-held-for-robbery/articleshow/88699217.cms||A Selvaraj
---||Chennai||Rlys yet to resume system to collect money from stns||Chennai: The staged robbery at Thiruvanmiyur MRTS station must have happened because railways does not collect money generated at stations for depositing in the banks in a systematic manner but let the counter staff deposit it when they find time. After the pandemic began, railways withdrew the system of sending cars to collect money and deposit in the nearest SBI bank branch. Now, counter staff have to take the money at their own risk and cost and deposit it in banks. RPF personnel often do not accompany the staff if the cash is less than 25 lakh. This means money gets accumulated at the counters because the staff can go to the bank only after duty hours. Sources said the cash management from counters need to be streamlined in such a way that the day’s collection can be moved to the bank or should be kept in safe keeping.Though counters at MRTS stations have grill doors to prevent robbers from entering, that is not the case with counters in many suburban stations. The grill doors began to be installed after there was a dacoity at Mambalam railway station in 2001 when 9.75lakh was looted. The full amount is yet to be recovered. Small amounts have also been robbed from Chennai Fort, Kathivakkam, Taramani and Tondiarpet.Ticket counters at suburban stations, especially on Chennai-Gummidipoondi route are vulnerable because these stations are deserted and poorly lit at night and at early mornings.A railway official said that RPF team escorts the staff to the bank to deposit the collection at specified intervals like once every two to three days. "The counter staff at Thiruvanmiyur had this much money because of holidays."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/rlys-yet-to-resume-system-to-collect-money-from-stns/articleshow/88699218.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Civic body’s new drain eats up bus bay at Santhome||CHENNAI: Instead of repairing an existing storm water drain, the corporation has constructed a new one parallel to it along Santhome High Road towards Foreshore Estate, encroaching a bus bay. The new drain eats up almost 8ft of the road as well. As a result, buses now stop on the two-lane road, causing traffic jam. The issue was raised in the Namma Chennai app by resident Ramesh R in December last year. A zone level official said 5 crore tenders to build 1.5km drains in divison 125 were out before the 2021 state elections. “We had planned to put concrete slabs over the existing drains in the area. But they appeared weaker to carry the weight of the slabs. So, we decided to construct newer ones parallely,” the official said. Asked why the contractors did not construct the new drains in place of the old ones, the official said disturbing the structure of the older drains would mean damaging the BSNL utility cables that pass alongside. Activists and experts question such shoddy work by the contractors and the waste of public money. Civic activist David Manohar said, “Why a new drain was constructed side-by-side an old drain when it can be repaired or its space utilised. The officials who gave green signal to the project must be taken to task. GIS expert Dhayanand Krishnan, who has executed civic body projects, said, “It was unscientific to encroach a road to build narrower drains. “If older drains don’t work, what’s stopping corporation from removing them and using the space? If the newer drains don’t work, will they build another one, taking more space from the road?,” he questioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/civic-bodys-new-drain-eats-up-bus-bay-at-santhome/articleshow/88699220.cms||Omjasvin M D

In a video shared by chief minister's official Twitter handle, Stalin can be seen distributing masks among people when he saw them on the streets roaming without masks. “Please wear a mask," Stalin appealed in the video. However, there was no social distancing and total disregard for masks as hundreds of ration card holders thronged fair price shops to receive the Pongal gift hampers, which the state government launched on Tuesday. At a PDS outlet in Chintadripet, at least 50 per cent of those standing in queues were either without masks or were not wearing it properly. Ration card holders complained that they were waiting to receive the gift hampers since morning. Several people also alleged that the delay was due to technical glitches and that several ration card holders were waiting for the scheme to be officially launched on Tuesday. At other PDS outlets across the city, the situation was no different. Most visitors adhered to wearing masks only after cops deployed for crowd management insisted that those in the queue must wear masks. In Velachery, about 80 per cent of ration card holders wore masks, though social distancing norms went for a toss. Official sources with the civil supplies and consumer protection department said that the token system was introduced to ensure that only limited number of people visit PDS outlets so that all Covid protocols were followed while receiving the Pongal gift hampers. Tokens were issued to about 100 to 150 ration card holders in each fair price shop to collect their Pongal’ gift hampers everyday. “In fact, we are asking all visitors to follow social distancing and wear masks,” a civil supplies and consumer protection department said, adding that special teams will be deployed to monitor it. The Pongal gift hampers contains 21 items and will be distributed to 2.15 crore ration card holders across Tamil Nadu at a cost of 1,296.8 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cm-plea-in-vain-masks-missing-at-pds-outlets/articleshow/88699225.cms||---

The 3.1-kilometre-long structure, connecting MIOT Hospital in Manapakkam with Mugalivakkam via Ramapuram, is aimed at decongesting traffic near DLF IT Park. According to official data, every hour, more than 11,000 vehicles use the stretch, leading to traffic snarls, particularly during peak hours. To decongest the stretch, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the nodal planning agency for the city, recommended construction of a grade separator along the stretch. The State Highways department approved the proposal in 2017-18, and a Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared. Meanwhile, during an inter-departmental meeting, the Highways authorities came to know about the CMRL’s proposal to construct an elevated line along the same stretch. As the proposed grade separator completely overlapped with the metro line, a government steering committee decided to integrate both the projects. Accordingly, the CMRL was assigned the task of finalising the designs and constructing the structures. Both the agencies agreed to share the construction cost. As per the latest design, the structures will come up at two levels – the grade separator on the first, and above that, the metro rail viaduct. A senior official said the highway will have four lanes to ease traffic flow. GR Ingulab, a resident-activist from Manappakam, said, “Ever since Chennai Trade Centre and DLR IT Park were established, the locality began to develop in leaps in bounds. Now, with the State government planning to establish a fintech city in the vicinity, the move to construct a grade separator will be more advantageous.” He, however, suggested the authorities provide alternate routes during the construction as the width of the road is bound to shrink during the period. “The stretch is already prone to accidents,” he said. The Highways official said Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has been awarded the contract for the construction of the grade separator and the metro rail viaduct. “It would take 36 months to complete the project. The plan is to open it for public use by November 2024,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/grade-separator-to-ease-snarls-on-mount-poonamallee-road/articleshow/88699228.cms||Ram Sundaram

The existence of such a reputation in the present days is a million-dollar question,” said the judges. The court made the observations while allowing an appeal moved by the university challenging an order passed by a single judge of the court dated October 23, 2017. The single judge had ordered promotion for a technical officer as an assistant librarian. The petitioner stated that he had been purposely denied promotion to accommodate his juniors. Allowing the appeal moved by the university, the court made it clear that the original petitioners are not entitled to promotion to the post of assistant librarian, unless they succeed to such status in the manner prescribed by the UGC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dismiss-university-officials-who-are-irresponsible-hc/articleshow/88699229.cms||---

Residents of a four-storeyed apartment building had a miraculous escape on the morning of December 27, 2021, as it came crashing just minutes after the last of them walked out fearing for their safety as the walls had developed cracks. The urban habitat development board tenement on Village Street had 24 flats that housed 80 people. Some of them had moved to the homes of friends and relatives. The rest spent an uneasy night in their homes, with bits of plaster falling and the building groaning. Around 9.45am on December 27, a local activist arrived to videograph the state of the building and asked those who had remained behind to move out, the reports stated. Everyone had left the building by 10 am. According to recent reports, seventeen families who lost their houses were offered alternate allotment in units of the board's tenements by TNUHDB at Ernavur and NTO Kuppam. While the remaining 11 families have sought houses in the same premises at Tiruvottiyur after reconstruction, an official release said, financial assistance of 24,000 would be given to the respective families for staying elsewhere during the reconstruction period.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/shrc-seeks-report-on-collapse-of-tiruvottiyur-housing-complex/articleshow/88699231.cms||---

The corporation is in the process of printing more than 1.6 crore textbooks for these students by February end, according to sources. More than three crore textbooks for the remaining classes will be printed and distributed by May end. As per the government direction, the school education helpline 14417 and child helpline 1098 will also be printed on the first page of all textbooks to enable students to seek help in case of any abuse. The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has handed over the soft copies of many titles for Classes X to XII for printing. "This year we are carrying out only a few corrections in the textbooks. So, there will not be any delay in handing over the textbook CDs for printing," a subject expert said. There was criticism from some quarters that the printing orders were being given to printers from outside the state. However, sources have clarified that out of 126 textbook printers, 100 are from Tamil Nadu and only 26 of them are from out of the state. The textbook and educational services corporation also called for tenders to supply educational aids to students such as school bags, footwear, geometry box, colour pencils, crayons among other things to students from government and government-aided schools. "The textbooks are given top priority and the printing is going on at full swing. The other items will be procured and supplied to students before the first quarter of the next academic year," a source said. While the textbooks for government and government-aided schools are supplied for free, the copies will be sold to students from private schools. The free textbooks will be delivered at nodal points in districts and private schools will procure sale copies from the godowns of textbook corporations from across the state. Last year, it also printed bridge course materials and worksheets for students of Classes I to IX.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/classes-x-xii-texts-to-be-ready-by-feb/articleshow/88699234.cms||A Ragu Raman

The Mayiladuthurai constituency MP, S Ramalingam, claims that the parliament has no legislative competence to legislate the law, which is in the domain of States.On Tuesday, when the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu commenced their proceedings, senior advocate P Wilson made an urgent mention seeking an early hearing of the plea.“The Act has the effect of taking control of all major dams in the state and the union government is taking steps to constitute National Committee on Dam Safety and National Dam Safety Authority whereupon the states will be completely denied control over dams located inside and outside the states,” he said.Allowing his request for an early hearing, the bench said the petition would be taken up for hearing on January 10.“Dams have been constructed, operated, and maintained by the state government using the state exchequer on the state’s properties and the union cannot now claim dominion and control over the properties, including water of the state government stored in such dams,” Ramalingam said.The Act not only shifts control over the dam to the union government but also usurps control over water supply through the dams within the state for various purposes, the MP said.According to him, the law is ex-facie unconstitutional, hit by Article 246(3) (exclusive power of state over subjects in the state list) and ultra vires the constitution as parliament lacks legislative competence.He added that the Act encroaches into the exclusive legislative domain of the state and as such infringes the doctrine of cooperative federalism and violates the federal structure which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dmk-mp-moves-high-court-against-dam-safety-law/articleshow/88699237.cms||---

A senior official said that in November last year, the TNPCB had appealed to the people to share information on such illegal plastic units. “Most of the units were functioning clandestinely and little is known about their presence or functioning. To overcome this problem, the board had appealed to the members of the public to share any information about these units. The identity of the informers was kept confidential,” said the officer. The Erode collector, in a joint operation with the district environment engineer, sealed two such illegal units. Another official said that information about these illegal units continues to come in from the public. Once received, the board alerts its district engineers who visit the spot for an inspection. Following this, a notice is issued, and these units are subsequently shut down. The environment committee functioning in each district has been empowered to act against such illegal units. The state government in 2019 had banned the use of bags, cups, tumblers, spoons, and other materials, made of one-time-use plastic. As per a study, plastic bags or other materials made of one-time-use plastic when dumped along with other waste materials takes hundreds of years to get degraded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/state-pcb-shuts-15-illegal-plastic-units-after-tip-offs-from-public/articleshow/88699238.cms||P Oppili

While notorious criminals and gang leaders would be categorised as A+, their close associates would fall under the A category. Other criminals would be grouped under B and C categories, based on their records. The commissioner, who has begun inspections at Pallavaram, Tambaram, and Shankar Nagar, has asked his subordinates to ready the list, which should also include the names of those arrested, on bail, absconding, with non-bailable warrants, and those detained under the Goondas Act. A few of the notorious history-sheeters in the localities include extortionists Padappai Guna and Nedungundram Surya. Also, lists of ganja sellers, perpetrators of crimes against women and children, and those organising kangaroo courts are being prepared separately. Police will also closely examine the history-sheeters’ recent criminal activities and action will be taken accordingly. "Instructions have been issued to personnel in this regard. Intelligence gathering and vigilance will also be strengthened. Kangaroo courts and goondaism will soon end," said the CoP said. Apart from this, he said, police are focussing on traffic regulations and Pongal bandobust preparations, especially on the traffic snarls expected at Perungalathur during Pongal days. Moreover, the commissionerate has rolled out an additional phone number, 8525007100, for the public to lodge their complaints. This phone number is apart from the common police control-room number of 100. The Tambaram commissionerate will function with two police districts -- Tambaram and Pallikaranai – and have 20 police stations under it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/make-a-list-of-rowdies-to-target-tambaram-police-chief-tells-team/articleshow/88699239.cms||---

Vijay Munjal and his son Naveen Munjal, who own Hero Electric, have taken cousin Pawan Munjal, CMD of two-wheeler market leader Hero MotoCorp, to court. The point of contention — the use of the Hero brand name for Hero MotoCorp’s soon-to-debut electric vehicle range. Vijay and Naveen Munjal’s Hero Electric has been in the EV business for 15 years but since EVs were not top of the mind as a business segment until now, the branding issue did not crop up before, said sources. With Hero MotoCorp getting into the EV segment in March this year, Vijay-Naveen Munjal are claiming exclusive use of the brand name in the EV space.“Now that EVs are red hot, suddenly the use of the Hero name has become a brand issue,” said a source close to the matter. “At the end of the day, the core brand is Hero and not Hero Electric so products from competing companies will face a challenge.”When contacted Naveen Munjal refused to comment on the matter since it is sub-judice. A Hero MotoCorp spokesperson also refused to comment. Sources said there has been no out-of-court dialogue initiated between the two factions. “There has been no discussion on this for the last 10 years because earlier no one was interested in getting into the EV segment,” said the source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hero-electric-takes-hero-moto-to-court-over-brand/articleshow/88699242.cms||---

In an open letter to the state government, they said that even countries like the US, Australia and Brazil, which are seeing thousands of Covid cases have not closed educational institutions yet. “Why can’t the state follow the academic calendar that it had released? What is the need to make a decision overnight and pre-pone holidays for educational institutions?” questioned Y Shekhar Rao, president, TRSMA adding that after the formation of Telangana, the state government has failed to adhere to the academic calendar on multiple occasions and announced holidays overnight. He said that by pre-poning Sankranthi vacation, the state is sending out a wrong message to the public. “It looks unlikely that children will come back to schools after the vacation. Holidays will only make their fear of Omicron stronger. If this happens, they will lose another year,” he added. The TRSMA members said that the education system has been destroyed in the state and elsewhere in the country owing to schools remaining shut for almost two years during the pandemic. “There is no discipline in children. They have got addicted to the internet and their learning levels have drastically reduced as they have even forgotten the basics. Instead of coming out with a plan to bring the education system back on track, the state is further destroying it by pre-poning holidays,” said S Madhusudhan, general secretary, TRSMA. Members added that students and teachers of residential schools will have to suffer because of the move as many have already made their travel arrangements as per the holidays mentioned in the academic calendar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/early-holiday-order-hasty-will-hurt-students-trsma/articleshow/88699246.cms||---

The city’s current testing goal is 3,000 RT-PCR tests in the government sector, 2,500 in private labs and another 7,000 to 8,000 tests elsewhere. A few days ago, only about 1,000 tests were being conducted in the city and now 13,000 tests are being performed on a daily basis.Taking this into account, Hyderabad is performing 55% antigen and 45% RT-PCR tests. Medchal Malkajgiri (55%), Rangareddy (49%), Sangareddy and Mahabubabad (34%) have higher RT-PCR testing patterns than other districts. Mulugu and Nagarkurnool are the two districts where antigen kits are used for 99% of testing and RT-PCR is used for 1% of testing.Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the state has conducted over 2.97 crore tests. For every million people, 8,00,580 tests were done, while the World Health Organisation standard for testing is 140 tests per million per day, which equates to 5,600 tests per day.Experts say there is a need to increase testing because formula for testing, tracing and treating will not change. “Spike in cases suddenly become like a big wave. The wave-like situation will enhance testing further,” said Subodh Kandamuthan, director of Centre for Health Care Management, ASCI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/with-centre-focus-on-antigen-tests-city-needs-to-catch-up/articleshow/88699249.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

If caution is not exercised, it is only matter a time before cases in districts increase, especially during festivities.” At present, 13 districts — Suryapet, Mulugu, Nalgonda, Narayanpet, Nirmal, Jangaon, Bhupalpally, Gadwal, Kamareddy, Asifabad, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, Peddapalli and Wanaparthy — have a positivity rate of zero. Up until Monday, Adilabad had the highest positivity rate in the state after Hyderabad at 0.36 per cent. However, the city has seen a jump in this regard, with the positivity rate now at 0.45 per cent. “More cases are asymptomatic this time with many cases emerging from private labs. The number of daily tests has also risen, with cases now being reported all over the city,” a senior health official said. Authorities also pointed out that it is not a surprise that number of cases has increased following New Year’s day events. “It appears that people have welcomed both the new year and third wave but the healthcare system is now better-prepared to handle the cases,” another senior official said. Health officials also stated that none of the second contacts in Paramount Colony, which housed several patients detected with the Omicron variant, had tested positive. There were over a thousand tests performed in the locality. Such trends, according to experts and officials, call for increased vigilance as they indicate the emergence of cases from large gatherings and parties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-year-events-usher-sea-of-infections/articleshow/88699252.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Nadda had arrived in the city on Tuesday to take part in the protest. Police video recorded the entire proceedings and so far no case has been registered.On Tuesday, North Zone DCP G Chandana Deepthi received an application from BJP leader B Shyamsundar Goud of Secunderabad seeking permission to conduct a silent procession for ‘Prajaswamya Parirakshana’ from Mahatma Gandhi statue in Secunderabad to Ranigunj via MG road between 5pm and 8pm under the leadership of JP Nadda, Union minister Kishan Reddy, DK Aruna, national vice president, and K Laxman, OBC Morcha national president.DCP rejected the request on the grounds of maintenance of public order and public health due to the threat of spread of Covid-19. In his order, the DCP also said that the applicant did not disclose the number of participants and mentioned intelligence input indicating that the organisers were planning to mobilise large number of supporters from various districts, which would lead to traffic problems in the commercial area during peak hours.The possibility of miscreants damaging private and public property during the event was also mentioned and finally the GO issued by the state prohibiting rallies and public meetings till January 10 was also cited as reasons while rejecting the application.Joint CP of City Armed Reserve (CAR), Hyderabad, Kartikeya, met Nadda when he arrived at the RGI Airport and explained that he would not be allowed to participate in the proposed rally due to Covid-related prohibitory orders. Subsequently, Nadda along with a few senior leaders, including Kishan Reddy, went to the Gandhi statue in a convoy and garlanded the statue on Tuesday night. No rally was taken out.“There were over 100 supporters in the vicinity, but only five or six people, including Nadda, went to the statue to garland. They briefly spoke to the supporters and left the place,” said a Mahankali police official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-calls-off-protest-after-police-deny-nod-for-rally/articleshow/88699253.cms||---

After the meeting, the Waqf board chairman urged the Muslim community not to panic over the Bill, since it has not been approved and referred to the selection committee for scrutiny. He said that though the Centre had tabled the Prohibition of Child Marriage Amendment Bill, 2021 in the Parliament during the winter session, it still has many phases to pass and get a nod from President Ramnath Kovind. “The TRS party will oppose the Bill in Parliament since it interferes with the Muslim personal law. As per the religion, Muslims are free to marry once they attain puberty,” said Saleem. He said that the Bill will be defeated in the Parliament since it is being opposed by the other sections of society too. During the meeting, Saleem advised the qazis to counsel those who are panicking over the proposed Bill. “A Muslim girl aged 18 years can still get married and there is no bar for her. There has been unnecessary hype just over the introduction of the Bill,” he said. There has been a rush to solemnize nikahs in Hyderabad and in other parts of the state after the Bill was tabled. In just a month, many nikahs were performed in a hurry and the brides were aged between 18 and 20 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-need-to-panic-over-billon-marriage-waqf-board/articleshow/88699267.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Builders in Hyderabad told to adopt lakes within 500m of all projects||HYDERABAD: Real estate developers would henceforth have to take care of any lake or water body within 500 metres of their planned layout or mega projects. This will now be made mandatory while granting permission for ventures in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) region. The new plan by the state government is meant to protect lakes by making developers responsible for it. There are nearly 3,100 lakes in the metropolitan region. Municipal minister KT Rama Rao, who held a review meeting with officials on Tuesday, directed officials to involve developers for lake protection and improvement of greenery near their ventures. The municipal administration is also planning to rope in all real estate and developers’ associations for protection of lakes in the city. “The minister advised that CREDAI as well as builders who have projects adjacent to lakes should be asked to maintain them as it leads to improvement in ambience also,” special chief secretary (municipal administration) Arvind Kumar told TOI on Tuesday. While for some lakes in HMDA region the full tank level (FTL) was finalised and protection measures such as fencing taken up, many lakes’ FTL was yet to be identified by both revenue and irrigation departments. In GHMC limits, the municipal administration had taken up beautification of lakes in a phased manner. Officials said that this measure would not only ensure protection of lakes, but also lead to beautification of the surrounding areas. The HMDA said new norms would be applicable to all types of developments and permissions for layouts, multi-storey buildings, gated communities and commercial complexes. The officials said that in many ventures the sewerage was getting into nearby lakes illegally, which had to be prevented. The developers would be asked to construct walkways and develop greenery, which would also help in improving the water quality of the lakes, Arvind Kumar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/builders-told-to-adopt-lakeswithin-500m-of-all-projects/articleshow/88699268.cms||Koride Mahesh

While Bengaluru notched a net office space absorption of 2.42 msft in the fourth quarter of 2021, Mumbai was third with 1.88 msft net absorption followed by Delhi NCR with 1.61 msft, Pune with 1.34 msft, Chennai with 0.85 msft and Kolkata with 0.47 msft. Net absorption is calculated as the new floor space occupied minus the floor space vacated. The three cities of Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai, with a total 7.29 msft net absorption, together accounted for 63% of the total office space absorption of 11.56 msft across seven top markets for Q4 of 2021, said JLL’s Office Market Update-Q4 2021 that was released on Tuesday. Also, the total net office space absorption recorded in in the key 7 markets during Q4 of 2021 was the highest in the last eight quarters and up by 86% as compared to Q3 of 2021, the report added. According to JLL, pre-commitments were a major driver of net absorption with 60% of the new office supply, that came on-stream in Q4 2021, being pre-leased. When it comes to the entire year of 2021, however, Bengaluru topped the charts with a total net absorption of 7.82 msft, followed by Delhi NCR’s 4.72 msft, Hyderabad with 4.14 msft, Mumbai’s 3.7 msft, Pune with 3.18 msft, Chennai with 2.03 msft and Kolkata with 0.5 msft. Net absorption in the top 7 markets grew just 2% from 25.66 msft in 2020 to 26.17 msft in 2021, the report said. “While net absorption was up marginally, we have observed greater traction in overall leasing activity. The Gross Leasing Volume (GLV) for the last quarter of 2021 was recorded at the pre-Covid levels as seen in Q4 2019 at 15 million sq ft. This is also the highest in the last eight quarters and higher than the average quarterly GLV numbers during the pre-Covid (2018 and 2019) period as well,” said Radha Dhir, CEO & country head-India, JLL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-notches-highest-net-office-space-absorption/articleshow/88699269.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||JNTUH: 75% attendance must to appear for semester exams||Hyderabad: Amid fear of Omicron variant, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) rolled back its decision to extend attendance exemption to engineering students set to appear for their semester-end exams this year.In view of the pandemic, the JNTUH in 2020-21 had exempted all UG and PG students from mandatory attendance of aggregate 75%. As a relief to all these students, the varsity had decided to have no attendance based detentions last year. Now, in a recent circular issued to all affiliated colleges’ principals, the university stated that minimum of 75% attendance is compulsory to appear for semester exams that are set to be held in March-April. “The university will compute the promoted and detained list based on uploaded fortnight attendance by the colleges. Hence you are advised to upload the fortnight attendance within the given schedule,” stated the university in the circular to all college principals. Not just this, the university has also decided to go back to the pre-pandemic exam pattern. During the pandemic, there were no compulsory questions and students had to answer five of the eight questions. Each semester exam was conducted for a duration of three hours. Now, the university has decided to go back to the pre-pandemic exam pattern. “Since students are attending the college physically, we decided to go back to the pre-pandemic norms in terms of attendance and exam pattern. The exemption was only meant for 2020-21 and is not being extended for this year,” said Manzoor Hussain, JNTUH registrar. The move has not gone down well among many students who are asking the university to roll it back. “We are already being warned about a possible third wave by the government. Then why is the varsity implementing new norms, especially just ahead of the exams,” asked Raj Kiran, an engineering student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/jntuh-75-attendance-must-to-appear-for-semester-exams/articleshow/88699270.cms||Preeti Biswas

The Chinese infrastructure development in border areas indicate their military preparations when seen with extensive deployment of weapons and troops along the LAC, said Owaisi. Stating that Union home minister Amit Shah’s posturing about laying his life down to get back Aksai China was a mere bluster, Owaisi in a series of tweets said this was a serious issue which calls for a special session of Parliament. “This challenge needs a whole of India response, which this clueless, divisive and weak government is incapable of providing. Our government’s behaviour with China is inexplicable. What is PM Modi so scared of? Or is Amit Shah right in what he told about PM’s mental state to Meghalaya governor? There is no rational explanation for this timidity on display,” he tweeted. Stating that China was setting up new villages in border areas, the MP said: “It is putting up videos of its forces and flag waving in Galwan...Our response is to exchange sweets in areas occupied in Ladakh.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hold-spl-parliament-sessionon-china-border-row-owaisi/articleshow/88699271.cms||Roushan Ali

Kolkata had registered 2,801 cases on Monday, 46% of Bengal’s fresh case-load of 6,078. By Tuesday, this shot up to 52.5%, which means the city has more than half of the state’s new infections. Kolkata, with a positivity of 38.4%, has the highest rate of patients testing positive in the country, according to ICMR data. “We are definitely into the third wave,” said Diptendra Sarkar, surgery professor at IPGMER. “Going by the trend, we would see a very steep surge, that is likely to peak by January 15 to 18. Thereafter, there will be a plateau period around end-January,” he added. Even during the peak of the second wave, fresh daily cases in Kolkata had never breached the 4,000-mark. The highest single-day spike in the city in the second wave was 3,990, recorded on May 3, 2021. Abhijit Chowdhury, the head of hepatology at IPGMER and public health activist, said a “clearer picture” would emerge in two weeks. “But this wave will be a huge one. Even though infection caused by Omicron is apparently mild, given the tidal wave of cases, the absolute number of people down with Covid will be staggering,” he said. “There is no place for laxity. We urge everyone to be calm and not panic.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kols-fresh-cov-cases-cross-4k-mark-for-first-time-ever/articleshow/88699278.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Twenty-one cases had been sent back to the state police but CBI officials “strongly denied” that the agency had found no evidence in cases referred to it by the NHRC.The CBI said it had also received 29 complaints of sexual assault from the NHRC. Two of these were handed over to the state police’s SIT. “Remaining cases are under progress,” the agency said, adding that it had been mandated by a Calcutta High Court August 19 order to investigate post-poll violence cases of murder, rape and attempted rape.As on 1st January this year, the CBI has registered 51 cases and submitted charge sheets in 20 cases. Over 100 persons have been chargesheeted.The Calcutta High Court on August 19 had ordered a court-monitored CBI probe into the alleged cases of murder, rape and attempted rape during the poll process in Bengal and set up a special investigation team under the supervision of a retired judge to probe other criminal cases. A five-judge bench, led by former acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, also directed the NHRC, the state government and all other commissions or committees that had received complaints to hand over all records relating to murder and crime-against-women cases to the CBI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/21-cases-sent-back-because-of-nature-of-offence-cbi/articleshow/88699279.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Want community faces in BJP panels: Matua leaders||Kolkata/Malda: The controversy over no Matua community representation in BJP’s state committees and Union minister Santanu Thakur’s exit from state BJP’s WhatsApp groups continued even on Tuesday. After a four-hour-long meeting at Thakur’s home in Bongaon, at least four BJP MLAs from the Matua belt in North 24 Parganas and Nadia said they were voicing their demand for more representation of community leaders in the state committees. “Almost 60% of voters of BJP are from backward classes and they want representation in the party. We will convey our concern to the party leaders. Let them decide on that,” said Mukutmani Adhikari, the Ranaghat Dakshin MLA.On Tuesday morning, BJP’s national president J P Nadda called up Thakur. Hours later, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar indicated that the entire list of committees for the state would be released soon. Controversy started brewing on Monday when Thakur left the party’s WhatsApp groups. According to sources, Thakur, unhappy with the absence of any community member from the party’s state committees, had earlier met Nadda in New Delhi. During his visit to Kolkata last month, BJP general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh had met five party MLAs — Asim Sarkar (Haringhata), Ashok Kirtania (Bongaon Uttar), Swapan Majumdar (Bongaon Dakshin), Subrata Thakur (Gaighata) and Adhikari.On Tuesday evening, four MLAs reached Thakur’s Bongaon home. “They could have at least consulted the leaders representing Matua community before deciding on the district presidents. The dissenting voice, I think, is a result of not taking them into confidence,” Sarkar said. The Matua community, which helped BJP win in as many as 45 assembly seats, are feeling left out, indicated leaders close to Thakur.Bengal BJP leaders indicated a discussion with the community leaders over dissenting voices. “It is an internal issue of the party and we will take a decision on that after discussion within the party,” said Majumdar. BJP’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said the recent changes in the state would take time to adjust to.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/want-community-faces-in-bjp-panels-matua-leaders/articleshow/88699280.cms||---

When contacted SLBC convenor Nabin Kumar Dash said that the committee is discussing the matter and would consult it with the state government. It has argued that banking community of the state, being the frontline warriors and in direct contact with the general public, is continuing to do their duties amid high chances of being infected by the deadly virus. “The bankers despite taking necessary precautions are working with constant fears of being contaminated with Covid-19, which has been alleviated by the sudden surge in Covid-19 positivity rate in the last few days,” the letter adds. AIBOC has urged the state government to implement some measures that includes an order for working with 50% work force in banks, to restrict the bank working hours from 10am to 2pm with an immediate effect, to implement five-day week by keeping the branches and its other offices closed on all Saturdays enabling the branches and offices to sanitise the area and also to break the chain of spread if any and to make arrangement of booster dose of vaccination on priority basis to all bank staff. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bankers-seek-ofc-hour-ease-amid-covid/articleshow/88699283.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Health workers in Covid grip, hospitals curtail planned operations||Kolkata: The healthcare system has started showing signs of stress, what with the spiralling Covid cases and an increasing number of doctors, nurses and other workers themselves contracting the fast-spreading virus. Staring at manpower shortage, several hospitals are curtailing the number of planned surgeries, while many patients are also not willing to go in for their scheduled operations and other procedures amid Covid spike. “We have already started reducing the number of elective surgeries. Our doctors are talking to more patients, asking them to defer their surgeries unless it is an emergency and a deferral of the procedures won’t cause much harm,” said an official at AMRI Group of Hospitals, where 42 healthcare workers are now infected with novel coronavirus at present. During a meeting with private hospitals on Monday, senior health officials at Swasthya Bhawan had also suggested the reduction of planned surgeries now, pointing out that might help hospitals get over the temporary manpower shortage. Health officials told the hospitals that Covid care should be their priority for the next one-and-a-half months. “Currently, about 150 healthcare workers at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and Narayana Superspecialty Hopital Howrah are off hospital duty as they are infected with the novel coronavirus. About 50% of them are doctors, nurses and support staff in the ward and OTs. We are planning to reduce the number of planned surgeries after assessing the situation for the next two to three days,” said R Venkatesh regional director (east) Narayan Health. Most hospitals are conducting several rounds of meetings to find out ways to deal with the increasing manpower shortage. “So far, our elective surgeries have not been affected. But we are continuously assessing the situation,” said Medica Hospital chairman Alok Roy. “We are able to manage both Covid and non-Covid patient care for now, as only about 25-odd healthcare workers are infected at present. But some patients have have started communicating that they would prefer their planned surgeries at a later date, after the Covid situation gets better,” said Sudipta Mitra Peerless Hospital CEO. Most of the elective surgeries being deferred at other facilties are GI and orthopaedic operations. At Charnock Hospital, where close to 100 healthcare workers are under isolation, has cut down on their elective procedures. “Most of our affected healthcare workers are in home isolation. We currently have a skewed manpower. The number of surgeries here is already on the downswing,” said Prashanta Sharma, MD at Charnock Hospital. In the government sector, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan College of Obstetrics Gynaecology and Child Health restricted its OPD and admission services after about 70% of its healthcare workers were deteced with novel coronavirus. “Due to the surge in Covid cases, we are expecting fewer general patients in the next few days. This should also help hospitals tide over this temporary manpower shortage,” said a Swasthya Bhawan official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/health-workers-in-cov-grip-hosps-curtail-planned-ops/articleshow/88699291.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Positive in two days, negative in six: Covid behaves differently this season||KOLKATA: A couple in central Kolkata tested their swab samples on December 25 on getting the news that one of their close contacts they met only three days ago had developed symptoms. They tested positive. The couple had only mild symptoms and was in home isolation. They decided to test their swab samples on January 1 as they wanted to attend a small family function. The result for both were negative. “None of us had any health issues. We wanted to check our Covid status as there was a family function with 10 guests. We were surprised to find ourselves negative after five days,” said the couple. Their case is not an isolated one. Doctors are getting a large number of patients who are turning negative in just about three to four days later. Health experts said these are tell-tale signs that the virus in circulation is causing not only mild infections and but is also striking a person fast, in two to three days of being in contact with a positive person, and that the period of virus cycle in a person’s body is getting shortened. “In most symptomatic patients, the symptoms are resolving within four to five days and they are becoming virus-free. Possibilities are that these infections are caused by Omicron which has a shorter incubation period and the virus is staying inside the body for a much shorter period of time,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital. Earlier, the incubation period for the virus on an average was five to seven days. So, a person had to wait for these many days for the symptoms to throw up before going for the test. “There’s no doubt that even the clinical improvement in symptomatic patients this time is much faster than what we came across during the two previous waves. But we need to observe more cases for about a week more to come to some conclusion about how the prevalent variant is going to impact the healthcare system,” said IPGMER infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray. During the previous waves many of the infected will go on testing positive even after three weeks of the infection long after the symptoms have resolved. This time, positive patients, including the confirmed Omicron-positive international travellers, are testing negative within five days. “Most patients admitted to hospital are getting free of symptoms within a short span of time. Even as many do not need hospital care, some are coming out of panic,” said infectious diseases specialist Sayan Chakrabarty of AMRI Dhakuria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ve-in-two-days-ve-in-six-covid-behaves-differently-this-season/articleshow/88699292.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Medicine retailers sound shortfall alert, stock up paracetamol, antibiotics||KOLKATA: A sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases has prompted medicine retailers to stock up on medicines like paracetamol, cough syrup, azithromycin and ivermectin. The pharmacy associations have also asked the retailers to keep enough stock for paracetamol and azithromycin suspension required to treat kids. On Monday night, the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) issued a letter to members of all states to keep sufficient stock of at least six medicines. The list of the medicines included all types of cough syrup, paracetamol tablets, vitamin C, zinc tablets, azithromycin and ivermectin. “We have asked our members to prepare for the challenges in the time to come. The government is concerned that cases arising due to Omicron and Delta variants of the virus may increase. We have asked our members to inform us immediately if there is any shortage of medicine,” said Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the AIOCD. Sajal Ganguly, secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association said that no shortfall has so far been reported by the retailers. “Some medicines like paracetamol and azithromycin are going off the shelves fast. We have also asked retailers to keep enough stock of the two medicines required for children,” he said. According to Rajendra Khandelwal of Dhanwantary Pharma, there is no shortage of medicines so far. “People have started buying more immunity boosters like chyawanprash and multivitamins. Sales for Antihistamines and Montelukast are also on the rise. But sales of such medicines and health supplements go up during the winter,” said Khandelwal. In some pockets of Kolkata, retailers on Tuesday reported a very high demand of paracetamol and azithromycin. Retailers have also started to stock up antiviral molunopiravir which has received an emergency use nod from the Drugs Control General of India. “There is also a high demand for zinc supplements and doxycyline. We have also stocked up molunopiravir as well but the demand is yet to pick up,” said Somnath Ghosh of Metro Pharma. But doctors cautioned against using any antibiotic without proper medical advice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/med-retailers-sound-shortfall-alert-stock-up-paracetamol-antibiotics/articleshow/88699295.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Several private hospitals revive satellite units, house infected staffers now||KOLKATA: The spiralling Covid cases notwithstanding, hospitals across the city are yet to see a proportionate rise in demand for Covid admissions as a major chunk of the affected are in home isolation. But some private hospitals have started reviving their satellite centres, using them to accommodate their infected healthcare workers. The AMRI group of hospitals has turned its nursing college at Southend Park into a satellite facility. Currently, 11 of their healthcare workers, down with Covid, most of them nurses, are being housed there in isolation. They do not need hospital care right now. “Most of our nurses are from outside and they live in the nursing hostel. We cannot afford to keep the infected ones in the hostel. Therefore, we are accommodating the affected ones at the satellite centre to prevent infection among other inmates of the hostel,” said a source at AMRI Hospital. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences also opened its satellite centre from Sunday. During the second wave of the pandemic, the hospital had reserved two nearby buildings as its satellite units. This time, they have acquired only one of the buildings. “We have started a 20-bed satellite facility, where we are currently housing some of our Covid-affected healthcare workers under isolation and observation. None of them needs hospital care. They don’t have proper facilities of their own to isolate themselves and so, we activated this centre,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (East), Narayana Health. Health officials had also told private hospitals to keep satellite units ready, where the mildly symptomatic patients could be housed, so that hospital beds could be kept aside for those needing oxygen support and other intensive care. Many hospitals have zeroed in on such units, ready to utilize them at the shortest time possible. “We can activate our satellite unit within hours as and when the need arises. The place is at a stone’s throw from the hospital,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/several-pvt-hosps-revive-satellite-units-house-infected-staffers-now/articleshow/88699297.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Ten major housing complexes have been brought under the 25 micro-containment zones declared by the state. At Urbana, a large team of cops from the Anandapur police station, were posted outside each of the seven towers on the premises while from a separate team manned the main gates, where “Micro containment zone Restricted area” boards were set up. The complex, which is home to 4,000-odd residents, including actors, politicians, diplomats and businessmen, has so far reported 40-plus Covid cases, one of them a confirmed Omicron patient, who is on the path of recovery. “Five of the seven towers have more than five Covid cases each. In these towers we have stopped allowing part-time domestic help who go to other households, too. Visits within towers are stopped, no guest is allowed, and no social or cultural gathering is being held. Drivers, car washers, pet-handlers and delivery personnel are not being allowed beyond the reception. There is no bar on recreational walking, but all have to wear masks and maintaining other safety protocols,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director Urbana Facility Management, adding masks were mandatory for everyone within the complex common area. With special focus on Urbana, local councillor Sushanta Ghosh said a dedicated KMC team has been assigned to carry out sanitization of the complex as well as other gated communities in the vicinity. “A big New Year’s Eve celebration was held at Urbana. They should have avoided it. The situation might have been under control otherwise. We are making all arrangements and asking residents and others living nearby to cooperate with us,” said Ghosh. At Ideal Towers in Ekbalpore, cops barricaded the main entrance, allowing only residents to go in and out and carrying out a strict check of visitors’ IDs and verifying the purpose of visit. A Helpline of the local police station has been pasted on the gates for residents to call in emergency. “We have upgraded our safety and sanitation measures on the complex. We are not allowing outsiders to enter the complex and delivery agents are allowed only till the reception,” said a security personnel of the complex, where more than 10 active Covid cases were reported. Similar rules were in place at Vrindavan Gardens in Topsia; the local police station has cautioned the residents as well as the staff that they will be fined Rs 100 if caught without a mask within or outside the premises. Cops have been patrolling all the complexes in the micro-containment zones, taking action against those violating safety protocols. At Active Acres in Tangra, the residents’ association undertook largescale sanitisation of the common areas, such as elevators, staircases and other places. “We are trying to bring back the Covid restrictions, which were in place during the first and second waves of the virus spread. While outsider entry and guests are being stopped, residents have also been asked to limit their movement outside the complex as much as possible,” said Mahendra Sureka, a resident of the complex.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/high-rises-in-micro-c-zones-close-their-gates-to-check-virus-spread/articleshow/88699299.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The other six micro C-zones are in FD Block (two), one each in GD Block and CB Block and two in AK Block. In New Town, one flat each at Uniworld City, Akanksha cooperative society and Sapoorji housing complex have been demarcated as micro-containment zones. There was some confusion over a micro C-zone that was earlier demarcated in Salt Lake’s CD Block. TOI on Tuesday visited the spot and found that nobody in the four to five houses as listed were presently affected by Covid or was affected within the last few weeks. The authorities said the matter was being rectified. New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) officials said they were planning to send mobile rapid antigen test teams at places where multiple cases are getting reported to check whether others living in the area are getting infected. Also, they are keeping ambulances ready for. NKDA will hold an online meeting with residents’ welfare associations and NGOs in New Town to urge them to take up Covid measures. A few gated communities in New Town have already taken safety steps.“We are introducing no-mask-no-entry rule along with thermal scanning, keeping PPE kits and oxygen concentrators ready,” said Kingshuk Chakraborty, a resident of Greenfield Ambition housing complex.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rat-for-salt-lake-c-zone-neighbours/articleshow/88699303.cms||Suman Chakraborti

But from Monday, footfall has crashed to less than 15% of the capacity with only those required to make essential purchases walking in. “Between Sunday and Monday, footfall has dropped by nearly two-thirds. Compared to January 2021, when we were recovering from the pandemic situation and footfall was increasing, the decline is 70%. The food court is deserted. There are not even 140 people where 1,400 can be accommodated,” said South City vice-president Manmohan Bagree. At Quest and Acropolis, too, footfall has reduced by half since Sunday. This is the first time that malls have not been shut at the start of a wave. “In the first wave, the whole situation was unknown and footfall was initially low due to the fear factor. After the malls opened following the shutdown during the second wave, recovery was fairly quick. I believe there is a panic reaction of people as cases are rising. But with low hospitalization and very few fatalities, I think footfall will start to improve by the weekend,” said Quest V-P Sanjeev Mehra. Acropolis mall general manager K Vijayan does not mind the dip in footfall when cases are on the rise. “Traditionally, this is also a lean period for malls. Once the Covid situation improves in a couple of months, footfall will bounce back,” he said. Retail and wholesale markets in the central business district have also witnessed a drop in footfall by almost 50% on the first two days of the new year. Shop owners in busy markets in Burrabazar, Posta, Canning Street, Chandni and Esplanade, where customers would start arriving from morning, have been sitting idle for most parts of the day. “Footfall has decreased by almost 50% from Monday onwards. We would have wholesale and retail customers dropping in from early in the day but they have not been coming for the last two days. We are following all safety guidelines,” said Rajiv Changoiwala of the Satyanarayan Park AC market Shopkeepers’ Welfare Association. At New Market, too, footfall has been very thin last two days. “People are scared to use public transport and come to crowded places. This is going to have a negative impact on our business. If this continues, we won’t be able to even meet our expenses,” said Mohammad Safiullah, owner of Karimullah and Sons.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/footfall-at-malls-drops-sharply-as-third-season-of-curbs-kicks-in/articleshow/88699304.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Host of music fests postponed after Covid surge||KOLKATA: The rising Covid-19 numbers have sent alarm bells ringing among organizers who have postponed most of the music conferences. Among them are Dover Lane Music Conference, Behala Classical Festival, Chaudhury Festival and Uttarapara Sangeet Chakra’s conference. Sandipan Banerjee, general secretary of Behala Sanskriti Sammilani that organizes the Behala Classical Festival, said the decision to defer has been taken keeping the health of artists and audience in mind. Hoardings were up for the conference between January 9 and 12, decorators have started constructing the pandal on the Behala Blind School grounds, flight tickets of outstation artists and hotel accommodation were done. Everything has been cancelled with a tentative loss of Rs 6 lakh. “It is difficult to bring senior artists from Mumbai now that flights have become irregular. It is impossible to host a conference with the likes of Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia, Vidushi Kala Ramnath, Ustad Shahid Parvez, Pt Ronu Mazumdar, Pt Ajoy Chakraborty, Pt Tarun Bhattacharya, Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar and Vidushi Kaushiki Chakraborty where only 50 people will be allowed in the audience. That’s why we decided to postpone our conference,” he said. The tentative new dates are between March 19 and 22. The 70th Dover Lane Music Conference was supposed to be held between January 22 and 25. General secretary Avijit Majumder told TOI that it has been postponed. Last year, Uttarpara Sangeet Chakra had deferred its conference from end-January to end-March. This year, the conference was supposed to be held between January 22 and 25. “We had initially cancelled all whole-night concerts and only gone for evening performances. Now, we are postponing our festival and abiding by the government guidelines,” said Anish Mukhopadhyay, joint secretary of Uttarpara Sangeet Chakra. Three international artists were performing at the Chaudhury Festival, which was scheduled on January 14-15. That has been cancelled along with the drama festival. “The state has allowed 50 people for cultural activities without mentioning the area of the venue. A bar and a cinema with more capacity has been allowed to operate. This is ridiculous. I have lost a substantial amount of money for this last-minute closure,” said festival organizer Anirudhdha Chowdhury. Subrata Dhar, the secretary of Sutanati Parishad that has been organizing the Sutanati Sangeet Sammelan for 30 years now, is now weighing the options. “We will wait till January 15 to see if we can host the concert on January 29. The high point of the concert is a recital of Pt Kumar Bose and Pt Kushal Das. However, chances of spending lakhs for a concert where only 50 can attend seems quite remote,” Dhar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/host-of-music-fests-postponed-after-cov-surge/articleshow/88699305.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Air India’s Kol-London flight plan grounded after embargo||Kolkata: The four-days-a-week ban on flights from Mumbai and Delhi to Kolkata has put a spanner in Air India’s plans to operate the Kolkata-London flight.While the ban on the London-Kolkata flight announced earlier had led to AI scheduling a Dreamliner Boeing B-787 aircraft from Mumbai to Kolkata in the wee hours of Sunday that would then do the Kolkata-London sector later that morning, the latest embargo restricting flights from Mumbai and Delhi to only Monday and Friday has forced the airline to cancel the Kolkata-London flight. The airline has already waived rescheduling charges for passengers booked on the once-a-week fight via other cities till February 4.Sources in the airline said it was not possible to re-route the Dreamliner aircraft via Bengaluru or Hyderabad to Kolkata for the Kolkata-London sector as that would involve changing multiple flights, causing huge scheduling problems.Travel agents have individually begun rescheduling the tickets of passengers who are booked to travel next Sunday or thereafter via Hyderabad and Bengaluru. “Both the connections are decent. While the flight from Kolkata reaches Hyderabad at 9.15pm, the departure for London is at 1.35am. For Bengaluru, the flight from Kolkata reaches at 1.50am and the London flight departs at 7am,” said Manav Soni of Exclusive Travels. Businessman Nakul Malhotra, who had come to his Ballygunge home on December 26 and planned to fly back to his office in London on January 16, said, “This had happened last time as well. I was here during December 2020 planning a four-week holiday and I ended up staying back for four months. I hope the same doesn’t happen this time.” Similarly, Kolkatans have also travelled to the UK to meet friends and relatives this winter and are scheduled to return. While the latter will have to come via Delhi, Mumbai or some other Indian city, where AI operates direct flights from London, with the airline now scrapping the Kolkata-London flight, departing passengers will also have to fly via some other city.“After this embargo on flights from Mumbai and Delhi on the weekend, we will not have access to the Dreamliner aircraft,” said another official of the airline, which may schedule another flight between Mumbai and London.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/air-indias-kol-london-flight-plan-grounded-after-embargo/articleshow/88699306.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Senior cops down with Covid, start work from home||KOLKATA: It seems the third Covid wave has left Lalbazar battered within a span of just one week. The Lalbazar brass is facing its biggest challenge in the new year with senior officers either being themselves diagnosed with Covid or forced into isolation as colleagues with whom they have been working closely have become Covid-infected. The number of total cases climbed up to 83 with 22 fresh detections on Monday (the total hospitalization stands at 16), several others are awaiting their results. However, with none of the senior officers reported to be serious, several of them are preferring to work from home and issuing necessary instructions. Sources said important meetings are going ahead as scheduled through the online mode. The traffic department is among the worst hit with three of its senior most officers down with Covid. At Lalbazar, several IPS officers are either in home isolation or admitted to hospitals. This includes an additional CP, two joint CPs and two DCPs. Another DCP is running a high fever and sources said he was likely to get tested. He is presently in isolation. The detective department, too, is functioning without its head who had to be admitted to a hospital. Another DCP, who was heading important probes, is likely to proceed to isolation after developing symptoms. Another joint CP is in isolation after a close relative was diagnosed with Covid. The DCP of an important division is also in isolation. “We have had thousands of Covid cases in the past two waves. but this is probably the first time that so many officers have tested positive at the same time,” said a source at Lalbazar. He, however, insisted that unlike in the past, the scare is not there this time. “The symptoms are milder and recovery is faster. There is no threat to life,” said an officer. The situation at the police stations and traffic guards is no better. At least six OCs have been diagnosed with Covid, two of them from adjoining police stations of Behala. At Tiljala Traffic Guard, seven officers are running fever. At Jorabagan traffic guard, two sergeants are down with Covid. Under such a situation, CP Vineet Goyal has held a video conference where he took stock of the traffic situation. It has also been decided that cops who are nearing retirement and have a history of respiratory trouble will not be allotted outdoor duty. The barracks where cops are staying close to each other might also be shifted yet again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sr-cops-down-with-covid-start-work-from-home/articleshow/88699307.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The university has instructed its affiliated colleges to finish internal assessments by January 8 and start preparing for the different semester examinations. The university has decided to hold the examinations online due to the rising Covid-19 cases. The government has also suspended all offline classes in schools, colleges and universities because of the same reason. “The decision to conduct examinations online was taken when Omicron variant was discovered in South Africa and started spreading to other countries. Moreover, most of the classes for these semesters were held online. That is why, it was decided that examinations should be held online,” said a CU official. Most of the semester examinations for humanities, science and commerce will start from January 15 while the general examinations will start from January 20. “For Honours subjects there will be one examination in a day while for the elective subjects there will be two examinations every day,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cu-to-hold-ug-semester-exams-online/articleshow/88699309.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Business||RIL, Jio eye mega borrowings to lock into low interest rates||Mumbai: With signs of hardening interest rates in domestic and international markets, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RIL) is raising funds at multiple levels. RIL has obtained board approval for raising $5 billion in unsecured dollar bonds over multiple tranches to refinance existing borrowings. Telecom arm Reliance Jio Infocomm too is planning to replace costly debt with a Rs 5,000-crore rupee bond sale. In the US, 10-year treasuries saw yields rise by over 13 basis points on the first day of trading, while rates in India are also inching up as the RBI drains surplus liquidity from money markets. On Tuesday, Moody’s assigned a Baa2 rating to RIL’s proposed $5-billion fund-raise. The company is raising funds from global institutional investors taking advantage of Section 144A of the US Securities Act, which allows an exemption for offers and sales to large ‘qualified institutional buyers’ in the US. RIL’s adjusted net debt/operating profit was estimated at around 1.1x as of September 30, 2021. Reliance Jio Infocomm is looking to raise Rs 5,000 crore through five-year bonds at less than 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) over the current yield on 5-year government bonds, which is 5.8%. Last year, the telecom unit had repaid most of its high-cost debt after raising equity funds from several private equity investors. Now, the company is again looking at making large investments to roll out 5G services. Bankers say that although yields have hardened it is a good time to lock into long-term rates as the RBI is widely expected to start hiking its rates after April. Reliance Industries did not comment on its fund-raising plans. The group began the new year with Reliance Industries announcing that its solar unit will buy UK-based sodium-ion battery technology provider Faradion for $135 million as part of its push into the renewable energy segment. In the petrochemicals business, Reliance Industries had last month said that it would partner with Abu Dhabi Chemicals Derivatives Company RSC (TA'ZIZ) and invest $2 billion in setting up a petrochemical production facility in the UAE. According to Moody’s, Reliance Industries’s existing cash, along with expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to cover its cash outflows for capital spending and debt maturities in the next 18 months. Last November, it received around Rs 266 billion in proceeds from the final call on its rights issue, which further enhanced its liquidity. Reliance Industries has diversified earnings sources with little or no correlation, given its presence in the refining and petrochemicals, digital services, and consumer retail segments. These three segments together generated around Rs 944 billion ($12.6 billion) or 86% of RIL’s consolidated operating profit for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021. The company’s announcement to increase tariffs for its digital services business is positive for the telecommunications industry, while the easing of pandemic-related disruptions will support demand for oil and gas as well as increase consumer spending. “A resurgence of coronavirus infections due to the emergence of new variants could result in fresh lockdowns and affect the company’s refining & petrochemical and retail earnings,” Moody’s said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-jio-eye-mega-borrowings-to-lock-into-low-interest-rates/articleshow/88697832.cms||TNN

The high courts in Mumbai and Delhi have issued interim orders in at least half a dozen cases after India’s largest food marketing organization filed suits of trademark and copyright infringements against such players. Around four brands selling milk and dairy products with artwork, design, motif, colour scheme and fonts on pouches, packages similar to that of Amul have surfaced in Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Uttar Pradesh markets. These milk pouches even copy the iconic mascot — Amul girl — known for its polka dotted frock and a half-tied-up pony. In most of the cases, the milk pouches are sold by adding/ replacing just one or two alphabets in the brand name Amul. In fact, proprietor of a Palghar-based firm has submitted an undertaking in the Bombay high court stating that he was selling ‘Amsul Taaza’ deceptively similar to ‘Amul Taaza’ — a registered trademark owned by the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited (KDCMPUL) popularly known as Amul Dairy. KDCMPUL is a member union of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) — the apex organization of all dairy cooperatives of Gujarat. It has permitted GCMMF to exclusively market dairy products with the trademark Amul. While submitting an undertaking that he has stopped production and sale of the product under the impugned mark – Amsul Taaza – from September 2021, the proprietor has even paid Rs 75,000 as damages to GCMMF. The Bombay high court observed that a defendant simply added the letter ‘S’ to well-known mark Amul to make the impugned mark – Asmul Taaza. “By no stretch of imagination, the use of the impugned mark and artistic work can be said to be accidental or co-incidental. No other inference than that of riding the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs and drawing an unfair advantage can be drawn,” the court of justice N J Jamadar observed while granting injunctive relief. Delhi high court recently passed ad interim ex parte injunction against Delhi-based Shree Bankey Bihari Vegetables and Foods Co, which had started manufacturing and selling ‘Fresh Cream’ in Delhi/UP market in similar packaging design of Amul Fresh cream. The firm has been restrained from using the trade dress and trademark of Amul Fresh cream. The court has further appointed a local commissioner to inspect the premises, prepare inventory and inspect the book of accounts of the party. “At the time of final arguments, the party has filed an undertaking and paid Rs 1.50 lakh to federation towards token damages,” said Delhi-based advocate Abhishek Singh, who was engaged by GCMMF. Amul has also filed suits in Delhi high court against a firm selling kitchenware and utensils like Amul pressure cooker and another firm that manufactures, sells, and deals in paint brushes, roller, putty knives and other products with ‘Amul’ and ‘KBI Amul’ marks. “We are continuously working against such misuse. There is one set of small players who deceive consumers by carrying phonetically similar names and designs of popular and reputed brands like Amul. There are other players who package fake films. And there are a third set of players in the non-dairy product categories who are using Amul’s well-known brand name for their own advantage which is not permissible,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/copycats-selling-milk-other-items-keep-amul-on-its-toes/articleshow/88697587.cms||Prashant Rupera

The centre will come up in the town that houses world renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom. "A total of 56 commandos will be permanently deployed here. This is my message to terrorists: If you conspire against the nation, our commandos will finish you, no matter where you hide,” said Yogi, addressing a public rally. "ATS has done a lot of good work. During past regimes, there were terror attacks -- on Ram Janmabhoomi, Kashi's Sankat Mochan temple, courts in Lucknow, Rampur's CISF centre, etc. They were regular, and terrorists changed colours like chameleon. In a similar way, Babua (Akhilesh Yadav) of Samajwadi Party is also saying that had it been their government they would have made the Ram mandir. Now they are also saying lord Krishna is visiting them in their dreams." Spread over 2,000 sqm, the ATS centre will have nearly 100 commandos who will keep an eye on the communally-sensitive regions of western UP. It will also have around 15 IPS officers. The Yogi government has plans to set up similar ATS centres across the state, including in Meerut, Bahraich, Shravasti and Gautam Buddha Nagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/ats-centre-in-deoband-will-keep-terror-away-yogi/articleshow/88697381.cms||Sandeep Rai

The deal valued Pine Labs significantly higher than $3 billion — the valuation in its previous financing round. In 2021, Pine Labs had raised $600 million from new investors and followed it up with a $100 million fund-raise from US-based Invesco Developing Markets Fund. In addition to offering more features on its card swipe machines, Pine Labs is now looking to invest in scaling Plural, its newly launched brand of online payment products. This will allow the company to offer payment services for both in-store as well as online payments, the company said. “We are empowering merchants with seamless and secure payment experiences across offline and online platforms. Last year, several marquee investors have placed their trust in our business model and growth momentum and that is a gratifying feeling,” said B Amrish Rau, CEO, Pine Labs. SBI has been making significant investments in the payment acceptance space. It has a subsidiary SBI Payments, which onboards merchants for digital acceptance. Pine Labs is also expanding its Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) business across India and southeast Asia. The company has entered the consumer payment space with its April 2021 acquisition of Fave, one of southeast Asia’s leading consumer fintech platforms, and has a leading presence in the gift, prepaid and stored value segment through its 2019 acquisition of Qwikcilver.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-invests-rs-150cr-in-card-machine-co-pine-labs/articleshow/88697842.cms||TNN
---||Business||Pay isn’t enough, cos must add value to employees too||By M MuneerThe onset of the pandemic has caused a proliferation of ‘free’ seminars and conferences virtually. However, none of these free events ever resulted in acquiring useful skills for our career other than giving us some ideas at the most. Now events for a fee are coming back. Unfortunately, a freeze on training budgets is preventing employees from attending some of these programmes and acquiring many essential skills. Employers seem more inclined to ensure increased work hours for lost time than fund ‘working holidays’. The post-pandemic environment will be very different and new skills are much needed for the success of the business. Additionally, responsible employers must add value to their employees, not just pay for their labour. Here are some suggestions employees can use to persuade their bosses for approvals and add even more value to the company: Stage 1: Requesting approval Time your request tactfully. Do not ask for a big budget for a course when your firm has just had its worst quarter. On the other hand, if a competitor has recently beaten you to the market with a new product, the time might be ripe for getting new ideas/expertise. Present your proposal in terms of return on investment (RoI), rather than mere training. How will the new knowledge specifically affect your company’s prospects? Say you would like to attend a conference on database marketing, when your firm’s reliance on mass media has not delivered results. Establish how direct marketing may be a more efficient use of funds. Contact the course director for detailed curriculum, since this helps to build your case. When all else fails, pull out the last resource: “Our competitors will be there, we can’t afford to miss.” Seek funds from the frozen training budget first. Be willing to admit your knowledge deficiencies — no one knows everything. Explain your rationale for attending based on what’s happening now in your company. (For example: “Since we’re trying to connect with Gen-Z, we need to learn more about digitisation. We can’t afford to do it wrong.”) If networking or strategic alliances are important, outline your specific plan. Offer to minimise costs by proposing to stay with friends in the destination city, be willing to take a train instead of flying, or use frequent-flyer miles. Often it pays to invest in your own career. A colleague I know offered to pay half the course fee at Stanford and landed a job in the Bay Area. Another friend’s boss was so impressed with her willingness to share expenses that a salary increase was awaiting upon her return. Emphasise how you will maximise RoI. This includes networking with experts over lunch, taking educational side trips, or burning the midnight oil and applying to your work. Make sure your peers and subordinates are covering work issues in your absence. Plan to leave nothing crucial hanging that will not wait until your return. At the course, instead of rushing out frequently to take calls, relax to really learn. Stage 2: During the course Send messages to the bosses, updating them on your progress. Perhaps you have stuck a strategic relationship with someone or learned of an opportunity to close a sale. Take every opportunity to save money. Stage 3: Upon returning Speak only in terms of how your learning will benefit the company. Make a presentation about your takeaways from the course at the next staff meeting. Try to get a soft copy of the course slides. Suggest ways to drive your company or division better, and how your colleagues might play. But take a hard-earned lesson: Be careful about your approach. Early in my career, after returning enthusiastically from a course, I tactlessly blurted out everything the company was doing wrong. The silence was deafening, and I was persona non grata for a while with the big bosses. Given another chance, I would praise my co-workers for what they were doing right, then present improvement opportunities as enhancements.

---||Lucknow||BJP pools party volunteers from other states for poll battle in UP||Lucknow: BJP has sent reinforcement of party volunteers from other states to UP, a development that could presumably augment the saffron outfit’s prodigious state organisational machinery further in the run up to the high-stakes assembly polls due next month. All the six organisational regions have got teams from various states. BJP workers from Delhi have been deployed in the west UP region, while functionaries from Rajasthan have arrived in Braj region. Likewise, a contingent from the Gujarat unit has arrived in Awadh region, while BJP workers from Bihar and Jharkhand have been positioned in Gorakhpur and Varanasi. Similarly, a team from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has been stationed in Kanpur-Bundelkhand region. Highly placed sources in BJP told TOI that two-three volunteers, some of them prominent office-bearers in their states, have been assigned duties in each of the 403 assembly seats in UP. Being ‘outsiders’ these volunteers will be able to gauge the ‘exact’ pulse and prevailing political situation on the ground as well as get a veracious feedback on the sitting MLA, which would be then relayed to the leadership, sources added. The development comes amid speculations of BJP denying tickets to a substantial number of sitting MLAs to counter anti-incumbency stoked by the opposition’s negative campaign. When contacted, state unit spokesperson Hero Bajpai said BJP is a national party and therefore intra-state movement of party workers is normal. “Party workers from UP too have gone to other states when elections were held there,” he said. During West Bengal assembly elections, CM Yogi Adityanath was the party’s star campaigner while deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and state general secretary JPS Rathore handled election management at local level. BJP’s decision to use its organisational sources of other states in UP becomes significant as the opposition, led by Samajwadi Party has drawn daggers to take on the saffron party and arrests its chances of coming back to power. The convergence of resources comes amid regular visits by party’s top brass, including PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief J P Nadda for inauguration, foundation laying of developmental projects and flagging party campaigns. “The idea is to assess public mood and accordingly create the political atmosphere in favour of BJP,” said a senior office-bearer. The recently organised Jan Vishwas Yatra was one such move to reach out to the people. “Soon, there would be a door-to-door contact programme,” said a leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-pools-party-volunteers-from-other-states-for-poll-battle-in-up/articleshow/88698547.cms||Pankaj Shah

The police officer involved in the incident was identified as Prashanth, an ASI attached to Malappuram police camp. Prashanth was assigned as a welfare officer for the RRTs in several stations in Thrissur station, including Vadakkekkad. The friends who were with him were reportedly from Vadakkekad. The police officer and his friends, who were allegedly under the influence of alcohol, had reportedly tried to drive away in their car without stopping after knocking down the bike. However, people who chased them detained them after their car stopped due to flat tyres. The accused were later handed over to the police.

This is the first time since April 2020 that the benchmark crossed that mark, which signals that the interest rate in India may increase during the coming months. Bond dealers said indications of hardening of rates were there since December 24 when 30% of the government’s total borrowing for the week, that was pegged at Rs 24,000 crore, devolved as investors wanted higher yield while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was not ready to accept the same. During the gilt auctions on December 31, the RBI cancelled auctions aggregating Rs 17,000 crore or about 71% of the Rs 24,000 crore that was planned. This, again, was due to the same reason. “Over the last couple of weeks Indian fixed income yields witnessed some pressure, tracking global yield movement and rising crude prices,” said a debt fund manager. According to the fund manager, rising supply of state government bonds since mid-December has further complicated the situation in the absence of any open market purchases or Operation Twist by the RBI, which was conducted regularly during the first half of the fiscal. On the contrary, the central bank is selling smaller amount of central government papers every week in the secondary market. These factors, coupled with muted demand from the banking sector during the third quarter owing to sizeable credit pick up, has tilted the demand-supply balance towards the supply side. “As a consequence, even after the RBI’s yield signalling either through devolvement or partial cancellation of primary auction, proved to be less effective.” In the government bond market, while the 10-year benchmark gilt yield surpassed the 6.50% mark for the first time after April 13, 2020, the yield on state development loans also crossed the 7.10% on Tuesday. Yields on central and state government bonds had peaked around the same time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/10-yr-gilt-yield-tops-6-5-after-20-mths/articleshow/88697785.cms||---

In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Jasani said strategic acquisitions would form a significant part of this vision. Although Jasani did not share any specific numbers, he said Wunderman Thompson in India is powering significant growth for the global business. “The vision is to double our size in the next three years. Although lofty, it’s a vision which we feel is going to be possible by building on this amazing legacy that we’ve had,” said Jasani. A key part of what Jasani terms as ‘Wunderman Thompson Reboot’, is to evolve from being an agency to a partner to clients. “Over the next one year will be about how we can evolve in not just offering a great brand experience but also transforming our business into a consumer experience business by owning the entire consumer experience funnel for the entire business, and not just the brand. Every touchpoint of the consumer experience, even the post purchase journey, is critical. That evolves our discussions within clients — from the CMO to CIOs, CXOs and CEOs too,” said Jasani. One of Jasani’s mandates is also to evolve the India business to what Wunderman Thompson is globally, and to take assets that India is strong in and build it globally. The 1,400-strong Wunderman Thompson India, he added, can also fuel the growth globally in terms of talent. Jasani said the firm has a strong focus on strengthening its capabilities in digital as well. Mirum India, its digital/marketing-tech company, is being seamlessly integrated with the parent. Prior to joining Wunderman Thompson as CEO, following Tarun Rai’s elevation as ED strategic initiatives (APAC), Jasani had scaled up Isobar to a 300-strong digital agency.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wunderman-thompson-aims-for-2x-biz-in-3-years/articleshow/88697781.cms||Namrata Singh

The entire Rajak family is in a state of shock.When TOI visited home of the deceased family members alleged that they had reported the matter to the cyber-crime branch two months ago but nothing happened. Only three days prior to the incident, on December 31, the cyber-crime branch had called him.They alleged that they suspect their child was blackmailed over phone by the three women online fraudsters whose names he had mentioned in the complaint he drafted before taking the extreme step.The family however was unable to understand why the deceased deleted his e-mail and formatted his mobile phone after clearing the WhatsApp chats before taking the extreme step.Govindpura police have registered a case in the matter and police have recovered his mobile phone which would now be sent to FSL for recovering the mobile data. The deceased, Shubham, alias Rohit Rajak, 20, a resident of Kasturba Nagar in Govindpura, was a third year civil engineering student.

Shobha told TOI that their family resides on rent on the first floor of the house while Shubham’s study room was on the ground floor. He allegedly took the extreme step on Monday morning while she was busy preparing tiffins. Around 11 am, when Sandeep called him on his mobile phone to check whether he would deliver the tiffins, he did not respond. When they went to his room, he did not respond and later on entry to the room they found him hanging. Shobha alleged that online women fraudsters siphoned the money deposited in his account to pay his brother’s fees. Shubham’s sister Rohini told TOI that he became a victim of online dating fraud through a phishing link. He came across the fraud link for ‘É-Friends Zone Company’ on November 17 and the three women Shalini Gupta, Sapna and Preeti posing themselves as company executives siphoned Rs 40,800 from him in six transactions within three days till November 19 on the pretext of enrolling him.

It’s an alarming trend when the Omicron threat is growing and Delta is already causing another surge in MP. While 61,819 samples were tested on December 29, it dropped to 57,843 on January 4. This, despite CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s directive to ensure 60,000 tests a day. Testing on the decline in MP for monthsThe positivity rate, which was only 0.07% on December 29, has since risen to 0.53%. If there were more tests, more Covid patients would be identified earlier, helping in their isolation and treatment. Even on Tuesday, if as many tests had been conducted as a week earlier, it could have led to a daily count of 328 - 20 more than what was reported in the bulletin. Barring the month of December, when there was a slight increase in testing compared to previous months, Covid testing in MP has been decreasing month on month. On June 26, CM Chouhan had said that no less than 80,000 tests should be conducted daily in the state, but the daily average has gone nowhere close to that. The highest daily average in the last six months was in August, when 69,764 samples would be tested daily. It dropped to 65,579 in September, and plunged to 56,115 in October and 52,334 in November.

---||Lucknow||SP is worshipper of Kans: Yogi in Aligarh||Lucknow: Unleashing one of the sharpest offensives at Samajwadi Party, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday termed the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit as the “worshipper of Kans”. Yogi said SP had played a pivotal role in orchestrating the 2014 Kosi Kalan communal riots followed by an armed conflict in Mathura’s Jawahar Bagh in 2016 in which two policemen and 24 squatters were killed. Yogi made the searing attack while inaugurating the 660MW super-critical Harduaganj thermal power unit and other developmental works in Aligarh. “Lord Krishna must also be cursing these people who claim that he comes in their dream,” Yogi said, in an apparent counter at Akhilesh who on Tuesday claimed that Krishna comes to his dream every night to tell him that he will form the government in UP. “These people are worshippers of Kans. When they were in power, they did not develop anything in Mathura, Vrindavan or Barsana. But created a Kans who was responsible for the Jawahar Bagh massacre,” he said. Yogi’s reference to Kosi Kalan riots and Jawahar Bagh incident marked BJP’s fresh combative strategy to corner SP on the issue of law and order. While riots in Kosi Kalan (a town near Mathura) brought Jats and Muslims at loggerheads, the Jawahar Bagh incident was a result of illegal occupancy of the park for two years since 2014 by an armed group led by Ram Vriksh Yadav, a follower of Jai Gurudev cult. It is alleged that Yadav was close to some prominent politicians in the SP regime. Yogi also took a swipe at Akhilesh saying: “A boy who does not go to school throughout the year cannot do anything in the last month. They stayed away from people during the pandemic and have become active ahead of elections,” he said. Comparing the state governments before and after 2017, Yogi said that in the SP regime, public money was looted and development was restricted to just one family. “Those people used to keep the money of the poor inside walls so that they could organise riots. Today, we are digging the same money out and giving tablets and smartphones to the youth, building houses for the poor,” Yogi said. He said that the new thermal power project will drive the state towards being “self-sufficient” in terms of electricity generation. “In previous governments, smartphones and laptops could not be charged in the absence of enough electricity but our government is giving electricity uninterrupted,” he said, flaying SP government for buying electricity at expensive prices and passing the burden on to the public. Yogi also hit out at Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra, besides Akhilesh, accusing them of getting restless “whenever bulldozers were set free” on their illegally occupied properties of mafias. “When bulldozers run on robbers, the brother and sister from Italy and people sitting in Saifai suffer the most,” said Yogi. The CM maintained that there was no difference between what BJP said and did. He said that there was a time when temples were demolished and defiled. “But under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, a grand Ram temple is coming up in Ayodhya and the Kashi Vishwanath corridor has been renovated,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-is-worshipper-of-kans-yogi-in-aligarh/articleshow/88698565.cms||Pankaj Shah

These cases were under trial in the former court as all the accused are or were legislators, including BJP state minister Kapil Dev Agarwal, former Congress state home minister S Saiduzzaman, former BSP MP Kadir Rana (now a member of SP), BSP ex-MLA Noor Saleem Rana (now a member of Rashtriya Lok Dal), and BSP ex-MLA Maulana Jameel (now a member of RLD). Most of the accused had allegedly made communal speeches before and during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, in which over 50 were killed and nearly 50,000 people were displaced. Sharma said, "It is a normal procedure to transfer magisterial trial cases to magistrate courts, and it is only a coincidence that the magistrate court is also a fast-track one." In the aftermath of the Muzaffarnagar riots, Saiduzzaman, Kadir Rana, Jameel, and Noor Saleem Rana were booked under Section 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) of the IPC for holding large public gatherings and allegedly making hate speeches in Khalapar locality of Muzaffarnagar on August 30, 2013. BJP state minister Kapil Dev Aggarwal, along with MLAs Umesh Malik, Sangeet Som and Vikram Saini were also booked in 2013 after a 'mahapanchayat' was held in Nagla Mandaur in Muzaffarnagar, where leaders allegedly made inflammatory speeches.

---||Bhopal||BJP & Cong in bitter exchange as cabinet reinstates happiness dept||BHOPAL: In an important decision, state cabinet headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday approved reinstatement of the ‘Happiness department’. While the BJP government here was the first to introduce a happiness department in the country in July 2016, it was later merged into the spirituality department by the erstwhile Kamal Nath regime in December 2018. The Congress had promised a spirituality department in its 2018 assembly election manifesto. Soon after it came to power, the Congress government decided to merge two departments of the BJP government – happiness and religious trust and endowment departments into one – the spiritual department. On Tuesday, the cabinet reversed the 15-month Congress government’s order and went back to the system that prevailed before the 2018 assembly elections. Now the happiness department will again come into existence along with a separate religious trust and righteousness (not endowments) department. A state government release on Tuesday said, “The council of ministers have approved the formation of the happiness department and to change the name of the spirituality department to dharmik nyas evam dharmasya vibhag.” Minister for medical education Vishwas Sarang explained, “Kamal Nath had worked to snatch away happiness from the people. Our government and especially chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan believes that a person should get satisfaction from the government’s work in his daily life. It is important that we work on the satisfaction index of our citizens. It is a very positive development that our chief minister has initiated the step to strengthen the happiness department again. We will try to end the negativity of the Congress party.” Reacting to the cabinet decision, former minister of the Kamal Nath government PC Sharma said, “Presently, people are immersed in sadness. Where will the happiness come from? From Coronavirus spread all across or the increasing unemployment? There are 40 lakh persons who are unemployed in the state today. How do you expect them to be happy? Make the daily living of citizens better and happiness will thrive in the state.You cannot distribute happiness like `prasad (offering in temples)’ to the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bjp-cong-in-bitter-exchange-as-cabinet-reinstates-happiness-dept/articleshow/88699361.cms||---

The fact being so, it would be impossible to think about an alternative political force without the Congress. Tell me the name of a leader, other than Rahul Gandhi, to lead the alternative political combine, he asked on Tuesday.Addressing a meet the press programme, Rajendran said Rahul Gandhi is a choice by default when it comes to the question of who would lead the anti-BJP camp in the current political scenario. He said CPI leader Binoy Viswam’s statements on the importance of Congress in the politics against BJP should be seen in the national context.“Such political observations need not to be interpreted in Kerala’s context. The political context in Kerala is far more different,” he added. The CPI state secretary reiterated that what Viswam said was the party’s stand and there is nothing strange or wrong in other parties, like CPM, pushing a different view on the subject.Following mixed reactions from different parties towards Viswam’s opinion, CPI mouthpiece Janayugom printed an editorial piece on the matter on Tuesday.“The reactions to the statement are quite natural. In fact it should lead to serious political discussions in the current Indian political scenario. Congress is a democratic and secular political party with pan-Indian presence. Not just the Communist party, even independent ones would agree that Congress is an integral element in any democratic, secular alternative political force,” the editorial read.It also pointed out the difference of opinion CPI has over the economic policies followed by the Congress. “There is no consensus among Left parties over political alternatives to BJP. Hence, discussions on the same should only be taken as a political process,” the editorial concluded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kanam-dares-critics-to-cite-alternative-to-rahul/articleshow/88699366.cms||---

He said the UDF would be reaching out to the poor who are going to lose their land and properties. “He is more interested in appeasing the corporates than the common man. He is not willing to speak to the people’s representatives or to the common man. He is also not interested in listening to the concerns or grievances of the common man,’’ said Satheesan on the sessions convened by the chief minister meeting eminent personalities from diverse sections for detailing about the SilverLine project. The Congress and the UDF will reach out to those people who are going to suffer with this project. The CPM which has been in the forefront fighting for the rights of downtrodden has now changed its policies to appease the corporates, he added. KPCC president K Sudhakaran made it clear that the Congress will not allow to conduct the alignment work and also the land acquisition for the project. The Congress would parade the people against the land acquisition. All the stones laid as part of the alignment work will be thrown away by the party workers. “If the law and order becomes a crisis due to this, then the CM would be responsible for this. The chief minister should convince the people of the state about the concerns raised against the project. The Congress is ready to withdraw all its agitation if the chief minister is ready for this,’’ said Sudhakaran. The KPCC president said the chief minister is eyeing at the commission he wouldget from this project and that was the reason why he is so adamant, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-not-concerned-about-common-man-congress/articleshow/88699372.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Will go ahead with SilverLine project: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||Thiruvananthapuram: Hinting that the government is determined to go ahead with the proposed SilverLine project, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan recounted the projects that were initially sidelined as impossible to execute but could successfully be completed by the LDF government. He cited the examples of national highway development, GAIL pipeline project and Kochi-Edamon powerline project that were successfully completed or put back into track in the state after his government took over in 2016. “There are some vested interests behind protests against such projects. I can cite three examples at this juncture. In 2016, when the LDF came to power, the general notion was that even the normal developments will not be possible in the state. The disappointment was palpable then. It was because the people’s experience was like that,” Vijayan said. He said that when the UDF government convened an all-party meeting for NH development in which he had participated as the CPM representative, the project did not make any progress despite all the parties agreeing to widening the NH to 45 metres. “In 2016, when the LDF government came to power, the government decided that such projects were necessary for the state. The government decided to go ahead with it. At present, land has been acquired, and each tendering is going in reach-by-reach from Thalappady. When the government stood with those who had to give up their land for the expansion, except two or three, all other people cooperated with the government,” the CM said. Regarding the GAIL pipeline, he said that even the GAIL authorities decided that it will not happen in Kerala. “When I met the Prime Minister after taking charge in 2016, the Prime Minister asked me to complete the project as early as possible. I promised the Prime Minister that I would come back with the progress of the project. The project has been completed and the gas transmission has begun through the pipeline,” Vijayan said. He said similarly, the completion of Kochi-Edamon power line was necessary for bringing the power generated at Kudankulam to the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/will-go-ahead-with-silverline-project-cm/articleshow/88699374.cms||---

The newly described species ´Monoceromyia flavoscutata´ and ´M. nigra´ belongs family Syrphidae. The findings have been published in the Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology. The members of the genus are extremely rare with only 12 species reported from India previously. New species discovery in this rare genus is happening in India after 80 years. They were discovered by H Sankararaman, a PhD scholar from Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, Anooj S S, an assistant professor of Kerala Agricultural University, and Ximo Mengual, a scientist from Alexander Koenig Zoological Research Museum, Germany.Surveys were conducted in evergreen forests of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Arunachal Pradesh as part of the study.In addition to the two new species the researchers have revised the genus and re-described seven existing species in the genus. They also found that two species ´Monoceromyia multipunctata´ and ´M. polistoides´ previously described were synonymous. The new species ´M. flavoscutata´ discovered from Thadiyankudisai in Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, was named after its yellow coloured thoracic ends and can be differentiated from the closely resembling species based on the coloration of the thorax and the wing vein characters whereas the other new species ´M. nigra´ discovered from West Siang, of Basar district of Arunachal Pradesh differed from the near species based on thoracic, abdominal and facial coloration and wing vein character, it was named as nigra based on the black coloured the thorax.This genus is recognized by their facial projection from which their antennae arises, petiolated abdomen and coloration which mimic thread-waisted wasps to escape predators.The one discovered from Western Ghats was observed to show a peculiar habit of egg laying on tree sap. The immature stages of the genus are reported to show interesting habitat preferences like sap runs and rot holes of trees, colonies of stingless bees and water fills of plants like bamboo and agave. The discovery of such rare species with specialized habitat preferences highlights the diversity richness of the Western Ghats and North Eastern India and the need for conservation of the natural vegetation , the researchers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/researchers-discover-new-species-of-wasp-like-flower-flies/articleshow/88699376.cms||---

According to SVP hospital officials, the flier insisted on being isolated at home, and got many VIPs to call up the authorities to prevent his hospital stay. He was not the only one to behave in this manner, said officials, adding, “We tackled five others like him this fortnight.” “The man from Gota had arrived from Switzerland four days ago. For nearly 10 hours — four hours on the day of his arrival and six hours the following day — he posed as if he knew only Switzerland’s Covid protocol, and that Indian laws were alien to him,” said a senior doctor at SVP. AMC officials spent four hours explaining the Indian protocol for Omicron to him, but the man demanded more time to understand. “In the end, he agreed to follow the rules. We requested asked him to come to the hospital in 108 ambulance the next day,” added the SVP hospital official. However, the zonal AMC officials began getting calls the next morning. A senior medical specialist, a councillor, an influential businessman and even a member of temple administration called up to the hospital visit postponed. “By noon, we were sure that visitor had no intention of coming to the hospital. By 2 pm, he stopped picking up calls. He later told AMC officials that he had gone for an RT-PCR test,” the SVP official added. The officials told him that as he had violated Omicron quarantine norms and ventured out, he would be placed under arrest. This finally got the guest to quietly sit in the 108 ambulance and get admitted to SVP hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/arrest-threat-gets-swiss-flier-to-quarantine-at-svp-hospital/articleshow/88699385.cms||---

However, the total number of birds spotted decreased from 1,674 to 1,521 in this range in Meerut district. “Out of the 45 species spotted here, 24 are resident species and 21 migratory species. Five of these species are in the ‘threatened’ category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list,” said TK Roy, Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) Delhi state coordinator, Wetlands International. The day-long bird count exercise on Sunday, revealed a decrease in the number of Bar-headed Geese (365), Gadwal and Common Teal and an increase in Ruddy Shelduck (47), and Greylag Geese (50) in comparison to previous years. The Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary falls in the Central Asian Flyway and its wetlands, comprising marshes, ponds and lakes, provide a natural habitat for water birds. “Last year, due to good monsoon, several dried-up wetlands, especially seasonal marshlands on the Ganga floodplains, revived and attracted a good number of long-distance winter migratory water birds, especially ducks, Geese and a few waders. But in the January, 2022 census, a large number of migratory birds have disappeared due to shrinking of the wetlands caused by human interference,” added Roy. The AWC is an annual exercise to count the waterbirds and monitor the wetlands for conservation of migratory birds and their habitats along the Central Asian Flyway. The census, which began on January 1, is being carried out across Asia and Australasia simultaneously, and will conclude on January 16. The census in Hastinapur witnessed the participation of a student volunteer team from the department of environmental science, Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, led by Prof A K Chaubey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/increase-in-waterbird-species-drop-in-numbers-at-hastinapur-range-census-2022/articleshow/88697403.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Hospital occupancy up tenfold in 12 days||AHMEDABAD: On December 23, private hospitals in Ahmedabad had seven Covid patients. Three were in ICU, two in high-dependency unit (HDU), and one each in isolation and on ventilator bed. Twelve days later on January 4, the number has increased tenfold to 73. The number includes 49 patients in isolation, 18 in HDU, two in ICU, and four on ventilators. State-run hospitals have 19 Covid patients, majority in isolation wards. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, the president of Ahmedabad Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that private hospitals have recorded a major spike over the past two to three days. “The overall profile of patients indicates them being above 45 years of age, having one or more comorbidities, and a previous medical history,” he said. “Many are in isolation on medical advice.” According to AHNA members, the city has 2,150 beds in private hospitals including 183 ventilator beds and 367 ICU beds. The officials said that if needed, the infrastructure can be ramped up. Government-run hospitals in city have over 1,700 beds that can be made available at short notice, said officials, adding that oxygen demand has remained low so far. AHNA vice president Anish Chandarana said that majority of the patients are vaccinated, and perhaps that is why the cases are less severe and the mortality is low compared to the second wave. “Almost none of the patients require oxygen as opposed to the second wave,” he said. “The HRCT score is very low and prevalence of hypoxia is very low too.” He said doctors prescribe remdesivir to some patients in the early phase to prevent complications. “Some patients are also advised to take an antibody cocktail depending on their condition and the overall health profile,” said Dr Nirav Visavadia, a critical care physician. “The majority, however, don’t need heavy medication or steroids compared to the second wave.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hospital-occupancy-up-tenfold-in-12-days/articleshow/88699388.cms||Parth Shastri

The reduction will come into force from midnight on Tuesday and will boost aviation services and tourism in the state, the state government said. VAT on ATF will now be 5%. On December 13, the state government had reduced VAT by 5%. The state government said the decision will boost tourism in the state. Tourism industry sources said the reduction of VAT on ATF will make ATF cheaper and make it more viable for airlines to operate from airports in Gujarat. ATF accounts for the major cost component in flight fares. Manish Sharma, chairman of the Gujarat chapter of the Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), said, “Intrastate movement will get a big boost with this decision as airlines operating within the state will get cheaper fuel and will be able to pass on the benefit to customers. This will also increase demand. At the same time, interstate movements will improve with better connectivity as operating from here will be more viable for airlines. Customers will get the benefit only if airlines choose to pass it on to them. Overall, the decision is definitely in the interest of the tourism sector, which has gone through turbulent times since the pandemic began.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-slashes-vat-on-atf-by-20/articleshow/88699389.cms||---

In the German legend, Hamelin refuses to pay the piper’s dues so he leads a precious force, children, away from the town. But in Pandit Chaurasia’s case, his flute helps people clear cultural dues. He shepherds rasikas to the classical high ground, away from mass culture which makes our sensibilities incur wasteful expenses.Audiences love Pandit Chaurasia because he has the infinite capacity to soften his eminence into humour and conversation. “I feel great performing at Saptak,” he said. “Music lovers wait for me and I also want to meet them!”In another recital on Wednesday, Ahmedabad sitarist Amita Dalal will reiterate the point that Saptak’s music is deepened by the echoes from the Hindustani pantheon. Dalal is the disciple of Manju Mehta, the Saptak guardian and an illustrious sitarist. Pandit Ravi Shankar was the guru of not only Mehta but also of the Mohan Veena maestro, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Dalal considers Pandit Bhatt a mentor. So in Dalal’s accomplished playing, one can see fingers gliding across the frets of a grand legacy. “In 2020, I presented a unique bandish in Shyam Kalyan composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar,” Dalal said. “I learnt it as part of the guru-shishya parampara. The composition bears all the hallmarks of Pandit Ravi Shankar’s genius.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/flute-legend-plays-toi-memory/articleshow/88699397.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

Roughly 80% of the 40,000 property units or dwellings do not have ‘Building Use’ (BU) permissions that fulfill requirements under the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act. Many of these properties that were constructed from the 1980s till the early 2000s have additional floors and extra constructions.With the AMC continuing its sealing drive in the rest of the city following the high court’s orders, several legal questions have arisen for these newly incorporated areas. The AMC faced a similar issue when other areas were incorporated into the municipal limits earlier. “In 1986, 70% of the properties in areas such as Isanpur and in the surrounding green belt had no BU permission,” said a senior AMC official of the south west zone. “Then in 2006, 60% of the buildings had no BU permission in Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Jodhpur, Thaltej, and other areas.” Most buildings with valid BU permissions were built only after 2007, the official said.As for Bopal-Ghuma and Kathwada areas, officials said that plans were passed arbitrarily when they were under the gram panchayat and then again when they were brought under the nagarpalika limits. “Building plans were passed without much scrutiny from the 1980s till the early 2000s and the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) used to charge an ‘unauthorized construction fee’ but no demolition was ordered,” said the senior AMC official. “Legally speaking, there are several irregularities in the original plans of most buildings in the Bopal-Ghuma area.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bu-quandary-for-thousands-of-families-in-bopal-ghuma/articleshow/88699398.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Ahmedabad||Road accident fatality rate up from 12% in 2013 to 31% in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: With every passing year, a greater proportion of road accidents in the city have involved a death. This is apparent from city traffic police data, which shows that while 12% of accidents involved a death in 2013, the figure was 31% by 2021. According to city traffic police, there were 1,888 road accident cases in 2013 of which 227, or 12%, involved a fatality. This percentage has been increasing ever since 2013. The past three years have been particularly bad, with at least 31% of road accidents resulting in a fatality. Traffic police officials said the greater part of the city’s accidents have occurred on highways and ring roads. “With new establishments being set up and greater activity on the outer ring road, road accidents there have increased,” said a traffic police officer. Officials said the other reason for more fatal accidents is people not employing safety measures while driving. “Some 91,357 offences were registered for helmets not being used, and 72,680 for seatbelts not being used. These two are the most common traffic offences every year. This means people do not take safety measures seriously and either lose their lives or suffer injuries in accidents,” said a police officer. Another traffic police officer said the number of vehicles in the city has also been increased, due to which the number of accidents and rate of fatalities have been rising too. Deputy commissioner of police, city traffic (admin), Tejas Patel, said that as roads have become smoother and broader, people drive faster and meet with accidents. “Fatal accidents occur when one of the vehicles involved is at high speed,” said Patel. He said pedestrians and two-wheeler riders account for the largest share of road accident deaths. Patel said that even in the past two years, when vehicle movement was restricted due to the lockdown and night curfew, the proportion of fatal accidents remained high, as people drove fast on relatively empty roads, and enforcement was more lax.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/road-accident-fatality-rate-up-from-12-in-2013-to-31/articleshow/88699399.cms||---

According to Sola police, victim Kailash Panchal had been married to Mahadev Panchal for 32 years. However, the couple was childless and this often led to the husband allegedly harassing her and beating her up over frivolous pretexts. “Around two-and-a-half years ago, Mahadev got into a live-in relationship with his girlfriend, a mother of two aged 28 and 20. They began living together at his Chandlodia residence. Whenever Kailash objected to this relationship, he would thrash her and force her to go to her parents’ house in Chandlodia,” said inspector J P Jadeja of Sola police station. However, according to Kailash’s brother Vasudev, their parents would send her back to Mahadev, hoping his behaviour towards her would change some day. On Sunday, after a showdown with her husband, Kailash came over to her parents’ house. She pleaded with her family members to either let her live with them or convince Mahadev to stop beating her up. However, Vasudev dropped her back to Mahadev’s house and asked him to treat her well, the FIR stated. Around 11am that day, Mahadev called up Vasudev and informed him that Kailash had committed suicide. Jadeja said that when the cops reached the spot, Mahadev tried to misguide the cops saying she had fainted due to low blood pressure and was declared brought dead by doctors at a private hospital. Mahadev and Hansa have been booked for abetment to suicide, Jadeja said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/harassed-by-husband-his-live-in-partner-sola-woman-kills-self/articleshow/88699401.cms||---

Senior forest department officials who asked not to be named said sightings of the species are increasing in the state’s sloth bear corridor — Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Mehsana, Chhota Udepur, Panchmahals, Vadodara, Dahod and Narmada districts. Nishith Dharaiya, associate professor of life sciences at Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University, who has been studying sloth bears said, “Sightings in areas such as Satlasana and Kheralu in Mehsana have become regular. Kheralu is just 100-odd km from Ahmedabad. “Sightings are also increasing in Chhota Udepur. In Pavi Jetpur, a 25-year-old man was injured by a sloth bear. The youth was returning from his field in the evening when the encounter took place. Dharaiya is also a member of the expert team on the sloth bear at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). He also runs an NGO, Wildlife Conservation Biology Research Foundation. He said, “At this Vibrant Gujarat summit, we (the NGO) are signing an MoU with the forest department to carry out Poonam Avalokan (full moon counts) for sloth bears, as is done for lions. These counts will be taken up every two months and will help research teams and NGOs working in the area to identify new home ranges and raise awareness.” He said it is very important to start conservation exercises and disseminate information about the species among the people living near it and spread information to increase their tolerance level. IUCN has stated that sloth bear are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most used by people. Poaching and trade in sloth bears or their parts is also common in many parts of their range, including the capture and removal of cubs from the wild. They are also killed by people who apprehend threats to their life or livestock. “Given the aggressive nature of the animal, and increasing encounters between bears and people, they are widely feared. Although education may help reduce bear-human conflict, the root of the problem is largely deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of encounters between people and bears,” the IUCN report states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-bullish-on-sloth-bear-numbers/articleshow/88699403.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

A resolution to this effect was issued by the government on January 3.The resolution reads, “After careful consideration, the government has decided to extend the date of commercial production for industrial undertaking registered under this scheme. Industrial undertaking registered under this scheme will have to commence commercial production by July 24, 2022.” Several units, which are presently under development, will get time for completion. According to government data, projects worth over Rs 12,000 crore registered under the 2016 policy, are nearing completion.A key source close to the development said, “A number of industries that have invested over Rs 500 crore or even Rs 1,000 crore are finding difficulty in commencing commercial production due to the unexpected disruption of production plans due to the second wave of Covid pandemic. They will benefit from the decision. Also, the decision is not negatively impacting the government financially.”Many industries that have started development of the industrial units but could not got registration under the 2016 scheme have also requested for the registration under the old policy, thereby allowing them to start commercial production by July 2022. “The reason behind this is that compared to the 2020 policy, industries find the 2016 policy more lucrative. The government will have to take a call on whether they should be allowed registration under the lapsed policy,” sources said.Sources added that the since this is an election year, there is a fair chance that the government will accede to all demands of the industry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/deadline-for-industrial-policy-benefits-extended/articleshow/88699404.cms||---

However, the company has issued a statement, denying the charges. It claimed that the alleged irregularities were pertaining to the period prior to AM/NS India taking over the project. “AM/NS India acquired Essar Steel India in December 2019 as a result of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process through the National Company Law Tribunal and subsequent legal process in the most transparent manner. We would like to bring to your notice that AM/NS India has approached the Gujarat government to regularise the allotment to the company,” the company said in a statement. Addressing a press conference in Ahmedabad, Congress leader Modhvadia said, “Earlier AM/NS was given advanced possession of 72.48 hectare land by the state government at an ad hoc price of Rs 700 per sq m with a condition to pay the market value of land which would be decided later. AMNS had paid Rs 127 crore on an ad hoc basis by calculating 2.5 times the ad hoc valuation. However, the said 72.48 hectare land parcels were valued at Rs 16,520 per sq m by the district level valuation committee chaired by the district collector.” He claimed that the state government was planning to overlook the district collector’s views and give away the land parcels at much cheaper rates. “If the land valuation is carried on as per current arrangement instead of existing rules and regulations, the state government will suffer a loss and AM/NS will stand to benefit to the tune of Rs. 9,861.74 crore,” said Modhvadia. AM/NS India denied the allegations and clarified that the land allotment process is being carried out according to the established procedures. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cong-alleges-land-given-for-steel-project-at-cheap-rates/articleshow/88699405.cms||---

He was speaking at the Sant Sammelan on Tuesday at the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. About 1,000 saints and seers from various parts of the state attended the event. The event was organized by Dharmacharya Aashirwad Samiti, Karnavati (Ahmedabad). The event was organized to seek blessings for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath corridor in Varanasi on December 13. The corridor in Varanasi — the parliamentary constituency of Modi — connects the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the Ganga. Last year, the BJP government passed an amendment to Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act to provide for a prison sentence of up to 10 years for fraudulent or forcible conversion by marriage. Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti’s national president Avichal Das said Hindus have finally started voting for Hindus. “The sants should appreciate the good work done by PM Modi in places like Ayodhya and Kashi,” he said. “Modi is like a soaring kite and we have to ensure that he remains high up.” Gujarat chief minister Patel in his speech lauded the PM for restoring Hindu shrines. He said the Kashi Vishwanath temple was demolished during the time of Aurangzeb. He said the restored temple was unveiled by PM Modi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cm-making-efforts-to-thwart-marriage-for-conversion/articleshow/88699406.cms||---

The hospital was mooted near Sheelanagar for the benefit of the working class community covered under the ESI Act.The state government had allotted seven acres of land at Sheelanagar for a 300-bed hospital. Later, the government wanted to make it a 500-bed facility and gave approval for additional land. The proposed hospital with a strength of more than 120 staff would provide medical services to more than 12 lakh beneficiaries in and around Visakhapatnam, who are covered under the ESI scheme. The then Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya laid the foundation stone for the hospital in 2016. The ESI central board member Prasantanandan Chowdary visited the project site on Monday and expressed dissatisfaction. He demanded the government to start construction of the hospital immediately as private persons have set sight on the site and are waiting for an opportunity to grab the land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/board-member-rues-delay-in-esi-hosp-work/articleshow/88699413.cms||Siva G

According to the VMRDA officials, the project will involve land acquisition to the tune of 346 acres in 9 villages lying adjacent to the proposed project. The land acquisition alone is expected to cost about 942 crore. The state government has accorded its approval for the land acquisition. The proposed six-lane road spans about 20.2 kilometres in length, and passes through Kongavanipalem, Kancheru, Kancherupalem, Annavaram, Chippada, Mulakuddu, Kummaripalem, Bheemunipatnam villages on the beachfront. Amid the government’s plans to shift executive capital to Visakhapatnam, speculations are rife that the key offices of the capital may come up in the stretch between Madhurawada and Bheemunipatnam. The proposed greenfield international airport works in Bhogapuram are also expected to begin sometime this year. Even the proposed metro rail project has been extended to Bhogapuram airport. All these factors point to the need for improved mobility options. The Bheemili-Bhogapuram road is expected to serve as an alternative to the national highway in the future, particularly for those going to and fro the airport. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner K Venkata Ramana Reddy said that peg marking for the land acquisition for Bhogapuram-Bheemili greenfield beach road corridor will be completed in about a month’s time. “Those, who may have to part with their lands due to the project, will be compensated. They can opt for either money or transferable development rights (TDRs). The state government has promised 67 crore for the initial works,” said Reddy. As per the plans, the road alignment of this beach corridor will integrate all those stretches which are already abutting the shore. The corridor is expected to enable radial connectivity of the main road with the nearest strategic locations such as highway points, social infrastructure, tourism locations, etc. The corridor will provide avenues for development of a wide variety of tourist attractions, logistic hubs, urban and social development projects, service industries, etc. along with the road project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-gets-ready-for-beach-corridor-project/articleshow/88699414.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Of them, roughly 1.86 crores are first doses and 1.14 crore are second doses.”A statement issued by the minister’s office later in the day says Jharkhand administered one crore vaccine doses on August 5, 2021, and crossed the two-crore figure on October 24. “The government achieved this milestone in 11 months and seven days even though the state was provided with very little doses in the initial phase (of the nationwide vaccination drive),” the statement reads.Though Gupta lauded his department’s efforts publicly, the state has missed the December 25 deadline given to the state government by the Centre to fully vaccinate its adult population. As per the vaccination figures issued by the state health department on Tuesday morning, nearly 77% of all eligible adult beneficiaries have taken their first doses. The second dosage coverage figures are dismal as only 47% has taken the jabs so far. As many as 2.41 crore adults are eligible for the jabs in the states. To make matters worse, as many as 17 out of the 24 districts have been able to administer the second dose to less than 50% of their respective adult populations. East Singhbhum district, which comprises the urban circle of Jamshedpur, has administered the most second doses (67% of their adults) while Sahibganj in the tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana division has the lowest (39%).In December last year, chief minister Hemant Soren reviewed the status of vaccination in the districts and mandated the health department to ensure that all of Jharkhand’s eligible adults are fully vaccinated (which includes both doses) by January 15.While Gupta remained unresponsive to TOI’s calls and health secretary Arun Kumar Singh could not be reached, the administrations of various districts claimed that 100% immunization of the adult population will be possible only around February this year.A deputy commissioner of the Santhal Pargana division said, “In my district, nearly 15% of the adult population got their first doses in November last year and they are not due for the second dose until mid-January. Nearly 70,000 eligible people have taken their first doses outside Jharkhand while around 65,000 people are not eligible for their second doses for more than a fortnight.”Another DC said the second dose coverage in his district has taken a hit due to the lack of awareness. “During the first dose drive, the beneficiaries were given cards bearing CM Hemant Soren’s picture. However, the health workers did not put the second due dates on the cards and as a result, the beneficiaries are not aware of when to take the second dose. We will be able to achieve 100% first dose coverage only by February this year,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/banna-lauds-milestone-of-inoculating-3cr-vax-doses/articleshow/88699420.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Vineesh, 17, son of Shibu of Kallumpootta Puthan House, Oolampara near Peroorkada, Sidharth, 17, son of Shibu and Bindhu of Karoorkonam Kulathinkara House near Peroorkada and Stefin Vinod, 17, son of Vinod of JP 12/19, Hilltop Garden, Puravoorkonam near Vazhayila are the deceased. The police said that as per preliminary evidence collected, the mishap occurred around 4 pm after the motorcycle which was traveling at high speed apparently strayed off the road and rammed into a tree. The vehicle was reportedly ridden by Vineesh. It is suspected that Vineesh lost control of the motorcycle causing it to stray from the road eventually leading to the collision. Though they were rushed to hospital their lives could not be saved. All three youths were students of higher secondary class. While Vineesh was a class XI student of Government Higher Secondary School, Medical College, Sidharth and Stefin Vinod were class XI students of Concordia Lutheran Higher Secondary School, Kudappanakkunnu. The police also said that the motorcycle that the youths rode was a high performing vehicle called Honda X Blade with a 160 CC engine. It belonged to their common friend Adarsh of Mannamoola. Adarsh, a BCom student, has reportedly told the police that Vineesh and Sidharth turned up at his residence around 3 pm and took the motorcycle out. They then picked up Stefin from his residence at Puravoorkonam. Adarsh also told the police that he had called Vineesh on phone and demanded to return the vehicle moments before the accident occurred. Hence, the police suspect that the teenagers were speeding in a hurry to return the vehicle. Aruvikkara station house officer inspector D Shibu said that the police were collecting details of the ownership of the motorcycle. ‘’Since Vineesh did not have a driving license, being underage, the registered owner of the vehicle would be booked for providing him the vehicle. The case in that regard will be registered in the coming day,” the inspector said. Accident at Vithura: In another incident a 57-year-old man died on Tuesday near Vithura after a concrete mixer that was being towed by a jeep overturned and fell over him.

"We should see the peak in cases between January 6 and 13," said professor Sandeep Juneja from TIFR's school of technology and computer science. "It will take another month for cases to come down while peak fatalities will be seen around the first week of February," he said. On Tuesday, the Mumbai daily tally breached the 10,000-mark - a milestone crossed only thrice during the Delta wave - and Juneja said the Omicron wave could break the 16,000-plus-mark daily. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said BMC's internal projections estimate a peak around mid-January with cases touching 20,000. The study, that is based on data from South Africa and UK, expects deaths to be 30% to 50% of the second wave, and hospitalisation to be "around 50-70% of the peak seen under Delta".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/peak-in-mumbai-around-jan-6-13-deaths-may-be-half-of-delta-toll-say-scientists/articleshow/88699438.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mysuru||15 tigers died in K’taka in 2021||Milton.LawrenceMysuru: Karnataka has witnessed 15 tiger deaths in 2021. All the deaths took place in tiger reserves and there was no foul play. Bandipur had seven deaths, Nagarahole had six while Bhadra and Biligiri Ranganatha Temple (BRT) reserves had one death each. Of the total deaths, three were cubs – while two were found dead in Bandipur Tiger Reserve, one cub was found dead in BRT. Karnataka has five tiger reserves with over 524 big cats with Bandipur and Nagarahole having the highest tiger population. Karnataka ranks second in having the highest tiger population in the wild after Madhya Pradesh, which has 526 tigers. According to the statistics available at National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the country saw 126 tiger deaths last year, the highest in the last decade. Karnataka is ranked third after Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In March, carcasses of a male and a female tiger cub were found in a decomposed state in Nugu range of Bandipur reserve while another cub was found in June in K Gudi beat in BRT. BRT deputy conservator of Forests G Santhosh Kumar said the reserve witnessed the death of a tiger cub due to natural causes. About 86 tigers are utilizing the tiger reserve, he said. Nagarahole director D Mahesh Kumar said no case of tiger poaching was reported in the reserve in 2021. ‘Prey base cause for growth’Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, Karnataka, Vijayakumar Gogi told TOI that prey bases play a crucial role in conserving tigers. Providentially, the prey base is good and developing in Karnataka. As a result, the number of big cats has increased from 300 to 400 and now to 524 in the last one-and-a-half decades. Naturally, there are challenges connected with the rise in the number of tigers. The young big cats in a bid to mark their territory in national parks or tiger reserves edge out the old or sub-adult tiger from their territories. Consequently, the injured or weak tigers become vulnerable, he said. Regarding deaths, Gogi said a majority of tigers die of natural causes like illness, injuries sustained in infighting, and old age. Sometimes tigers put themselves in danger by trying to prey on animals like gaur bulls or elephants that are beyond their size. When tiger numbers are increasing, it is a dynamic situation for authorities, and ensuring 100% survival is literally challenging, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/15-tigers-died-in-ktaka-in-2021/articleshow/88699439.cms||Lawrence Milton

It is only to lay claim to credit for getting the project implemented that Congress leaders are planning the padayatra, he said. Speaking to reporters, he said the state government is serious about implementing the project. “But Congress leaders are seeking to gain political mileage by planning to hold a padayatra from Mekedatu,” he said, adding since the project could be green lightened soon and Congress has timed the padayatra to lay claim to the project implementation. He denied that the government is seeking to impose lockdown in the state to stop the Congress padayatra. “It is our job to safeguard the public,” he shot back pointing to the rising number of Covid cases in Bengaluru. “We have asked Congress to stop the padayatra to ensure the positivity rate stays low.

The announcement was made by the forest department, after a cow was killed by a tiger, in a cattle shed. A tiger, which is suspected to be a male, had entered the Antharasanthe village, and had killed the cow, which was in the cattle shed of a house. The incident has sent chills down the spine of residents, who have demanded that foresters trap the tiger immediately, before there is a loss of human life. Villagers had sighted the tiger and its pug marks near the village, and had informed the forest department recently. Foresters had installed camera traps at a few places. The cameras had captured a few pictures of the tiger prowling in the village.The foresters have forwarded the tiger photos captured in the camera traps to the Tiger Cell in Aranya Bhavan in Bengaluru for documentation, said Antharasanthe range forest officer (RFO) Siddaraju. The experts at the cell will analyse the unique features of the tiger, like its stripes, by comparing it with photos in their database, to identify the tiger. The cell will provide details of the tiger’s age, sex, previous sightings and its movements to the foresters, which will help in taking further action.In order to catch the tiger, a cage has been placed near the carcass of the cow, which the tiger had killed two days back, as the animal may return there, said Siddaraju.Meanwhile, through the forest staff and village leaders, the department is also spreading awareness among people, to avoid venturing out of their houses from 6 pm to 8 am, for releasing water for their crops in their farms, or attending to nature’s call, as a tiger was found near Mahadeshwara Temple in Antharasanthe. Foresters requested the villagers not to leave their cattle outside during the night, and inform the foresters if they notice the movement of a tiger or leopard in their area. “The tiger had killed a head of cattle on January 2. The DCF and other officials had visited the spot and inspected the area. We have asked villagers not to venture out of their houses at night, to prevent any untoward incident. We are hoping to trap the tiger soon,” the RFO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/tiger-threat-villagers-asked-not-to-step-out-at-night/articleshow/88699444.cms||---

The HC held that this amounted to desertion. “The auspicious time is meant for happy family life. Instead, in this instant matter, it appears that auspicious time (shubh-muhurat) was used as a tool barrier by the wife to start their matrimonial home,” observed a division bench, comprising Justice Goutam Bhaduri and Justice Rajani Dubey. The court ordered that the marriage be dissolved under the Hindu Marriage Act by a decree of divorce. The wife, in full knowledge of the facts, had deserted the husband, so he was entitled to get a divorce, the judges said in the order passed last month. A copy of it has now been made available. Appellant Santosh Singh had moved HC, challenging a family court order, which had dismissed his petition for divorce on the grounds of desertion. According to his petition, he got married in July 2010 and he and his wife lived together for only about 11 days after which her family members came and took her away, saying they had some important work. The husband tried to get her back twice but was turned down on the ground that it was not an ‘auspicious time’. Singh then filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which was decreed ex parte. In response to the petition, the wife contended that she was ready and willing to join her husband but he did not return to take her back when the auspicious time started, which according to their custom was necessary. The wife also submitted that she had not deserted her husband and that he had failed to take her back as per their prevailing custom. Singh’s counsel, however, submitted that the wife knew that the decree for restitution of conjugal rights had been passed but she still didn’t join her husband in matrimonial life. The wife’s counsel submitted that the custom prevailing between the two parties was that during the ceremony of ‘Duviragaman’, the husband was required to come personally and take his wife back. The counsel argued that when the husband came to take her back, it was not an auspicious time, as per the advice of the pandit and elders of the family, and he was advised to come back at a particular auspicious time to take her back but he failed to turn up. The high court, in its order, observed that the defence of ‘custom’ raised by the wife has not been proved in trial court, and granted the divorce decree.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wife-makes-man-wait-10-years-for-shubh-muhurat-hc-grants-divorce/articleshow/88699448.cms||---

The court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Bhupendra Kumar Vasnikar granted the transit remand of Kalicharan to the Maharashtra Police. The Hindu seer faces separate cases in his home state Maharashtra for his alleged derogatory comments against the Father of the Nation and also for making inflammatory remarks during an event in Pune in December. The CJM ordered the police team to produce Kalicharan, who hails from Akola city in eastern Maharashtra, in a Pune court by January 6. The Raipur police apprehended Kalicharan Maharaj alias Abhijeet Dhananjay Saraag from a rented room near Bageshwar Dham, located about 25km from Khajuraho town in Madhya Pradesh, on December 30. On December 26, an FIR was registered against the seer at the Tikrapara police station in Raipur under IPC sections 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and 294 (obscene acts) for allegedly using derogatory words against Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the police added 124A (sedition) and four other sections of the IPC in the case. The case in Chhattisgarh stemmed from his remarks at a two-day ‘dharma sansad’ (religious parliament) that concluded in Raipur on December 26. At the conclave, the seer had allegedly used abusive words against the Father of the Nation, and asked people to elect a staunch Hindu leader as the head of the government in order to protect the religion. A case has been registered against the religious leader in Akola, while Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad has filed a separate police complaint in Thane city against him over his alleged remarks against Mahatma Gandhi.

---||Kochi||Home dept comes under ‘friendly’ fire||Idukki: The delegates at the CPM district meeting on Tuesday demanded a separate minister for home affairs as the police force in the state was being misused by some elements. The actions of the police were adversely affecting the goodwill of the government, they said. “A reshuffle was needed in the police force. The party should intervene for effective functioning of the police. Some elements within the force were working against government interests. Initiatives are needed to find such elements and take corrective measures. The police association is not active and it failed to identify those in the force acting like spies, thereby bringing bad reputation to the government’s good work,” said the delegates. The delegates criticized Idukki district police chief too, saying that senior police officials from other states are working for their own interests. They have no interest or respect for the state or its people, the delegates added. Though chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan took the stand that party leaders should not intervene in the home department, some leaders of LDF allies, including CPI, influence the police force through bribery, said delegates. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said that the CPM state secretariat would take action against former Devikulam MLA S Rajendran. Talking to media at Kumily on Tuesday, he said that the district committee has recommended action against Rajendran and a letter submitted by the former MLA was with the secretariat. The next secretariat meeting will consider the issue and take action accordingly, said Kodiyeri. Kodiyeri admits police lapses At the meeting, Kodiyeri admitted the police lapses. Kodiyeri agreed to discuss the issue with the chief minister and find a solution immediately. Officials have more relationship with animals and that is why the police officers often behave like animals, alleged Kodiyeri. Factionalism to the fore in Alappuzha CPM Even as Alappuzha district conference of CPM is slated for January 28, 29 and 30, factionalism in the party has reared its head during the area conferences.

P Subash Chandra Bose, a native of Togummi village in Kovvur mandal in West Godavari and B Venkata Durga Prasad from Vadapalli village moved the high court challenging the inaction of district authorities in taking preventive measures in accordance with the earlier orders of the high court to stop cockfights. The petitioners argued that despite the orders from the high court and the apex court, cockfights are being conducted in and around Kovvur mandal during Sankranti season. They said MLAs and MPs have turned gamblers and are encouraging people to participate in cockfights which involve betting, illicit liquor, gambling and cruelty to animals and birds. The petitioners stated that they have submitted representations to the police to prevent cockfights as arrangements are being made in the villages under the supervision of MLAs and local politicians. They contended that because of the unabated cockfights, local villagers are facing several problems. With free flow of liquor, obscene dances and anti-social elements, women in the villages are unable to even come out of their homes during the festive season, they said. The petitioners added that every year, the high court is giving orders and the officials are submitting that they are taking action against the cockfights. They alleged that the officials are submitting action taken reports for the sake of record but on the ground they are not taking any action and every year cockfights and other gambling activities are being organised in large scale without any hindrance.

Industry estimates suggest that cancellations of bookings at hotels have risen to 30-50%, in different properties with both leisure and corporate travel declining in January. Industry representatives said the government was likely to resort to more stringent prohibitions like weekend curfews and curbs on inter-state movement which will further hit the tourism industry. Rajvijay Singh, joint secretary of Hotels, Restaurants Association of Rajasthan (HRAR), said, “Instead of capping the number of people in weddings to 100, the state government can consider bio-bubble and allow more people.” January has around six wedding dates which means the bookings could cover almost whole of the fortnight. February too has eight weddings spread in the first 20 days. Confirming that cancellations, Singh said some weddings have been cancelled, while others will happen with reduced number of people as per government guidelines. “Those who did not want to compromise with the number of guests have postponed or cancelled. Instead of capping the numbers, a bio-bubble mechanism could have saved some weddings for the industry,” added Singh. Leisure and corporate travel have also come down significantly after a good December. Gajendra Luniwal, president of Jaipur Hotel Association, said, “The inflow of travelers have reduced. Additionally, the corporate people visiting for business activities have also stopped travelling. January is a peak month of tourism and travel when the hotels clock occupancies of 80-90%. But today, occupancy has fallen to 20%.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tourists-cancel-hotel-bookings-as-virus-picks-up-pace-again/articleshow/88699464.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Physical classes continue in schools outside Jaipur limits||JAIPUR: Risking the lives of children, many government and private schools located on the periphery of the JMC – Heritage and Greater –continue to operate offline classes. Earlier, amidst rising Covid cases, the state government had issued orders to schools in the municipality to shut physical classes from 1 to 8. These schools have been saving themselves on the grounds that they do not come under the corporation and hence they cannot be forced to follow the orders. Majority of the students in these schools pose a threat to others as they come from corporation areas, where the virus is spreading rapidly. Still, many parents are concerned with the situation or confused about sending their children to schools. Also the teachers are of the opinion that if schools in Jaipur are shut, nearby areas should also be ordered to follow the same. A government school in Adhunik ki Dhani in Jhotwara comes under rural area and its students, are from the nearby villages. This school is situated on the border of the city. Similarly, many of these private schools outside corporation areas with urban students are located in Harmada Ghati, Amber area, Sanganer. In Government Senior Secondary School, Bad Mohanpura, near Muhana Mandi, students of both urban and rural areas are attending the school from classes I to VIII. “Although we are near the municipal corporation area, this order doesn’t apply to us. Students from all classes are attending school but it is scary for us as the number of cases are rising in Jaipur,” said one of the staff members on condition of anonymity. Narayan Singh Sisodia, president of Rajasthan Shikshak Avam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh said that this is a very unreasonable order. “Is the disease limited to just Jaipur border areas and not its vicinity? When the government knew that cases are rising in the capital, even schools on the border areas should be closed because students from Jaipur are studying there. Government should include the JDA boundary for implementing the orders or else corona will spread over there also,” said Sisodia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/physical-classes-continue-in-schools-outside-city-limits/articleshow/88699465.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Tribal univ collects 18% GST with affiliation fees, colleges protest||Jaipur: Over 130 colleges affiliated with Govind Guru Tribal University (GGTU) in Banswara are protesting against the 18% GST being charged in affiliation fees. They have registered a complaint with the governor stating that GST doesn’t apply to affiliation fees and it would result in increased fees for students. The college association in Banswara has contended that due to the pandemic, they had suffered heavy losses and the additional 18% GST on top of the affiliation fees would put them under additional stress. Sharad Joshi of private college association in Banswara said, “It is not compulsory for universities to collect 18% GST. Not all universities in the state are collecting it. Also, we have presented the cases to the university that how colleges were refunded the GST amount wrongly collected by respective universities.” The report said the university is charging Rs 80,000 per subject for 80 students along with Rs 15,000 inspection fees. The 18% GST is additional to the university charges and inspection fees required for granting affiliation for the session 2022-23. “The institutes will be left with the no choice to pass the onus to the students by increasing the fees. The decision would impact close to 50,000 students,” said Joshi. Reacting to the controversy, IV Trivedi, vice-chancellor of GGTU told TOI, “The GST sum is collected by the government not by the university. I have gone through though their plea and have asked them to furnish any court order exempting the GST in such cases. I have also sought guidance from the higher education department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tribal-univ-collects-18-gst-with-affiliation-fees-colleges-protest/articleshow/88699470.cms||---

For example, Government First Grade College in Kaup has written a letter on Monday that all 18 students who appeared in the third semester BA English examination have failed. However, they have passed in other subjects. TOI has a copy of the letter written to the MU registrar(evaluation) that states all students have failed, and that they are unhappy that even after a month, the issue has not been rectified. “How is it possible that all fail in one subject. Mangalore University must answer us as well as rectify the errors at the earliest,” said a faculty member, adding that some of the students have been preparing for the LLB examination, and English marks are considered for the course. “MU has been rectifying errors of private colleges on priority. Why is such step-motherly treatment given to government colleges?” the faculty member asked. A source from a private college in Milagres said first semester interior design and about 25 hospitality science students are yet to get their results. While some have failed, a BSc biotechnology student from a college in Moodbidri has received additional marks. The highest marks to be awarded are 50, However, the student has got 51 marks. “MU is still in denial, despite several anomalies in the undergraduate exam results,” said a senior lecturer of a first-grade college.

Over 35 years, Sadwelkar evolved and invented his own style and perspectives in painting, art and design practice. His works have been displayed nationally and internationally and are a regular feature in Jehangir Art Gallery, NGMA in Mumbai in addition to various galleries over the world. They are housed in the collection of numerous personalities and corporates. Sadwelkar was a topper and gold medalist alumni of Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai, and later forayed into the world of advertising and films. But he was always a painter and would eventually settle full-time into his work. Using the black ball point pen as his tool, he created articulate, surrealist paintings with long precision in this unforgiving medium, usually taking months to complete one painting. Sadwelkar gave birth to stunning visuals etched with his trademark hatching styles, gradations but more importantly the spherical point that is a motif across his work. Together with artist wife Minoo, Sadwelkar established Vijoo's Creative Workshop, an art academy in the name of his mother (Vijoo Sadwelkar) in 1999 and have since mentored thousands of students across age groups right till their careers, winning numerous national and international accolades. He is survived by his wife and two children. Sadwelkar's parents were both amongst the renowned artists and educationists of India — Baburao and Vijoo Sadwelkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/veteran-artist-sheil-sadwelkar-no-more/articleshow/88708255.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Record 99.3 lakh students are enrolled in Rajasthan govt schools||JAIPUR: The state has recorded the highest ever enrolment of 13 lakh students in government schools in the 2021-22 academic session. This has taken the total enrolment to almost 1 crore against 87 lakh in the 2020-21 academic year. The rise is attributed to transfer of students from private to government schools in the pandemic year, enrolment of children from migrant families and improvement in quality education. The desert state is among the few in the country that offers free education in government schools. The situation in several schools has come to a level where they have refused admission to students due to running full capacity. Girdhar Singh, principal of government senior secondary schoolin Malpura, said the total capacity of students in his school is 1,080 from classes 1 to 12. “This year, I have received over 1,500 applications, mostly by students from private schools of the tehsil and nearby villages. I could take only a few students against the vacancy while refusing the majority of them,” said Singh. The situation in English medium institutes like Mahatma Gandhi English Medium School and Vivekanand School is worst in terms of rush of parents seeking admission against those securing it. “The admission in these two English medium schools is a dream for every low-income family. It is obvious that parents who could afford low-income private schools would prefer to admit their child to these schools,” said KB Kothari, former policy and planner, UNICEF. Experts say enrolment is going to shoot in the coming years as the government promise of opening 1,200 more English medium schools would continue to attack families that would have afforded low-income English medium schools. The performance of government schools during lockdown has also shown exemplary results. Programmes like SMILE and Aao Ghar Se Seekhen (Let’s Learn From Home) where students are being taught online or through pre-recorded videos have had a major impact in containing the learning outcomes of students. The rise in figures in government schools clearly means that fall of numbers in private schools. Data on private school enrolments for 2021-22 and 2020-21 is officially not available. In 2019-20, the official figures say that enrolment in private schools were 81 lakhs while in the government schools were 85 lakh in 2019-20. “Data is still being tabulated but enrolment figures of private schools in October was around 65 lakh. In indicates that lakhs of students from private schools have shifted to government schools,” said Kamlendra Ranawat, assistant professor at Rajasthan State Council ofEducational Research & Training (RSCERT), Udaipur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/record-99-3-lakh-students-are-enrolled-in-raj-govt-schools/articleshow/88699472.cms||Shoeb Khan

The MLA could not be contacted for his reactions. Justifying his action, he posted on Facebook, “If something wrong is happening, it is necessary to raise voice.” He thanked the chief minister and industry minister Shakuntala Rawat for rectifying the mistake. “This reflects how bureaucracy wants to dominate people’s representatives. Ignoring the CM, the minister and local people’s representatives in such an event will not send the right message to the public,” Abrar wrote in the letter.

The giant high-tech earth pressure balance tunnel boring device will be soon launched in the city.However, hassled Surti commuters already juggling on the ground with several developmental projects taking place on the main thoroughfares, are not exuding the same spirit of happiness. Loud complaints of barricades and blocked roads for the metro project are heard in the air. Even the business community is worried about financial losses as the roads in front of their establishments are set to stay closed for several months for the project. The metro officials, on the other hand, claim that once the project is complete it will become the first choice of citizens for transportation. Surat Metro Rail Project will be a great infrastructure development with seamless connectivity across the city.Surat Metro phase – 1 comprises an underground 6.5km stretch from Kapodrato Chowk Bazar through Labheshwar Chowk, Central Warehouse, Surat Railway Station up to Maskati Hospital. Stations will be developed at all these locations and length of each underground station is nearly 200m, while the depth ranges between 11m and 33m. These underground stations will be connected through twin tunnels having an excavated diameter of 6.8m and with finished diameters of 5.8m.The tunnels of the metro rail will be constructed using four high-tech earth pressure balance TBMs with international standards in tunnel design and construction. The selection of these TBMs has been done after detailed soil investigations and preparation of Geotechnical Interpretative Report (GIR) by detailed design consultants, hence specifically designed to suit the project geology.“TBMs deliver high safety in tunnelling work environments as well as no impact to surface structures. These provide high performance in deep and long tunnels incurring low tunnel maintenance cost and high construction progress rates when it comes to soft ground soil especially considering the Surat city’s geology,” a metro official told TOI. On why TBMs will be deployed, the official explained that these machines make relatively negligible noise, vibrations and surface disturbances making it an ideal choice of tunneling method for underground construction in urban areas. “Safe tunnelling using EPB TBMs is a proven method for construction of underground tunnel infrastructure in densely populated areas of old city with buildings as it provides great control on tunnel induced effects on the surface for the existing building structures,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/tbms-to-expedite-metro-rail-project/articleshow/88699488.cms||---

The demolition was stayed in August after residents approached the Apex court seeking relief and rehabilitation on lines of slums in urban areas. In the city, the civic body provides houses at affordable rates to those vacated from slums. The residents in the slums alongside the railway line were demanding rehabilitation on similar lines. “Advance notices were issued to the residents to vacate houses. After the notice period was over and detailed survey by departments concerned, the demolition drive was carried out,” said a railway official. “The demolition drive will continue at few other locations where the slums are present.

For example, Government First Grade College in Kaup has written a letter on Monday that all 18 students who appeared in the third semester BA English examination have failed. However, they have passed in other subjects. TOI has a copy of the letter written to the MU registrar(evaluation) that states all students have failed, and that they are unhappy that even after a month, the issue has not been rectified. “How is it possible that all fail in one subject. Mangalore University must answer us as well as rectify the errors at the earliest,” said a faculty member, adding that some of the students have been preparing for the LLB examination, and English marks are considered for the course. “MU has been rectifying errors of private colleges on priority. Why is such step-motherly treatment given to government colleges?” the faculty member asked. A source from a private college in Milagres said first semester interior design and about 25 hospitality science students are yet to get their results. While some have failed, a BSc biotechnology student from a college in Moodbidri has received additional marks. The highest marks to be awarded are 50, However, the student has got 51 marks. “MU is still in denial, despite several anomalies in the undergraduate exam results,” said a senior lecturer of a first-grade college. MU vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya said complaints on results have been addressed by the university, whenever they were raised. Registrar (evaluation) P L Dharma refused to comment on the issue. Students need not panic: Registrar (evaluation)In a press statement, registrar (evaluation) P L Dharma said that MU has managed to conduct examinations using open software MULinx. “However, due to the Covid pandemic and data mismatch, the examination results have been delayed.

After considering a bail plea filed by Suhail and his parents, Justice Gopinath P however granted bails to the parents. The court declined bail to the husband after noting that the allegations against him are serious and, if proved, would mean that the deceased was treated with utmost cruelty by him. But the allegations against the parents pertain to demand of dowry and making the deceased work like a housemaid, the court said while holding that their continued detention is not necessary. Mofiya’s father, who was the complainant before police, had opposed the bail plea at the high court and had alleged that the accused husband was diagnosed with sexual perversion during a counselling session he had attended with his daughter. He had forced his daughter to perform unnatural sexual acts as per her complaint, the father had contended. While pointing out the seriousness of the allegations against the husband, the court said it is not inclined to grant bail to him, especially when the prosecution has opposed it. Suhail, a native of Iramalloor near Kothamangalam, and Mofiya had met on social media, fell in love, and had got married in April. It is alleged that Suhail and his parents harassed her demanding a dowry of Rs 40 lakh, with the in-laws threatening to marry Suhail to a doctor if the dowry demand was not met.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hc-denies-bail-to-mofiyas-husband/articleshow/88698027.cms||---

In this connection, a public consultation meeting was held at the deputy commissioner’s office on Tuesday.Yathish Baikampady former CEO, Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project, said that there are lessons to be learnt from the Padubidri Blue Flag Beach. “The same mistakes must not be repeated here. The design and implementation of the project should be in accordance with the local conditions. We cannot have the same plan for all 100 beaches in India. Every beach is unique. Public consultation should have been done before inviting tenders. Locals must be a part of the beach management committee,” he said.Raising several questions, he said, “We have seen how the vegetation was destroyed at Padubidri. Do we need to build a jogging track for tourists who would love to walk on the sand? How many international tourists has the Padubidri Blue Flag beach been able to attract? This is a scam. Access to the beach for locals should not be curbed, and even the uniform prescribed for the staff does not match the local conditions,” Yathish said.Meanwhile, the representatives of Mogaveera Sabha Boloor expressed interest in managing the beach, but said that the international certification should not affect fishing activities.Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that this is one of the district’s ambitious projects, that will bring international recognition. “Some of the objections raised are reasonable, but cannot be dealt with at the district level. We will convey the same to the officials. We are going ahead with the plan, and tenders have been invited for development of a one-kilometre stretch in Tannirbhavi, at an approximate cost of Rs 8 crore. Work orders will be given in the next one month. Depending upon the outcome of this project, we will think about proposing a second stretch for Blue Flag certification,” he said.DCF Dakshina Kannada Dinesh Kumar Y K, said that the government in its pursuit of sustainable development of the coastal regions, embarked upon a highly acclaimed and flagship programme, Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS) under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project. This was launched by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), through the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM).MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar and officials from the tourism, CRZ and fisheries department were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/demand-for-plan-to-suit-local-needs-raised/articleshow/88699510.cms||---

Hence, the property tax for the smaller properties would not be waived, said NMC officials.The civic body officials further said that by the year 2010, the city had a total of 3.5 lakh properties on record and around 2.5 lakh properties measured less than 500 sq ft. Most of the properties in the old city and other areas were smaller, and there was more demand for the flats less than 500 sq ft.The trend of bigger flats and residential properties increased during the last one decade, added NMC officials.NMC reactions came after city mayor Satish Kulkarni asked the property tax department of the NMC to table the proposal of waiving property tax for the smaller properties from April 1. The NCP Nashik city unit has also made such a demand to the district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal.Kulkarni said that poor and middle-class families reside in smaller residential properties and a property tax waiver will give a major relief to these families.NMC officials further said that the NMC's revenue through property and water taxes has been badly hit due to the Covid pandemic during the past two years.Earlier, NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore for the current financial year, but it had to revise and reduce the target to Rs 140 crore due to the Covid pandemic. Hence, exempting the smaller properties from the property tax will affect the financial condition of the civic body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-unwilling-to-waive-tax-on-small-properties/articleshow/88699511.cms||---

A senior official from the district administration said apart from some rural hospitals under the Nashik civil hospital that were converted into DCHCs, many private hospitals were also acquired for the purpose of treating Covid patients owing to the oxygen facilities there. “Now that cases of Covid-19 are increasing rapidly the need of acquiring these hospitals is being felt. The process would soon get underway,” he said. In the rural areas there are approximately 27 such primary health centers where the oxygen facility has been put in place. “Each of these primary health centre has around 20 beds. These PHCc would also be brought into use if the need arises,” he added.In general as cases of Covid-19 are increasing the process of activating the Covid Care Centres (CCC) and DCHCs has been initiated. Meanwhile, officials also said that over the past one year the infrastructure has been strengthened across the district due to which the shortage of beds and oxygen experienced during the first two waves will not happen this time. Nonetheless, the district administration is leaving no stone unturned to be fully prepared if cases begin to rise dramatically over the next few weeks or months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/pvt-hosps-in-rural-areas-used-as-dchcs-to-be-acquired-soon/articleshow/88699514.cms||---

---||Nashik||Buffer zone to come up at civil hospital for Covid patients awaiting admission||Nashik: The Nashik civil hospital has started the work to create a buffer zone, equipped with at least 10 oxygen beds, for people seeking admission into the Covid ward. The buffer zone will ensure that the patients are not kept waiting in vehicles and ambulances outside the building, until the beds get vacant in the hospital. This had occurred frequently during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 last year.The plan is to set up 10 oxygen beds on the ground floor of the building. Critical patients arriving at the hospital can be accommodated here until the beds in the wards on the four floors become vacant. Currently, the procedure of setting up oxygen points where the beds could be put is underway. “Our aim is to the utilise every space of the hospital to set up beds so that Covid patients do not have to face any inconvenience,” said nodal officer of the Covid building of the civil hospital Rohan Borse. He added that they are also attempting to use the side rooms of every ward in the four-storey building. This side rooms can accommodate at least 24 additional beds and 15 more beds can be accommodated in the space, which is currently utilised for administrative purpose. Medical officers can operate even from a smaller space, added Borse. During the peak of the first as well as the second wave, the 180-bed covid wing used to be filled to capacity. A large number of patients were not getting beds and would turn to the civil hospital.

The newly described species ´Monoceromyia flavoscutata´ and ´M. nigra´ belongs family Syrphidae. The findings have been published in the Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology. The members of the genus are extremely rare with only 12 species reported from India previously. New species discovery in this rare genus is happening in India after 80 years. They were discovered by H Sankararaman, a PhD scholar from Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, Anooj S S, an assistant professor of Kerala Agricultural University, and Ximo Mengual, a scientist from Alexander Koenig Zoological Research Museum, Germany. Surveys were conducted in evergreen forests of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Arunachal Pradesh as part of the study. In addition to the two new species the researchers have revised the genus and re-described seven existing species in the genus. They also found that two species ´Monoceromyia multipunctata´ and ´M. polistoides´ previously described were synonymous. The new species ´M. flavoscutata´ discovered from Thadiyankudisai in Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, was named after its yellow coloured thoracic ends and can be differentiated from the closely resembling species based on the coloration of the thorax and the wing vein characters whereas the other new species ´M. nigra´ discovered from West Siang, of Basar district of Arunachal Pradesh differed from the near species based on thoracic, abdominal and facial coloration and wing vein character, it was named as nigra based on the black coloured the thorax. This genus is recognized by their facial projection from which their antennae arises, petiolated abdomen and coloration which mimic thread-waisted wasps to escape predators. The one discovered from Western Ghats was observed to show a peculiar habit of egg laying on tree sap. The immature stages of the genus are reported to show interesting habitat preferences like sap runs and rot holes of trees, colonies of stingless bees and water fills of plants like bamboo and agave. The discovery of such rare species with specialized habitat preferences highlights the diversity richness of the Western Ghats and North Eastern India and the need for conservation of the natural vegetation , the researchers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/researchers-discover-new-species-of-wasp-like-flower-flies/articleshow/88697476.cms||---

Affairs of many prominent temples of our country, including Tirupati Balaji, Sri Jaggannath or Siddhi Vinayak, are being looked after by the government. Furthermore, there maths which are being looked after by persons who are of different religions and are not well aware of and rituals. How can we tolerate this,” Puri questioned. Holding ‘Dharam Sansad’ at Magh Mela bears significance as the issues, discussed and approved in this meet, will be pursued and propagated by the seers and religious organisation across the country as was with the construction of temple at ShriRam Janmabhoomi at Ayodhya. The matter was taken up in the meet held in 2019 Kumbh.

President of Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Swami Parishad, Swami Brahmashram, said, “Governments should not have a say in managing funds, day-to-day affairs or for that matter the religious rituals and practices of temples and maths. A mass movement would be taken up on this issue. ” Talking to TOI on phone, Mahant Ravindra Puri condemned the recent remarks of some religious leaders made at Haridwar against the ‘Father of the Nation’. “Seers should refrain from making comments against the ‘Father of the Nation’, political personalities or for that matter against any community. Seers should be well aware of their ‘maryada’ (limits) and should not indulge in giving controversial statements,” said president of ABAP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/dharm-sansad-to-decide-on-plan-to-free-temples-from-govt/articleshow/88699528.cms||Rajeev Mani

Sources said the party feels since it is nowhere in the race and any collaboration with AAP may affect it severely in other parts of the country, it is preferring to remain out. “Any collaboration with AAP may impact us negatively in the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, and there is no question of any understanding with the BJP. So, we have decided to remain away from the election. However, we are still keeping an eye out on what is happening,” a senior Congress leader said. “It is a collective decision not to contest the election and stay away from the dirty politics of AAP and BJP. Therefore, none of our party’s councillors filed the nomination papers for any post. All of our councillors are together,” sources in the Congress said. After the joining of Congress elected councillor Harpreet Kaur Babla in BJP on Sunday, remaining seven councillors of Congress along with party president Subhash Chawla and senior Congress leader D D Jindal left the city for Rajasthan on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/cong-likely-to-abstain-from-mayoral-poll-for-first-time/articleshow/88699546.cms||Deepak Yadav

Ramesh in a phone conversation with ToI said he was neither interested in a cabinet post, nor would he lobby for it. “I am not interested in any positions and I will not make an effort to secure a position,” he said.The BJP high command may go for a cabinet shuffle after Sankranti. A few party leaders such as Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal have stated that districts will have better representation in the next cabinet shuffle.On the other hand, the suspense over the Jarkiholi family’s youngest brother Lakhan supporting the BJP to secure absolute majority in the council continues. His brothers in the party say the decision had been left to Lakhan, who won the MLC polls by contesting independently but also upset some equations. Lakhan’s victory resulted in the decimation of BJP candidate Mahatesh Kavatagimath in a setback to the party as well as the Jarkiholis. The idea of the family fielding Lakhan was to defeat their political nemesis, Congress MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar.It was believed that if Ramesh was successful in defeating the Congress in the biennial polls, he would have had a strong bargaining ground to reclaim power in the cabinet. However, with the changed scenario questions are being asked on what he would do.When asked whether his brother Lakhan was compelled to support the BJP in the council to gain majority, Ramesh simply said that the decision had been left to Lakhan. He said he had nothing to do in this matter.Sources in the BJP say that Ramesh may not lobby for a cabinet berth this time as he has lost ground. His influence in the state is waning because of repeated setbacks, the sources said. He may now ask his brother to support the BJP because that is the only option he is left with after he failed to get his party to victory in the recent elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/jarkiholi-speaks-on-cabinet-berth-im-not-interested-in-any-position/articleshow/88699547.cms||Shreyas HS

The police had filed a charge sheet against the gang nine months ago.In the 2,000 page document, various documentary and technical evidence were highlighted showing how the syndicate was extorting money from the victims in an organised manner. It also highlights the syndicate’s activities and different modus operandi employed by the gang and also role of each member. It also elaborates their hawala network and how they send money outside the country.Talking to TOI, in-charge superintendent of police, Jamnagar, Nitish Pandey said, “We have recovered more evidence during investigation and have submitted these in the special court through supplementary charge sheet. We have submitted documentary evidence like victims and witnesses statements, properties documents and technical evidence like call detail record in which Patel and gang members’ call recordings while talking to victims.”The police had produced evidence of several MO Patel’s syndicate employed including putting the target (victim) on surveillance, getting all the minute details of the victim and his family members. Thereafter, Patel would call up and threaten the victim giving exact details including what his family members are wearing, where they are, which vehicle they are using etc. Then he would tell the victim that if he won’t comply with his extortion demand, then he will be responsible for the consequences.The second MO used was to threaten the victim to raise a dispute on his property. Once the property becomes disputed nobody buys it and the owner has to sell it at a very cheap price. He would extort money with this threat and repeatedly tortured the victims theill they coughed up the amount.Cops also submitted evidence on his hawala transactions to the US and the UK and how he got equivalent dollar or pound in foreign currency. However, it’s under investigation if he had invested money in foreign land. The police got the evidence of transferring Rs 80 lakh to foreign countries through hawala. The police got evidence of extorting Rs 10 crore in cash, of which Rs 5 crore was recovered. The gang had extorted huge amounts of land, the value of which is difficult to calculate.Of the total 16 accused in the syndicate, 12 are arrested by Jamnagar police and are lodged in jail. Jayesh Patel was arrested by the UK police while three accused are absconding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/jayesh-patels-extortion-tricks-detailed-in-2k-pages/articleshow/88699556.cms||---

The incident came to light when the Mundra police were investigating a theft case. The investigation also revealed that the accused schoolteacher Jay Thakkar had not only raped the minor student twice, in October and in December, but also forced her to steal jewellery from her own house.According to Mundra police, the rape survivor's parents had filed a complaint on December 14 that jewellery worth Rs 1.2 lakh had been stolen from their house. During the investigation, the police questioned the minor girl who broke down and admitted to having stolen the jewellery. She told police that she did at the behest of her teacher Thakkar. When police asked why she did it, the girl revealed that Thakkar had allegedly raped her twice promising her good marks in the exam. He also coerced her into stealing jewellery from her house with the lure of better marks. A Mundra police official said, “Thakkar is married and his family lives in Mumbai.

As the number of Covid cases have began to rise again, cops are mulling to start collecting fines strictly in the coming days. The data also shows that mask rule violators have paid Rs 8.82 lakh more than the previous year. According to city traffic police data, the people also had to cough up Rs 4.8 crore on the spot as fines in 2021 for violating traffic rules like jumping red light, driving on the wrong side or wrong entry and other violations. A senior official told TOI, “Covid cases are on the rise, but we have instructions from Gandhinagar not to become strict in collecting mask rule violation fines at this stage. So, we have decided for now to distribute masks to those seen not wearing one. After this gesture, we will start penalizing violators.” Rajkot people also paid towing charge Rs 11.86 lakh in 2021, which, however, has decreased by around Rs 30 lakh. The reason behind the huge figure is that in 2020, police used to seize vehicle and the fine collected from the violators were charged under the head of towing charges during curfew. The police have started collecting fines this year too through UPI and QR code scanning and has so far collected Rs 27 lakh as fines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/get-ready-to-pay-for-not-wearing-masks-soon/articleshow/88699559.cms||---

The sanctuary will prepare bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides, which can be sold to local farmers at concessional rates.The cows which will be kept at the sanctuary would primarily be the animals which are abandoned by their owners after they stop producing milk and become stray animals. Animals rescued from cattle smugglers will also find a place in the facility.The state aims to set up cow sanctuaries in 11 of the 12 districts, barring Lahaul-Spiti, to provide shelter to stray cattle in natural environment and facilities for grazing as per the availability of land resources.

---||Madurai||Madras HC orders Rs 25,000 relief to woman bit by rat in hospital||MADURAI: The Madras high court has directed the principal secretary of the health department to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation to a woman who was bitten by a rat inside the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai district in 2014. The court was hearing the petition filed by Muthulakshmi alias Rajam. The petitioner’s son Suresh had suffered grievous injuries in a road accident and was admitted as in-patient on January 19, 2014. On January 23, 2014, when the petitioner was sleeping near her son’s cot, a rat bit her on her left elbow. She suffered pain and swelling. Since the pain increased, she took treatment as an out-patient. She then gave a representation to the authorities in February 2014 seeking to prevent rat menace at the hospital. Since there was no response, she had filed the present petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2014, seeking compensation of ₹2 lakh for the injury suffered by her. In the counter affidavit, the dean of GRH had stated that though the petitioner claimed that a rat had bitten her on January 23, 2014, she did not approach the medical officer on that very night but took treatment only on January 31, 2014. Justice C V Karthikeyan said that a copy of the medical receipt given to the petitioner which had been enclosed as a document to the petition shows that the nature of treatment given to the petitioner was for rat bite. The petitioner also produced newspaper reports regarding this incident. The judge observed that it may not be proper on the part of this court to rely on newspaper reports. But in this case, this court holds that it is justifiable that the petitioner had suffered rat bite. It cannot be brushed under the carpet and stated to be a false statement. If it was actually a false statement, then the GRH authorities would have certainly given a rejoinder to the newspaper items. The judge held that rat bite in GRH is an unforeseen accident and when such an accident occurs, then compensation is automatically payable. The judge said that petitioner had undergone only treatment once and there is no evidence or documents provided by the petitioner to show that she has to undergo treatment for several days. Hence, the judge said that the petitioner is entitled for compensation of ₹25,000. The judge further said that the principal secretary of the health department is ultimately liable to pay the compensation.

The patient is currently doing well and was discharged in just two days post the treatment. Addressing the media, doctors at Apollo Hospitals, said that a 61-year-old patient from Theni with early-stage liver cancer was offered an innovative treatment called microwave ablation. This treatment uses the microwaves to destroy cancer cells. This procedure was done by a team of doctors including liver transplant surgeon Dr Madhusudhanan, interventional radiologist Dr John Robert, medical gastroenterologists Dr Rajesh Prabhu and Dr Praveen Kumar. Doctors said that for the procedure, the treatment was delivered through a needle inserted into the tumor. The entire treatment duration was 30 minutes. “What makes this treatment more effective is that it is accurate in destruction of the tumour. Further, we can also see the destruction of the tumour visually on an ultrasound scan and confirm if it is completely destroyed,” said Dr Madhusudhanan. The cost of the procedure was around 2.2 lakh and doctors said the procedure can possibly provide complete cure in early-stage liver cancer. “We would like to create awareness that any liver cirrhosis patient should undergo routine follow up with a liver specialist. This will help in early diagnosis of liver cancer and potential cure for the same,” said Dr Rohini Sridhar, senior vice-president, Apollo Hospitals.TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/patient-with-cancer-treated-with-microwave-ablation/articleshow/88699570.cms||---

A decision on the chief minister’s participation in the jallikattu events would be considered as per the prevailing situation then, he said. Moorthy was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the distribution of the free Ponal gift hampers to ration card holders in Madurai district. On being asked about the preparedness to face the third Covid wave, he said the district was well equipped in terms of oxygen requirement. All Covid prevention teams would conduct house to house checks to control the spread of the disease, as it was done during the second wave. Stress would be given to ensure that people wear masks. The district administration would impose a fine on people who don’t wear masks in public places, he added. When pointed out that former AIADMK minister R B Udhayakumar, was demanding the reopening of the Alanganallur sugar mill, Moorthy said that it was the DMK, which had ensured that the mill functioned well, between 2006 and 2010. After the AIADMK came to power, the mill did not function for three years. Steps would be taken to reopen the mill if the special officer and the farmers associations give the assurance that they would source the required amount of sugarcane from the districts that supply the cane to the mill. Meanwhile, the distribution of the gifts started in the ration shops only on Tuesday afternoon. In some places, people who came in the morning had left their bags outside to book their slot, though the government said that tokens were being distributed. About 9.2 lakh rice cardholders in Madurai district will receive the Pongal gifts containing 21 items through the 1,394 ration shops in the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/jallikattu-events-will-be-conducted-by-following-covid-19-sops-says-minister/articleshow/88699571.cms||---

They were discharged later after giving first aid. Nearly 5,000 girls had gathered to participate in the 5-km marathon as part of Congress’s “Ladki hu, lad sakti hu (I am a girl, I can fight)” poll campaign. District magistrate Manvendra Singh has ordered an FIR against the organisers following a report submitted by the city magistrate that Covid guidelines were flouted. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had earlier in the day written a letter to the DM requesting to initiate an enquiry. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “Permission was taken for the event. We have not received any written complaint from guardians of any girl so far. I have ordered an investigation.” A Congress leader claimed that the turnout of about 7,000 was much higher than expected and this caused confusion among participants who pushed hard while moving forward in a bid to win the race. Congress leader and former Bareilly mayor Supriya Aron, who had organised the event, said, "These schoolgirls only wanted to come out for a bit of experience and fun. If anyone is offended for any reason, I would like to apologise on behalf of Congress." Girls from various schools and rural areas had gathered at the Bishop Mondol Inter College ground, in the city and when the race started, about 50 girls fell on the ground after losing their balance as those behind them pushed hard. But they were rescued in the nick of time by organising committee members. The event, however, was completed though nearly 100 girls skipped the event soon after the race started. Videos of the incident went viral on social media later. Neelu Shara, who suffered injuries in the melee, said, “I was in the front row and suddenly I fell down after the girls behind me started pushing badly. Nearly 50 girls, including I, fell on the ground and we had to skip the race because of injuries. I am upset as I couldn’t participate in the marathon.” Bareilly city Congress president Ajay Shukla told TOI, “The crowd was larger than we expected and, hence, there were initial hiccups. The event was completed and 100 winners were given smartphones, fitness bands and a scooty. There was no law and order issue and the girls, barring a few who had sustained bruises injuries, were happy to participate in the event.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/several-minor-girls-hurt-in-congress-event-in-up/articleshow/88699574.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The court was hearing the petition filed by Ashik Abdullah of Tenkasi district. The petitioner had originally been issued with a passport in 2017. Since the pages have exhausted, the petitioner submitted an application in October 2021, seeking re-issuance of passport. Since no steps were taken on the application, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to re-issue his passport. The authorities submitted that the Kadayam police in Tenkasi district had stated that a case was registered against the petitioner in January 2020. Justice C V Karthikeyan observed that registration of FIR cannot be a bar to issue or re-issue a passport. FIR is only information about the commission of an offence and after investigation, the police can even drop the allegations against the petitioner. Even if a final report is filed making out the allegations or the commission of the offence, still the petitioner is deemed to be innocent till proven guilty in a manner known to law after due trial. The court directed the authorities to re-issue the passport within January 15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/fir-cannot-be-a-bar-to-issue-or-re-issue-passport-says-hc/articleshow/88699575.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Demand for plan to suit local needs raised||Mangaluru: The city’s Tannirbhavi Beach is one among the two beaches in the country, that has been selected for Blue Flag certification this year. In this connection, a public consultation meeting was held at the deputy commissioner’s office on Tuesday. Yathish Baikampady former CEO, Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project, said that there are lessons to be learnt from the Padubidri Blue Flag Beach. “The same mistakes must not be repeated here. The design and implementation of the project should be in accordance with the local conditions. We cannot have the same plan for all 100 beaches in India. Every beach is unique. Public consultation should have been done before inviting tenders. Locals must be a part of the beach management committee,” he said. Raising several questions, he said, “We have seen how the vegetation was destroyed at Padubidri. Do we need to build a jogging track for tourists who would love to walk on the sand? How many international tourists has the Padubidri Blue Flag beach been able to attract? This is a scam. Access to the beach for locals should not be curbed, and even the uniform prescribed for the staff does not match the local conditions,” Yathish said. Meanwhile, the representatives of Mogaveera Sabha Boloor expressed interest in managing the beach, but said that the international certification should not affect fishing activities. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that this is one of the district’s ambitious projects, that will bring international recognition. “Some of the objections raised are reasonable, but cannot be dealt with at the district level. We will convey the same to the officials. We are going ahead with the plan, and tenders have been invited for development of a one-kilometre stretch in Tannirbhavi, at an approximate cost of Rs 8 crore. Work orders will be given in the next one month. Depending upon the outcome of this project, we will think about proposing a second stretch for Blue Flag certification,” he said. DCF Dakshina Kannada Dinesh Kumar Y K, said that the government in its pursuit of sustainable development of the coastal regions, embarked upon a highly acclaimed and flagship programme, Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS) under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project. This was launched by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), through the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM).

The city had reported its first Omicron case on December 17 when an elderly couple had tested positive. After this 23 more cases emerged taking the total number of positive cases to 25 Sources said that only two active Omicron cases now remained because the other cases were discharged after treatment. But several of them were found to be infected with the variant only after they got cured and some even leaving the country or the city. “Most of these cases have tested negative over a period of time. Their genome sequencing reports arrive after they test negative. We test them again to clear them,” said Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel.

If it is one group this year, it will be another the next year. One cannot say when the pandemic will come to an end. Therefore, people will have to develop a habit to live with it. Complete lockdown cannot be imposed every time the pandemic knocks the door,” Mishra told mediapersons in Delhi.When reminded that migrant workers have once again started returning to Bihar, Mishra said the government did not have any such information.“If at all the migrant workers return home, we will put in place a mechanism to create work opportunities for them,” Mishra said.Meanwhile, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) led by former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav are also opposed to imposition of complete lockdown in the state.“We are opposed to the imposition of complete lockdown.

The poor cannot bear the desperate situation that will be created by mass hunger that will ensue due to cessation of economic activities,” HAM(S) spokesman Danish Rizwan said.JAP(L) chief Pappu Yadav said, “Why is it that the coronavirus pandemic surfaces ahead of national and state budgets. The virus vanishes after the presentation of the budget. It all happens for the diversion of money and March loot.

---||Patna||Bihar: Leave of govt doctors & health staff cancelled till February 28||Patna: The health department on Tuesday cancelled leave of all government doctors and health workers till February 28 in view of exponential rise in Covid cases. It also asked those already on leave to immediately return to their duties. Leave of doctors and health workers posted in medical college and hospitals have also been cancelled. A letter issued by the state health department OSD Renu Kumari said in the wake of unexpected rise in Covid infections, all leaves, except study and maternity, of medical officers, including those on contract basis, superintendents and principals, junior residents of the medical colleges, GNMs, ANMs, OT assistants, lab technicians and Class IV employees were being cancelled. Copies of the letter were forwarded to divisional commissioners, DMs, civil surgeons and other officials. As the order came into immediate effect, Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) administration issued notifications in this regard. As the Covid virus has infected at least 168 health workers, including 50 doctors, at NMCH, its superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said routine clinical, OPD and OT services would be hit at the hospital. He, however, added as the isolation period of positive persons was shorter and recovery faster in the third wave, many could return to their duties soon. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said there very few doctors and staff at the hospital have tested positive for Covid. Implementing the government order, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) has restricted registration of OPD patients. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the registration would be done online. “In view of the rising cases of Covid, only serious patients would be operated at the hospital.

---||Patna||Bihar: Experts attribute rise in Covid cases to Omicron||PATNA: Alarming rise in Covid cases in Patna and some other cities in the state has clearly indicated the onset of the third wave of the pandemic triggered by the Omicron variant, health experts said. According to health experts, even though the people infected with Covid-19 during the past few days have not been tested for the Omicron variant due to lack of facility for genome sequencing, the rate at which the people are being infected per day is a clear sign of the spread of the new variant. Expressing his concern at the recent surge in Covid cases, Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) joint director Dr A K Ashu said every alternate patient in the hospital is Covid positive. “However, all of them may not be infected with the Omicron variant. There may be mixed cases of coronavirus as only genome sequencing would confirm the presence of the exact variant of the virus. The third wave has already arrived and people would have to take all the necessary precautions and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. Dr Ashu added fortunately the Omicron variant has so far not been reported to be as virulent as the Delta variant, but if the chain of its transmission is not broken immediately by observing the Covid protocols meticulously, some more deadly mutations of the virus may emerge in time to come. Nodal officer of Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, however, said it’s too early to predict the exact nature of the Omicron variant. “Six out of seven Covid patients admitted in the hospital are on oxygen and a six-month-old patient at RMRI, Agamkuan has been put on ventilator. “We should not take things lightly as we don’t know about the transmissibility or virulence of the new variant. The deadly Delta variant has also not vanished completely till date,” he said, adding use of masks and social distancing must be enforced vigorously to save the people’s lives. Paediatrician and infectious disease expert Dr Arun Shah said it can’t be said with certainty that all the infections are of Omicron variant, but the situation is likely to turn explosive soon. “There are only 27 genome sequencing laboratories in the country and Bihar has got one recently. Hence, nothing can be said about the recent surge unless proper genome sequencing of all the positive cases are carried out properly. Even though the Omicron infections are supposedly less virulent as compared to those of Delta variant, the number of people to be infected with the new variant is likely to surpass those of the second wave. The peak of the third wave may be witnessed in about a month or so,” he added. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s medicine faculty dean Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad cautioned the people against the rising cases of Covid-19 in the state. “The possibility of the emergence of the third wave caused by the Omicron variant cannot be ruled out and, hence, coronavirus disease related protocols and travel guidelines must be made stricter.

A single bench of Justice P B Bajanthri dismissed the analogous writ petitions filed by Sudhir Kumar Gupta and 200 others who had challenged the final selection list on the ground of disparity in the minimum cut off in the merit scores. On December 1 last year, the high court had directed the respondents concerned not to issue the appointment orders until next hearing in the matter if the same had not been issued by that time. The selected candidates had to wait for their appointment letters due to the stay order issued by the court. The recruiting agency, Bihar Police Subordinate Service Commission (BPSSC), countered the allegations of the petitioners by laying bare the mechanism of category-wise merit-marking pattern. Finding force in the arguments of the respondents, the court dismissed the writ petitions. The BPSSC was represented in the court by advocate general Lalit Kishore and advocates Sanjay Pandey and Kunal Tiwari.The selected candidates may get a sigh of relief with automatic annulment of the earlier stay order on appointments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patna-high-court-clears-decks-for-appointment-of-2k-sis-and-sergeants/articleshow/88699589.cms||---

SuMo told this reporter that the government must take all necessary steps to apprehend Prasad, whose residence and office were raided by the state vigilance unit in November, yielding cash and documents worth crores of rupees. “He has been extending his medical leave and obstructing the vigilance team’s efforts” he added. SuMo continued, “The government’s coordination with the Raj Bhavan on this matter should be improved and an arrest warrant issued if the VC refuses to cooperate with the investigations.” Talking about other VCs, SuMo said, “With the VCs of MU, Patliputra University (PPU), and Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU) facing serious corruption charges, the image of higher education in Bihar has been tarnished, resulting in a bad name for the state. Despite facing numerous corruption charges, LNMU’s S P Singh has served as the VC of two additional universities, which is unfortunate. If the newly appointed VC of PPU does not assume his charge within 40 days of notification, another member of the search committee’s panel should be appointed to the post.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/arrest-tainted-mu-vc-sumo/articleshow/88699590.cms||---

Mamta on Tuesday tweeted, “Please hamari boli na lagaye”, while advising political parties to refrain from announcing freebies to women ahead of elections. In her tweet she stated, “Kind attention to leaders of all political parties. Pls stop taking Punjabi women on a ride by offering money etc. We feel proud in our womenhood and if anyone wants to provide something, then provide us safety, equality and self respect.”The tweet evoked curiosity and speculations within the Congress and other political parties as her husband and minister for food and civil supplies Bharat Bhushan Ashu too had criticised Sidhu for being critical of his own government.When contacted Mamta Ashu said, “It is not for one particular party rather I have asked all parties against offering money or other freebies for the women.” She advised the parties against indulging in politics on her comment too. Meanwhile responding to her tweet, senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal pointed out that Mamta Ashu was showing concern about women, but why she and her party had been silent about Lok Insaaf Party chief and Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Bains, who is to be arrested in a rape case. “She has not uttered a single word on the issue,” he said. Reacting to Sidhu’s announcements he added, “This is something very interesting that when other parties were making announcements then Sidhu was asking about funds and he said Rs 1,000 is an insult to women, but now Rs 2,000 is acceptable. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi should clarify whether Congress will fulfill all these announcements or these are merely jokes cracked by Sidhu.”Meanwhile, BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said, “The BJP has not promised anything like this till date and we will not offer any freebies to the women or any other section of society. We will include only those promises in our election manifesto that are possible.” He added that it was good that Mamta Ashu had shown concern about the issue but instead of giving advice to others she should first stop people from her own party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/mamtas-tweet-slamming-freebies-to-women-creates-flutter/articleshow/88699602.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||4 of family found dead at house in Mullanpur||Ludhiana: Four members of a family were found dead in a room at their house at government quarters near Railway Lines in Mullanpur, about 20 kilometres from here, on Tuesday morning. The deceased have been identified as Sukhdev Singh, 56, his son Jagdeep Singh, 27, daughter-in-law Jyoti, 25, and granddaughter Jyot, 2. While police suspected they died of asphyxiation, kin alleged foul play.Mullanpur SHO inspector Gurwinder Singh Bhullar said, “Sukhdev lived with his son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter in the government quarters. As the family had organized a prayer ceremony at home on Monday, Sukhdev’s daughter Reena and her husband had come to attend it.” On Tuesday morning, when Reena went to their room, she found them dead. “It seems the four died of asphyxiation as the room they were sleeping in was small and its sole window was closed,” the police added.However, Jyoti’s brother Jaswinder Singh, also a resident of Mullanpur, suspects foul play.Jaswinder said, “As Sukhdev, a Class IV employee, was retiring in two to three days, the family had organized a prayer ceremony at home. Around 12.30am on Tuesday, Jyoti had called us up. She said Jyot was not sleeping. My mother asked her not to worry and that we will get her medicines in the morning. Around 6.35am, my mother again talked to Jyoti for 44 seconds. An hour later, the son of Jagdeep’s brother Kulwant, called us up and said all four were lying unconscious and their bodies were stiff.” “Then I called on Jyoti’s number many a time, but the calls went unanswered. We were told the room was bolted from inside. Kulwant’s son said the phone was with them. Sukhdev was to get money on his retirement. So, they dying of asphyxiation is doubtful,” he added. The cops said, “Jaswinder suspects Kulwant and his family. We will initiate proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC. A board of doctors have conducted the post-mortem. We will proceed as per law after the autopsy report is received.” Police said Sukhdev’s wife Balvir, who slept in the neighbouring room, had tried to open their door in the morning. “As it was stuck, she sought the help of others to open it,” they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/4-of-family-found-dead-at-house-in-mullanpur/articleshow/88699606.cms||---

---||Pune||RTO calls bike taxis ‘illegal’, cracks down on 2-wheeler public transport||Pune: The Regional Transport Office (RTO) has said that operations of two-wheelers for public transport, commonly called ‘bike taxis’, is illegal. A drive has been launched to identify such operators and those letting them use their bikes. With at least two cases on Monday, wherein bike taxis were caught by autorickshaw drivers, officials at the Pune RTO said that in the last four days, 21 such motorists had been nabbed. “Any kind of public transport service needs a permit from the RTO. In case of tourist taxis, permits for them are provided by RTOs. The Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Rules have no regulations for the operation of two-wheelers as public transport modes. Hence, they are illegal and operations must stop,” said Sanjiv Bhor, Pune’s deputy regional transport officer. He also admitted that RTO has no data on the number of bikes being used for such services in the city. On Monday, a taxi biker was called by some auto drivers posing as customers in Aundh. Upon his arrival, he was thrashed by the latter. Similarly, auto drivers operating in the Pune airport area spotted a biker in their area. “The man has no licence and said he was working for an aggregator. We gave him a warning and asked him to leave. There are many such unauthorized people who are further damaging our business,” an autorickshaw driver in the airport area said.RTO officials said that earlier, two cab aggregator services started the bike taxi system in Pune without permissions. “We think one of them has stopped and we will be checking with the second. There is another aggregator specializing in just this service and we had talks with a representative of theirs on Monday to ask them to stop. In Maharashtra, renting a bike, as it happens in Goa, is allowed. However, operating a bike as a public transport service is not permitted,” Bhor said. But commuters thought otherwise. “ If some service is giving employment to two-wheeler owners in dire need of money in these troubled times, they should be allowed. Besides, it is a much easier mode of public transportation,” said Suresh Gaikwad, a daily commuter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rto-calls-bike-taxis-illegal-cracks-down-on-2-wheeler-public-transport/articleshow/88699613.cms||Joy Sengupta

Of the 3,950 active cases in Pune, 88 patients were on oxygen support and 36 people needed ventilators. People without masks will be fined Rs 500 and those who spit in public places, Pawar said, a will pay a penalty of Rs 1,000. He said that a three-layered surgical mask or N95 masks should be preferred, and all the guidelines set out by experts should be followed. The 36% population due for the second dose of vaccination must take it at the earliest, he said. "Citizens, who have not taken the second dose, must take it. The number of Covid-19 positive patients has gone up drastically," he said. Ajit Pawar also added that if the positivity rate goes beyond 10%, it is a matter of concern. Pune's rate at 18% is worrisome, he added. Ajit Pawar said more statewide guidelines will be issued after a meeting on Wednesday with the health minister and other senior members of the government. Those guidelines will be based on concerns raised by the state task force, experts, media and officials about the spread of the virus. "The state government was waiting for the Centre to announce the treatment protocol," said Pawar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/schools-shut-for-std-1-8-till-jan-30-in-pune-district/articleshow/88699614.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Covid surge casts a shadow over Paryaya||Udupi: Days ahead of the Paryaya festival in Udupi, the organising committee is concerned about the increasing Covid-19 cases in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. Mutt authorities feel that an increase in cases may lead to the extension of the night curfew, and the festival rituals may be affected, if the movement of people is restricted. The Paryaya Samiti has already made vaccination certificates compulsory for devotees taking part in the festival rituals. Sri Krishnapura Mutt seer Sri Vidyasagara Thirtha will ascend the Paryaya Peetha of the famous Sri Krishna Temple during the Paryaya festival on January 18. A ‘Pura Pravesha’ ritual, the customary Paryaya seer into the temple after completion of his pre-Paryaya tour, will be held on January 10. Thousands of devotees are expected to visit Sri Krishna Mutt during the festival every day. BJP MLA K Raghupati Bhat, who is also the honorary president of the samiti, said he has requested the government not to extend the night curfew, which was imposed till Friday. “The government has introduced night curfew only to control the free movement people, and not to check the spread of the virus. When night curfew is imposed, there will be fear in people’s minds, that the pandemic is not over. I am sure that the government may not extend the night curfew if the number of cases increases,” Bhat said. The MLA said all arrangements have been made to celebrate the Paryaya festival. “Those who are participating in the festival should compulsorily possess vaccination certificates for both doses. We have mentioned this in the invitation cards of the festival too. The Paryaya seer also has directed that the festival should be held by adhering to all guidelines of the government. I have met chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, and invited him for the festival. The CM will be visiting Udupi on January 17, and will be participating in the programmes on January 18,” he added. The MLA held a meeting on Tuesday, and directed the police to make arrangements to ensure security during the festival. Superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhan and additional SP Kumar Chandra were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/covid-surge-casts-a-shadow-over-paryaya/articleshow/88696739.cms||---

The fraudster took the bank details as well as the one-time passwords from the complainant to siphon off the amount. The fraud was carried out on December 28 last year, when the complainant was at home. The police registered an FIR on Monday after the complaint-verification process. The complainant, a retired central government officer, said, “On December 28, I received an SMS that my public-sector bank’s app and debit card will be blocked but I can update it with the PAN card.” He said there was a link in the SMS and when clicked on it, he found he had to fill in his information in it. “After filling the information, I got an SMS asking for my PAN and the last four digits of my bank account number, which I provided,” he said. He added after providing the details, the fraudster got access to his cell phone. “I received two OTPs, which I had keyed in on my cell phone, but the fraudster could see it. They siphoned off Rs 99,900 twice from my bank account without asking the OTPs,” the complainant said.He said after that he again received an OTP. “The fraudster called me and asked for the OTP, which I shared and immediately Rs 24,999 were siphoned off from my bank account. Realising it could be a fraud, I stopped responding to their calls,” he said. The complainant said, “Within half-an-hour, I had alerted my bank about the fraud. They could have stopped the transactions but nothing was done. I then filed a complaint with the cyber cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police.”He said the police, too, do not have powers to block a SIM or freeze an account. The sexagenarian said on Monday he filed a complaint with the Wakad police, “So that the fraudster could be restricted from duping others.”The police have registered the case under sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bank-app-update-ruse-to-cheat-elderly-man/articleshow/88699619.cms||Mihir Tanksale

He gave up his IIT Kharagpur seat to pursue his passion in physics. But after almost five years, about 18 months ago, Gupta decided to appear for the CAT. On Monday when the results were declared, he aced the competitive exam for admission to the Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) with his 100 percentile, bagging the highest score in the elite club of nine cent percentilers. A student of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, Gupta enrolled for an integrated five-year BS-MS programme, and will graduate in May. “I did a lot of physics projects. But about a year and a half ago, I did a lot of research and opted for a career change to consulting. My family supported my decision,” he told TOI on Tuesday.Gupta said that he was aiming for a career in strategy consulting once he completed his management degree. “I was sure of 99.99 percentile, but one never expects a 100 percentile so it was a pleasant surprise for me,” he added.He said he started preparing for CAT from March onwards and focused on mock tests. “Till the exam, I had attempted nearly 50-60 mock tests,” he said.Gupta, a resident of Goregaon in Mumbai, prepared for the test on his own. “I had forgotten all the maths formulae and had to go back to all my Std XII books. After a while, it started coming back to me. I would tell CAT aspirants to take as many mocks as they can if they want to crack the exam. In the case of verbal, people make the mistake of reading philosophy and psychology books. I started by reading novels,” said Gupta. But it was another deeper strategy that helped him in the exam. “Every time I took a mock test, I would not start attempting the paper for the first 15 minutes. This was meant to build more pressure. Last, always attempt the data interpretation questions even if they take more time, it is possible to arrive at an answer,” he said. Another dual degree mechanical engineering student of IIT Bombay Yash Mandhana who scored a 99.99 percentile credited it to consistent preparation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/iiser-student-chirag-gupta-aces-cat-with-top-percentile/articleshow/88699622.cms||Hemali Chhapia

While the fraud occurred in July-August 2021, the businessman waited for a couple of months for the rental deal to materialise before finally approaching the city police with a complaint. Post-verification of the complaint, the Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Monday registered an FIR. “We are not ruling out the possibility of three suspects involved in the case considering that the complainant was provided three separate mobile phone numbers for the money transfer using a UPI payment service app,” said inspector Vijay Puranik of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police. After clicking on the link, an online form, having similarities of a private infotech company, popped up on the complainant’s computer screen. The businessman filled the form and clicked on the submit button. “According to the requirement in the form, he also sent a message to the website operators with all his details and that of the shop,” Puranik said. A tele-caller then called and asked the businessman for more details. Later, his aides called and told the businessman that a non-banking financial company was interested in installing an ATM unit. The caller asked the businessman to pay a deposit, agreement charges, TDS amount, and other fees totalling Rs1.38 lakh in two months, the police said.  “The businessman transferred the money using his UPI application to three different phone numbers, which the telecaller had provided him.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bizman-loses-1-38l-in-online-search-for-renting-out-shop-to-atm-unit/articleshow/88699624.cms||---

At present, around 1,500 buses ply daily. “Our daily operations have touched pre-pandemic levels, but we are still short by 40-50% in daily passenger traffic. The PMPML is trying to run more buses and also adding new routes,”a PMPML official said. An official said a large chunk of people had stopped using buses . “They might have bought their own vehicles. Many workplaces are closed and not many schools are functioning as well. Crowd factor was also one of the reasons,”the official said. According to PMPML data, number of daily buses in July 2021were 450 and it increased to 1,450 in December. “Daily passenger traffic was around 4.5 lakh in July and 8.9 lakh in December. But overall average is still less,”the official said. “People also know another bus will be there in a few minutes, but they don’t always have the patience to wait,” another official said. A regular commuter Ganesh Kadam said the crowd scared him, which is why he had stopped using the buses.PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said, “If all seats in the bus are full, conductors shouldn’t even stop. There can be many ways to control crowd.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/extra-buses-on-roads-in-21-pmpml-revenue-still-low/articleshow/88699626.cms||Joy Sengupta

It has not been a smooth ride for the airport because of the pandemic for almost two years now. Earlier, flight operations had to be suspended for months in 2019 because of low visibility. With one million passenger-mark crossed, we are hoping to continue with the recent good run in terms of passenger traffic, cargo movements and facilities,” an airport official said.Deepak Kapoor, vice-chairman and managing director of MADC, tweeted, “On January 3, Shirdi airport successfully crossed the target of serving more than one million passengers with more than 13,000 flight movements…” An official said the airport is seeing daily passenger traffic of around 1,700 on weekends against just 300 after the first 2020 lockdown.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/shirdi-airport-crosses-1-mn-milestone/articleshow/88699628.cms||Joy Sengupta

We have been suffering for nine years due to the strict directions from the RBI,” said Bhalchandra Kulkarni, co-convenor of the forum.The RBI has received proposals to take over Rupee Bank from the Gujarat-based Mehsana Urban Cooperative Bank and the Mumbai-based Saraswat Bank. Rupee Bank administrators have claimed that except a negative net worth, the bank has no adverse regulatory or structural issues. Till September 2021, the bank’s overall losses stood at around Rs 627 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/proceed-with-rupee-bank-resolution-fast/articleshow/88699629.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||SPPU team develops nano formulation to treat candida with lignin from bagasse||Pune: Scientists at Savitribai Phule Pune University have succeeded in synthesizing zinc oxide nanomaterial to fight candidiasis, a fungal infection in humans, by using lignin extracted from sugar cane bagasse. The research was published in a renowned journal Elsevier, recently.Their study shows that nanotechnology can be used to develop advanced medicines using sustainable nanomaterial synthesis with agricultural waste like sugar cane bagasse. Their study aims to develop non-toxic, anti-fungal nano-formulations specifically designed to combat Candida infection.This research was successful in the laboratory and using agricultural waste as a raw material, the team of SPPU researchers are now trying to develop nanomaterials on a large scale. The team was led by scientists Manohar Chaskar and Rajendra Patil along with doctoral scholars Kanchan Joshi and Amruta Shelar.Lignin is a complex macromolecule of plant origin located in the secondary cell walls.Chaskar said that a major obstacle to effective antibiotic therapy for candidiasis is drug resistance. “Antimicrobial resistance in candida albicans and the diminishing availability of effective anti-microbial drugs have been identified as major global health threats by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, special focus should be placed on the development of potent anti-microbial agents, and the development of urgent curative strategy by targeting biofilm inhibition that can be more effective and safer is highly required in managing and treating Candidiasis and that is how we started our study,” he added.The use of drugs in combination or in high doses to treat C albicans infection may result in side effects, some of which are quite severe, raising serious concerns about the safety profile, and long-term use can lead to many complications. Chaskar added that nanoparticles synthesized by this research were tested on mouse embryo and toxicologically tested on rats. A study of the biocompatibility of lignin and zinc (ZnO) nanoparticles has shown that they are non-cytotoxic. In the present study, lignin-ZnO nanoparticles were found to be promising anti-virulence agents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/sppu-team-develops-nano-formulation-to-treat-candida-with-lignin-from-bagasse/articleshow/88699631.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

This is why players like Nick Kyrgios have been complaining about Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal) getting preferential treatment,” Rawal said. “The circumstances don’t matter. The rule is if you don’t have two vaccine doses, you cannot enter. (So) Why did they allow Djokovic?“Djokovic can have special treatment on the court (like centre court priority), but the entry point has to be same. In this case, it is directly connected with a government law. But Aman can be collateral damage, and Djokovic cannot be.” Rawal said he had earlier brought to the attention of the AO organisers that India was yet to start vaccination for teenagers and that they wrote to them again when the vaccination drive started two days ago.“We requested the Australian Open so much. We said that he will get one dose and undergo quarantine (for seven days). First they agreed for single dose, but then wrote back to us saying we have to have second dose,” he said.“The kid had worked hard for the last four years to reach where he is now. He played the event in Pune (ITF Asian B1 junior meet last month) with blisters because he wanted to go to the Oz Open.“Aman comes from a poor family, his father makes about Rs. 10,000 (a month). If he goes to Australia, it will send a strong message to all the kids like him. “He has 15 ITF titles, eight in singles and seven in doubles. Not many Indians can claim that in the last 20 years.”Rawal also mentioned that hardly any help came from the Indian federation or the central and state governments.“For one and half months we tried and reached out to all the authorities -- AITA, SAI and Sports Authority of Gujarat. None of them stepped up,” he said. “The message being sent out is only a few privileged can have it. That is the sad part.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dahiyas-coach-hits-out-at-ao-officials-for-double-standards/articleshow/88699634.cms||---

When governments across the world are fighting vaccine hesitancy among adults, adolescents in the city are showing the way with their vaccine eagerness. “My friends and I have been waiting for the vaccination drive to start for the 15-18 age group. We did not have any apprehensions because we had already done a lot of research about the immunisation when our parents took the vaccine last year,” said Siya Gurbaxani (17).Trisha Modi (16) said, “Everyone in my family had taken the vaccine, except me. I was looking forward to taking the jab but tested positive for Covid mid-December. I have a slight cold and cough, so my doctor has advised me to wait until I am perfectly fine. All my friends are posting pictures on social media of their vaccination and encouraging others to take it at the earliest.” “I had apprehensions about the symptoms associated with the vaccine but many of my friends have taken it since the drive started. They are motivating me to get my jab, too,” said Vansh Sanghvi (16).Jazmine Shah (16) planned her vacation in the US in such a way that she could take both vaccination doses there before the drive was started in Pune for those in her age group. “I got my first dose of Pfizer after registering with my identification documents within three days of my arrival in the US in July last year.”Rohan Gaikwad, MNS prabhag president of NIBM-Mohammedwadi, said the footfall of adolescent beneficiaries, though low on the first day, picked up significantly on the second day. Tushar Parikh, paediatrician, Motherhood hospital, Kharadi, said, “On the first day, we administered 45 doses. On the second day, all 100 slots were full, 10% of which were walk-ins. We are sharing information about the expiry date on the vile before administering the shots to the beneficiaries.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/teens-win-social-media-with-pro-jab-messages/articleshow/88699636.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The surveys have been conducted since April 2020 by the MCCIA to measure the economic activity and employment levels in the region after the onset of the pandemic and the subsequent restrictions. In December 2021, the respondents to the survey reported that production levels reached 92% of the pre-pandemic levels, up from 90% in November 2021. Employment levels compared to the pre-pandemic era remained constant over November and December 2021, at 91%. Despite the yet-low levels of restrictions on economic activity in the region concurring with the rise in cases, some firms have expressed apprehensions that meaningful recovery to pre-pandemic levels migh now take longer than previously expected. Industry observers have maintained that given the nature of the current surge, with low levels of hospitalisations and a strong inventory of oxygen, restrictions on economic activity should be kept to a minimum. “I genuinely believe that there should be no restrictions on manufacturing industries. The only restrictions on regular, everyday economic activity should be around limiting crowds. Thus, capacity restrictions on meetings, wedding functions and conferences make sense. It would also help if schools are taken online for a couple of months,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of MCCIA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-industries-maintain-recovery-hopes-despite-new-variant-cloud/articleshow/88699642.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The report showed that 76% of the patients were vaccinated, while 37% were yet to receive any Covid shot. The district administration carried out a symptom-wise analysis of 113 patients with Omicron infection. Of the 113 patients, 97 didn’t develop any symptoms till the time of their discharge and only 16 had mild symptoms. “Infection and illness are two different things. A person may catch the infection but can remain asymptomatic or disease-free. In the Pune district, most of the patients with Omicron infection have not developed illness and are absolutely symptom-free,” said additional district health officer Abhay Tidke. “Those who are asymptomatic are only being given vitamin supplements. A small number of patients with mild symptoms are being treated with paracetamol and other supportive medication,” said PMC’s nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Wavre. A total of 75 samples, including eight from Pune district, were found infected with the Omicron variant across the state on Tuesday, taking its tally to 578.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/just-14-of-omicron-patients-developed-symptoms-report/articleshow/88699643.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||ICMR scientists spot variant with S-gene dropout feature||PUNE: The SARS-CoV-2’s C.36.3.1 variant carrying Omicron-like genetic variation has been identified for the first time in India, a senior scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) told TOI on Tuesday. The variant has a del 69-70 mutation that shows the S-gene drop-out, a genetic variation like that of Omicron. It was earlier reported from some European countries and is detectable with the existing diagnostics. However, its identical Omicron-like S-gene target drop-out/failure is likely to muddle the use of specialized RT-PCR test kits that are currently being utilized to sift probable omicron cases from the daily caseload for “accelerated genome sequencing” to track the extent of community spread of the Omicron in the country. “The enhanced genome sequencing work is throwing up fresh concerns. For the first time in India, we have identified C.36.3.1 that is neither a variant of concern nor of interest or under investigation as of now. It is only a part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) list of monitored variants. The fact that it shows Omicron-like S gene drop-out throws a new challenge for the priority genome sequencing of positive clinical samples drawn from the community,” the scientist told TOI. The mutations carried by the C.36.3.1 make it a variant that should be followed. “The C.36.3.1 has a total of 36 defining mutations, of which nine are in the Spike (S) gene region as against 32 mutations identified in the S-gene of Omicron variant, which has a total of 52 mutations,” the scientist said. Despite forming a unique clade in European countries such as Switzerland, Germany and the UK with a mutation profile that is somewhat concerning, circulation of this variant remained low there. “It is too early and there is not enough data to say how the variant will play out in India. Some mutations in the variant, however, are known to produce increased affinity to the cell receptor,” the scientist said. Epidemiologists tracking the virus spread have underlined that variants keep emerging, but it does not necessarily mean they will be dangerous. “A variant becomes worrisome only when it becomes a ‘variant of concern’, like Omicron, which is more contagious and more past immunity evasive. It remains to be seen in which category this variant (C.36.3.1) will fall,” said a task force expert. The Omicron variant was detected in a sample taken from South Africa on November 24 last year. Since then, it has spread to over 100 countries. In India, it has so far infected nearly 1,900 people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/icmr-scientists-spot-variant-with-s-gene-dropout-feature/articleshow/88699645.cms||Umesh Isalkar

At present, 124 DCHCs and DCHs are functioning across 13 tehsils. Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s CEO, said, “We have instructed all tehsil health officers, medical officers, and primary health centre (PHC) heads to attach their staff to Covid facilities without hampering non-Covid healthcare.” ZP authorities also told the tehsil health officials to inspect the Covid facilities. The ZP is also in the process of recruiting health staff under the national health mission programme. Meanwhile, some PHC heads felt they were already understaffed. “A primary health centre covers at least 10 villages. The role of sub-centres has become critical after thevaccination of 15-18 age group. So, we need adequate manpower to administer vaccines. So, it will be a difficult task for the PHCs to manage their regular functioning,” said a PHC head.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/zp-to-restart-350-covid-facilities/articleshow/88699646.cms||---

Health officials anticipate huge demand for the third dose among the senior citizens with comorbidities in the wake of the rise in Omicron cases. The official said it would be challenging to find the vaccine taken by the people who do not have vaccination certificates. S Rajan, 60, said he had visited Periyanaickenpalayam government hospital for vaccination certificate, but in vain. He was inoculated during a private vaccination camp at Periyanaickenpalayam market. Since there is no proof of vaccination, it is difficult to generate a certificate for him and identify the vaccine that he had taken. “We have given a slip to the people who were inoculated in government hospitals. People can show the same as a proof of vaccination and get the booster dose,” the official said. Many health workers are now engaged in vaccinating the people in the age group of 15-18 years. More than 11,000 students were vaccinated on Monday. On Tuesday, another 17,028 students were inoculated in the district.“While the target is 1.61 lakh students, we want to finish the vaccination before January 10 to avoid additional burden on the health workers who will then be busy with administering the booster dose and handling the challenges associated with the same,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/frontline-workers-senior-citizens-to-get-booster-dose/articleshow/88699648.cms||---

Officials said the lessons learned in the second wave would help them face another wave in a better manner.A district administration official said they were reviving Covid care centres in the city and the round-the-clock Covid control room at the collector office. “Also, bed and oxygen availability in hospitals is being reviewed and steps are being taken to increase the same.”District collector G S Sameeran had instructed the private hospitals to allocate 10% of the total beds to treat Omicron patients under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme.Dr Darez Ahmed, director, national health mission, Tamil Nadu, inspected both the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital and the ESI Hospital on Tuesday.

Malls, commercial places and recreational facilities should ensure access only to fully vaccinated people.”There was, meanwhile, an increase in Covid cases in the district in the past two days. The district recorded 120 fresh cases on Tuesday, up from 105 on Monday.

He was produced before a judicial magistrate and remanded in judicial custody. The Peelamedu police said it was during the baggage scanning at the city airport that the .22mm revolver with seven bullets was detected. “Thangal, former chairman of Pattambi municipality in Kerala, had booked an IndiGo flight to Bengaluru from the city. The airline staff scanned his baggage and found the revolver. They alerted the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, who picked him up for inquiry,” a police officer told TOI. Thangal, he said, told the CISF personnel that he was not aware about the revolver in his luggage. Later, he was handed over to the Peelamedu police. “Thangal told us that he was secretary of a private school at Pattambi and going to Amritsar to buy uniforms for the students. It was his father’s revolver and not in use for many years. He said his family members might have accidentally kept the weapon in the bag . The revolver is not in a working condition. It will be sent to the armoury for testing,” the officer said. Since Thangal failed to produce valid documents for the revolver, the Peelamedu police have registered a case under Section 3 read with 25(i)(B)(A) of Arms Act, 1959, and arrested him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/kerala-congress-man-arrested-with-revolver-in-city-airport/articleshow/88699652.cms||---

He said Modi was remaining silent on the reports of China’s aggressive infrastructure development projects near the Line of Actual Control. Addressing the media in the city, Raja said India and China should continue the dialogue to mitigate the tension on the border and find a solution to the issue. “Earlier, Modi had conducted a meeting with the representatives of all political parties on the Galwan valley face-off, stating the country had not conceded an inch of land to China. But he is not talking about the issue now. Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh should clarify the country about the developments taking place on the border areas.” He said the Left was an uncompromising force fighting against the BJP-RSS combine. “The influence of the Left is high and nobody can undermine the communist movement in the country. There is a gap between the influence of our movement and electoral performance. We are discussing how to bridge this gap.” He said the party’s three-day national executive meeting would be held in the district from January 26 to discuss political situations, challenges faced by the people and issues prevailing in the country. “All the political parties should unite to dethrone the BJP government at the Centre. The Modi government has been functioning against democracy and the constitution. The BJP has been functioning as a political arm of the RSS and implementing the RSS agenda in the country. All the secular, democratic and anti-fascist force should come together to throw out the Modi government,” the CPI leader said. Referring to the RSS Shakha that was conducted on the premises of a private matriculation school premises in the city, he said the youths, who participated in the training programme, were taught to be involved in violence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/pm-should-break-silence-on-chinese-presence-in-galwan-valley-says-cpi/articleshow/88699657.cms||---

However, the total number of birds spotted decreased from 1,674 to 1,521 in this range in Meerut district. “Out of the 45 species spotted here, 24 are resident species and 21 migratory species. Five of these species are in the ‘threatened’ category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list,” said TK Roy, Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) Delhi state coordinator, Wetlands International. The day-long bird count exercise on Sunday, revealed a decrease in the number of Bar-headed Geese (365), Gadwal and Common Teal and an increase in Ruddy Shelduck (47), and Greylag Geese (50) in comparison to previous years. The Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary falls in the Central Asian Flyway and its wetlands, comprising marshes, ponds and lakes, provide a natural habitat for water birds. “Last year, due to good monsoon, several dried-up wetlands, especially seasonal marshlands on the Ganga floodplains, revived and attracted a good number of long-distance winter migratory water birds, especially ducks, Geese and a few waders. But in the January, 2022 census, a large number of migratory birds have disappeared d ue to shrinking of the wetlands caused by human interference,” added Roy. The AWC is an annual exercise to count the waterbirds and monitor the wetlands for conservation of migratory birds and their habitats along the Central Asian Flyway. The census, which began on January 1, is being carried out across Asia and Australasia simultaneously, and will conclude on January 16. The census in Hastinapur witnessed the participation of a student volunteer team from the department of environmental science, Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, led by Prof A K Chaubey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/hastinapur-range-sees-drop-in-number-of-waterbirds/articleshow/88699658.cms||Sandeep Rai

The battery car service was also suspended in view of shooting stones and landslides on the new route. “Dense fog in Trikuta Hills compelled authorities to suspend the chopper service from Katra to Sanjichhat,” he added. The Vaishno Devi shrine is situated at an altitude of 5,200ft above sea level and attracts close to a million devotees every year. Due to a sudden rush of pilgrims who had arrived at the shrine to mark the beginning of the new year, as many as 12 people died while 15 others were injured in a stampede.

Offences with seizure of commercial quantities of brown sugar (250 grams and above) and ganja (20kg and above) will be treated as “special report” (SR) cases.In the Odisha Police, senior officers like superintendents of police (SPs) and range deputy inspectors general (DIGs) or inspectors general (IGs) will monitor the SR-category cases.“It has been decided that (pending government approval) from now on, all Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act-related cases with seizure of commercial quantity drugs will be treated as the SR cases. Seizures having less than the commercial quantity will be treated as non-SR cases,” read a circular, sent by the special task force (STF) of the state Crime Branch to all SPs, last week.The circular was signed by former DGP Abhay on December 31, 2021, the day he had retired. Same day, the government made him the chairman of a new task force to curb drug menace in Odisha. The government is likely to notify the terms of reference of the new task force.“We want to ensure conviction of the NDPS Act-related cases so that the drug menace can be checked to a great extent. Supervision at a higher level is necessary to ensure better investigation and conviction of the cases,” a senior police officer said.The state police and the STF made record seizures of brown sugar and ganja in 2020 and 2021. While 34 kg brown sugar was seized in 2020, the seizure stood at 33 kg in 2021 (till August). Altogether 1,374 quintals of ganja was seized in 2020 and 1,229 quintals till August 2021.Under the chapter V-A of the NDPS Act (Section A-Z), there is a provision of seizure and forfeiture of the ill-gotten property of the accused involved in such cases. During financial investigation into such drug smuggling cases, the police normally seize movable and immovable assets, which were illegally acquired by the accused from the profits of drugs trade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/senior-cops-asked-to-monitor-drug-cases/articleshow/88699661.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Stating that curbs must not affect livelihood in any manner, Naveen said enforcement must be judicious. “Like in other parts of the country, the number of Omicron patients is rising in Odisha. However, Covid management must not inconvenience people. There has to be restrictions to prevent the spread of infections, but these must not affect people’s livelihood,” a government statement quoted Naveen as saying. The chief minister asked officials to undertake vaccination of 15-18 age group on mission mode. The government also decided to appoint senior bureaucrats as observers for various districts, like in the second wave, to monitor preparedness on a war footing. Odisha had readied more than 10,000 general beds, 4,000 ICU beds and 1288 ventilators in government and private hospitals during the second wave.The state’s daily infection count and test positivity rate (TPR) have been steadily rising over the past one week, which experts fear may be due to the Omicron variant of Covid. From 221 cases on December 29, it has more than tripled on Tuesday. The TPR, too, has jumped to 1.31% from around 0.3% a week back.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/naveen-to-babus-ramp-up-health-infra-to-check-covid/articleshow/88699663.cms||---

The Sahasrabuddhe-led parliamentary panel is currently examining the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that proposes to raise the marriageable age of girls to 21 and make it uniform for boys as well. The bill was referred to the panel for further scrutiny after it was introduced in Lok Sabha on December 21.Arguing against raising the minimum age bar, the OSCPCR chief wrote that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and Integrated Child Protection Scheme have the scope to extend support to vulnerable children only up to the age of 18. “In such circumstances there will be no space to provide support to a child bride/groom in between the age of 19 to 21 if rescued from child marriage,” she wrote.“The POCSO Act has restricted consensual sex up to the age of 18. This implies that someone may have sexual act after 18 but won’t be able to marry till 21, will create new sets of issues like increasing unwed mothers and foeticide thereafter,” Pradhan added. Stating that legislation alone has never been able to check child marriage, she pointed out the National Crime Records Bureau data which showed 785 cases were registered under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act in 2020, which was 523 in 2019 and 501 in 2018. On the other hand, National Family Health Survey-V shows 23.3% girls had been married before the legal age of 18, she wrote.Pradhan said change of legislation only will never be able to stop child marriage. “Socio-behavioural change among parents and community is needed,” she said, adding, “Factors such as distress and poverty, patriarchal norms and lack of opportunity for schooling and jobs contribute to child marriage.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/retain-marriage-age-of-girls-at-18-urges-oscpcr-chief/articleshow/88699666.cms||---

Their representation in these three zones in the zilla parishad appears to be a distant dream as the zones are not reserved for them to contest in the upcoming panchayat elections, said a Dalit leader.“These communities have been deprived of representation in the apex panchayat body for the past 25 years from these three zones. During this period, all other communities, including women, were elected from other zones, except these three. We urge the government to reconsider the reservation status of these three zones and give an opportunity to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to contest in the coming panchayat elections,” he added.While zone no. 11 of the zilla parishad was made un-reserved, no. 60 and 62 were reserved for women in the draft reservation policy. The tribal leaders said no post of sarpanch and block chairperson has been reserved for their community in most of the districts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/ganjam-sc/st-groups-fume-on-rural-poll-role/articleshow/88699673.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Punjab: PM Modi to launch BJP election campaign with Ferozepur rally||BATHINDA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a rally in Ferozepur on Wednesday to launch the poll campaign for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab. The rally in Ferozepur, where the party has a considerable presence, will launch BJP’s role as a senior partner in its alliance with former chief minister Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and the remnants of SAD (Sanyukt) led by Akali leader and former Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. BJP is going all out to ensure a huge crowd for the Modi rally. The party is expecting a gathering of nearly 2.5 lakh people from across Punjab, according to BJP state unit general secretary Jeevan Gupta, who is in-charge of the Ferozepur rally. The Prime Minister is visiting Punjab after nearly two years due to the Covid outbreak but he has always fulfilled promises made to the people of Punjab be it withdrawal of farm laws or opening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, Gupta said. Police stop farmers on the way to protest at PM Narendra Modi’s rallyThere is speculation about some major announcement by Modi at the rally, but the party is neither confirming nor denying anything. “I assure you that the Prime Minister's rally is bound to bring a new change in Punjab politics and if any doubts are there in people’s minds about the BJP, all those will be cleared,” said Gupta. Claiming that Punjab transporters faced a shortage of buses to fulfill BJP's demand for the rally, Gupta said the party had to arrange buses from neighbouring states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. As the leaders from other parties have joined the BJP in the past few weeks, Gupta added that more leaders are expected to join the saffron party after the Prime Minister's rally. Till now, BJP was a junior partner in its almost 25-year alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal and was limited to certain pockets mainly in the Majha and Doaba regions of the state. The Modi rally is a strong indication that it now is aiming to make inroads in the all-important Malwa region. After announcing his government's decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws on Gurpurb, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev on November 19, 2021, BJP is trying to placate farmers and Sikh voters, who had totally rejected the party over these farm laws. This is for the first time that the saffron party is taking Punjab seriously and is making all-out efforts to show that Punjab, dominated by Sikhs, is no longer angry with BJP and in the last few weeks, has inducted a number of Sikh leaders in the party. At present, BJP is concentrating on urban segments and may prefer to leave rural segments where Sikh voters outnumber Hindu voters to its alliance partners, according to sources. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Kumar Sharma also reiterated that the Modi rally will be a turning point in Punjab polity. "People are evincing faith in the leadership of Narendra Modi and this faith will translate into making a BJP-led government in the state," he added. The Modi government is banking on healthcare and road infrastructure sectors to make inroads in Punjab. It is highlighting upgradation of healthcare infrastructure as Modi will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects, including the PGI satellite centre and two medical colleges at Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur. A number of road projects too will be launched. The party is also trying to generate goodwill on the religious front by connecting Sikh religious sites at Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib, Tarn Taran, and the Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi at Katra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/modi-to-launch-bjp-election-campaign-with-ferozepur-rally/articleshow/88699674.cms||Neel Kamal

The other two IPS officers found most suitable by the UPSC to head the Punjab police include the 1987-batch officer and former state police chief Dinkar Gupta and the 1988-batch officer Prabodh Kumar. The state government has the prerogative to appoint one of the three IPS officers, found most suitable by the UPSC, as the state police chief. The Punjab government led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was trying its best that the UPSC should consider now officiating state police head and 1986-batch IPS officer Siddharth Chattopadhyaya among the three suitable officers for the post but faced embarrassment after the UPSC dropped Chattopadhyaya’s name since he is superannuating on March 31. The UPSC did not consider September 30, 2021, as the cut-off date for the selection of DGP as being pushed by the state government. As the UPSC considered October 5, 2021, as the cut-off date, Chattopadhyaya was left with less than the mandatory six-month remaining eligibility service period for the post. Bhawra, who holds the charge of DGP Punjab home guards and director, civil defence, is superannuating on May 31, 2024. The Election Commission had in October 2016 handpicked Bhawra as the nodal officer for the 2017 Punjab assembly elections. During his central deputation earlier, Bhawra has served the Intelligence Bureau. After Channi replaced Capt Amarinder Singh as the chief minister, he chose Sahota as officiating DGP on September 25 till the appointment of permanent DGP through the UPSC process. Then permanent state police chief Gupta was sent on leave. Sahota's appointment was strongly opposed by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on the ground that Sahota was head of the SIT probing sacrilege cases in 2015 that had arrested two innocent Sikhs but had to leave them later. Finally, Sidhu succeeded and Sahota was replaced by Chattopadhyaya as officiating DGP on December 17. Apart from Chattopadhyaya, Bhawra, Gupta, and Kumar, the state government had on September 30 last year sent six more names in the panel to the UPSC for the DGP's post. These include MK Tiwari (1987-batch), Rohit Choudhary (1988-batch), former officiating state police chief Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota (1988-batch), Sanjeev Kalra (1989-batch), Parag Jain (1989-batch), and Barjinder Kumar Uppal (1991-batch).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/upsc-sends-three-names-for-post-of-punjab-dgp/articleshow/88699677.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Stress & strain of military service aggravates medical conditions, says Chandigarh AFT||CHANDIGARH: Underlining again the effect of stress and strain of military service on the medical conditions of defence personnel, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) Chandigarh has set aside the rejection of disability pension on the pretext that the disability of ‘hypertension’ was a ‘lifestyle disease’ incurred in a ‘peace area’. The Chandigarh bench of the AFT, comprising Justice Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Vice Admiral H C S Bisht, has passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Colonel Jagir Singh of Amritsar. The petitioner was commissioned in 1963 and released from service after serving in various field and peace areas in the low medical category with ‘hypertension’. Though the disability was declared as ‘aggravated by stress and strain of military service” by the Release Medical Board (RMB), he was later made to undergo another medical board by the authorities which declared his disability ‘neither attributable to, nor aggravated (NANA) by military service’ being a ‘lifestyle disease’ incurred in a ‘peace area’. Calling such reasons far-fetched and underlining that military personnel serving even in peace areas can suffer from stress and strain of service being posted away from their families, the tribunal has directed the government to release the disability pension as per law declared by the SC in similar cases. The SC and various high courts have earlier held that if a person joins military service in a fit medical condition, then there is a presumption that medical conditions arising in service, unless due to a person’s own negligence of health, are deemed as affected by service conditions and no distinction can be made between ‘peace’ and ‘field’ areas for grant of disability pension. A high-level committee of experts constituted to reduce litigation in the defence ministry on the directions of defence minister Manohar Parrikar in 2015 had observed that a regimented lifestyle, living away from family, restricted rights, frequent movements and inability to cater to domestic commitments all added up in aggravating medical conditions of defence personnel and that even the rules were quite liberal but were being interpreted narrowly by the authorities. The committee had also observed that such matters should be conceded in courts on a case-to-case basis, being already covered by decisions of the Supreme Court and high courts. Experts say that the ministry of defence (MOD) had issued letters implementing the recommendations, but such cases were still being contested by military authorities in courts and tribunals, resulting in wastage of public money and manpower, paperwork and burden on courts, apart from delay.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/stress-strain-of-military-service-aggravates-med-conditions-aft/articleshow/88699678.cms||Ajay Sura

Of these, over 39,000 voters are 100 years or above in age, shows the election commission data, exclusively accessed by TOI.  Though minuscule in percentage, these 39,598 voters are likely to vote in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, with election commission providing them special facilities, including that of postal ballot service, to vote. In Lucknow, we will also try to push centenarian voters as local ambassadors to motivate others to take part in the voting process, said district election officer, Lucknow, Abhishek Prakash. “The EC is offering postal ballot service at homes of voters who are above 80 years. Further if any senior citizen electors wish to visit polling booth. our on-duty staff will assist them in every possible way,” said Prakash.  As per data, the highest number of centurion electors are registered in Aligarh (1,727) followed by Prayagraj (1,413), Azamgarh (1,252), Ballia (1,213), Ghazipur (1,135) and Shahjahanpur (948).  Sultanpur and Mainpuri district recorded the least number of centurion voters 48 and 61 respectively. Speaking to TOI, Rakesh Tripathi, the spokesperson of BJP Uttar Pradesh unit, said, “Though centenarian voters are less in percentage as compared to total number registered electors, but such voters have immense experience. They have lived under several regimes, and with their vast experience they can often predict the elections results. Also, such voters have a lot of following in their community and families who follow them to polling booths. One such centenarian has been the MLA from our party as well.” Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi felicitated former two-time 106-year-old MLA Shri Narain alias Bhulai Bhai, who have represented Naurangiya assembly segment, now known as Khadda in Kushinagar. Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Vaibhav Maheshwari said, “Centenarian voters have seen both the colonial and free India. Their opinion in public has huge weightage.

---||Chandigarh||Ambala’s stadium project in funds row||CHANDIGARH: The construction of Haryana’s War Heroes’ Memorial Stadium in Ambala Cantonment has become embroiled in controversies over the alleged loss to the state exchequer of around Rs 45 crore. It has been claimed that due to the alleged connivance of some officials of Haryana’s PWD (B&R) department, the contractor of the project was paid in excess leading to loss to the state exchequer. Importantly, despite the recommendation of recovery of the loss to the state exchequer and action by some senior officers of the department against executive engineers (XEN), SDO, and JE-level officers, no action has been taken by the senior officers of the department in this regard.An examination of communication between the officers of the department has put the total loss to around Rs 45 crore. This includes Rs 35.91 crore as a loss on account of funds paid for excess quantity, and Rs 9.18 crore as a loss on account of excess rates paid to the contractor. The construction of the stadium, including IAAF-approved synthetic track and FIFA-approved artificial football turf was allotted to M/s Garg & Company, Jind in March 2017 for an agreement amount of around Rs 40.48 crore against the administrative approval of around Rs 48.57 crore. The cost of the project was revised to around Rs 85.28 crore in July 2019 and re-revised to Rs 115.16 crore in February 2021. The work was to be executed through the Haryana PWD (B&R) department. The allegations are that non-scheduled rates of structural steel were paid to the contractor at Rs 151.81 per kg but were revised to Rs138.80 per kg against the existing approved price bid where Rs 62 per kg was quoted for this item. After some senior officers of the department wrote to the head office for de-sanctioning of non-scheduled rates of structural steel as it was part of the approved price bid by the contractor, a committee was constituted by the head office on October 13, 2021, to decide the rates of structural steel and whether it was an approved item or a non-scheduled item. (Approved items are those which are approved to be undertaken by the contractor as per the agreement finalised at the time of the bid. Non-scheduled items are those which are not the part of original bid but surface during the execution of the work) The quantity of structural steel as taken in the approved bill of quantity was 7,690 quintals but the contractor was paid for 32,084 quintals. However, during the site visit by senior officials of the department, it was noticed that the quantity of structural steel items executed at the site was much lesser than the quantity paid to the contractor. In November 2021, a committee was constituted to verify these facts. TOI has accessed several communications of the department regarding the alleged irregularities and in which serious allegations of fraud have been levelled by senior officials. Interestingly, the committee found that only 13,349.60 quintals of structural steel were executed against the payment made to the contractor for 33,316.31 quintals. Around 4,270-quintal steel was also found by the committee on the site as of December 13, 2021. The committee held the excess quantity of structural steel paid to the contractor was around 15,697 quintals. The committee also noticed illegal excess undue payment of profile sheeting and terracotta cladding beyond the executed quantity. Based on the committee's report and after analysing the record, the higher officials of the department had quantified the total loss to be around Rs 45 crore. Importantly, an examination of the various communications received by the head of the PWD (B&R) department revealed that the total payment of Rs 48.70 crore for 32,084 quintals of structural steel quantity of Rs 151.81 per kg was released to the contractual agency as against the Rs 62 per kg rates fixed at the time of the allotment of the contract and due to excess steel shown to have been used by the contractor. Records also revealed that the department had revised the rates from Rs 151.81 per kg to Rs 143 per kg and again to 138 per kg. Even this earlier approval of higher rates and then again revision of the rates for the same items resulted in an extra undue claim in favour of the contractor and litigation against the government interest. It was because of these two revisions of rates, the contractor had approached the HC and got stay orders on the recovery of the alleged excess amount received by him. Interestingly, no action has been taken despite recommendations. When contacted, Arvind Kumar, engineer-in-chief (buildings), Haryana PWD department, expressed complete ignorance of the issue and said that "the matter is not in his knowledge." The projectThe construction of this stadium was allotted to M/s Garg & Company, Jind in March 2017. According to the Haryana government, the upcoming stadium would be best in north India in accordance with the international standards and the first such stadium in Haryana, where national and international-level football matches will be held.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ambalas-stadium-project-in-funds-row/articleshow/88699680.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||Massive rise in Covid cases, but testing slow in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: At a time when a sharp rise in Covid-19 caseload clearly indicates at the beginning of the third wave of infection, Punjab has been found wanting in testing, which is one of the key containment measures. The daily testing count has been abysmally poor in recent weeks, dropping below 10,000 on January 3. The average seven-day test per million population has dropped below 500, which at one point was close to 2,000. Low testing and high positivity ratio many districts have emerged as a cause of concern for the health authorities.  Sample this: 23.95% of samples of 597 examined in Patiala were found positive on January 3. Similarly, in Pathankot, despite a low testing figure of 358, 16.20% of samples were found infected. On January 2, 13.64% out of 572 samples were tested positive. To improve the sampling and testing ahead of the state Assembly elections, the state health department has set an ambitious daily testing target of 60,000 — 35,000 RT-PCR and 25,000 RAT — which has been further distributed among districts.  In a communication to civil surgeons, the principal health secretary pointed out that sampling and testing frequency has sharply dropped, and many districts are collecting less number of samples which is disproportionate to the population of the districts. Highlighting the importance of these containment measures, civil surgeons were directed to increase sampling and testing in their respective districts. As part of the strategy, health officials have been asked to focus on severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) patients, symptomatic persons coming to OPD/IPD, international travellers and their contacts, contacts of Covid patients, persons in containment zones, vulnerable population, prisons\old age home\orphanages\shelter homes, persons with co-morbidities and commercial places.  Ludhiana has been given the highest daily testing target of 8,200 — 4,800 RT-PCR and 3,400 RAT — followed by a target of 5,400 for Amritsar, 4,600 Jalandhar and 4,000 Patiala. Rapid antigen tests can give results in 15-20 minutes with an accuracy of about 70%, having the possibility of throwing more false negatives, while results of RT-PCR, which is considered as a gold standard in the diagnosis of Covid-19, are processed in 24 hours. Due to reliability issues, civil surgeons have been asked to use RT-PCR and RAT in the ratio of 60:40. Punjab uses both conventional RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests for detecting the virus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/massive-rise-in-cases-but-testing-slow-in-punjab/articleshow/88699681.cms||Vinod Kumar
