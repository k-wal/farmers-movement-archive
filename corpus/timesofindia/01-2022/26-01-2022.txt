Today, this long-cherished dream is turning into reality. A 26-year-old BSF officer, P Jayanthi, is thrilled to be performing for the first time with the all-women bikers’ team, Seema Bhawani, at the Rajpath. “I feel quite lucky that I’m finally getting to do this,” says the young woman, who has been training for the big day with her team since December 20. Her team will be showcasing the pyramid formation and Jayanthi says even the preparations have been fun. Jayanthi, who always wished to don the uniform, says this is the only job she ever applied for. “If I wasn’t selected for the force, I would have joined the Kerala Police,” says the Soldier one grade officer, who joined the BSF soon after her graduation in 2017. “Right from the time I joined, I wanted to try to be part of the parade. At the same time, I always used to immerse myself deep in work, whenever in the uniform and couldn’t do the needful in the first few years.” But, the officer, who was working on the India-Bangladesh border, went on to win awards for her performance and eventually brought herself to apply for parade participation. “I also sent the selectors my riding videos and soon, I was lucky to be selected,” she says. Jayanthi, whose husband Sangeeth Raj is also part of the BSF, had wished her parents too could witness her performance but the pandemic situation means that isn’t possible. “Regardless, I’m hoping to give it my all,” says the officer, who reveals that her ultimate dream is to “Do a ton of social service.” She says, “That’s something that gives me joy, always. I don’t think much about earning bigger posts in my job, but if I can at least buy a pen for a kid who needs it, that gives me pleasure,” she says, signing off. The Seema Bhawani team was formed in 2016, and they participated in the Republic Day parade for the first time in 2018. More than 100 female troops from different ranks form part of the performance. This is the second time that the team is showcasing its stunts for the parade.

More than the caste equations, what is sure to catch eyeballs was the candidature of jailed former minister Gayatri Prajapati’s wife from Amethi and party fielding a candidate against strongman Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya in Kunda. The party has also accommodated sitting BJP MLA from Nanpara, Madhuri Verma and named former minister Pawan Pandey as a candidate from Ayodhya. Another sitting BSP MLA Hakim Chand Bind is the party candidate from Hardiya in Prayagraj. The lone Muslim candidate on the list is sitting SP MLA Yasar Shah from Bahraich City. He is a sitting MLA from Matera assembly seat of Bahraich district. If party sources are to be believed, the candidature of Maharaji Prajapati, the wife of Mulayam loyalist and jailed former minister Gayatri Prajapati was recommended by some influential quarters of the Yadav clan. The party has nominated Gulshan Yadav as a candidate from Kunda from where Raja Bhaiya is an independent sitting MLA since 1991. His proximity with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav is well known but the sitting MLA had failed to cut the ice with Akhilesh after the two parted ways on a sour note after SP entered into an alliance with BSP and Raja Bhiaya voted against the alliance candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections. The SP chief has, however, accommodated former SP minister late Pandit Singh’s nephew Suraj Singh from Gonda city and retained former MP and SP veteran Reoti Raman Singh’s son sitting MLA Ujjwal Raman Singh in Karchana assembly constituency of Prayagraj. Party general secretary Indrajit Saroj is SP candidate from Manjhanpur (Kaushambi). The list includes the name of Santosh Pandey from Lambhua in Sultanpur district.

---||World||Peer in House of Lords calls for UK 'golden visas' to be abolished||LONDON: The golden visa route to enter the UK that wealthy Indians use to get the right to live in Britain could come under greater scrutiny or be abolished altogether after a peer in the House of Lords tabled an amendment to a bill passing through Parliament calling for it to be axed as he fears it is facilitating money laundering and corruption. The UK tier 1 investor visa, established in 2008, is the most favoured route that high net worth individuals from India, China, Russia and other countries use to get permanent residency in the UK. Applicants simply have to invest at least £2 million (Rs 20 crore) in the UK and a decision on the visa will be made in just three weeks — far swifter than an asylum application. Those who get it are eligible to settle after five years and, if they invest £10 million (Rs 100 crore), they get permanent residency after two years. Lord Wallace of Saltaire has tabled an amendment to the Nationality and Borders Bill, which is at committee stage in the House of Lords. His amendment calls on the cash-for-residency visa route to be suspended until a review of the investor visas granted between June 2008 and April 2015 is published or until the route is closed permanently to new applicants. Saltaire told TOI he was concerned about “foreign influence” and political party donations by the recipients of such visas and the “importation of corruption” from countries like Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. “India is less a country of concern than Central Asia,” he said. His amendment will be debated at committee stage and then, at report stage, amendments that had the most support at committee stage will get voted on. Those that are passed will be sent back to the House of Commons. In an October 2015 report, Transparency International UK said “it is highly likely that substantial amounts of corrupt wealth stolen from China and Russia have been laundered into the UK through the UK’s golden visa programme”. In the House of Lords debate Saltaire described it as a “shameful visa programme” that allows “wealthy people from dodgy countries to buy the right to live in the UK and, after a period of residence, to qualify for citizenship.” “It has been reported that more than 6,000 golden visas, half of those yet issued, are being reviewed for possible national security risks, although those who applied in earlier years will by now have acquired full UK citizenship,” Saltaire said. “Two court of appeal judgments in the last year have thrown up questions about the regulation of this scheme and the sources of the finance pledged by applicants. In four of the National Crime Agency’s major cases about illicit finance and unexplained wealth orders in the last two years, those under investigation had originally entered the UK with a golden visa. Most golden visas have been issued to individuals from countries with a high risk of corruption,” he said. A July 2020 report on Russia by the UK’s intelligence and security committee called for an overhaul of the tier 1 (investor) visa programme, warning that it was providing Russian oligarchs with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London “laundromat”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/peer-in-house-of-lords-calls-for-uk-golden-visas-to-be-abolished/articleshow/89124697.cms||NAOMI CANTON

This rugged and restive tribal land bordering Afghanistan has been on the radar again since the Taliban takeover of the neighbouring nation to the north. “A small-scale attack on the military, something very common here, will trigger indiscriminate firing from the forces. Curfew will be imposed, search operations will start, and everyone will be forced indoors. I advise you to leave as soon as possible,” said an influential tribal elder in the town of Mir Ali. Famous in the past for its fearless warriors and good-natured hospitality, North Waziristan was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) until it was merged in 2018 with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to stop the “Talibanisation” of the area and bring Islamabad’s influence. But this place has remained a trouble spot, a no-go for travellers: permission, solid reason and registration on entry and exit are needed to visit this scenic but dangerous area. For a new visitor, travelling down a new road to Waziristan gives the impression of normality. But things are not well in this mountainous region, more so since Taliban fighters recently broke a border fence and stopped Pakistani soldiers from fixing it. The Taliban say the fence divides families on both sides of the 2,670km border, known as the Durand Line. The Taliban don’t recognise the Durand Line. In Mir Ali, the second largest town of North Waziristan, heavily armed soldiers have replaced young and old civilians carrying automatic weapons on the roads and markets. An army convoy moves slowly in the bazaar, flanked by soldiers ready to fire at the slightest hint of danger. Not a single woman was to be seen in markets, on roads, or even outside people’s homes. A senior intelligence official from Mir Ali said he was visiting home after five years to attend a funeral. “You may have noticed on the way makeshift arrangements for people displaced by the 2014 military offensive (in North Waziristan). They are not returning home because they know their towns and villages are unsafe,” he said. He was referring to Pakistan’s second biggest internal displacement of people in a military offensive against terrorists. A brief stopover at one such “camp” during the return trip from Mir Ali brought clarity. “The militants are not publicly visible, but will demand men and material through their emissaries. Refusal is risky and acceptance means reprisal from the military that has an effective intelligence network,” said Islam Gul, a Dawar tribe elder. This region has been a springboard for wars in Afghanistan for over four decades. The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban, al-Qaeda, Haqqani Network and a host of little-known outfits and warlords used the area to hold hostages, train terrorists, store weapons and deploy suicide bombers to targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The 2014 military crackdown brought some semblance of normality, many terrorists escaped, but peace has remained tentative because this remote land has enough boltholes to hide an army. Proof perhaps are the recent attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on targets in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/armys-gun-guards-shaky-peace-at-pakistans-global-terrorism-hq/articleshow/89124715.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The attack rattled authorities because the city was ring-fenced with maximum security ahead of Republic Day, a time when terrorists were known to step up their violent activities. IGP Vijay Kumar tweeted that “hardcore stone-pelter Aijaz Wani, son of Fayaz Wani” from Fatehkadal in downtown Srinagar was arrested and he threw the grenade “at the behest of terrorists”. He also said an investigation is being conducted. The grenade was thrown at a police and CRPF team stationed at the market bustling with afternoon shoppers, but it missed the target and landed near the pedestrians on the road. Among the wounded are Mohammad Shafi Bhat, 43, and wife Tanveera, 38, from Chattabal in Srinagar, Asmat, 40, from Charar-i-Sharief in Budgam, and 40-year-old police inspector Tanveer Ahmad, who works with the anti-corruption bureau. The cop was in his civvies. The others are Nusrat, 48, from Nawab Bazar in Srinagar, Zahoor Ahmad Lone, 30, from Khaniyar, Imtiyaz Ahmad, 25, of the city’s Lal Chowk area, and Gyasuddin, 35, from Assam. They were taken to SMHS hospital, where medical superintendent Dr Kawaljeet Singh said the patients suffered abdomen and leg wounds. Their condition is said to be stable. The market was cordoned off immediately after the blast, while security agencies put the entire Union territory on maximum alert. A multi-layered security arrangement has been made for peaceful Republic Day celebrations at the Maulana Azad Stadium in Jammu at Sher-e-Kashmir Stadium in Srinagar on Wednesday morning. Heavy security deployment and round-the-clock patrols are in place, checkpoints are erected, while drones are being used for aerial surveillance. Police checked passengers of vehicles entering Srinagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/srinagar-grenade-attack-wounds-8-suspect-held/articleshow/89124755.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||World||US court upholds conviction of Mexican drug lord El Chapo||NEW YORK: The conviction of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was upheld Tuesday by a United States appeals court that praised the trial judge for his handling of a case that drew international attention.  The decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected claims that Judge Brian Cogan made rulings allowing a jury to hear faulty evidence at Guzman's 2019 trial.  Cogan "conducted the three-month trial with diligence and fairness, after issuing a series of meticulously crafted pretrial rulings," the ruling by the panel concluded.  Guzman, 64, was sentenced to life behind bars for a massive drug conspiracy that spread murder and mayhem for more than two decades.  On appeal, his lawyers had argued that the guilty verdict was tainted because some jurors reportedly sought out news accounts about sex abuse allegations against him that were barred from the trial, and that Cogan erred by not ordering a hearing on the reports.  "The decision seems like it was decided and written before the argument even occurred," one of Guzman's lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, said in a statement Tuesday. "How can there be justice here when the jury was exposed to scurrilous claims against Mr Guzman which were not part of the government's case?"  The appeals court found that Cogan was to correct in finding "that the jury was not prejudiced by any extraneous information to which they might have been exposed." It added:. "Any possible prejudice was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of Guzman's guilt.  Before the trial in federal court in Brooklyn, Guzman had attained near-mythical status by escaping from prison twice in Mexico, the second time through a tunnel dug into the shower of his cell. He was recaptured and sent in 2017 to the United States and put in solitary confinement.  At trial, Guzman, the defense argued, was the fall guy for other kingpins who were better at paying off top Mexican politicians and law enforcement officials to protect them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-upholds-conviction-of-mexican-drug-lord-el-chapo/articleshow/89124820.cms||---

"It's incumbent upon both governments to be ambitious. It's incumbent upon well-wishers like USIBC and our member companies to show the pathway forward on the trade issues on investment. You know, we need a framework," Keshap told PTI in a recent interview. "And FTA (free trade agreement) is something that we absolutely need to have between US and India for the protection and wellbeing of Indian companies and American companies, and the wellbeing of both of our peoples. So we should be ambitious, we should set bold goals," the veteran American diplomat said. The former US foreign service official joined USIBC as its head this month. "I would like to see continued growth on the strategic side. I feel like much good work has been done. In fact, so much so that I felt comfortable moving over to work on trade and economic issues. But there is still scope on the strategic side and we should continue to be close friends and continue our collaboration,” he said. Responding to a question, he noted the recently concluded Trade Policy Forum between the two countries had good outcomes in terms of addressing some of trade issues. "I would love to see more good energy and outcomes from that. I do think it's important for us to start talking about how we frame our standards on digital economy and thereby will have an impact on the framing of global standards on the digital economy," Keshap said. “The pandemic has shown us that we have to be very, very watchful about supply chain issues. There have been a lot of supply chain crunches over the past couple of years. And to the extent that the US and India can work on creating a more seamless supply chain that connects our two economies and weaves in the broader Indo-Pacific, I think that's also very, very important,” he said. "Sky's the limit. Every time I look around at the potential in the relationship, I realise we've really only just begun. Twenty years of solid work and effort have gotten us to this point, and there's plenty of upside,” Keshap said, who has earlier served as the US' charge 'de affairs in New Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-and-us-need-a-free-trade-agreement-usibc-president/articleshow/89124824.cms||---

IMF board members "urged the authorities to narrow the scope of the Bitcoin law by removing bitcoin's legal tender status," the IMF said in a statement following a yearly consultation. Some board members were also concerned about the risks associated with El Salvador's expected issuance of bitcoin-linked bonds, the IMF said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-urged-el-salvador-to-remove-bitcoins-legal-tender-status/articleshow/89124866.cms||---

Companies that use semiconductors are down to less than five days of inventory _ a sharp drop from 40 days in 2019, according to a department survey of 150 companies. The chips used in the production of automobiles and medical devices are especially scarce. Demand for chips, the department said, was up 17% last year from 2019. Citing the results, the Biden administration called on Congress to pass stalled legislation that would provide $52 billion for domestic semiconductor production. "The semiconductor supply chain remains fragile, and it is essential that Congress pass chips funding as soon as possible,'' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. "With sky-rocketing demand and full utilization of existing manufacturing facilities, it's clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities.'' Chip shortages have disrupted auto production and driven up car prices, contributing significantly to a 7% year-over-year increase in consumer prices last month the hottest inflation in four decades. Still, it would take years for semiconductor factories to begin operation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-warns-that-chip-shortage-could-shut-down-factories/articleshow/89124958.cms||---

Also, the regulator has put in place operational guidelines for dematerialisation of securities while processing investor's service request. As an on-going measure to enhance ease of dealing in securities markets by investors, it has been decided that listed companies will henceforth issue the securities in dematerialised form only while processing certain service request, Sebi said in a circular. These request from investors include issue of duplicate securities certificate, claim from unclaimed suspense account, renewal/exchange of securities certificate, endorsement, splitting of securities certificate, consolidation of securities certificates or folios, transmission and transposition. Sebi said that securities holder/claimant will have to submit a form -- to be hosted on the website of the issuer companies and the RTAs (Registrars to an issue and share Transfer Agents) -- as per the format specified by the regulator along with necessary documents. The RTA/issuer companies will have to verify and process the service requests and thereafter issue a 'Letter of Confirmation' in lieu of physical securities certificate(s), to the securities holder or claimant within 30 days of its receipt of such request after removing objections, if any. The 'Letter of Confirmation' will be valid for a period of 120 days from the date of its issuance, within which the securities holder/claimant will have to make a request to the depository participant for dematerialising the said securities. The RTA/issuer companies will have to issue a reminder after the end of 45 days and 90 days from the date of issuance of Letter of Confirmation, informing the securities holder/claimant to submit the demat request, in case no such request has been received by the RTA/issuer company. In case the securities holder/claimant fails to submit the demat request within this period, RTA/issuer companies will have to credit the securities to the suspense escrow demat account of the company. In a notification on Monday, Sebi said that requests for effecting transfer of securities will not be processed unless the securities are held in the dematerialised form with a depository. "Transmission or transposition of securities held in physical or dematerialised form shall be effected only in dematerialised form," the regulator said. The move will improve ease, convenience and safety of transactions for investors. To give this effect Sebi has amended Listing of Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/shares-in-demat-form-must-for-investors-service-requests-sebi/articleshow/89125010.cms||---
---||Business||Bharti Airtel looking to onboard strategic investor through equity allocation: Sources||NEW DELHI: Telecom operator Bharti Airtel is looking to onboard a strategic investor through allocation of preferential equity shares, which is scheduled to be discussed at its board meeting on January 28, according to sources. A source, who did not wish to be named, said the primary goal of the preferential share allocation is not influenced by any sort of liability pressure but is inclined towards onboarding a strategic partner aligned with the long-term business objectives of the company. Jefferies Equity Research, in a report, said Bharti Airtel's announcement to consider an equity issuance on preferential basis has come as a surprise as there is no immediate need for capital, in its view. "An issuance to usher in a strategic investor that boosts its enterprise/digital offerings will be seen positively; however, any large acquisitions will be viewed negatively," the report said. Bharti Airtel has notified the exchanges that its board will on January 28 consider a proposal for issuance of equity capital through a preferential issue. However, it did not specify the quantum of the capital raise or its timing. "The issuance will be to non-promoters implying that promoter stake in the company will get diluted post the potential issue," Jefferies said. Bharti Airtel had in December cleared payments for spectrum that it acquired through auction in 2014. The company paid Rs 15,519 crore to the department of telecom for 128.4 MHz spectrum (including Telenor spectrum) that it acquired for Rs 19,051 crore in 2014. The net debt on the company was about Rs 1.66 lakh crore as on September 30, 2021. Jefferies said the move comes as a surprise because the company recently made spectrum payments, it can call its pending rights issue capital of Rs 15,700 crore at a month's notice, recent tariff hikes will boost its cash flows further and there is no visibility of 5G auctions in the near future. "Given that Bharti's business does not need capital immediately, a preferential equity issuance could be due to a strategic investor entering Bharti Airtel or an acquisition by Bharti Airtel," the report said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharti-airtel-looking-to-onboard-strategic-investor-through-equity-allocation-sources/articleshow/89125101.cms||---
---||Business||Union Budget 2022: Households wrestle with inflation as incomes dip||NEW DELHI: Households are grappling with rising living costs at a time when jobs and incomes have taken a hit amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but economists are not hopeful the government's annual budget due next week will provide much relief. Tea, edible oil, pulses, meat, cooking gas and services have gone up by 20%-40% since the pandemic began in early 2020 - hurting consumers while their incomes have fallen below levels seen before the health crisis. Retail prices have risen nearly 10% in the last two years compared with 8% in the previous five-and-half years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, an analysis of inflation data compiled by the ministry of statistics showed. Government plans to raise import tax on more items to support local manufacturing and increase spending on long-term projects. Economists blame higher taxes, a widening fiscal deficit, Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) easy monetary policy and supply constraints during the pandemic for a sharp rise in prices. The government has offered little aid to households except free food grains for the poor. According to official estimates, average per capita income stands at Rs 93,973 ($1,258) for the current fiscal year ending March, lower than Rs 94,566 before the pandemic. The unemployment rate was at 7.9% in December, with nearly 35 million people looking for work, a report by Mumbai-based think tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said. Meanwhile, the economy is projected to grow 9.2% in 2021/22 after a 7.3% contraction the previous year. The increase in import tariffs on hundreds of goods in the last two years, climbing global crude oil and commodity prices have added to the burden on households. Cooking gas prices rose 43.36% in two years ending December 2021, compared with a 30.68% rise in the previous five-and-half years, data showed. However, domestic electricity and education costs rose at a slower pace reflecting a fall in economic activity and the closure of educational institutions during the pandemic. Inflation is expected to push even higher as manufacturers pass on rising input costs while the central bank delays monetary tightening in efforts to support the economic recovery. Retail inflation accelerated to a five-month high of 5.59% in December from a year earlier, while wholesale price-based inflation, a proxy for producer prices, marginally eased to 13.56%, but remained in double-digits for nine straight months. "The Covid period has been a nightmare for Indian workers," said K R Shyam Sundar, a labour economist at XLRI, Jamshedpur, and the author of "Impact of Covid-19, reforms and governance on labour rights". He added that households suffered job losses, fall in incomes and a sharp rise in prices during the pandemic. "RBI and the government, which have excessively focused on supporting industry and boosting growth, should now take steps to rein in inflation and provide a relief to households."

---||India||India’s Covid cases top 4 crore, third wave tally now over 50 lakh||NEW DELHI: Recorded infections of Covid-19 in India crossed 4 crore on Tuesday, with 50 lakh fresh cases added in the last three weeks alone during the Omicron-driven third wave of the pandemic in the country. India's Covid case count continues to be the second-highest in the world after the US, where nearly 7.3 crore cases have been logged till date. India had reached the 3-crore mark in total cases on June 22, 2021, when the second wave was waning. During that wave, the country saw the fastest rise of 1 crore cases, when the count rose from 2 crore to 3 crore in just 40 days. Meanwhile, daily deaths rose by a steep 27% in a day, with 571 fatalities reported on Tuesday, the highest daily count in five months since Aug 25, 2021, when 603 deaths were recorded. The toll on Monday was 449. In terms of fresh cases, the third-wave surge continued to slow down in the country despite a massive surge in Kerala, which posted its highest-ever daily count of 55,475. Close to 2.87 lakh new cases were reported in the country on Tuesday, up from 2.54 lakh on the preceding day. Last week, daily cases had hit a high of 3.47 lakh on Thursday. Deaths were up sharply in Maharashtra, which reported 86 fatalities on Tuesday, the highest daily toll in 110 days. Of these, Mumbai recorded 10 deaths. Other states grappling with surging deaths on Tuesday included Kerala (70), Karnataka (52), Tamil Nadu (48), Gujarat (28), Chhattisgarh (23), Assam (19), Haryana (18), J&K (14) and Andhra Pradesh (12). These were among 12 states and UTs that reported their highest single-day deaths during the third wave on Tuesday. Daily fatalities remained high in several other states, including Bengal (36), Delhi (31), Punjab (30) and Rajasthan (22). On Tuesday, daily cases saw a big spike in just two states/UTs — Kerala and J&K. While Kerala reported a very high positivity rate of 49.4% (with one out of every two tests giving a positive result for Covid), J&K posted 6,570 new cases, the highest single-day count in the UT since the start of the pandemic. While the next two-three days are likely to reveal whether the third wave will rise any further than last week's high, the count of active cases registered a slight fall for the second day running. The current tally of active remains a little above 22.3 lakh, down 25,000 in the past two days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-covid-cases-top-4-crore-third-wave-tally-now-over-50-lakh/articleshow/89125221.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||---||Ex-Union minister RPN Singh quits Congress, joins BJP||NEW DELHI: Former Union minister and a known face of Congress Kunwar Ratanjit Pratap Narain Singh, popularly known as RPN, quit the party on Tuesday and joined BJP, a development seen as a personal jolt to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Accompanied by Union minister and long-time political associate Jyotiraditya Scindia, Singh joined the party in the presence of Dharmendra Pradhan, who is poll in-charge for BJP in Uttar Pradesh and has been working towards consolidating the party’s dominance over the OBC vote-bank, a factor seen as crucial in its performance in 2014, 2019 Lok Sabha polls and 2017 assembly polls in the state. BJP sources said new entrant Singh would be utilised as a rigorous campaigner in OBC-dominated eastern region adjoining his native place in Kushinagar-Padrauna in eastern UP. He had earlier represented the Padrauna assembly constituency and defeated Swami Prasad Maurya from Kushinagar in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. Chosen to be one of the 30 “star campaigners” for Congress in UP only on Monday, Singh is the third former Union minister after Scindia and Jitin Prasada to quit Congress and join BJP. Soon after sending his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and shortly before joining BJP, RPN Singh in a tweet said: “This is a new beginning for me and I look forward to my contribution to nation-building under the visionary leadership and guidance of the honourable Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi, BJP president Shri @JPNadda ji & honourable Home Minister @AmitShah ji.” This is a new beginning for me and I look forward to my contribution to nation building under the visionary leaders… https://t.co/vrzGekialw— RPN Singh (@SinghRPN) 1643100424000While joining the party, Singh said he had worked for Congress for 32 years with honesty, dedication and full commitment but neither the party nor its ideology is the same, which it used to be when he had joined it. “For several years, my supporters were suggesting to join BJP… but better late than never, and I have joined the party and will contribute in nation-building which is possible only under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Singh said. He said assembly polls are happening in five states but his native state Uttar Pradesh is the heart of the country, where the double-engine government of Yogi Adityanath and PM Modi at the Centre have introduced several schemes, which was never done earlier. “I have been politically active in UP and I can say that the law and order situation has immensely improved under Yogi Adityanath,” Singh said and added that he would accept whatever responsibility is given to him in his new party. Singh was also the in-charge of Congress affairs in Jharkhand where the party is in power along with JMM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/ex-union-minister-rpn-singh-quits-congress-joins-bjp/articleshow/89125299.cms||---

---||World||Pfizer begins trial of Omicron-specific shots in adults, Fauci says may not be needed||NEW DELHI: As Pfizer announced trials for a reformulated Covid-19 vaccine, meant specifically for the hugely contagious Omicron variant, on Tuesday, top US infectious disease official Dr Anthony Fauci said that such a shot would be "prudent" even if it ultimately may not be needed. "It makes sense to think in terms of at least having ready an Omicron-specific boost. However, we may not need it... but I think it's prudent to at least prepare for the possibility that this may be a persistent variant that we may have to face, even if it's at a very low level," Dr Fauci, President Joe Biden's top medical adviser and a member of the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told MSNBC. Earlier in the day, Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech SE said they have started clinical trials for a version of their vaccine targeting the highly-transmissible variant that has eluded their current two-dose protection and led to breakthrough infections. Pfizer said it has started enrolling healthy adults to test the reformulated Covid-19 vaccine to see how it compares with the original shots. While many nations are grappling with high Omicron infections, Fauci said eventually enough community immunity will hopefully build up to prevent massive surges like the previous waves driven by the other variants so far. "I don't think we're going to be seeing that indefinitely," he said, adding that Covid was unlikely to be eradicated. Omicron is more likely than previous variants to cause infection even in people who've been vaccinated. Among the issues, regulators are weighing, is that some of the first places to face an Omicron surge already are seeing the mutant wane — and there's no way to know if the next variant that arises will resemble it or be totally different. Besides, the original vaccines are still offering good protection against severe illness and death. Studies in the United States and elsewhere have made clear that adding a booster dose strengthens that protection and improves the chances of avoiding even a milder infection. “We recognise the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,” Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer's vaccine research chief, said in a statement. The new US study will include up to 1,420 volunteers ages 18 to 55 to test the updated shots for use as a booster or for primary vaccinations. Researchers will examine the tweaked vaccine's safety and how it revs up the immune system in comparison to the original shots. Full study results will take many months as volunteers receive multiple vaccine doses — and as researchers measure how long virus-fighting antibodies remain at high levels after an Omicron-adapted dose versus the regular booster. For the new study, one group of about 600 volunteers who received two doses of the current Pfizer vaccine three to six months ago will receive either one or two Omicron-based shots as boosters. Another 600 who have already gotten three regular doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be given a fourth dose of either the regular vaccine or the Omicron-matched version. The study also will enrol some unvaccinated volunteers who will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. Pfizer's CEO told CNBC earlier this month that the company could have some Omicron-matched doses ready as early as March. But doing what the company calls “at-risk” manufacturing doesn't mean those doses will be rolled out to the public. Pfizer and other vaccine-makers also have brewed and tested experimental doses to match previous variants, changes that ultimately weren't needed but offered valuable practice at tweaking the recipe. Pfizer plans to produce 4 billion vaccine doses in 2022, and said Tuesday the amount isn't expected to change if an Omicron version is needed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pfizer-begins-trial-of-omicron-specific-shots-in-adults-fauci-says-may-not-be-needed/articleshow/89122997.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheswari and C T Ravikumar turned down the plea for interim relief after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the apex court that the NGOs were at fault themselves for not applying for renewal of the licences. He submitted that the government extended FCRA licences for 11,594 NGOs, which had applied for renewal, till their applications were decided and the same relief could not be given to those which failed to apply. Taking note of the Centre’s submission, the court said the aggrieved NGOs can make representation to the Centre, which will take the decision as per law. The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by US-based NGO Global Peace Initiative, which has been founded by an Indian and works closely with many NGOs, including the Missionaries of Charity. The NGO, founded by Kilari Anand, pleaded to the apex court that NGOs played a very crucial and important role in reaching out to people and helped the country during the Covid-19 pandemic, which had been duly acknowledged by the government and the Prime Minister’s Office itself. Cancellation of licences of close to 6,000 NGOs at this juncture would hamper relief efforts and lead to denial of aid to citizens in need, it said. “The work done by these NGOs helped millions of Indians. The sudden and arbitrary cancellation of FCRA registration of thousands of these NGOs violates the rights of the organisations, their workers as well as the millions of Indians who they serve. This is especially relevant at a time when the country is facing the third wave of the Covid-19 virus,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fcra-licence-supreme-court-denies-relief-to-ngos-that-failed-to-apply/articleshow/89125349.cms||---

Much of the footage shown at the trial of former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao was from police body cameras and street surveillance video that also was played extensively in the state criminal trial that eventually convicted Chauvin of murder last year. It shows Floyd struggling with officers as they try to put him in a police vehicle, him being held on the ground and later put into an ambulance, and a growing group of onlookers who become increasingly frantic as Floyd stops moving.  Police had responded to a 911 call that Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy a pack of cigarettes at a corner store on May 25, 2020. His killing triggered worldwide protests and a reexamination of racism and policing.  Floyd died after Chauvin knelt on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man was facedown, handcuffed and gasping for air. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back, Lane held his legs and Thao kept bystanders back.  Kueng, Lane and Thao are broadly charged with depriving Floyd of his civil rights while acting under government authority. Chauvin pleaded guilty in November to a federal civil rights charges.  One video that prosecutors played for jurors Tuesday was from Thao's body camera, which showed him pushing an onlooker. The video was shown during the testimony of the cashier who had taken the counterfeit bill. Christopher Martin, 20 - who also testified at Chauvin's trial - said he had recorded about 30 seconds of video as bystanders were yelling at Thao to check Floyd's pulse, but stopped when Thao pushed the other man.  He said he didn't have a good view of Kueng or Lane.  Earlier, as prosecutors played other video of Floyd's arrest, at least one juror appeared to be dabbing her eyes. Courteney Ross, Floyd's girlfriend, was in the courtroom and also dabbed her eyes at times.  During opening statements Monday, prosecutor Samantha Trepel, who works for the Justice Department's civil rights division, said that the videos will show the three officers stood by as Chauvin "slowly killed George Floyd right in front of them" and told jurors that prosecutors "will ask you to hold these men accountable".  But it was Chauvin, the senior officer at the scene, who called "all of the shots," Tom Plunkett, Kueng's attorney, said, adding that the Minneapolis Police Department did too little to train officers to intervene when a colleague should be stopped.  Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, focused on Floyd's struggle with police before they restrained him. And an attorney for Lane, Earl Gray, said his client raised concerns about the restraint of Floyd, but was rebuffed.  Kueng, who is Black; Lane, who is white; and Thao, who is Hmong American, are all charged for failing to provide Floyd with medical care. Thao and Kueng face an additional count for failing to stop Chauvin, who is white. Both counts allege the officers' actions resulted in Floyd's death.  Attorneys for both Kueng and Thao noted that prosecutors must prove the officers willfully violated Floyd's constitutional rights - a high legal standard that essentially requires prosecutors to prove the officers knew what they were doing was wrong, but did it anyway.  Gray told jurors that Lane will testify, but it's not known if Thao or Kueng will. It's also not clear whether Chauvin will testify, though many experts who spoke to The Associated Press believe he won't.  U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson has said the trial could last four weeks.  Lane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate state trial in June on charges they aided and abetted both murder and manslaughter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-federal-trial-of-3-ex-police-officers-prosecutors-show-video-of-george-floyds-last-moments/articleshow/89125369.cms||---

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said that it was “troubling” that the Bar Council of India, which is the top body regulating law education and the profession, has virtually failed in its duty and said that it is high time the regulating body “introspect” and “pull up the socks”. “Problems start with law schools. It is mushrooming. In Tamil Nadu itself there are over 110 law schools. Where are the law teachers? More or less they are fictitious... Antisocial elements get admission in colleges. In Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, law courses are taking place in cowsheds. You have to make introspections,” the bench said. Times ViewWeeding out crooked elements at the entry point would certainly elevate the quality of the profession and help create a better judicial system. The Supreme Court has taken a much-needed step which must be lauded.It said that there are many law colleges running in the country which give admission after being paid a hefty amount and where the students do not attend classes. “This is completely diluting the quality… A person without attending classes gets a law degree… More stringent checks on law schools and more serious criteria for entry in the profession are needed,” the bench said. The bench also pointed out the fault with the examination conducted by the BCI for allowing law graduates to practice and said that unlike other entrance exams there is no negative marking for wrong answers in Bar exams and that the Council should also introduce negative marking. The court said that the BCI could learn from The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India on how to maintain quality checks at the entry-level to ensure that people possessing proper understanding of law are allowed to enter the profession. The court was hearing an appeal filed by the BCI challenging an order of Gujarat high court clearing the path for other professionals having LLB degree to be enrolled with the Bar Council for provisional licence to practice law and to have eligibility to appear in the All India Bar’s test to qualify to become a lawyer without giving up their current profession before applying for enrolment. Senior advocate K V Viswanathan, who was appointed by the court as amicus curiae to assist it in the matter, said that a mechanism could be worked out to allow people coming from other employment in the profession but some regulation has to be put in place.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/antisocial-elements-getting-degrees-supreme-court-bats-for-quality-control-of-law-education/articleshow/89125380.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

This is where the aluminium sector will play a greater than ever before role. Extensive growth in electric vehicles, renewables, modern infrastructure, energy efficient consumer goods and greater dependence on strategic sectors such as aerospace and defence, will drive Aluminium consumption to grow at CAGR of 10 per cent or more. For example, Aluminium usage in EV battery is 40-50 per cent more than a normal ICE. Being 3 times lighter than steel it aids in fuel efficiency making it an efficient choice for EVs. However, the Indian aluminium industry is struggling to revive itself over the last two years following the unprecedented Covid pandemic. The declining domestic producers market share with surging imports coupled with significant cost escalation for primary producers due to a rise in input costs of critical raw materials, escalating ocean freights; logistics costs due to container shortage, current coal crunch situation etc, is restricting the industry's ability to support the future of the country at a time when India cannot rely on import sources alone to fuel this growth. To give relief to the sector, there is a need for urgently looking at the duty structure. The basic custom duty on Aluminium and Aluminium scrap is not in line with other non-ferrous metals like Zink, lead, nickel and tin which is a huge disadvantage for domestic aluminium producers. The industry expects increase in tariff rate of basic custom duty or peak custom duty rate from existing 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Currently custom duty on Primary Aluminium is 7.5 per cent, Downstream Aluminium is 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent and Aluminium scrap is only 2.5 per cent. This is the reason why despite having significant presence of primary Aluminium capacity and potential to generate sufficient domestic scrap, India's consumption of scrap is 100 per cent import dependent. The way forward is to increase custom duty on Aluminium srap from 2.5 to 10 per cent. Primary aluminium industry is facing severe threat from the increasing import of Aluminium scrap. The share of scrap in total imports increased from 52 per cent in FY-16 to 66 per cent in FY-21. resulting in Forex Outgo of $2 billion (Rs 15,000 crore). What is also affecting the Indian industry is China's renewed measures to restrict Scrap imports through National Sword Policy, which is leading to greater inflow of scrap into India. China imposed 25 per cent duty on Aluminium Scrap imports from USA, and classified Aluminium Scrap in restricted import list from July, 2019, with plan to completely ban all scrap and waste imports. Post that the share of import from the US in China's total Aluminium scrap imports has declined from 53 per cent in 2017 to just 16 per cent in 2019. India has overtaken China as world's largest aluminium scrap importer due to Chinese measures. As a result, entire global scrap chain is shifted to India in absence of any quality or BIS standards for scrap recycling/ usage and imports in the country. A major threat is from US scrap imports, as US is diverting large volume of scrap to India, since EU and other developed countries have stringent standards for scrap. The import from US as share of India's total scrap imports increased from 8 per cent in FY16 to 24 per cent in FY21. This precarious situation can be resolved by safeguarding the domestic industry against these non-essential imports in the upcoming union budget.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2022-increase-in-custom-duty-on-aluminium-scrap-from-2-5-to-10/articleshow/89125403.cms||---

By paying MNREGS workers well under minimum wages, the government saved nearly Rs 42,000 crore in just the last two years, a period in which the poor faced severe economic distress due to Covid-induced disruptions. The minimum wage ranges from Rs 441 in Karnataka to just Rs 201 in Uttar Pradesh. In almost no state were MNREGS workers paid the minimum wage, though it is supposed to be the barest minimum required for subsistence-level existence. The minimum wage fixation (itself disputed by experts) is done by considering the most basic nutritional intake for human survival. Time and again, the Supreme Court through several judgments has also elevated the right to minimum wages from a statutory status to constitutional status. The SC has also ruled that wages less than minimum wage amount to “forced labour”. Work under MNREGS is hard manual labour used for building rural infrastructure such as water conservation structures, roads, houses under PM Awas Yojana and land development. In effect, all of this is being subsidised by the poorest through their underpaid labour. TOI looked at data on person days of work generated under the scheme and calculated what the wage bill would have been at minimum wages. We then compared this to the wages actually paid to see how much was saved. We used the minimum wage for agricultural labour, typically the lowest of the minimum wages in each state, and where that was not available, the closest proxy. The highest savings were in states which provided more person days of employment and had the highest minimum wages, while in those which provided hardly any work under MNREGS or have very low minimum wages, there was little or no saving. Thus, in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have among the highest minimum wages, the government saved the highest amounts of Rs 3,038 crore and Rs 2,115 crore in April-December 2021. Rajasthan and West Bengal have much lower minimum wages but generated more person days under the scheme and thus the savings in them was over Rs 2,000 crore each. Uttar Pradesh was the only state where the actual labour bill under MNREGS was higher, though only slightly, than the calculations at minimum wages. But then, UP has the lowest minimum wage rate for agricultural labour and has not revised them for the past two years. Prof Ravi S Srivastava, director of the Centre for Employment Studies at the Institute for Human Development, pointed out that the total cost of providing appropriate wages would not be much, but the government has resisted an increase in MNREGS wages despite two of its own committees recommending it. “No justification has been provided for MNREGS wages not corresponding to legal minimum wages, but this has been a long standing practice. MNREGS is a very productive programme that creates basic rural infrastructure. In a crisis it makes sense to invest in short gestation period infrastructure which will be more labour intensive and can increase earning of workers. Studies going back 20 years have shown that this has a cascading effect on the economy by increasing demand. The notion that MNREGS is just a social scheme or that expenditure on the poor is relief expenditure is wrong. You are paying the poor to do very hard work and in the process creating rural assets/infrastructure,” he said. Government notifies revised MNREGS wages with effect from April 1 of every financial year after adjusting for changes in prices. According to a paper co-authored by Dr Anoop Satpathy, fellow at the V V Giri National Labour Institute, in 2006-07, the first year of implementation of the scheme, MNREGS wages were linked with the minimum wages notified by the state governments and varied from Rs 50 in Gujarat to Rs 125 in Kerala. In 2007-08, 10 states revised minimum wages and demanded more funds from the central government, which foots the entire labour bill for the scheme. The paper argues that this upward revision was not unreasonable as the Minimum Wage Act of 1948 empowers states to revise minimum wages according to price indices. The wage revision created apprehension that the scheme might become financially unsustainable in the long-run and the Congress government, which had promised 100 days of employment per year at Rs 100 per day under MNREGS, delinked wages in the scheme from minimum wages. It is another matter that the average number of days of employment actually ranges between 44 to 52 days over the last five years. Even the fixation at Rs 100 was done arbitrarily as in states where minimum wages were lower, the MNREGS rate was hiked to Rs 100 while for states like Goa, Haryana, Kerala and Mizoram, where minimum wages were above Rs 100, these were protected and wages notified under MNREGS were also higher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mnregs-workers-subsidised-creation-of-infra-assets-by-rs-20000-crore-a-year/articleshow/89125423.cms||Atul Thakur

It also demanded input tax credits for the industry, incentivise institutions for traceability in the food supply system; subsidy for testing in the food sector, funds for setting up food and beverage tech machinery manufacturing plants; and interest subvention scheme for MSMEs. "Looking at the great potential which the agri and food sector holds for the economy, this sector needs further thrust and renewed focus. The agri and food sector has shown a resilient growth of more than 20 per cent sustainably despite tough times," V K Gauba, additional director general TPCI said in a statement. The agri and food exports may touch $40 billion mark this fiscal, he added. He said that extending capital support for setting up CODEX standard-based R&D labs in the country will help the sector. Set up in 1963, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is an intergovernmental body established jointly by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), within the framework of the Joint Food Standards Programme to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the food trade.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tpci-seeks-support-measures-in-budget-to-promote-food-beverage-industry/articleshow/89125438.cms||---

In its budget wish list, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) also said more money needs to be put in the hands of the poor and the salaried as two years of the pandemic have impacted many in the poorer section of the population. "ECLGS for finance in retail needs to be announced as most of the lockdowns impact high contact sectors like restaurants, shops, salons, etc," RAI chief executive officer Kumar Rajagopalan said in a statement. While the retail sector recently got included in priority lending guidelines under MSME, he said, "It is important for the sector to get all support that MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) policies accord as more than 90 per cent of retail can be classified and MSME." Calling for support to retail with policy around digitisation, Rajagopalan said retailers need to get themselves digitised faster and need to get e-commerce ready. "Financial support for digitisation can help better boost the sector. Also, a directional focus to enable retailers through the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) will give a big boost to the sector," he added. Seeking a better direction for the implementation of goods and services tax (GST), RAI said any increase in GST on clothing, food and housing creates a direct impact on consumption. "A direction for a more predictable GST regime will be welcome. Similarly, many clauses around carry forward and refund of GST needs clarification," Rajagopalan said, adding that directional support to the creation of a nation-level policy for retail and internal trade will help. Asking for more money in the hands of the poor and the salaried, RAI said the two years of the coronavirus pandemic have impacted many in the poorer section of the population. "Many were without jobs thanks to reverse migration and lockdowns. Any scheme that helps increase the spending power of the poor will be welcome," Rajagopalan said. Similarly, the salaried class of the population also needs to get more money in their hands to help them consume with confidence. "Rising inflation is a worry, and this can be faced better only with more money in the hands of the consuming class," he said. RAI also called for better infrastructure spending as all transport infrastructure work helps create new jobs as well help create better logistical connectivity for movement of goods and people, while any expenditure on new sources of energy helps retail access electricity at better prices.

Addressing the nation on the eve of the 73rd Republic Day, he said India showed an “unmatched resolve” when faced by the pandemic. “The pandemic management was bound to be all the more difficult in India. We have a high population density, and as a developing economy, we didn’t have the level of resources needed to battle this enemy. But it is only in such difficult times that the resilience of a nation shines forth. I’m proud to say that we have shown an unmatched resolve against Covid. The vaccination drive is progressing at a quick pace in our country. During the pandemic, we have reached out to several other countries with vaccines and other medical help,” the President said. Kovind also said with the virus mutating and the pandemic still spreading, people must remain alert and not let their guard, and masks, down. He emphasised that in the fight against Covid, it has now become a sacred national duty of every citizen to follow the precautions suggested by scientists. Lauding the leadership, policy-makers and administrators at the Centre and in states for making timely interventions to maintain supply chains and utilities, Kovind said it is due to such interventions that the economy is on the move again. “It is a testimony to India’s spirit in the face of adversity that the economy is projected to grow at an impressive rate in this fiscal, after going through contraction last year. This shows the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan launched in the previous year….The impressive economic performance is made possible due to improvement in agriculture and manufacturing sectors,” he said, congratulating Indians for their spirit of enterprise and for India to have been included among top 50 innovative economies. He also referred to the National Education Policy and said the policy creates “makes a perfect blend of traditional values and modern skills” and created the right environment to “reap the demographic dividend”. In his address, the President also paid tributes to General Bipin Rawat, and lauded all soldiers and security personnel who carry on the legacy of national pride. He said this marks a “watershed year for women empowerment in the armed forces”, with women breaking the glass ceiling, and a permanent commission now being allowed for women officers in new areas. Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, the President said that he would have liked us to celebrate Republic Day by striving to become better human beings and contributing towards the making of a better India and a better world. Congratulating India on its 75th year of independence, he said the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ is a great opportunity not only for the next generation but for everyone to reconnect with the past. “For us, nation-building is a constant endeavour. When we won independence, the exploitation of colonial rule had left us in poverty, but in 75 years, we’ve made impressive progress. New opportunities await the next generation,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-showed-unmatched-resolve-in-covid-war-president-kovind/articleshow/89125505.cms||---

Agreeing for detailed examination of a PIL filed by advocate-petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay on the issue of freebies and their deleterious impact on state exchequers as well as fairness of elections, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli termed the issue serious and asked the Centre and the EC to file their response affidavits within four weeks. The CJI asked, “How to control this (alleged irrational announcement of freebies and doles)? It is a serious issue, there is no doubt about it. Freebies are going beyond the budgets. And as the SC had pointed out in its 2013 judgment, it disturbs the level playing field. The court had acknowledged that a candidate of a political party, which announces a large number of freebies and doles, gets a winning edge in the elections, even though it is not a corrupt practice under the Representation of People Act.” “Within the limited scope, it appears that the court had directed the EC to frame guidelines. The EC had met political parties for this purpose. But we do not know what is the status of the exercise undertaken by the EC on this issue,” the bench said. Though it felt that before passing any orders it would have to hear all political parties, the bench said, “for the time being we will issue notice and let the Centre and the EC come back with responses within four weeks”. Appearing for Upadhyay, senior advocate Vikas Singh said most of the states are neck-deep in debt and political parties competing with each other in promising freebies and doles would completely destroy the finances of the next government, whichever party forms it after the elections. He gave a tabular chart of the debt burden on the five states — Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur — which are going to the polls in February and March. Citing newspaper reports, he said UP has a public debt of Rs 6.1 lakh crore, Punjab 2.8 lakh crore, Uttarakhand Rs 68,000 crore and Goa Rs 18,844 crore. The petitioner did not give the data about Manipur. Singh said there has to be some repercussion provided in the Symbols Order or registration of political parties for announcing freebies irresponsibly. But the SC said that it would be only after the elections are over. Singh said even if such punitive action is taken by EC after the elections, it would have a salutary effect on political parties for the next election. The SC in its judgment in the case ‘S Subramaniam Balaji vs Tamil Nadu’ on July 5, 2013 had said, “We arrived at a conclusion that the promises in the election manifesto cannot be read into Section 123 (of RP Act) for declaring it to be a corrupt practice.

The Army currently has 93 modernization projects in progress at various stages in the procurement process, with a total value of Rs 1.37 lakh crore ($18.4 billion), as per the latest figures. With the overall thrust also being on indigenization, General M M Naravane recently said 19 of the 20 new “acceptance of necessities (AoNs)” approved for the Army by the defence ministry in the current financial year are in the “Buy Indian” category. The Army has inked 121 capital procurement contracts worth Rs 93,463 crore over the last three-four years. The standoff with China, of course, propelled the entire modernization process on an upward trajectory. Under emergency powers, for instance, 71 capital procurement contracts (worth Rs 6,918 crore) and 113 revenue procurement deals (Rs 9,000 crore) have been inked since June 2020, said sources. “The aim was to make up for operational deficiencies, even as the re-balancing of additional forces to the northern borders and infrastructure upgrade was fast-tracked to counter the China threat,” said a source. The plans underway include a major induction of high-volume firepower, with a mix of artillery guns, enhanced Pinaka rocket regiments, longer-range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as loiter munition systems, runway-independent remotely piloted aircraft systems, and enhanced surveillance and weapon-locating capabilities, said sources. Towards this end, the Army plans to order another 200 K-9 `Vajra’ self-propelled tracked artillery guns after inducting 100 of them under a Rs 4,366 joint project of L&T and South Korean Hanwha Defence. With a strike range of 28-38 km, the Army has deployed some of these 155mm/52-caliber guns in Ladakh, as was reported by TOI earlier. Around 110 of the 145 M-777 ultra-light howitzers ordered from the US for over Rs 5,000 crore have already been inducted, with the rest to follow over the next five months. The Army has also equipped two regiments with the `Sharang’ artillery systems, which is the upgraded version of the old Soviet-origin 130mm guns, with a third on the way. Progress, however, is slow in trials of the indigenous 155mm/52 caliber advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS), which the DRDO contends is the best in its class in the world with a 48-km strike range. The Army needs as many as 1,580 such guns. Another focus area for the Army is “future-ready mechanized platforms”, with advanced weapons, enhanced night-fighting and cross-country capabilities from deserts to mountainous terrains. Two “Make in India” projects are envisaged for this. One for 1,750 futuristic infantry combat vehicles (FICVs) and the other for 1,770 advanced main-battle tanks or future ready combat vehicles (FRCVs).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-cranking-up-modernisation-drive/articleshow/89125603.cms||Rajat Pandit

The draft of the Kerala Lokayukta (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, has been sent to governor Arif Mohammed Khan for his assent. The ordinance proposes amendments to the Kerala Lokayukta Act, 1999, by replacing sub-section (1) of section 14. This particular section empowers the Lokayukta or an Upa Lokayukta to make a declaration in its report that a public servant against whom a complaint is made should not continue to hold that post if the allegation is substantiated. “Where the competent authority is the governor, the government of Kerala or the CM, he or it shall accept the declaration,” it states. It is this portion of the law, which makes a verdict binding on the government, that is about to be amended. The proposed amendment says, “Where the competent authority is the governor, or the chief minister or the government of Kerala, he or it may either accept, or reject the declaration, after giving an opportunity of being heard.” With CM Vijayan in the US for medical treatment, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan took it upon himself to explain the government’s rationale for bringing the amendment, saying it was aimed at curbing the “unbridled” powers contained in the legislation, the only one of its kind in the country without any provision for appeal against a verdict. The opposition raised questions about the amendment coming at a time when complaints were pending with the Lokayukta against the CM over utilisation of the distress relief fund. Higher education minister R Bindu, too, is facing a case pertaining to the re-appointment of Kannur University’s vice-chancellor. Leader of the opposition V D Satheesan has written to the governor, urging him not to give his assent to the ordinance. The ordinance was reportedly approved during the last cabinet meeting. Two high court verdicts had noted that the Lokayukta had only recommendatory jurisdiction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-all-set-to-clip-lokayuktas-powers/articleshow/89125642.cms||---

---||Business||Budget 2022 must focus on near-term income support measures, delay fiscal correction: Report||MUMBAI: Noting that household consumption, which forms as much as 55 per cent of the GDP, has contracted by 10.1 per cent in FY21, a report has called for some radical measures in the forthcoming budget to undo the damages by adopting a loose fiscal policy and focusing on near-term income and job-generating measures. Citing the latest National Statistical Office's estimate on GDP for this fiscal, a report by Crisil on Tuesday said household consumption is lagging fiscal 2020 levels by three percentage points this fiscal, making it the worst performer among the expenditure-side components of the GDP since the pandemic. Stating that the consumption cycle badly needs a lift in the Budget, the report noted that private consumption was slowing even before the pandemic. On a per-capita basis, consumption growth slipped from 6.8 per cent in fiscal 2017 to 4.4 per cent in fiscal 2020 and in the financial year 2020-21, it contracted sharply by 10.1 per cent. Beyond that, the catch-up has been slower than for other demand components of the gross domestic product (GDP). By the end of this financial year, it would not even have sighted fiscal 2019 levels, Crisil chief economist D K Joshi said in a report. Joshi called upon the government to ensure the budget announces some key measures to arrest the fall by making provisions for job creation and income-supporting measures. The government can create an additional Rs 35 lakh crore fiscal space over fiscals 2022-26 by postponing the fiscal deficit milestone of three per cent, said the report. It added that even a fall in nominal GDP growth from 17.6 per cent in the financial year 2021-22 to 12-13 per cent in the financial year 2022-23, can support a wider government balance sheet, given rising tax collection. This, together with a gradual path of deficit reduction, can provide room for higher spending to support rural and urban employment generation, which will in the near term support consumption and fund capex (capital expenditure) over the next four financial years, according to the report. Specifically, the report said the Budget should announce measures to generate jobs that create assets till growth becomes broad-based and demand conditions show sustained improvement. Riled by inflation and lower budgetary support to the rural employment scheme in fiscal 2022, wage growth has slowed in farm and non-farm sectors. According to data from the Reserve Bank of India, farm wage growth in nominal terms slowed to 5.7 per cent in the financial year 2021-22 from an average of 6.6 per cent in the financial year 2020-21, while non-farm wage growth just halved to 3.2 per cent. Discounting for high inflation, non-farm wages in real terms have been negative. Noting that consumer sentiment is weakening due to a lower savings cushion, the report said household financial savings averaged 13 per cent of GDP for nearly a decade to fiscal 2015. But, this slipped to 11 per cent in the financial year 2019-20, as income growth slowed and households dipped into their savings. As the pandemic hit, it shot up to 21 per cent of GDP in the June 2020 quarter, due to a forced reduction in consumption but savings dropped to a low 8.2 per cent in the December 2020 quarter, due to job losses and lower earnings over the recurrent pandemic waves, coupled with medical expenditure during the pandemic. Further complicating the matter is higher inflation, which has eroded purchasing power across essential inflation categories -- food, fuel, rent, clothing and health. For the three years through this fiscal, it was on an average 180 basis points (bps) higher than for the previous three years. In contrast, inflation in the discretionary categories was only 30 bps higher. This has led to higher income inequalities. Support to rural employment schemes fell, impacting consumption in rural areas. For the financial year 2020-21, the government announced a higher allocation under the national rural job guarantee scheme, providing succour to rural workers. But, that was short-lived. In the budget 2022, these allocations were downsized as Covid-19 cases came down and data suggests that in the absence of employment opportunities in urban areas, demand for rural works stayed high even this fiscal, a large part of which remained unmet. The fact is that the rural jobs scheme remains the only lifeline for the vast section of the landless, informal sector and migrant workers, who have borne the brunt of the pandemic and lack of employment opportunities in urban areas. A higher allocation for this must be prioritised this fiscal. There is also merit in introducing similar employment generation schemes in urban areas, given how swathes of workers in urban construction and contact-based services remain un/underemployed, even if lockdowns have become less restrictive. And, the time is ripe for a national urban employment guarantee scheme, repeatedly put forth by experts as well as the Parliamentary standing committee on labour in its August 2021 report. Such spending could be frontloaded towards the first half of the next fiscal. But, this does not mean a steroidal lift is advocated. Any support measures will have to be designed carefully after weighing their impact on consumer price inflation. And, the fiscal policy can help control inflation by bringing down excise duty on fuel which will simultaneously trim input cost burden.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2022-must-focus-on-near-term-income-support-measures-delay-fiscal-correction-report/articleshow/89125743.cms||---

Not only this, Chopra is also among this year’s Padma Shri awardees, in what could be a first such instance. Subedar Chopra, only the second-ever individual gold medallist in India’s Olympic history, stands out in the list of the 29 who have been conferred the PVSM, which is awarded for distinguished services of the “most exceptional order”, in the Republic Day awards this year. The others include 17 Lt Generals, one Major General, three Vice Admirals and seven Air Marshals. The prominent ones are Eastern Command chief Lt Gen Manoj Pande (the new Army vice-chief from next month), Northern Command chief Lt Gen Y K Joshi, Western Naval Command chief Vice-Admiral A B Singh, Navy vice-chief Vice-Admiral Satish Ghormade and IAF vice-chief Air Marshal Sandeep Singh. Chopra, who enrolled in the 4 Rajputana Rifles as a direct-entry Naib Subedar in May 2016, was given an out-of-turn promotion to the rank of Subedar in 2018 after he won gold at the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. He was also conferred with the Arjuna Award that year.

---||World||RFK Jr remarks on Anne Frank 'deeply offensive': Jewish groups||Anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr made "deeply offensive" comments when he suggested things are worse for people today than they were for Anne Frank, the teenager who died in a Nazi concentration camp after hiding with her family in a secret annex in an Amsterdam house for two years, several Jewish advocacy and Holocaust remembrance groups said Monday.  "Making reckless comparisons to the Holocaust, the murder of six million Jews, for a political agenda is outrageous and deeply offensive. Those who carelessly invoke Anne Frank, the star badge, and the Nuremberg Trials exploit history and the consequences of hate," the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum said Monday in a statement posted to Twitter.  A spokesman said the museum made the statement in response to Kennedy's speech and other recent incidents of people invoking the Holocaust for political purposes. The museum also pointed out that Anne Frank was one of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust.  Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote on Twitter that Kennedy invoking Anne Frank's memory and the mass murder of Jews by the Nazis to make a comparison with the U.S. government "working to ensure the health of its citizens is deeply inaccurate, deeply offensive and deeply troubling. This must stop."  Among the others condemning the comment were Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, in Jerusalem, which said it "denigrates the memory of its victims and survivors."  During a Sunday rally in Washington organized by his anti-vaccine nonprofit group Children's Health Defense, Kennedy complained that people's rights were being violated by public health measures that had been taken to reduce the number of people sickened and killed by COVID-19. He said the nation's leading infectious disease doctor, Anthony Fauci, was orchestrating "fascism."  "Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did," said Kennedy, a nephew of former president John F. Kennedy and the son of his slain brother, former U.S. attorney general, civil rights activist and Democratic presidential contender Robert F. Kennedy.  Kennedy Jr went on to say that today, "the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run and none of us can hide," and complained about 5G, the newest generation of wireless communication networks, and about vaccine passports.  An investigation published last month detailed how Kennedy has invoked the specter of Nazis and the Holocaust in his work to sow doubts about vaccines and agitate against public health efforts to bring the pandemic under control, such as requiring masks or vaccine mandates.  In a speech to the Ron Paul Institute in October, for example, Kennedy referenced Nazis multiple times, obliquely comparing public health measures put in place by governments around the world to Nazi propaganda meant to scare people into abandoning critical thinking. Last month, he put out a video that showed a picture of Fauci with a Hitler mustache.  In an email sent by a spokeswoman on Monday, Kennedy described his statement as "a factual observation that technology has given an arsenal of frightening instrumentalities to totalitarian elements."  "I referred to Anne Frank's terrible two year ordeal only by way of showing that modern surveillance capacity would make her courageous feat virtually impossible today," he said.  Kennedy said he "compared no one to the Nazis or Adolf Hitler," but did not immediately address other instances when he has invoked Nazis and Hitler to make a political point.  Kennedy apologized in 2015, after he used the word "holocaust" to describe children whom he believes were hurt by vaccines. He said at the time that he "employed the term during an impromptu speech."  That he has continued to use such comparisons indicates, "he means it," said Dr. David Gorski, a cancer surgeon at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit and a critic of the anti-vaccine movement who has tracked Kennedy's rhetoric for over 15 years. Gorski said Kennedy has been making Nazi and Holocaust references in relation to vaccines since at least 2013.  In the past few years, Gorski said, Kennedy has been more open about using such language, which he said may indicate Kennedy senses it resonates with the new fan base he has built up during the pandemic, or that the consequences of using such language aren't "unacceptably negative."  The AP investigation documented how Kennedy had grown his group during the pandemic, expanding his audience and pulling in millions of dollars in new funding.  Gorski said the language demonstrates one of the ways Kennedy likes to connect with his audience: buttering them up by portraying them as going against the flow and smarter than everyone else.  "If vaccine mandates are totalitarian like Nazis and the Soviet Union and that sort of thing, what does that make the anti-vaxxers? They're brave freedom fighters," Gorski said. "There's flattery in those analogies."  Aryeh Tuchman of the ADL's Center on Extremism said Kennedy's repeated comments invoking the Holocaust were shocking. Such rhetoric ratchets up tensions and leads to the demonization of people who disagree, whipping up anger and rage, Tuchman said, adding that the repeated comments showed Kennedy had a callous disregard for the feelings of Jewish people.  "These analogies are historically specious and hurtful to Jews and, frankly, to anyone who has a historical memory of who the Nazis were and what they did," Tuchman said. "Anything in the pursuit of his agenda."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rfk-jr-remarks-on-anne-frank-deeply-offensive-jewish-groups/articleshow/89125875.cms||---
---||World||Biden administration officially withdraws vaccine rule for big businesses||The Biden administration has officially withdrawn a rule that would have required workers at big companies to get vaccinated or face regular Covid testing requirements.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed the withdrawal Tuesday. But the agency said it still strongly encourages workers to get vaccinated.  In early November, OSHA announced a vaccine-or-test mandate for companies with at least 100 employees. The rule, which would have impacted more than 80 million US workers, was originally set to go into effect on January 4.  But numerous states and business groups challenged the rule in court. On Jan. 13, the Supreme Court halted the plan. In a 6-3 ruling, the court's conservative majority concluded that OSHA had overstepped its authority.  "OSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress,″ the court's majority wrote. "Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here."  The justices left in place a vaccine mandate for health care providers who receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding. That rule affects 10.4 million workers.  OSHA indicated that the rule could return in some form. While it is no longer an enforceable standard, it remains a proposed rule, OSHA said. In the meantime, the agency said it will prioritize the health care mandate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-administration-officially-withdraws-vaccine-rule-for-big-businesses/articleshow/89125911.cms||---

Asked about his reaction to the award, Azad told TOI, “It is an honour that is provided in the Constitution, It is good to be recognised for one’s public service even by a government of the other side.” The former leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha also thanked colleague and party MP Shashi Tharoor for his compliments on the award. Azad is a prominent face of the dissident G-23 group. Significantly, Anand Sharma, another G-23 figure and party's deputy leader in Rajya Sabha, welcomed the honour for the former J&K CM. “Congrats to Azad for this richly deserved recognition for his invaluable lifelong contribution to public service and parliamentary democracy,” he said. However, others in the party seemed to differ. Tagging a news report about Bhattacharjee’s “no” to the award, Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh sarcastically tweeted, “Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad, not Ghulam.” The word play on the name of Congress leader Azad was hard to miss, in what was seen as a dig. Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad not Ghulam. https://t.co/iMWF00S9Ib— Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) 1643128880000Azad enjoys a special rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who broke down while praising him when the latter's term in Rajya Sabha came to an end. Ramesh’s reaction was widely viewed as the Congress’ cold shoulder to the Padma award for its senior leader, with many expressing an expectation from Azad to follow Bhattacharjee‘s cue and turn down the recognition extended by the BJP government. Azad did not seem fazed by the controversy and scotched speculation that he has removed his Congress affiliation from his Twitter profile. “Some mischievous propaganda being circulated by some people to create confusion . Nothing has been removed or added to my Twitter profile. The profile is as it was earlier," he tweeted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/buddha-not-ghulam-jairam-on-azad-padma/articleshow/89125816.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Though the list of invitees also includes autorickshaw drivers, sanitation and other frontline workers, their exact number was not available. “It’s a great gesture from the government to recognise their work. It was a tough task to complete everything between two Republic Day parades and that too amid the pandemic and despite the unusually long spell of rain. We were on our toes till the last day,” said an official. TOI has also learnt that a senior government official had given sarees as special gifts to all the women who worked at the site. Recently, PM Narendra Modi had lunch and with construction workers after inaugurating the Kashi Viswanath Corridor in Varanasi. Officials said giving “due respect” to the actual builders of such major projects bears the signature of Modi’s style of working. Sources said seating arrangements had been made for nearly 20,000 visitors. Those many visitors saw the full dress rehearsal last week. But the number has now been pruned to barely 6,000 because of the Covid pandemic-induced restrictions. Meanwhile, the defence secretary has directed all secretaries to share a weblink with all government employees for viewing the Republic Day parade and Beating Retreat. Officers of the joint secretary level have not got any pass this time due to the Covid restrictions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-special-people-on-this-republic-days-govt-guest-list/articleshow/89126077.cms||Dipak K Dash

Bengal singer Sandhya Mukhopadhyay and tabla maestro Pt Anindo Chattopadhyay refused the Padma Shri, citing different reasons. Sources said Bhattacharjee’s wife Meera received a call from the Centre at 2pm about her ailing husband being conferred the award. She broke the news to him, at which he smiled, the sources said. But when MHA officially announced the list of Padma awardees later, Bhattacharjee told his wife that he wouldn’t accept on personal grounds. In a cryptic written statement, he said, "I am not aware of the Padma Bhushan award being conferred on me. No one communicated it to me. If I was selected for the award, I decline it." CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury attributed a similarly worded statement to Bhattacharjee and shared it on his official Twitter handle. MHA sources confirmed to TOI that home secretary A K Bhalla had called Meera to inform her about her husband being chosen for the Padma Bhushan. Bhalla could not talk to Bhattacharjee directly because he was told that the CPM veteran was not well. According to party sources, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra got in touch with the Bhattacharjees, and left it to the former CM to take the final call. CPM insiders felt that Bhattacharjee had done the right thing because, as Marxists, they were not inclined to receive government awards for public service. They recalled a similar situation in 2008, when the Congress-led UPA I government proposed the highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, for former West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu. Basu had then declined it. CPM functionaries recalled that the PV Narasimha Rao government, too, had proposed the Padma Vibhushan for former Kerala chief minister and freedom fighter E M S Namboodiripad. "EMS didn’t accept the proposal," a senior party functionary said. Singer Mukhopadhyay, who is 90, turned down the offer because she found it "humiliating" that a government official called her just before the official announcement. Tabla maestro Chattopadhyay said the award came his way 12 years too late.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpms-bengal-ex-cm-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-declines-padma-award/articleshow/89126161.cms||---

In an interaction with BJP workers, coinciding with the National Voters’ Day, Modi though expressed concern over low voting percentage, especially in urban areas, and said this should change in a vibrant democracy like India. He lamented that residents in urban areas discuss elections on social media but don’t go to vote. The PM also raised the issues of “one nation, one election” and “one nation, one voters’ list”, saying the continuous cycle of elections results in politics being seen in everything while development works suffer. Addressing an event organised by the  Commission to mark the day, Rijiju said, “In a democracy, everyone has the right to criticise the EC but must keep the language in mind. Courts can make critical observations about EC but judges should think about the language they use and try to understand the circumstances under which EC officials work.” “It is okay to criticise the Election Commission but there should be a firm basis to it. The elements who try to discredit the efforts of EC are actually trying to discredit the democratic process of our country,” the law minister said in the presence of chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey. In an audio-visual message, vice-president M Vekaiah Naidu lauded the increase in voter participation from 58.2% in 2009 Lok Sabha elections to 66.44% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and urged that it be taken up further to 75% in the next general elections. The vice-president also made a pitch for simultaneous elections. Meanwhile, Sushil Chandra said that all arrangements were being made for safety of votes and voters in the ensuing state elections. Calling upon the need to curb the influence of money and muscle power in elections, he said an effort has to be made by the society as a whole, and not just the Election Commission, that people with criminal antecedents are discouraged from participating. Rajiv Kumar said that the participation of women electors had gone up by 235% since 1971. Also, young voters now comprise 25% of the country’s electoral base, with their total number at 23 crore, he added. Anup Chandra Pandey appreciated the law ministry for being supportive of all efforts of the Election Commission, including the recent amendments to the Representation of the People Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-flags-low-voting-in-urban-centres-rijiju-asks-critics-of-ec-to-watch-tone/articleshow/89126208.cms||---

However, none from the state has made it to the lists of Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan announced on Tuesday. Abdhul Kadhar NadakattinThe other four winners from Karnataka are Dr Subbanna Ayyappan (science and engineering), HR Keshava Murthy (music), Abdhul Kadhar Nadakattin (grassroots innovation) and Amai Mahalinga Naik (agriculture). HR Keshava MurthySiddalingaiah was one of Karnataka's prominent Dalit poets and is credited with launching the Dalit-Bandaya literary movement. Mangaluru’s Amai Mahalinga Naik singlehandedly transformed a 2-acre barren land into a lush farmSiddalingaiah was one of the founders of Dalit Sangharsh Samiti in the state. A surprise winner this year is Mangaluru's Amai Mahalinga Naik, a labourer who singlehandedly transformed a two-acre barren land into a lush farm. Naik was working as a labourer on a farm near Mangaluru. Impressed by his hard work and dedication, his landlord gifted him a barren plot in 1978. He then managed to create a water source there. Today, Naik's farm has over 300 arecanut palms, 75 coconut trees, 150 cashew trees, 200 banana plants and pepper vines. Subbanna Ayyappan is a former secretary in the department of agricultural research and education and director general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

His specific areas of research are fisheries, fresh water aquaculture and aquatic microbiology. He's chief executive of the National Fisheries Development Board. HR Keshava Murthy, a noted exponent of Gamaka (a mix of narration and singing in music), has popularised this age-old art through concerts and trained over 1,000 people to earn the title ‘Gamaka Gana Gandharva'. It was Murthy's relentless efforts to preserve and popularise the art that led to the setting up of Gamaka Kala Parishat by the state government and development of Hosahalli, on the banks of Tunga in Shivamogga district, as an abode of the art form. Abdhul Kadhar Nadakattin is an agricultural scientist and pioneer in agricultural equipment manufacturing. He set up Vishwashanthi Agriculture Research and Industrial Development Centre in 1975.

A team of 25 MCG employees has been constituted to keep a check on Sadar Bazar. “If we remove encroachment from the market, the rush will also be reduced to some extent.

In its order, state registrar Vivek Kalia said, “The ad-hoc committee should not impede with the electoral process and let the new governing body amend the by-laws wherever they are warranted to be corrected as per the provisions of the HRRS Act.” After a series of complaints to the district registrar and district administration over the last two years, the residents conducted the election in July last year, however it was challenged by the members of the previous RWA, citing gross violation in the conduct of election with the district registrar. Following which the district registrar set up an ad-hoc committee. “Despite the fact that there was deemed approved board of members elected in July 2021, the district registrar constituted the ad-hoc which mostly consist of members of the previous body. It was never their intent to hold the election process and just making excuse to amend the by-laws. In November, the district registrar appointed a returning officer to hold fresh election, however, the members of the adhoc committee filed a petition against the appointment with the state registrar,” said Rakesh Hooda, a resident of the society.“We want nothing but an elected representative body, who work for the residents’ welfare and harmony in the society,” said Manoj Singh, another resident.

Expressing their concern, the residents complained that there is no place for community gathering, meeting or a social function in the colony.They have urged the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to take over these sites and help get it completed. The residents pointed out that in 2016 the developer started the construction of a community centre and after building its structure, it has been lying abandoned since 2018.The department has issued the license for the colony from 1994 to 2009 which is spread across 327 acres with 13 blocks. “The community buildings are considered to be very important hubs for the community activities. The availability of such centre in a colony like this big is very much required for conducting social meetings, gatherings and functions, however, for the last four year half-done building has been wearing deserted look. Similarly, out of 38 community sites, more than 20 sites are lying vacant. This was supposed to enhance the public amenities. Even the work on the club site has not started yet and the building plan for the same has not been approved,” said Dharam Vir Yadav, a resident of the colony.Yadav added, “It is a high time when the government should take over such site and transfer it to the local authority or private intuition so that the community utility building be constructed for the benefit of people.”The residents claimed that the unutilised sites are exposed to encroachment and illegal construction in the colony. “All these community sites are part of the approved layout plan for which we have paid the amount and now we feel cheated as we are deprive off our rights. Even the public utility site reserved for the electric sub-station (ESS) has been transferred to HVPNL and site pertaining to police posts has been handed over to the police department free-of-cost through HUDA. But, both the sites still being vacant are under illegal encroachment,” said Jeevagan Nadar, another resident.Meanwhile, senior town planner, Sanjeev Mann said, “The matter was not brought to my notice yet, however, we will examine the matter as per the department policy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/over-20-sites-for-community-utilities-lying-vacant-residents/articleshow/89126272.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Nearly 35 kilometres of a total 135 kilometres length of sewer lines in the city have got cleared of waste, and work is underway on another 15 kilometres, the GMDA said on Tuesday. Another 25 kilometres length had already been clean, and the desilting work on 60 kilometres is still left.According to the GMDA officials, the authority will complete the pending work soon. “We are in the process of finalising the cost estimates for the work on the remaining 60 kilometres of the sewer lines. Since we have received a direction to make the city silt-free, we will expedite and complete this work. However, desilting is a continuous process. Just because we have cleaned a sewer line today does not mean it will not require attention again after a few months,” said a senior GMDA official.This matter came up for discussion at the latest authority meeting, with officials informing that sewer vents are also getting tagged with the Geographic Information Survey (GIS) technology to ensure more transparency and accuracy in the process of desilting.The desilting of the sewer lines is critical for the durability of the pipes and the proper flow of sewage. If the lines are not de-silted, there may be overflow or backflow of sewage, which may seep out into public spaces and cause commute, health and hygiene issues among residents.The officials further said that the time after which any sewer line requires desilting depends on its location; the downstream pipes are more vulnerable to silting than the upstream ones. Moreover, the officials said that the sewer lines on Golf Course Road or near Galleria Market “where people have better civic sense” do not get choked as quickly as those in areas “where people do not have much awareness and dump items in the sewer lines”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/35km-of-sewer-lines-unclogged-will-clear-all-soon-says-gmda/articleshow/89126274.cms||Sakshi Dayal

---||Gurgaon||After 3.5 years, ‘thak thak’ gang strikes again in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: The ‘thak thak’ gang is active in the city again. Several instances of bags and valuables being stolen from parked cars after their windows are broken have been reported from different parts of the city in the past two months. The gang was last active in Gurgaon in mid-2018, and police had arrested dozens of its members. According to cops, the gang targets vehicles parked in markets and streets. In case someone is sitting inside, they divert the commuter’s attention with different tricks and steal bags from the car, an officer said. On Monday, Nitin parked his car outside a mall in Sector 83 and went to a pharmacy store to purchase some medicines. He returned a few minutes later to find the window of his car broken and his bag kept on the back seat missing. “The bag had my laptop, watch and some documents. I had left my car for just a few minutes,” said Nitin. Based on his complaint, a case has been registered at Kherki Daula police station under Section 379 (theft) of IPC. On January 12, two air pistols worth Rs 3.2 lakh were stolen from two national-level shooters, allegedly by members of the gang, in Sadar Bazar. After finishing a practice session, Vinay Rathee (20) and his friend Sagar (18) had gone to the market to purchase a mobile phone cover. Sagar went shopping, while Vinay waited in the car. A man knocked on the car window and said some money belonging to Sagar had fallen on the road. When Vinay stepped out of the car to pick up the cash, another person stole two bags from the back seat. The bags had two air pistols, a shooting frame and Rs 8,000 in cash. Incidents like these have become a regular occurrence in Gurgaon for two months. The gang has become active in the city after 2018, when dozens of its members were arrested. After the series of arrests, incidents of thefts from parked cars had almost stopped. “The gang members had stopped coming to Gurgaon, but now they have again become active,” said a senior police officer. “Our teams are working to identify and track the gang members,” ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/after-3-5-years-thak-thak-gang-strikes-again-in-city/articleshow/89126276.cms||Bagish Jha

According to health department data, Nuh has inoculated only 20% of eligible teenagers so far, the lowest in the state. Vaccination for the 15-17 age group started on January 3. A total of 15,43,040 in this age group are eligible for jabs. Gurgaon, which aimed to vaccinate 100% of this age group by January 10, has managed to administer the shots to 70% till Tuesday. It has given 1,05,700 Covaxin doses, while 1,51,000 teens are eligible for jabs. Vaccine coverage is calculated as an official target estimate based on population projections. The city is aggressively pushing to increase vaccination drive coverage for children as Gurgaon has been reporting more than 2,000 new Covid cases daily. “We have expanded our reach by including this category in the ongoing door-to-door vaccination drive in rural areas of Gurgaon. We have also set up camps in religious places and have also involved RWAs in urban areas,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. The second district with the maximum eligible teens in this particular group is Faridabad (1,20,000). It has given jabs to 79,882 till now (67% coverage). Meanwhile, Karnal has given first doses to 57,515 (90%) of its eligible population, the highest coverage in Haryana. Its target population (64,090), however, is among the lowest in the state. Other than these districts, Kaithal has administered jabs to 68% in the 15-17 category, followed by Palwal (66%), Bhiwani (65%), Charkhi Dadri (64%), Panipat (63%), Hisar (62%), Mahendergarh (62%), Rewari (61%), Sonipat (61%), Kurukshetra (58%), Ambala (57%), Jind (57%), Jhajjar (56%), Panchkula (53%), Sirsa (48%), and Yamunanagar (46%) Fatehabad (43%) and Rohtak (43%). Asked how Haryana will increase the pace of vaccination for this age group, a senior health official told TOI that each district has been asked to undertake initiatives to increase the pace of vaccination. “Haryana doesn’t have a deadline for this age group. All districts have already been told to carry out the maximum vaccinations as the state is lagging in giving jabs to the 15-17 category. Districts can decide about their strategy on their own depending on their targets,” the official said. Meanwhile, 1,076 in this group got jabs in Gurgaon on Tuesday. Moreover, 5,707 people in the 18-44 group and 999 in the 45-59 group took the shots. A total of 1,297 people aged above 60 years, 85 healthcare workers and 285 frontline workers also got vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/c-vax-given-to-57-in-15-17-group-in-haryana/articleshow/89126277.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Noida||Central team to study Noida’s depleting groundwater level||Noida: Experts from the Central Groundwater Commission (CGC) will soon conduct a hydrological survey to ascertain ways to increase the groundwater level across the city. Noida Authority officials said the three-month-long survey will help identify the problem areas and etch out solutions with cost estimates that will be used to draw up a plan for groundwater conservation in the coming months.The city, which faces annual depletion of up to 5-6 feet, currently has 11 Ranney wells of which six are operational but in a near-dry state. Four others are damaged while one is contaminated and, hence, not operational. Ranney wells are a type of radial well used to extract water from an aquifer with a direct connection to a surface water source like a river or lake. “Ranney wells are a major source of potable water as they are found near the river. In Noida’s case, it is the Yamuna. The water, which was earlier found at 30-40 metres below the ground level, was drawn out with 150-metre-wide pipes laid horizontally along with these wells. Of the past six to seven years, six of these wells are lying in a nearly dry state due to sustained groundwater depletion, not only in the city but also in the Yamuna. It is a huge task to make these Ranney wells functional,” RP Singh, the deputy general manager (water and sewer department) of Noida Authority, told TOI. He added that the groundwater level in Noida has plummeted from 30-40 metres in 2002 to nearly 110-115 metres in the recent years.“For restoration of the Ranney wells and conservation of groundwater, we have engaged experts from the Ministry of Water Resources, who, in turn, have hired experts from the CGC. These experts will start the hydrological survey in February. Once we will get to know how much groundwater has depleted and in which area, we will take steps by way of government orders on how to restrict its extraction. The move would be based on suggestions from the experts, be it restricting unwanted borewells or withdrawals to making wetlands,” Singh said.The Authority will devise a plan based on the experts’ study, to implement measures at groundwater conservation, which will be the second part of the 15 month project||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/central-team-to-study-noidas-depleting-groundwater-level/articleshow/89126282.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The bird had sustained pellet injuries near its wings when it was shot on December 7 last year, the Sector 94 animal shelter team said. It was rescued from the park in Sector 15A, where it had collapsed, after the crews from the shelter, managed by the Dhyan Foundation, were alerted.“One of the wings of the bird had severe pellet injuries and we think someone had tried to shoot it down. This is completely illegal,” Anuradha Dogra of the animal shelter told TOI. Due to their dwindling population, painted storks come under the near-threatened species category in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list.Soon after it was rescued, Dogra said, the bird was operated on to remove the pellets lodged near its wings. “It was kept under observation till mid-January when we also tested its flying ability and the health of its injured wings. After it healed completely, we released the bird on January 18 this year,” she added.Shubham Mani Katiyar, who treated the bird at the shelter, said blood was oozing out of one of its wings when the bird was brought in. “We first started trying to stop the blood flow. Later, we gave it some painkillers. Post-surgery, we checked on the bird daily, fed it medicines and fish, which is also its favourite meal. All these helped it to recover and soon it started flying within the enclosure where it was housed. After testing and observing it for a few more days, the bird was finally released in its natural habitat,” Katiyar said.Painted storks, which are migratory in nature, are mostly found across large marshes of the sub-continent. Human-induced factors have led to the decline of their natural habitats.“It is very difficult to treat a wild species. We are happy to have nursed it back to health. It was indeed very satisfying to see the bird take wings and fly away,” Dogra said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/42-days-after-being-shot-at-painted-stork-can-fly-again/articleshow/89126283.cms||---

Another 20-year-old woman passed away in Gautam Budh Nagar while undergoing treatment for the viral infection at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS). In January, Ghaziabad has recorded seven deaths due to Covid, which took the total toll since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 to 468. On January 22, a 40-year-old woman from Loni had succumbed while undergoing treatment in the district. In GB Nagar, officials said, four persons have succumbed to the infection in the current year, which catapulted the total Covid-related fatalities to 471. On January 21, a 27-year-old man had died during his treatment at a hospital in GB Nagar.According to health officials, the 17-year-old boy, a resident of Modinagar, had complained of breathlessness, dry cough and weakness for several months but had no comorbidities. He was admitted to the LLRM Medical College in Meerut after testing positive for Covid on January 21. Doctors claimed that the teenager had succumbed due to cardiopulmonary arrest with resistant hypoxia refractory to mechanical ventilation.An 81-year-old Indirapuram resident also succumbed while undergoing treatment at Anand Hospital in Meerut. The patient was fully vaccinated and was admitted to the hospital on January 19 after he complained of breathlessness, cough and general weakness. “The octogenarian had a history of hypertension and was suffering from acute abdominal pain for the past few days. He died due to respiratory failure and cardio-respiratory arrest,” doctors at the hospital said.Meanwhile, a 20-year-old woman, admitted to GIMS in a critical condition after being referred from another hospital, passed away in GB Nagar on the day.On Tuesday, the two districts also noted a surge in cases — from Monday’s 501 cases to 1,373 in GB Nagar and from 661 cases recorded a day back to 820 in Ghaziabad.Currently, there are over 4,000 active cases in Ghaziabad, of which 49 are undergoing treatment in separate hospitals, district health officials said. The sample positivity rate in the district was recorded at 10.8%, up from 8.8% recorded on Monday, even as more than 7,500 tests were conducted. In GB Nagar, close to 1,400 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/cases-rise-in-gzb-but-still-below-1k-17-year-old-among-two-dead/articleshow/89126285.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Noida||UP elections 2022: AAP candidates pitch Kejriwal’s Delhi model to NCR voters||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The Aam Aadmi Party is taking its ‘Delhi model’ pitch to NCR through varied voices, most of whom are featuring in their first election in UP. In Noida, AAP has fielded Pankaj Awana (27), a former marketing manager with Apple in Delhi. Awana joined the party a year ago. Farmer Nimit Yadav is the party candidate from the Ghaziabad seat. In Jewar, Delhi University graduate and homemaker Poonam Singh is on extensive door-to-door campaigns, telling locals about AAP’s policies in Delhi and how the party could extend those to NCR. While local issues like broken roads and inadequate infrastructure are being raised by AAP candidates during the door-to-door campaigns, they are more focused on the promises of free electricity and water, besides providing unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 a month to every unemployed youth and Rs 1,000 to women. TOI trailed a few AAP candidates in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad during their door-to-door campaigns. JewarIn Jewar, it’s Poonam’s first electoral foray. But she is no stranger to politics. Her husband Mukesh Kumar was a gram pradhan for 25 years. Along with him, she had joined the Anna Hazare movement and later AAP. “My husband is a well-known figure in the area. I have been working in villages since the panchayat elections last year. People here know me by face,” she said. The husband-wife duo has been covering 10-15 villages every day and informing locals about the “Delhi model” of Arvind Kejriwal’s government. She says all those benefits which are being given to Delhi residents would be extended here if AAP forms the government in UP. On Tuesday, as soon as Poonam’s grey Scorpio reached Derin Atta village in Dankaur, a Muslim-dominated area, she was greeted by a small group of people sitting around a bonfire. The couple was taken to the nearest house where the village elderly and the AAP entourage sat on the verandah. But, most of the talking here was done by Kumar, who tried to convince people that the incumbent BJP MLA Dhirendra Singh had done “nothing” for people. He also dismissed SP-RLD candidate Avtar Singh Bhadana as someone with “no connect” with voters here. As soon as Poonam got ready for her door-to-door campaign, a portable speaker was taken out from her vehicle by a party member, which played songs like “Delhi se UP me Kejriwal aaya” and “Sabko dekha, ab Poonam Singh ki bari”. While Poonam went inside homes and met women, her husband struck up conversations with the men outside. He told them that only Kejriwal can take away the miseries of unemployment, inflation and lack of infrastructure. Poonam urged women to vote for the party on February 10, if they want good schools for their children and Rs 1,000 a month. “I start my campaign around 9am and wrap up by 7pm. I visit the homes of my friends and acquaintances in the evening till 11 pm. There are 20 teams, which work on my behalf across the constituency at the same time,” she said. The couple has two daughters — one is a doctor, another a pilot with a private airline. NoidaAAP’s choice for the Noida seat, Pankaj Awana (27) worked with Apple from 2017-19. He joined active politics a year ago and has been given a ticket to take on sitting MLA Pankaj Singh. An MBA from Sharda University in Greater Noida, he is hoping for a big win. With barely 15 days left for the assembly elections, Pankaj too has been visiting localities across the city to pitch AAP’s “Delhi model”, offering free electricity, employment and better education at government schools. Addressing people in Atta, which has a mix of shops and houses, Pankaj said, “I just need 15 days from you before the polls. After that I will take care of your needs for the next five years. In Delhi, Kejriwal threw out people who had been in power for more than seven decades, we will repeat that in Noida. You have to choose if you want leaders who stay kilometres away from you or the one who is just a call away.” Walking through the narrow lanes of Atta, Pankaj stopped to meet people and handed over pamphlets promising 300 units of free electricity, Rs 5,000 as allowance to the unemployed youth. Several women in the locality too had come out to welcome Pankaj. Ghaziabad Nimit, who holds an MCom degree from MMH College in Ghaziabad, was not the AAP’s first choice for the Ghaziabad constituency. Earlier, his relative Lalit Yadav was given the ticket, but apparently due to his ill health and some inconsistencies in his nomination papers, Nimit’s name was forwarded by the party’s district office-bearers. Nimit, who has mentioned farming as his occupation in the nomination papers, has also dabbled in property dealing and ran coaching classes for commerce students. “Nimit joined the party a year and a half back and is totally dedicated to the party’s ideology, which banks on the sole plank of public welfare. His name was forwarded by district president and approved by Sanjay Singh, AAP’s UP in-charge,” his brother Kapil said. On Tuesday, Nimit covered the localities of Crossings Republik and Vijay Nagar. His style of campaigning was different. Rather than going to each home, he walked through the narrow lanes of Vijay Nagar and stood at the end of each road, where his aides told people to vote for AAP on a loudspeaker. They counted the promises made by Kejriwal. “People are frustrated with the current government that solely believes in polarising votes,” Nimit said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/aap-candidates-pitch-kejriwals-delhi-model-to-ncr-voters/articleshow/89126287.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Noida||Shock & awe: Noida's twin towers to be demolished in four phases||NOIDA: The mammoth exercise of bringing down the twin towers at Supertech’s Emerald Court compound, while ensuring the safety of all other buildings in a populated neighbourhood, will take place in four phases that will include a structural survey of all buildings in the impact radius and a “pre-weakening” of the towers so that they implode within the perimeter once the charges are set off. Sources at Edifice Engineering, the company tasked with the demolition, said it’s also planning to take a third-party insurance cover of Rs 75 crore-100 crore to indemnify owners of houses and any other structure within a 50-metre radius of the twin towers at Sector 93A in case there is any structural damage due to the demolition of the towers. Residents in the vicinity, especially those at the adjacent ATS Greens Village, have been airing their concern about the demolition and its impact on the structural integrity of their homes. Its RWA head Bharat Bhusan had on Monday told TOI he had sought details of the demolition plan from the Noida Authority but hadn’t received any. Apex and Ceyane, the two uninhabited towers, are being razed on the orders of the Supreme Court, which had on August 31 last year upheld an Allahabad high court order to bring them down, holding that the towers were built in violation of law. The Emerald Court RWA had initiated the legal battle against the twin towers back in 2012. Sources said the type of explosives that will be used for the demolition will be determined once engineers and technical experts of Edifice visit the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) office in Agra within a week. Apart from seeking the organisation’s approval to carry out the blast, PESO, the nodal agency for matters where the Explosive Act and the Petroleum Act are applicable, will also provide the list of explosive storage magazines in the region. Edifice Engineering will pick which explosives it will use only after checking the available inventory in the magazines. Away from locations where they are manufactured, magazines are buildings or structures specifically designed to permanently store explosives. Ammonium nitrate, nitroglycerin (dynamite) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) are some options on the table. “The quantity will be decided only after we find out which type of explosives will be used for the implosion. Our meeting with PESO will give some clarity. Till then, nothing can be said. We will visit the magazines in Agra and other parts of NCR to check the options,” said Uttkarsh Mehta, partner at Edifice. Before the demolitions happen, likely in May, extensive preparations are needed. In the first phase of the preparations, engineers will survey the demolition site and the two towers exhaustively. Experts will also check for defects, cracks and degree of deterioration in nearby buildings. “Basically, we are going to conduct a structural audit within the impact area and see if reinforcement of existing structures is required,” said Mehta. Pre-weakening Apex and Ceyane to ensure the towers collapse inwards will be the next step. For this, engineers will identify columns, pillars and beams to be removed. Cantilever beams that support two walls will be the first ones to be brought down. Shear walls will present a challenge. A preliminary survey has revealed that the shear walls built around each floor of the 100-metre-tall (33 storeys) Apex and 97-metre-tall (32 storeys) Ceyane are 12 metres long and 3 metres wide. Designed to bear lateral load and increase seismic resistance, the shear walls will have to be cut strategically on each storey to ensure the remaining structure collapses in the ‘waterfall implosion’ methodology that is being employed, in which the towers collapse inward and the debris collects in a heap at the bottom within the regulated perimeter. The shear walls will also yield the maximum amount of salvageable steel. It is estimated that around 7,000 holes will have to be drilled at a gap of 1 metre to 3 metres in the two buildings to hold the charges for the implosion. The other steps of the preparation will include checking for hazardous material like asbestos, which can cause health hazards and will have to be taken out before the implosion. Engineers will also set up an insulating perimeter to absorb the shock and minimise noise and dust pollution and vibration caused due to the implosion of the towers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/structure-checks-in-radius-to-pre-weakening-four-steps-to-demolition-of-noida-twin-towers/articleshow/89126293.cms||Shalabh

They cite the proposal as an unwarranted burden on people, especially those who enjoy tax exemption.In a letter to Sitharaman, the Confederation of All India Traders Delhi-NCR (CAIT) has also demanded the abolition of goods and services tax (GST) on medical insurance in the wake of a surge in Covid cases and putting school fees under a separate exemption system for at least Rs 1.5 lakh.“No IT return filing fees should be levied because already the inflation is very high and taxpayers are already making their ends meet with extreme difficulty,” said SK Jain, convenor of CAIT-Delhi NCR. “Also, we have urged the minister that all small businessmen running sunilpartnership firms be extended the exemption on minimum income like individual taxpayers.”According to Jain, who is also the president of the Sector 18 Market Association, the abolition of GST on medical insurance is the need of the hour.“Medical expenses have been very high during Covid 19. Hence, we have written to the finance minister, seeking abolition of GST on medical insurance. We have urged the minister to reconsider the entire GST system and introduce a new one with a single-window format through a digital identity, like an Aadhaar card for all businesses,” he said.From the upcoming budget, Abhay Pandey from a Noida residents’ group has demanded from Sitharaman an increase in the standard deduction slab and the exemption limit under 80C to Rs 3 lakh from the current Rs 1.5 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/traders-in-noida-oppose-itr-filing-charge-gst-on-medical-insurance/articleshow/89126298.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Dr Khan, who was in Mumbai on Tuesday, claimed that many political parties are in touch with him.“I have not decided yet, but I may contest against Yogi Adityanath. Many parties have approached me,” Dr Khan told TOI. When told that Aazad Samaj Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad had decided to fight Adityanath from Gorakhpur, he said: “Chandrashekhar is a friend. We were together in jail. I will speak to him.” Despite an inquiry commission clearing him of “corruption and negligence charges” leading to the death of over 60 kids due to encephalitis in 2017, he was terminated from his job. Dr Khan petitioned Allahabad HC on January 19 against his dismissal.Dr Khan, whom Allahabad HC released after dropping charges under the NSA in September 2021, met a group of activists in Mumbai at the Islam Gymkhana. “Eight doctors and other government employees were suspended. Seven have been reinstated while the Adityanath government has sacked me. I have challenged it in court and will fight till I get my job back,” said Dr Khan. In January 2021, Dr Khan was arrested from Mumbai and later slapped with NSA charges for allegedly “promoting enmity”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/may-contest-against-yogi-kafeel-khan/articleshow/89126300.cms||---

ACPM Medical College had got approval for 150 seats this year and was also charging the lowest tuition fees (Rs 5.5 lakh) compared to other private colleges in the state. While the NMC found alleged irregularities during a surprise inspection, the college moved court against the decision. The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has now passed an order asking NMC to conduct a fresh inspection before January 30. The college had 100 seats for admissions till last year. This year, upon inspection, 50 more seats were granted by the commission. However, on Makar Sankranti, a team from the Medical Assessment and Ratings Board arrived for a surprise check. “It was a holiday and some of the teaching staff were not on campus. Based on this, a report was submitted by the team and the NMC put us on the no-admission list,” said the college dean, Dr Vijay Patil. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said that students should fill the college as an option as there is no official intimation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/med-college-off-admission-list-court-orders-re-inspection/articleshow/89126301.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena first party to fight polls on Hindutva plank, says Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: Taking a new dig at BJP which has accused its former ally Shiv Sena of adhering to Hindutva only on paper, party MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said Sena was the first party in the country to contest an election on the Hindutva plank. He referred to a bypoll in 1987-88 to the Vile Parle Assembly seat that Sena’s Ramesh Prabhu had contested on the Hindutva agenda. Prabhu won and retained the seat in the 1990 assembly polls. “It is after this victory that BJP approached Shiv Sena for an alliance on Hindutva which Balasaheb (Thackeray) agreed to as he didn’t want a division of Hindu votes. Contemporary BJP leaders are unaware of this history,” Raut said in a veiled dig at Devendra Fadnavis. Fresh acrimony had broken out between the saffron parties after CM Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday the party had wasted 25 years in alliance with BJP. However, Raut appeared to have gone too far and deleted a tweet after BJP MP Poonam Mahan objected. Raut had shared an old R K Laxman cartoon published in TOI, showing Pramod Mahajan taking instructions from Bal Thackeray. “The two ‘men’ (mard) formed an alliance for Hindutva and Raut should not share ‘unmanly’ (namard) cartoons,” Poonam Mahajan wrote in Marathi. Raut later said she should not feel hurt and that the Thackeray and Mahajan families share very close ties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/raut-shiv-sena-first-party-to-fight-polls-on-hindutva-plank/articleshow/89126304.cms||---

---||Mumbai||DGP post row: HC concludes hearing in PIL||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday concluded hearing in a PIL seeking appointment of a permanent Director General of Police (DGP) in the state based on three names shortlisted by the UPSC.The state, through advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, said it does not want the seniormost IPS officer (Pandey) to be excluded from the zone of consideration over incorrect application of an ACR rule. He said the former chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, who was on the selection panel, on checking the rule on his return from Delhi found he was right and Pandey’s ACR was “very good” and not just ‘good’. He, thus, over a week after signing on the three recommended names which did not include Pandey last November, wrote to the UPSC about the “error” and sought a revision for his inclusion, Kumbhakoni said. He added in doing so, Kunte acted in a “twin capacity” as a selection panel member and “for and on behalf of the Maharashtra government.”The acting DGP, Sanjay Pandey, sought to be added as a party and be heard on merits. Senior counsel Navroze Seervai, appearing for him, said his “vital rights” would be affected by the decision the court makes in the PIL and principles of natural justice require that he be made a party and heard on merit.The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik asked the state AG and Seervai to show how, under which law or judgment, does the state get that power to seek a review. To the AG, the bench said, “The more you argue the more you show the CS in poor light. He attended the meeting without knowing the rules. Why did he not defer the meeting and seek the rules then? The committee becomes functus officio (agency whose mandate has expired) after signing.”To Seervai, the HC repeatedly said Pandey has a right to move CAT against the selection and asked when had he first learnt of his name being excluded. The 3 names the panel shortlisted are Hemant Nagrale, Rajnish Seth and K Venkatesham. “What is the right of a person who is holding acting post?” asked the HC.The HC asked Chandrachud if there is a “glaring error” in the selection process, can the state not seek reconsideration from UPSC? He replied the state may ask UPSC to reconsider for other cases, not DGP, else in guise of seeking such reconsideration, a state may seek to continue its person in office.’“My (Pandey’s) fate is decided tangentially in the guise of deciding PIL,” said Seervai. ASG Anil Singh and Abhinav Chandrachud for petitioner Datta Mane said SC has held there can be no ‘acting DGP’ post and to ensure no political pressure falls on administration of law and order, the SC provided for security of a 2-year tenure for the DGP.The bench said till date, neither the state nor Pandey challenged the UPSC recommendations in any court, “yet you want in hearing the PIL us to examine whether UPSC was right or not.” Seervai said the “whole issue could be resolved if UPSC is asked to decide on state’s representation. They can well reject it.”The bench asked where is their duty to respond. “Where is the question of making a representation. They (state) should have gone to SC seeking a clarification of guidelines ( in Prakash Singh judgment), saying it does not allow for representation, not writing to UPSC and killing time,” the bench said. The HC gave Seervai and the AG till Thursday to submit short written notes on their submissions while reserving the matter for orders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dgp-post-row-hc-concludes-hearing-in-pil/articleshow/89126308.cms||Swati Deshpande

Chief Fire Officer (CFO) Hemant Parab said, that a notice will hence be served under Section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and life safety measures act 2006. As per this section it is the owners or occupiers’ liability to provide for fire prevention and life safety measures. “Our teams reached the site and found the systems were non-operational. We are in the process of issuing the structure a notice,” said Parab. Fire brigade officials said that they have repeatedly stated that, as per section 3 (1) of Maharashtra Fire Prevention & Life Safety Measures Act 2006, it is mandatory for every owner or occupier as the case may be to provide fire prevention and life safety measures in the building or part of the building. As per Section 3 (3) it is mandatory for the owner or occupier to furnish a certificate i.e ‘Form B’ issued by a Licensed Agency twice a year i.e. in the month of January and July regarding the maintenance of existing fire prevention and life safety measures in good repair and efficient condition. However despite this the same is not being done it has been repeatedly found.

On the application filed by dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, the commission called for communication as well as report dated March 30 submitted by joint commissioner (crime) Milind Bharambe and his communication of March 25, along with annexures, but rejected Waze’s application for summoning Bharambe for cross-examination. “After hearing respective advocates and since they have not seriously objected for calling the requisite records, as indicated in the applications be called (sic). Registrar of the commission to write to the concerned authorities with copies of applications, to enable the authorities to produce the requisite records by hand delivery within a week of receiving the communication,” Justice Chandiwal’s order said. During his cross-examination on Monday, Deshmukh had told the commission he would like to make some disclosures against Singh, following which Justice Chandiwal asked him if he has specific information then he will have to say it on oath in the form of an affidavit. Accordingly, Deshmukh on Tuesday submitted a two-page application. In his two-page application Deshmukh’s counsel Girish Kulkarni informed the commission that after Singh’s March 20 letter, the CM had set up a one-man committee to probe the charges levelled by the former CP. “Pertinently, the state government had transferred the cases from Mumbai Police Commissioner to ATS to probe the Antilia bomb scare case and murder of Mansukh Hiran. The facts, which are transpired during the investigation by the ATS in the two cases would show the role of involvement of the concerned persons, which would bring the truth on record to facilitate the commission to reach just conclusion,” says Deshmukh’s application. As per Deshmukh’s prayer, he urged the commission to call for records of the investigation done by the ATS and material and other noting to unearth the truth in the two cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/panel-seeks-antilia-and-hiran-papers-from-ats/articleshow/89126315.cms||---

Of this, nearly 130 hectares is railway land and nearly 33 hectares private land. The balance 11 hectares is government land and another 3 hectares is forest land.Private land is the most difficult to acquire as opposition and litigation can stall the progress of a project.MRVC chairman and managing director Ravi Agarwal said, “Only 13 hectares of private land is now left to be acquired. We intend to acquire the balance land in March.”MRVC has commenced work for laying of two additional tracks for segregation of mail/express and the suburban network between Virar and Dahanu. Earth work for embankment on the railway project has begun for laying of tracks on the west side of the existing corridor.Agarwal said, “As of now, 10% of the work is complete. We have set March 2025 (deadline) to complete the work.”The other components of the project include construction of new platforms at all existing stations, an electrical sub-station at Saphale, 10 new stabling sidings at Virar, Boisar and Dahanu Road, infrastructure augmentation at the Virar car shed for the maintenance of additional EMUs and construction of road over bridges (ROB) and road under bridges (RUB) at various level crossings.At present, suburban trains run up to Dahanu. The two lines (up and down) are a bottleneck, especially for long-distance trains that do not halt at intermediate stations along this stretch.Segregation of mail/express and local trains will ensure neither blocks the other’s path. The additional path will allow the railway authorities to run more trains. Eight new suburban stations are also proposed along this stretch. Even though suburban trains run at a maximum speed of 110 kmph, the newly laid tracks would ensure they run at 160 kmph, said railway officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/50-pvt-land-acquired-for-virar-dahanu-rly-project/articleshow/89126318.cms||Manthank Mehta

The impersonator asked the hospital to send its staff to the Mumbai international airport where he claimed 10 other jawans were waiting for their blood tests before heading to their respective camps to join duty, said Andheri police.The police said the staffer received a call from the scamster who told him he wanted to pay through a digital wallet and asked for his number. In his police complaint, the lab staffer said, “The caller said the payment method for Army officials is different. He first transferred Re 1 into the hospital account. Then he asked me to scan a QR code to ‘make a Rs 26,000 payment’. But instead of the money getting credited into the hospital account, two fraudulent transactions of Rs 26,000 each were done and Rs 52,000 was, in fact, debited from the hospital account.”On realising he had been duped, the staffer informed the hospital. A police case was then registered against an unknown person for cheating and identity theft. “We have sought details from the bank to find out into which account the money had got credited and was fraudulently transferred. Also, the call detail record information has been sought to track the accused,” said an Andheri police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fake-jawan-fraudulently-transfers-52k-from-hosp-a/c/articleshow/89126319.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The committee, headed by the settlement commissioner and director of land records, Pune, will submit its report within a month. The panel will scrutinise over 800 maps for the Madh Island and Erangal village area that have allegedly been manipulated, and inquire whether constructions were built with or without BMC permission. In cases of violation, it will direct the BMC to take action. Opposition leader in the legislative council Pravin Darekar had highlighted the issue during the winter session of the state legislature. He had alleged that illegal bungalows had been constructed in no-development zones and coastal regulation zones owned by the government and that land had been sold through forged maps and documents. The bungalows are being let out for film shoots and have turnovers running into crores, he alleged. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had assured the legislative council of an inquiry by the land commissioner. Thorat had pointed out that officials from the land records department, BMC and collector’s office over the last 10-15 years were involved in the scam, and many of them had retired.

---||Mumbai||PG medical aspirants hopeful as seats in Maharashtra up 29% in 2 years||MUMBAI: Post-graduate medical aspirants can cheer the fact that seats in Maharashtra have increased. While the state quota in aided and government colleges this year has 1,203 seats, private colleges have a total student intake of 676; the corresponding numbers last year were 1,168 and 619. Some private colleges converted their diploma seats to MD, adding to the overall seat pool. In case of government colleges, grants given under Covid allowed them to add beds and faculty vacancies were also filled. “There are a few court cases too and seats may go up further, depending on the judgment. That may bring a little respite among aspirants,” said a senior official from the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). The total capacity under the state quota went up 22.6% to 1,879 as compared to 1,461 in 2019. In the case of private institutes, the rise was 40.8% in the past two years (see box). Between 2019 and 2021, the overall rise in PG seats is 28.6%. This is excluding the current year’s all-India quota of 1,207 seats as also the approximate 500 seats in the 10 deemed universities of Maharashtra. For aspirants, the increase will see cut-offs drop a tad. “We saw more faculty from government colleges of Dhule and Kolhapur get recognised by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences. Hence, with an addition of every PG guide, two PG seats can be added. Moreover, hospitals received grants from the district development board which allowed them to add beds,” said former DMER head Dr Pravin Shingare. For every 30 beds, two PG seats can be added. This year, competition for post-graduate medical seats is intense. The implementation of the 27% OBC and 10% EWS quota in the all-India seats already has had an impact on post-graduate seats. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said, “Every tiny increase raises the hopes of students. The race to get a PG seat this year has become tougher than the earlier times because of the reservation in the all-India quota.” The state used to get back about 100 to 110 seats from the unfilled all-India quota. From this year, these will not be surrendered as the medical counselling committee will complete all the admission rounds. Preeti Gandhi, a PG resident aspiring to join orthopedics, said that while there has been an increase in seats, close to 60% will go to the reserved category pool in government colleges. “The number of seats coming to the open category are very few,” she said. In case of private medical colleges, 25% is set aside for constitutional reservation, 10% for EWS, 15% for NRI and 35% for the management quota, leaving 15% for open merit students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pg-med-aspirants-hopeful-as-seats-in-state-up-29-in-2-yrs/articleshow/89126326.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||Deaths on Pune expressway down 25% to 82 in 4 years||Mumbai: A combination of infrastructural improvements and strict enforcement reduced fatalities on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway by 25% in the past four years. According to data with the state traffic department, 82 people lost their lives to road crashes on the 100-km road in 2021, down from 110 deaths in 2018 (see box). Casualties are likely to reduce further once the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) completes a new tunnel that is being dubbed the ‘missing link’. “We started with a comprehensive analysis of the cause and location of crashes on the expressway. This helped spot a pattern,” said additional director general B K Upadhayaya, who until recently headed the state traffic department. The maximum crashes are in the ghat section where heavy vehicles coming down the slope are on neutral gear that leads to brakes heating up and often results in crashes. While the gradient in the ghats cannot be changed, MSRDC has proposed a tunnel that will bypass the sloping roads in the ghats and reduce commuting time.“Fixing bad roads, treating ‘black spots’ (frequent crash sites) and electronic enforcement, including installation of 10 hidden surveillance cameras, reduced fatalities over four years. We pushed the state government to set up truck stops for heavy vehicles facing breakdowns or for drivers wanting to take rest. This has reduced rear-end collisions (speeding vehicles hitting parked trucks) to some extent,” said Piyush Tewari of the non-profit Save Life Foundation.Speeding has been a key cause of crashes. A senior transport official said reduction in speed limit from 120kmph to 100kmph for four-wheelers in November 2019 has helped curb accidents to some extent. The expressway had recorded three deaths per 2km in 2016, 150% higher than the national average of 1.5 deaths per 2km, making it one of the deadliest in the country.The police ran an awareness campaign in adjacent villages against riding bikes on the high speed road and also trained villagers to rush crash victims to hospitals within the Golden Hour to save lives.Transport activist Jagdeep Desai said overseas, heavy vehicles are tracked by GPS for lane discipline and this should be incorporated. “Most heavy vehicles have dysfunctional lights and can’t be seen in the tunnels at night or during rainfall, which is dangerous for other motorists,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/deaths-on-pune-expressway-down-25-to-82-in-4-years/articleshow/89126327.cms||Somit Sen

The couple had refused to pay an additional airfare of Rs55,000, which the travel firm had demanded, for booking tickets on other airlines after the tickets originally booked on Jet Airways got cancelled when the airline shut operations.In addition to the refund and interest, the commission also directed the firm to pay Rs 50,000 as compensation to the couple for their mental and physical agony. Senior citizen couple Shirish Shetye and his wife Sandhya had booked a trip to England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales in September 2018 and had paid a sum of Rs 3.34 lakh.The tour was to begin at the end of May 2019, and the package included airfare, visa fee, insurance, hotel, sight-seeing, food and tour manager services. However, in March 2019, the travel firm informed that the Jet Airways tickets to Manchester had been cancelled. The next month, the firm demanded an additional Rs 55,650 for booking tickets on another airline. However, when the Shetyes refused to pay, the firm cancelled their booking.Veena Hospitality had claimed that the complaint was false and said it was prepared to return 25% of the amount.The commission took note of the complainant’s claim that there was no increase in taxes, fuel charge, visa fees etc, but the tour firm had demanded Rs 26,500 each from the complainants, only because Jet Airways had shut operations and the firm had to book flight tickets in other airlines at additional cost. The commission also pointed out that the name of Jet Airways was not mentioned in the list of airlines that the firm used for foreign tours. Therefore, the complainants claimed they are not responsible for paying increased flight ticket costs.The commission stated that the cancellation of the booking of the couple was one-sided and the demand for additional money for tickets was arbitrary. Even according to the terms and conditions of booking, the firm had to return certain amount to the complainants, which they did not do, the consumer commission said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/court-orders-refund-for-sr-couple-snubbed-by-tour-co/articleshow/89126328.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityOn Tuesday, Mumbai’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 350 compared to Delhi’s 249, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). People with respiratory issues, already wading through the receding Omicron wave, must avoid exertion and remain indoors for one more day as according to meteorology experts, Mumbai’s air quality is expected to improve by Wednesday evening. “The impact of the dust storms in Maharashtra (Mumbai and Pune) has reduced drastically and is expected to become negligible by tomorrow,” a bulletin by SAFAR said. The city’s AQI is likely to improve further to ‘lower end of very poor’ or ‘poor’ for next two days, it added. According to.experts, Mumbai’s proximity to the coast helps pollution disperse faster due to the strong breeze from across the sea, but the dust storms, coupled with moisture, local emissions and cold air, had forced smoke and dust to hang in the air. The storm initiated in the UAE instead of settling received triggers in Afghanistan and Balochistan due to warmer temperatures and reached India’s western borders and coast, affecting the air quality. On Tuesday, Mazgaon continued to show the worst AQI with over 502 PM2.5 concentration mark, the SAFAR monitor suggested. Except for Worli, where the AQI was reported to be in ‘poor’ category at 280, the air quality at Chembur, Colaba, Bhandup, Malad, Andheri, Bandra-Kurla Com-plex and Borivli was in the ‘very poor’ category (301-400). On Monday, for the first time, AQI for Mumbai was rated ‘severe’, as it breached the 500 mark—the highest indicator set for measuring 2.5 PM (particulate matter) concentration. Such AQI, said experts, has never been recorded in Mumbai except in 2012 and 2016 when it crossed the 400-mark and reversed quickly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-air-quality-very-poor-worse-than-delhis/articleshow/89126329.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The two arrested have been identified as Hanis Abdul Shaikh (44) and Zahid Salim Hussain (31). Police said that two hail from Kota district of Rajasthan. According to the police, the victim and her husband are residents of Cuffe Parade, while their son lives in Pune and visits every week. The elderly victim has had rheumatoid arthritis for the past 15 years and has severe knee joint pain. On December 24, she was climbing the steps at Gwalior tank, Nana Chowk, when a man approached her and identified himself as Vinod Gayal. He told her his mother had been cured of similar joint pain by a Dr Malick. Goyal told her that Malick was a well known Unani doctor who charges Rs 1,000, and shared the contact details with her. The woman called the number and after a few days, Shaikh visited her, posing as Dr Malick, while Hussain posed as his assistant. “Shaikh said her knee pain would go away completely once they removed some pus accumulated inside. He said he would charge Rs 3,200 for each procedure and that it would have to be done several times to completely cure her. The accused then injected her knee and removed some fluid — several times — and then demanded Rs 3.72 lakh,” said a police officer.The senior couple said they didn’t have that much money, but the two accused forced them to hand over their debit card and then made transactions worth Rs 2 lakh. The accused also told the couple that they would return for the rest of the money and to complete the treatment. The victim’s son heard about the encounter and insisted they file a police complaint. The Cuffe Parade police studied the CDR of the two accuseds’ mobile numbers and traced them to Kondhwa, Pune. Cops are now also looking for Goyal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fake-doctors-fleece-74-yr-old-of-2lakh-after-sham-surgery/articleshow/89126330.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra colleges can reopen from February 1 for fully vaccinated students||MUMBAI: The state government has declared that colleges across Maharashtra can open campuses to students for in-person teaching from February 1. The decision is applicable to all colleges and universities, public, private and deemed. Only students who have been administered both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine can enter the campuses; others can attend college online. Earlier, on January 6, the state’s higher and technical education department had closed colleges and directed institutes to conduct classes online till February 15. In line with that, examinations before February 15 will be conducted online. The state released a government resolution to that effect on Tuesday afternoon. “Exams that will be conducted after February 15 can be in online and offline mode too,” said the GR. The state, though, has directed colleges to be sensitive towards students’ problems. “If students have network issues, or if electricity is lost, if any candidate has health problems or if s/he or someone in the family is Covid positive, all universities and colleges must be sensitive towards these issues and ensure that the candidate does not miss an exam or lose a year. These rules are applicable to all colleges and universities of the state, private and deemed included,” said the directive. In pockets of Gondia, Gadchiroli, North Maharashtra, Jalgaon, Nanded and Marathwada, internet connectivity is particularly poor. “In such cases, the vice chancellor of each of these universities must discuss the situation on the ground with the disaster control authority and the collectors and in conjunction take a call on how and when offline exams can be conducted.” Colleges and district authorities have been asked to conduct vaccination camps for the youth and ensure that students are doubly vaccinated. “The decision to open hostels and campuses’ residential facilities will be taken up in the next step. The decision will be taken jointly by authorities of the higher and technical education department, higher education director, and the technical education director keeping in mind the local situation with regards to Covid cases,” stated the GR. Institutes can work with the local municipality and disaster management authority to draw up an SOP and conduct classes and exams accordingly. In case of faculty and non-teaching staff’s attendance, the state has left the decision to the respective university and colleges. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant took to social media on Tuesday to announce the reopening of colleges and the fact that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given his nod for it. The decision comes a day after schools reopened in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maha-colleges-can-reopen-from-feb-1-for-fully-vaxxed-students/articleshow/89126335.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||2.2 lakh in state seek payout for 1.4 lakh Maharashtra Covid deaths||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has so far received 2.2 lakh applications from family members of deceased Covid-19 patients for ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000 each. As on Tuesday morning. though, Covid deaths recorded in the state totalled 1,42,151. Claims received from certain districts are much higher than the total Covid deaths reported. Officials said the discrepancy is due to multiple claims filed by the same families. The BMC has received 34,642 claims as against 16,546 deaths reported till Tuesday morning. Similarly, Thane corporation, which had recorded 2,132 deaths, has received 4,723 claims. The state started disbursing the ex gratia payment to the kin of the Covid deceased from December 9 after the Supreme Court passed strictures against the delay. In 1.5 months, the state government has approved 1.07 lakh applications and another 24,000 are in the final stages of clearance and will be completed over the next two days. Officials said the high number of applications is a result of multiple applications by the same person or applications by different relatives from the same family. Nearly 51,000 such applications have been rejected, of which 13,000 have applied for an appeal with the district committee. Of the total applications received, 1.99 lakh have been scrutinised by doctors for the cause of deaths, the first level of verification. “Some applications are wrongly filled, lack required documents and get rejected. They can reapply with the correct documents,” said an official. He said the state has sanctioned Rs 953 crore to cover 1.9 lakh claims. “The gap between reported deaths and applications will not be as high as many other states. Maharashtra has been very transparent in reporting deaths,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-2l-in-state-seek-payout-for-1-4l-maha-covid-deaths/articleshow/89126336.cms||---

Attendance in primary sections has been worrying education officers. “Primary schools are saying parental consent is difficult. We have found that schools are not taking the effort to instil confidence in parents to send their children to physical schools,” said an education officer. Classes 1-4 had briefly reopened in mid-December. With schools restarting after being shut since early January, less than 40% students are making it offline. Schools are under pressure to raise offline attendance by the first week of February. Schools are in talks with bus operators as that is a stumbling block in students making it to in-person learning. “Only 27 of my 64 students have got parental consent to attend offline. We start school from February 1 by which time I have to get more students,” said a class 4 teacher of a Malad school. Officers from the education department have started visiting schools to take stock of students attending offline. “Some parents have complained that despite giving offline consent schools have not got back on when physical classes will resume,” said the official. Schools have been told to start offline irrespective of the number of students.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Contact tracing takes a hit as Omicron cases spiral||MUMBAI: The city’s contact tracing program wound down to a phone-call based system from door-to-door visits as the massive Omicron-driven third wave swamped civic teams with an exponential rise in cases. Experts say with coronavirus increasing its spread rapidly in a short period, contact tracing was no longer as relevant nor as practicable. In January, barely two-three contacts were traced per positive patient. An analysis of civic numbers revealed that contact tracing ratio dropped as daily cases gradually mounted to five digits. From January 6 to January 8, when Mumbai reported more than 20,000 cases every day, less than two contacts were traced per positive case. The ratio, though, has improved in the past few days as cases dip. According to the norms, teams are supposed to trace 15 high and low risk contacts for every patient. “However, it was impossible to visit all positive households, screen and prepare reports by evening when there were so many of them. Hence, we contacted most on phone, took details of their conditions and checked if family members have symptoms,” said Vedika Samjiskar, a health volunteer posted with a south Mumbai ward. The BMC’s epidemiology cell gets a list of positive patients, which is shared with all 24 wards. In each ward, there are dozens of health posts whose staffers do contact tracing. In January, each post suddenly had 90-120 cases to track daily, spiralling up from 7-10 in December. Contract tracing involves visiting the patient’s home, screening high-risk contacts and inquiring about low-risk contacts, which can be neighbours, colleagues, etc. In the current wave, low risk contacts were taken out of the equation, said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical officer of L ward, who added that screening was mainly restricted to immediate family members, unlike previous waves when neighbours were also checked. Other ward officials admitted that contract tracing was hit. Dr Mahendra Khandade of N ward (Ghatkopar) said they received 500-600 positive cases daily at the peak of the third wave. “Besides an enormous load on the system for ten days, many civic health workers contracted Covid, which shrunk the workforce,” he said. Dr Bhupendra Patel, MOH of M west ward, added that they had received up to 700 cases which was too much for a team of 150-odd volunteers to handle. “We kept an eye on households with senior citizens though,” he said. Globally, in cities like New York, positive patients no longer receive a call from health authorities. While in South Africa, UK contact tracing has been relaxed. Epidemiologist Dr C Lahariya said contact tracing at the community level is no longer relevant. “It is done when the pathogen is new, and you want to contain it. At that stage you also need it for the purpose of quarantining. Currently 90% of contacts are asymptomatic, so even if you identify a few, it won’t change or halt the infections,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/contact-tracing-takes-a-hit-as-omicron-cases-spiral/articleshow/89126338.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Mehta also continues as president - South Asia, since India is among the top three priority markets for Unilever, and HUL is a listed entity.On Tuesday, Unilever said it will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct business groups — beauty & well-being, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream. Each group will be fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth, and profit delivery globally.Since the focus is moving away from regions, the need for a COO with P&L responsibility for all markets — a post that was created in 2011 with Harish Manwani as the first COO — now becomes redundant. Nitin Paranjpe, who’s currently the COO of Unilever, will take on a new role as chief transformation officer and chief people officer, wherein he will lead the business transformation and head the HR function. Unilever CEO Alan Jope said, “Our new organisational model has been developed over the last year and is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business. Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this.”An HUL spokesperson said, “We will continue to leverage this organisation structure to serve our consumers and customers even better. Changes, if any, will be announced in due course.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mehta-retains-top-position-at-hul-as-unilever-rejigs-business-model/articleshow/89126340.cms||---

However, traders were keeping their fingers crossed as the US markets continued to slide later in the evening. The Indian markets are closed on Wednesday. So, when local markets open on Thursday, traders here will have to account for two trading sessions outside of India.The session started on an extremely bearish note and the sensex dipped to the day’s low, but soon the recovery started. After some volatility, the index finally closed in the green after five sessions of ending deep in the red. Tuesday’s gains came despite a Rs 7,095-crore net selling by foreign funds, while local institutions were net buyers at Rs 4,544 crore.

The current water blockage there is also a CRZ violation, said activist Sunil Agarwal of Save Navi Mumbai Environment group. “Natural tide water flow has been blocked under the pretext of fishing activities. The site never had fishing activities in the past. Flamingos regularly use this place to congregate and feed. However, the so-called fishermen are chasing the flamingos away and are disturbing the wildlife,” added Agarwal. Activist B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation said they have already written to the chief minister’s office (CMO) and also the forest department, besides other agencies, in order to save this bird-rich wetland area. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray promptly replied to our email, and directed the environment secretary and urban department secretary to look into this serious issue. The flamingos come here every winter; so it is unfair and illegal that the tidal water flow has been tampered with,” said Kumar. “It is high time the NMMC started seriously working on saving flamingo habitats if its chasing the Flamingo City dream,” Kumar said in his mail to the chief minister and NMMC commissioner amid recurrent blocking of tidal water flow into the wetlands. The state’s mangrove cell, too, evinced interest to conserve the two wetlands — along with Belpada, Bhendkhal and Panje wetlands of Uran — as per a BNHS plan to maintain them under the Thane Creek Flamingo Satellite Sanctuary project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/tidal-water-flow-to-nerul-wetland-blocked-again/articleshow/89126344.cms||Vijay Singh

The Uran Municipal Council (UMC), which was at the receiving end for dumping garbage on mangroves and wetland at Bori Pakhadi, has initiated the process of bio-mining — scientific closure of a dumping ground. The garbage hill in Uran has been in existence for 14 years now. A private firm has been given the contract for separating wet garbage for compost and the rest for scientific disposal. UMC is spending around Rs 10.45 lakh to complete the project within 90 days.“The entire area will be properly levelled and handed over to the forest department for conserving the mangroves. In accordance with the high court directive, we have started the bio-mining project from December 10. The work will be finished by March. Meanwhile, the dumping is being done at Ghot-Chal in Taloja, a dump yard developed by Cidco. Though it’s located far off from Uran, we have no problem transporting the trash. Moreover, the government will soon provide us with electric vehicles to carry the solid waste,” said UMC chief officer Santosh Mali. Appreciating the environment-friendly process, NatConnect Foundation director B N Kumar said the Uran garbage issue is now an ideal case study material for urban planners in dealing with garbage. The residents ran from pillar to post to get rid of the problem. Local residents and environmentalists have won the prolonged battle that culminated in a series of strictures from the high court that took up a writ petition filed by the Shri Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Sanstha Maryadit last month. Hanuman Koliwada, a resettlement of a displaced fishing community from Sheva, is in the vicinity of the garbage dump at Bori Pakhadi which, too, has been posing health hazards.“We have set up 24x7 security at the Bori Pakhadi site and installed CCTV cameras to keep tight vigil,” Mali said, and explained that the INS Karanja contractors were caught red-handed and warned against dumping garbage here. Bori Pakhadi residents, who had to brave the suffocating smoke from frequent fires at the dump apart from the stink and insect menace, now heaved a sigh of relief. “The 14-year-long fight for justice is over now,” said Samir Ashrit who, along with Yuva Uran platform, spearheaded the campaign.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/civic-body-begins-bio-mining-of-garbage-mound-on-uran-mangroves-post-hc-rap/articleshow/89126345.cms||---

After opening of the commercial bid documents recently, the Tata Group was found to be the lowest bidder and the CCTV surveillance project has been finalised at Rs 127.63 crore. According to NMMC sources, the installation work will be completed within the next nine months. The maintenance cost for five years has been included in the bid. The proposal to have 1,400 CCTV cameras was mooted five years ago.NMMC is going to save Rs 26 crore now as the estimated cost was Rs 154 crore. With the latest development, residents are happy that Tata will deliver the quality. “We have accepted Tata’s offer being the lowest bidder during the retendering process. We are in the process of issuing the work order which will be placed in the next 15 days which will follow the commencement of the installation. The agency is ready to complete the work in 9 months. NMMC is going to spend the money from its own coffer. The cameras will be fixed majorly in open spaces which will help in controlling crime,” said NMMC city engineer Sanjay Desai.The proposal to have 1, 400 CCTV cameras was mooted five years ago and the earlier lowest offer of Rs 271 crore, against the estimated budget of Rs 154 crore, was rejected last year which forced the civic body to recall the tender. It may be recalled that, NMMC had installed 282 CCTV cameras in 2009-10 at a cost of Rs 18 crore for the safety and security of the citizens after the terrorist attack in Mumbai. Over the years, a few cameras were found to be defunct which necessitated the commissioning of new cameras. The city police, NMMC officials and local representatives prepared a list of around 1, 400 cameras needed to cover key locations in the city following a joint survey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/nmmc-set-to-install-1400-cctv-cameras-across-city/articleshow/89126346.cms||---

As per the FIR by constable Prashant Karkhele of the cyber crime cell, the National Crime Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, Delhi, had sent a confidential ‘tipline’ about child pornography/rape/gangrape/obscene content through NCMEC to Maharashtra special DGP-cum-nodal officer of NCCRP (National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal). The report then reached joint commissioner of police, western region, Bandra, who overviewed the tipline and remarked that the tipline has child pornography content. Since, the tipline’s SDR (Subscriber Detail Record) was found to be from Navi Mumbai police commissionerate, a letter was sent to the Navi Mumbai cyber crime cell, directing it to register a case and conduct inquiry. During investigation, the Navi Mumbai cyber crime cell found that the user of the Instagram account had used a mobile for uploading a minor boy’s obscene video on August 6, 2020. Two files were uploaded with child pornography. The mobile service provider gave the accused man’s name and address after which an FIR was registered against him on January 21.Anil Patil, senior inspector of CBD-Belapur, said, “A constable was sent to the accused man’s residence in Agroli village. But, he does not reside there. He might have submitted fake documents.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/belapur-man-booked-for-uploading-child-porn-clips-on-insta/articleshow/89126347.cms||---

The three accused, who posed as officials of a finance company, conned the transporter by making him transfer the money as processing fees. As per the FIR filed by transporter Sitaram Satpute (51), the three accused — Vishal Patil, Navin Joshi and Snehal Rajput — had connived by posing as employees of a finance company and offered him a loan against policy. When Satpute said he needed Rs 25 lakh as home loan, the fraudsters asked him to make an NEFT payment of Rs 2.50 lakh as processing fees, and later, an additional Rs 3.75 lakh as 15% processing fees. On January 1, when they again demanded Rs 4.50 lakh as 18% GST, Satpute realised he was being cheated and told them to refund Rs 6.50 lakh he had already paid. The fraudsters, however, had switched off their mobiles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/man-seeking-25l-home-loan-loses-6-5l-to-cyberfrauds/articleshow/89126348.cms||---

The temple has already hogged headlines as the Election Commission rescheduled Punjab polling date from February 14 to February 20 as lakhs of devotees come to pay obeisance on Ravidas Jayanti and would not have been able to cast their votes. The temple in Seer Gowardhanpur is, meanwhile, being readied for grand celebrations on February 16 amid Covid protocol. The temple trust says it has not invited any politician this time, but a ‘good’ footfall is likely again — like before the 2019 general elections. Shri Guru Ravidas Janam Asthan Charitable Trust’s Kishanlal Saroa and temple manager Ranvir Singh said, “Trust chairman Sant Niranjan Das will arrive in a special train with pilgrims on February 14 after which Ravidas Jayanti celebrations will start. As international flights are still cancelled, no NRI follower will be there.” “Since the model code of conduct is in place, we have not invited any politician, though they are free to come and offer prayers voluntarily,” Saroa added. A tent city comes up near the temple every year to accommodate the pilgrims. DM Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “Just as in Magh Mela at Prayagraj, tent city has been permitted for Ravidas Jayanti. It will have capacity of accommodating 30,000 persons but only 15,000 will be allowed due to Covid norms.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-poll-season-a-temple-run-no-party-can-skip/articleshow/89126269.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: No need for Covid-negative certificate to return to work, says BBMP||BENGALURU: The BBMP on Tuesday clarified that employees who are returning to office after completing scheduled home isolation period need not carry or produce a Covid-negative certificate, reports Nithya Mandyam. The clarification comes following complaints that some BBMP primary health centres were demanding bribe to issue a Covid-negative certificate so that employees could report to work. Sources said Pushpa (name changed), a 33-year-old contract employee at a private firm in Bidadi, visited the BBMP health centre at Kengeri on Monday, seeking a letter on completion of home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 infection. Her employer had insisted on the letter to let her rejoin work. The staff allegedly demanded Rs 250 and gave the letter only after she paid Rs 100. She was made to wait for an hour for this, and officials gave her a mouthful for questioning the bribe. After learning about the incident, BBMP has requested private firms not to insist on the certificate as it is redundant since an infected person has completed a weeklong home-isolation and is free from symptoms. BBMP special commissioner (health) Dr KV Thrilok Chandra told TOI on Tuesday that the only condition is that the person should not have symptoms and must follow Covid protocols. With nearly 25% of those tested in Bengaluru testing positive, many firms are reporting large-scale absenteeism. During the first and second waves of Covid-19, many sectors made it mandatory for employees to get a negative certificate to rejoin work. "The viral load does not clear off within seven days of isolation. In some cases, it might stay longer. That, however, does not mean they are a threat to society," said a senior doctor from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. BBMP health officer Dr AS Balasundar said: "Since symptoms during the third wave have been milder, many people preferred home isolation. It is not just one person testing positive. The whole family is getting infected. Hence, home isolation is ideal in such cases." Samyuktha Sreenivas K, an analyst at a start-up, said her office demanded a negative report to return to work though she was away for only two days. "When I turned positive, I showed no symptoms except a mild cold. But it might take more than a week to vanish. It would be challenging to test again and get a report," she said, welcoming BBMP's clarification. "We are already losing one week's work due to home isolation. If we have to get a negative certificate to get back to work, it would be difficult. Sometimes we might feel healthy, but there could be fatigue and reports might show us positive," said Paramesha Lingaiah, a garment factory worker, in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. Data accessed by TOI said nearly 1.6 lakh active home isolation cases have been recorded in the past week and 97,000 home-isolation kits have been distributed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmp-no-need-for-ve-cert-to-return-to-work/articleshow/89126354.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Special facilities for inmates at Bengaluru jail under lens||BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said he has sought a report from the DGP (prisons) on prisoners at Bengaluru Central Jail enjoying special facilities illegally and promised strict action against those responsible for the lapse. Recently, a video clip showed a rowdy-sheeter enjoying all the comforts of life in jail and this has left netizens fuming. "I'll personally monitor the issue from now on," the CM said. In Shivamogga, home minister Araga Jnanendra said he has ordered a probe into the circumstances in which the rowdy-sheeter got the special facilities. "I'm pained by such incidents. I won't sit quiet. I will act and prove that I walk the talk," he said. The minister admitted that such incidents are being reported from prisons for several years despite the home department taking tough surveillance measures. "A couple of months ago, I had held a review meeting with the prison officials and instructed them to curb such practices," he said. He claimed that that officials have informed him that the incident in question took place before he took charge of the home department. Bommai had held the portfolio earlier. The minister said similar complaints have come from his home district Shivamogga. "Regardless of our measures, some miscreants try to break the law. I've instructed senior officials to install jammers to prevent prisoners from making phone calls and restrict entry into the cells where accused in high-profile cases are housed," he said. Replying to a query on alleged corrupt practices during the police sub-inspector's exam and selection, the minister said he will help the candidates get justice. He said some candidates who used Bluetooth devices during the exam have been arrested. "Though there are complaints of irregularities despite my intervention, I've faith in the system and will monitor the process closely," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/spl-facilities-for-inmates-at-bluru-jail-under-lens/articleshow/89126359.cms||---

The participants also took pledge for construction of Ram temples in each village and the people consecrated by Rampanth will be the priests of those temples. Addressing the participants, Kumar said, “The ancestors of tribal people had extended all help to Lord Ram to wage a war against demon king Ravana and defeat him to ensure the rule of dharma in the world.

---||Bengaluru||Marriage promise breach is not IPC Section 420 offence, says Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: Reiterating that breach of promise to marry does not amount to cheating under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, the Karnataka high court has quashed proceedings against a Bengaluru man and his family members. "This court has already held in (the) D Ramesh Sinha vs state of Karnataka that a promise of marriage and breach of contract will not attract the provisions of Sections 417 and 420 of IPC. Such being the case, continuing the proceedings or investigations against the petitioners is abuse of process of law. Therefore, the same is liable to be quashed," Justice K Natarajan observed in his order, while allowing the petition filed by Venkatesh and his family members. According to the case, Venkatesh and a girl were in love with each other for eight years. Later, supported by family, he married another woman. Following this, the girl filed a complaint in May 2020 before the Ramamurthy Nagar police station in Bengaluru, accusing Venkatesh and his family members of cheating and criminal intimidation. The judge has said the Supreme Court, in the SV Palanitkar and others vs State of Bihar case, had held "mere breach of contract cannot give rise to any criminal prosecution for cheating" unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning and the time when the offence is said to have been committed. Further, it was noted that in the KU Prabhu Raj case, the Madras high court had held that breach of promise to marry doesn't constitute an offence under Section 417 or 420 of IPC. "Here, in this case, petitioner (Venkatesh) is said to have promised to marry respondent No. 2 (the girl), but failed to marry her. In view of the judgment of the Supreme Court, respondent No. 2 has failed to make out a case of criminal intention of petitioner No. 1 from the beginning for cheating the complainant. That apart, the (Madras HC) judgment is applicable to the case where the promise of marriage will not attract Section 420 of IPC," Justice Natarajan has observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/marriage-promise-breach-is-not-ipc-section-420-offence-says-hc/articleshow/89126410.cms||---
---||India||Ex-CM Rawat, protege lock horns over Ramnagar seat||DEHRADUN: After Congress fielded former chief minister Harish Rawat from Nainital’s Ramnagar constituency, the party’s working president Ranjit Rawat, who had contested from the seat in 2017 but lost to BJP and was expecting the ticket this time, expressed his displeasure over the development. Ranjit once considered Harish a mentor, but during a media interaction on Tuesday, the former said the man who had once encouraged him to contest from Ramnagar had now taken the seat himself. For over three decades, Harish and Ranjit shared a close bond. Ranjit was a trusted loyalist of Harish, and the former called the latter his mentor and political guru. Things became sour during the 2016 political upheaval, when 10 Congress MLAs rebelled, reducing the then Congress government to a minority and paving the way for BJP to come to power the next year. Ranjit was not among the 10 rebel MLAs, but differences arose between him and Harish and the two parted ways soon. Political pundits commented that though Ranjit drifted to the “Pritam Singh camp”, the differences were eventually over between the two leaders. However, on Monday, Ramnagar constituency became a bone of contention between them. Ranjit Rawat had won from Salt constituency (neighboring Ramnagar) in 2002 and 2007. In 2012, he lost from Salt and shifted to Ramnagar, where he lost again in 2017. Insiders said Ranjit had “focused” on the constituency for close to a decade and stood a good chance of winning this time. It came as a shock to some when Harish was given the ticket from Ramnagar on Monday. There are talks that Ranjit, who was recently made one of Congress’s four working presidents, would be given a ticket from Salt, but some sources say he might fight as an independent from Ramanagar. “I was told that I will be getting the ticket but it has gone to someone else. What is interesting is that the very person who had advised me to shift to Ramnagar is now interested in contesting from the seat himself. The choice of candidates in many seats is shocking, and several workers have revolted against the party. If you uproot a tree from a place and replace it with a sapling, it may not yield good results,” Ranjit said during a media interaction on Tuesday. Harish Rawat said he had strong reasons to contest from Ramnagar, as he is a native of the area and had attended school here.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-cm-rawat-protege-lock-horns-over-ramnagar-seat/articleshow/89126412.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Padma Bhushan for Ellas, the couple behind desi Covid jab Covaxin||HYDERABAD: In a validation of the role Covaxin has played in battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Bharat Biotech's founding duo Dr Krishna Ella and his wife Suchitra Ella were conferred the Padma Bhushan on Tuesday. In the 68 years since the Padma awards were instituted, this is a rare instance when a husband-wife duo has been honoured together with the third highest civilian award of the country. While Dr Krishna Ella (66) drives the innovation at Bharat Biotech, Suchitra Ella (57) steers the operational and commercial aspects of the Hyderabad-based company. Suchitra Ella, as insiders point out, refers to herself as the heart and her husband as the brains behind Bharat Biotech. The award is being seen as a culmination of the thrilling yet stressful roller-coaster ride that developing India's first Covid-19 vaccine from scratch has proved for the couple that set up Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad in 1996.  In fact, Krishna Ella had told TOI in an exclusive interview recently that the many hair-raising twists and turns in Covaxin's journey robbed him of a 10 good years of his life in just 18 months. "The past 18 months were a tough time. The way I battled I have not battled so much in the last 25 years (since he set up Bharat Biotech)," Ella had told TOI, referring to intense scrutiny the couple were subjected to ever since his company began developing Covaxin in April 2020. Less than two years after Bharat Biotech began developing Covaxin, over 22.75 crore doses have been administered to those aged 15 years and above in India, not to forget exports of millions of doses to over 25 countries. Covaxin was also the first Covid-19 vaccine to be tested on children as young as 2 years old but has so far been approved only for the 15-18 years age bracket. It has also applied to the Indian drug regulator for full commercial licensure. The Covaxin success story also marks the emergence of India as a serious player to reckon with in the global innovation landscape. The Ellas, who quit cushy jobs in the US and decided to return to India in 1995-95 to chase their entrepreneurial dream with their two children Jalachari (12) and Raches (6), are no longer just content with the success of the inactivated whole virus vaccine Covaxin. Their company is also progressing with the development of an intra-nasal vaccine – BBV154 – that he hopes would be instrumental in bidding Covid-19 adieu if it proves to be successful in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as some of the other nasal vaccine candidates have dropped out of the race. With over 160 patents, Bharat Biotech has over 16 vaccines in its portfolio and employs over 2,600 people.  Apart from Covaxin, the company has developed and successfully launched vaccines like rotavirus vaccine Rotovac, typhoid conjugate vaccine Typbar TCV, even as it is working on vaccines for Zika virus and Chikungunya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bhushan-for-ellas-the-couple-behind-desi-covid-jab-covaxin/articleshow/89126435.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Coach Marco Pezzaiuoli, grappling with a number of Covid cases in the squad, told reporters that his immediate concern is to get a team out for Wednesday’s match. “It’s not the time to see how we will be at the end of the season but to see how we will take on Chennaiyin. The only thing that can stop us from getting into the top-4 would be the Covid-19 disruptions because till now there is no team better than BFC. Even against Goa, we were the better team. It is not easy to come out and play after being in the room for 12 days,” Pezzaiuoli said when asked about his team’s chances of making the playoffs. “We are pressing in all the games and we have a strong mentality. This team is hungry and with strong personalities,” he added. Despite putting up a brave front, Bengaluru would face a tough challenge to stop Chennaiyin, as they have to grapple with injuries as well. "We have a few problems in terms of personnel. Ashique (Kuruniyan) had an injury, Cleiton (Silva) is a question mark after taking a knock on the knee," the Blues' coach said. Chennaiyin, meanwhile, will be keen to avenge their 2-4 defeat against the Blues earlier in the season and take a leap to the top ahead of Hyderabad FC (20 points) having collected 18 points in 12 games. In eighth place, BFC have 14 points and a win will be a big boost with seven matches to go.Result: Mumbai City FC 1 (Jahouh 30-pen) drew NorthEast United FC 1 (Irshad 79).

In the next three months, Isro is targeting to launch five satellite missions involving three rocket launches, which also include the maiden launch of India’s first newly-developed small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV or mini-PSLV) targeted at scaling up launches of small-sized commercial satellites. While giving the timelines of the new launches to space minister Jitendra Singh in Delhi on Tuesday, the Isro chairman mentioned a RISAT-1A satellite launch with PSLV C5-2 rocket scheduled for February, OCEANSAT-3, INS2B and ANAND satellite launches by PSLV C-53 in March and SSLV-D1 launching a microSAT in April. This year, Isro also has the distinction of launching Gsat-21, the first fully-funded satellite of New Space India Ltd (NSIL) that will be owned and operated by the public sector undertaking. This communication satellite will meet direct to home (DTH) application needs of the country. While Risat-1A is a remote sensing satellite that will boost the country's border security, Oceansat-3 is a ocean-observation satellite and INS2B is a satellite belonging to Bhutan developed by a group of Bhutanese engineers trained by Isro. ANAND satellite is the first satellite of Indian startup Pixxel and will become part of Pixxel's Firefly fleet of earth observation satellites, which will help detect, monitor and predict global phenomena in real-time. MicroSAT to be launched by India's first SSLV will be an experimental imaging satellite. Somanath also updated Jitendra Singh about the status of the Gaganyaan programme and said there had been a delay in timeline because of Covid and other constraints “but now things have again fallen back on track and all the systems needed for the first unmanned mission are getting realised”, a statement from the Department of Space said. Before the final manned mission in 2023, Isro is planning to launch two unmanned missions, the second one will carry a ‘vyommitra (humanoid)’, before the final mission involving two or three gagannauts to space for seven days. The minister was also informed that gagannauts have successfully undergone generic space flight training in Russia and now a dedicated ad-hoc centre has also been established at Bengaluru for a specific training for the mission. The preparations for the human mission, said the Isro chairman, involve in-flight demonstration of the crew escape system functioning in lower atmosphere (less than 10km). The exercise recovery of the crew module after impacting in the sea is also being worked out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-set-to-launch-5-satellite-missions-in-3-months/articleshow/89126444.cms||Surendra Singh

When he took over as CM on July 27 last year, replacing Lingayat strongman BS Yediyurappa, many questions were raised about his leadership abilities. However, he is trying hard to firm his grip on the cabinet, administration and the party. After a shake-up in the bureaucracy, the new chief minister has tried to effectively drive officers, as they play a big role in the success of governments, especially in the implementation of ambitious projects of ruling parties and chief ministers. Former CMs Siddaramaiah, BS Yediyurappa and HD Kumaraswamy were considered strong leaders as they had a hold on the bureaucracy. Bommai, who is known to be “astute” in political circles, has been confidently making efforts to dispel this image. A senior minister in Bommai’s cabinet said the bureaucracy is like an uncontrolled horse and you cannot run a successful government if you fail to control the officers. On the political front, Bommai is facing multiple challenges, the biggest of which will be to accommodate “the right person for the right job”, when he rejigs his cabinet and the party organisation. Doing a balancing act while making political appointments in certain boards and commissions will be yet another task. As a close confidant of Yediyurappa, the CM is under pressure to accommodate his younger son BY Vijayendra. While some believe Vijayendra’s entry into the cabinet will help Bommai, many also think it might weaken his leadership as Yediyurappa could look to control the government and the party again through his son. Bommai’s other immediate big challenge is to overcome the financial crisis and present an impressive maiden budget. He also has to revive the economy and livelihood opportunities in the state, which have gone bleak due to the pandemic’s second and third waves. With assembly polls slated for 2023, Bommai will have to present popular schemes and programmes. He will have to announce major packages, especially with regard to water and irrigation in the backdrop of Congress’ Mekedatu padayatra and ensure adequate funds to ramp up infrastructure, mainly in Bengaluru. The CM will have to find an effective counter to Congress campaign seeking implementation of drinking and irrigation projects pertaining to Cauvery, Mahadayi and Krishna. The opposition Congress is planning to turn water into a major election issue in rural parts of Karnataka. The results of BBMP polls, which is expected to be held mid-year, will be crucial for the ruling party to gain momentum ahead of assembly elections. Bommai will have to win the civic polls convincingly to prove his electoral prowess since some within the party are still questioning his leadership capabilities, following a series of poll debacles last year. Asked to comment on the CM’s performance over the last six months, Vishwas Shetty, a political expert said: “So far, more than his political feats, his administrative performance has been a highlight.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/after-6-months-bommai-needs-to-tackle-multiple-challenges/articleshow/89126445.cms||---

Patil was seen as a strong contender for the KPCC president’s post before DK Shivakumar was appointed. Identified as a loyalist of former CM Siddaramaiah, Patil was part of the separate Lingayat religion movement before the 2018 assembly elections and then chose to maintain a distance after Congress was defeated. He now faces a major challenge to put up a united campaign of the faction-ridden party. “I know it’s a big responsibility. With the guidance of senior leaders, I will take all communities and sections together,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mb-patil-to-head-kpcc-campaign-committee/articleshow/89126447.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Cooked-up theft lands 5 of a family, 2 others in soup||BENGALURU: The gang thought it was a surefire way to earn money with a modus operandi involving police. The plan was simple: One member would steal gold ornaments, pledge them with loan companies and raise lakhs of rupees. In the meantime, others would lodge a complaint and also alert police about the person who pledged the gold. While cops would arrest the thief and gloat over having solved the crime, the gang would not only get back their jewellery but also get to keep the loan amount. But the ambitious plan went kaput when police examined the recovered ornaments thoroughly and raised a question. Why would a Hindu family (which lost jewellery) have ornaments that are typical of Muslim households? Their poser blew the lid off a fraud and the cops realised t they were being taken for a ride by the complainant and the thief, who are part of the same gang. Sarjapur police arrested seven people, including five from a family, in this connection. The arrested are: 55-year-old Raviprakash of Devendrapalya in Yeshwantpur, his 30-year-old son Mithun Kumar and daughter-in-law Sangeetha of Chikkabanavara, 26-year-old daughter Asha P and son-in-law Nallu Charan of Sevaganapalli near Hosur in Tamil Nadu, Kumar’s driver Deepak B of Mallasandra and Kumar’s friend Asma of Chikkabanavara. They had pledged 1,250 grams of gold. The entire episode unfolded when Asha filed a theft case on September 19, 2021, alleging that a miscreant had stolen her bag inside an apparel shop in Sarjapur when she and family members were purchasing a sari. She claimed the bag contained Rs 30,000, a mobile phone and gold weighing 1,250 grams.  Asha’s father Raviprakash told police his family used to deck up goddess Lakshmi with ornaments during Varamahalakshmi festival and would wear the same only after puja at a temple in Mysuru. The theft had happened when they were on their way to the temple. Initially, police did not suspect foul play and started probing. A team led by inspector Raghavendra Imrapur identified the thief as Deepak and arrested him in December. Deepak then confessed to the crime and claimed he had pledged the gold ornaments with different financial companies. Police have recovered 500 grams of gold based on his information. But they smelt something fishy when they found some ornament designs were those that are usually worn by Muslim women. Upon interrogation, Deepak spilled the beans.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cooked-up-theft-lands-5-of-a-family-2-others-in-soup/articleshow/89126448.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Fake CBI officer & husband con two job aspirants of Rs 13L||BENGALURU: A woman, who posed as a CBI officer, and her husband have allegedly duped two youths of Rs 13.2 lakh by promising police constable jobs. The accused had also created fake appointment orders in the name of Mysuru City police commissioner Chandragupta. DJ Halli police have registered a case of cheating against the two based on a complaint filed by Naveen Kumar MS, 25, from Shampura Main Road in KG Halli. Kumar alleged that he and his cousin Vijay Kumar paid Rs 13.4 lakh to Keerthana and her husband Suneel Kumar between October 2020 and January 2022 after they promised them jobs with Mysuru city police department. Naveen, a BCom graduate, works as an accountant with a private firm in Kammanahalli. He came to know about the suspects through his mother Meenakshi’s friend. The couple learned that Kumar had applied for government jobs. She met him in police uniform on October 16, 2020, and introduced herself as a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer. His mother had requested her to arrange a job for her nephew Vijay Kumar also. Keerthana had demanded Rs 3 lakh each. She arranged a medical check-up for them at a clinic near Yelahanka and took money from them. Later, the suspects demanded more money and assured Naveen that she would arrange a head constable’s job instead of a police constable. Kumar and his mother agreed to pay them more money. Meanwhile, they demanded additional amount to skip physical examinations for their recruitment. Kumar and Vijay Kumar have paid Rs 13.4 lakh so far. The couple gave Naveen a fake appointment order in which he was told to report for the head constable’s job in Krishnarajapuram police station in Mysuru and the order copy was issued in the name of the police commissioner. Believing it was genuine, Kumar went to Mysuru in July 2021 and came to know that it was a fake letter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fake-cbi-officer-husband-con-two-job-aspirants-of-13l/articleshow/89126450.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Now, renew your driving licence sitting at home||BENGALURU: In a major relief to motorists across the state, driving licence can now be renewed without visiting Regional Transport Offices. The transport department on Monday made four more DL-related services (Sarathi) contactless/faceless. They are: renewal, issuance of duplicate one, change of address and name in licence. With these four new services, 10 DL-related services are now contactless. Services like issuance of learners licence (LL), change of address in LL, DL extract, issuance of duplicate LL, issuance of international driving permit and change of name in LL have been made contactless from November 1, 2021, in the state. Rajender Kumar Kataria, principal secretary, transport department, who was instrumental in making these services contactless, said: “Contactless services like renewal of DL will benefit lakhs of vehicle owners across the state. They can avail these services from the comfort of their home and pay fees online. Very soon, citizens will need to visit RTOs only for driving physical tests and fitness certificate (FC) renewal. All other services will be contactless/faceless,” he said. Kataria said the CM has shown special interest in making these services faceless. Transport department records show 23.5 lakh applicants across the state availed LL in 2019-20 and 17.7 lakh in 2020-21. Similarly, 6.9 lakh applied for renewal of DL in 2019-20 and 6.2 lakh in 2020-21. Officials said those who want to avail faceless services will have to authenticate with Aadhaar-based e-KYC (paperless offline verification). At present, six vehicle-related services (Vahan) have been made contactless — change of address in registration certificate, composite fee for national transport permits, hypothecation addition, hypothecation continuation, issue of duplicate RC and issue of NOC. Most still prefer offline modeTransport department records show 1,01,998 applications were received through e-KYC for DL-related services (Sarathi) between November 1, 2021 and January 22, 2022. Of this, 96,985 applications were disposed of. A majority of the applications — 1,01,444 — were for LL. However, most Sarathi applicants are still using offline mode (non-e-KYC). A total of 1.5 lakh applications were received through non-e-KYC during the same period. It’s the same for Vahan services as well. While Vahan portal received only 2,460 applications through contactless mode, RTOs got 74,226 applications through offline mode between November 1, 2021 and January 22, 2022. Besides tackling corruption and touts at RTOs, contactless services are also aimed at reducing crowding during the pandemic. However, some motorists said few RTOs still reject applications citing small errors. “Some officials insist on visiting RTOs for reasons best known to them. These contactless services are a good move, but they should be monitored at a higher level to ensure people get these benefits without having to pay bribe or facing delays,” said a motorist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/now-renew-your-driving-licence-sitting-at-home/articleshow/89126453.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The boy successfully underwent the operation and doctors too were optimistic about his recovery. But fate took a cruel turn on Tuesday afternoon when his condition deteriorated and he passed away. Rahul underwent a surgery for a fractured leg and a rod was fitted on January 18. A report in TOI — Covid, mishap push bedridden boy’s family to the brink — on January 22 detailed Rahul’s condition and his family’s financial constraints and how the surgery would cost them Rs 1.1 lakh. Several TOI readers responded by helping the family with money and wishing the child a speedy recovery. Rahul’s father Dalpath told the reporter that the surgery was successful and Rahul was discharged on January 23. However, on Tuesday, when the reporter called to check on Rahul’s health, an inconsolable Dalpath said: “He stopped eating on Monday night. I rushed to get our doctor on Tuesday morning, who assured me that we had looked after Rahul for 14 years and nothing would happen to him now. But by 1pm, we lost him.” “I cannot thank everyone enough for their help. I got new confidence and hope when I began getting innumerable calls from people following the TOI report and received around Rs 3 lakh via Google Pay and account transfers. The surgery and medicines cost us Rs 2,00,000 and we had planned to keep the remaining amount aside for Rahul’s post-surgery care,” he said. Rahul’s sudden death has left the family broken, but Dalpath says his hope in humanity has only grown. “I could not imagine that we would receive help so quickly. But just when everything looked better, our world has crashed,” he said. A doctor, who had followed Rahul’s reports and surgery said the boy had battled hard with cerebral palsy and epileptic fits. “Any kind of surgery or procedure in such cases is always risky. The family did not have enough resources to provide him required specialised care earlier and he was already malnourished,” she said, adding that in spite of their financial condition and Rahul remaining bedridden, the family had gone to great lengths for his health. Rahul’s family spent over Rs 15 lakh on his treatment since his birth and Dalpath was even forced to sell his shop to meet medical expenses. He now earns Rs 10,000 a month working as a shop helper in Electronics City.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengalureans-donate-generously-for-treatment-but-teen-loses-lifes-battle/articleshow/89126455.cms||Farheen Hussain

TOI had published an article — Auto driver returns Rs 10k he got through wrong UPI transfer — highlighting the driver’s noble gesture. Calling it a circle of ‘good karma’, Saina Jayapal, a communications consultant, who initiated the drive to help Gopi, said she was touched by the auto driver’s statement recognising hard-earned money. “He mentioned that he was facing financial troubles at home, but was mindful of each one’s money being a product of their labour. That moved me,” Jayapal added. Jayapal posted a story on her Instagram profile expressing her desire to help Gopi and offer him some monetary respite. She said that in no time she received messages from friends and several strangers, who were willing to help. “From the article in TOI, I felt that the man was honest and hopeful. As you know, what goes around comes around. So, some good karma should come to him,” she added. Around 20 people donated money to Gopi via his UPI ID and he is likely to have got over Rs 10,000. Most donors said Gopi’s genuineness touched them. “He acknowledged that others work hard for their livelihood just as he does, and that stuck with me,” said a donor.An overwhelmed Gopi said his family and he felt blessed. “We are all speechless and don’t know how to thank the donors for their thoughtfulness and compassion. This makes us believe that there is God,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/help-pours-in-for-driver-who-returned-10k-to-passenger/articleshow/89126456.cms||Sanika Athavale

---||Bengaluru||Zuccarelli set for Derby riches||Bengaluru: After Covid-19 consumed the summer Derby at the Bangalore Turf Club last year, blue riband racing returns to the venue with the Kingfisher Ultra Bangalore Derby, to be run over 2400m here on Wednesday. While pandemic-related protocols are bound to dampen the festivity surrounding the winter extravaganza that offers a total prize money of Rs. 1.39 crore, the fact that three southern derbies have been scheduled in the span of five days has robbed the field of numbers.In normal course, a dozen of the finest in the country line up for the event but with the Bengaluru fixture followed closely by the Chennai (Jan 28) and Hyderabad (Jan 30) derby, the showpiece here will be a seven-horse affair. The Pesi Shroff-trained Zuccarelli, a classic winner, is tipped to be the one to beat in a contest which has two other classic winners — Eternal Blaze and Angelico. Shroff, who has a long-standing association with the city, having been a champion jockey for decades, knows the course like the back of his hand. Speaking about Zuccarelli’s chances, he said, “He hasn't run a mile-and-half yet. I think he will run a good race and has a good chance as well.”Shroff added: “I have great memories of racing here and hope it continues.” Zuccarelli will be piloted by seasoned jockey Trevor Patel. The main threat to Zuccarelli is from Eternal Blaze, winner of the Bangalore 1000 Guineas (grade 2). Eternal Blaze, from the stables of the seasoned S Ganapathy, will be ridden by CS Jodha.Given the compact fray, Ganapathy termed the event as an open race. “I personally feel Eternal Blaze also has a chance. Last time was a disappointment, but now he is doing well,” he added.Another title contender is the Neil Darashah-schooled Etosha, who will be ridden by Sandesh. Also in the Derby fray is Angelico, who is trained by champion jockey Sulaiman Attaollahi. The Padmanabhan-trained Douglas, competing in the upper division of the Totalizator Cup, looks outstanding and is considered as the day's best betting proposition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/zuccarelli-set-for-derby-riches/articleshow/89126459.cms||---

Among the top 1000 rank holders in the MBBS merit list for government quota seats released on Monday, 579 are CBSE students, 27 from other boards such as ISCE and 394 from the state board, according to the data provided by the directorate of medical education. This means that a majority of seats from top government colleges including Madras Medical College (MMC), Stanley Medical College, Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) would go to CBSE students this year. However, among the applicants, state board students constitute 64% while CBSE students account for 34% and other board students add up to 2%. "It will give a huge advantage to CBSE students in admission to top colleges as students within top 1000 ranks join colleges like MMC, KMC, Stanley Medical College, Madurai Medical College and Coimbatore Medical College," said Manickavel Arumugam, a students counsellor. After reducing all-India quota seats and 7.5% seats reserved for government school students, MMC has 197 seats, KMC has 117 seats while Stanley Medical College has 196. "CBSE students are better prepared and their exam pattern encourages them to score more in NEET. State board students are yet to come out of the fear of entrance exams. Teachers should give them confidence and change their mindset. Syllabus revision for state board is also yet to reflect on NEET scores," he added. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said state board students lack access to proper coaching compared to CBSE students.  "State board students are finding it difficult despite the improved syllabus. CBSE students are financially well-off and can afford better coaching and getting better marks," he said. He said the merit list is dominated by repeaters as few current batch students are scoring high marks. P B Prince Gajendrababu, general secretary of State Platform for Common School System, said the issue is not with the syllabus. "Even a CBSE student is writing the exam only after going through the NEET coaching. Many students are also giving multiple attempts in NEET.

The first bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu observed that the court could not interfere in the issue at the eleventh hour. According to P Babu, a practising lawyer, the decision of the ministry not to permit tableau of Tamil Nadu affects the sentiments of the people of the state. “The decision shows that the authorities ridicule and underestimate the Tamil freedom fighters’ contribution in the Indian independence. Without the participation of Tamil freedom fighters, India would not have got its freedom,” he said. The exclusion at the last minute is an arbitrary exercise of powers vested with the defence ministry, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-junks-pil-on-rejection-of-tamil-nadus-r-day-tableau/articleshow/89126461.cms||---

It, however, directed the SEC to ensure strict adherence of Covid-19 guidelines framed by it for the conduct of the elections. The bench also wondered as to why none of the petitioners had approached the Supreme Court which had already seized of the issue. “A circular on protocols to be followed from nomination to declaration of the elections has been released by SEC. The guidelines issued do not compromise the public health of Tamil Nadu voters,” the court said. Earlier, senior advocate S Prabakaran who represented a doctor petitioner alleged the SEC has not consulted the government about the prevailing pandemic situations. It is a statutory requirement under the municipal law, he added. Representing another petitioner, senior advocate A R L Sundaresan contended that as the SEC had not conducted the elections for the past five years there should not be any impediment for it to defer the elections for another 2-3 months considering the threat of the pandemic. Refusing to concur, the court said, “Failure in conduct of polls does not mean it can be replicated or continued.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-refuses-to-defer-civic-polls-asks-sec-to-follow-covid-norms/articleshow/89126463.cms||---

He also urged them to introduce new courses on emerging areas such as data science, cyber security, artificial intelligence, social engineering, digital marketing, behaviour economics and game theory. "All the new courses and degrees in foreign countries should be introduced in Tamil Nadu colleges and universities," he said.

So, authorities issued a notice to the contractor.Again, on January 20, complaints started to pour in. This time, the public had complained about unhygienic surroundings, unclean kitchens along with prices. Once again, notices were issued but there was no proper response from Star Associates Salem.So, TNSTC, Villupuram inspected the eatery on Tuesday and confirmed the violations. So, officials barred all government buses from halting at Mamandur dhaba, said RS Rajakannapan, state transport minister. He has directed his subordinates to issue fresh licences to another accredited contractor. Following this, Rajakannapamn has warned all the other government-run dhabas in the state to ensure that quality food was sold at a reasonable rate, failing which their licences will also be suspended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/licence-of-mamandur-highway-eatery-is-suspended/articleshow/89126466.cms||---

He also emphasised on improving the quality of education in government schools and restoring the once-enviable reputation of universities. In his Republic Day address on Tuesday, Ravi underscored the importance of Tamil language, and added: "It is also important that our school students learn other Indian languages like students in other states. Depriving our students of knowledge of other Indian languages is unfair to all. Besides fostering brotherliness and better mutual appreciation, a linguistic intellectual and cultural cross-pollination will enrich all of us and also open several opportunities for our harmonious growth,” he added. Pointing out that improving the quality of education in government schools is the crying need of the time, he said, the negative differential in the educational outputs between the government and private schools is worrisome. "Before the introduction of NEET, the share of students from government schools to the seats in government medical colleges was hardly 1%. Thanks to the affirmative action of 7.5% reservation for Government school students that the number has improved significantly. However, there is urgent need to improve the quality of education also in the Government schools," Ravi said. “In higher education too, we must work hard to restore the once enviable reputation of our universities,” he added. Governor also paid rich tributes to freedom fighters from Tamil Nadu including Veeramangai Velu Nachiyar, Veerapandia Kattabomman, V.O.Chidambaram Pillai and Mahakavi Subramania Bharathi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/school-students-in-tn-must-learn-other-indian-languages-says-guv-ravi/articleshow/89126467.cms||---

I am unable to see a brave AIADMK talking in the assembly with spine and manliness.” The AIADMK was quick to retort, asking Nagendran to prove his “manliness” by resigning his seat and winning on his own without his ally’s support. Nagendran made the provocative statement while speaking at a protest organised by his party to demand justice for Thanjavur schoolgirl Lavanya, who, according to the BJP, ended her life after she was pressured to convert to Christianity. BJP state president K Annamalai was present too.The AIADMK shot back with its own stinging remarks but reiterating Nagendran’s sexist reference. “Manliness is not a word but an act,” said AIADMK IT wing secretary for Madurai zone V V R Raj Satyen in a tweet. He dared ‘Annan’ (elder) brother Nainar Nagendran to resign his MLA seat which he won by clinging to the AIADMK and emerge victorious on his own and prove his manliness.” Following the strong backlash, Nagendran, later in the evening, tweeted, “My remarks about AIADMK at the Valluvar Kottam protest have been misunderstood. There is no motive. The protest had been organised to fight for justice for student Lavanya.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/aiadmk-lacks-spine-manliness-in-assembly-bjp-mla/articleshow/89126469.cms||---

---||Chennai||Automobile industry’s semiconductor crisis is exacerbated by use of older generation chips||Chennai: Is the auto industry’s chip crisis exacerbated by the fact that vehicle makers and their parts’ suppliers use legacy mode older generation chips that are even lower on the priority list of chip makers globally? According to auto industry insiders, that is one of the reasons why older bestselling cars and SUVs and even two wheelers are facing such a crippling supply shortage of semiconductor chips.“Over 30% of the chips used in India are older generation and since the auto industry is lower down the pecking order when it comes to chip consumption, the chip industry has not been focusing on these older generation chips.” Auto OEMs, he added, have not moved from “legacy to other modes particularly in some of the older best selling models. The new launches use newer generation chips where the supply constraint will slowly ease out. But the problem will persist with older models,” said Hemal Thakkar, director, Crisil Research.Auto parts’ makers are also feeling the legacy pinch in this regard. “The generation of chips that the auto industry uses is five years behind smart phones and consumer durables. Hence in supply terms, it is even lower down the pecking order of priority,” said Vikram Mohan, MD, Pricol. Pricol, he added, is addressing this problem by “onboarding new chips and getting OEMs to homologate,” because the “cost impact is minimal — $2-$3 per vehicle.” The consumer electronic industry in India is also facing something similar with older-generation products that use legacy mode chips. “In India, air conditioners don’t use too many chips and with supply chains impacted, we now need to order nine months to a year in advance,” said Gurmeet Singh, CMD, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India.What’s worse, the chip shortage, which has so far been very acute in passenger vehicles, is not getting sorted out in a hurry and is now spilling over to two wheelers too. “This current crisis will take till June-July to be sorted out,” said Thakkar. In two wheelers, which use less chips than PVs, there is a “blood bath” said Mohan. “There is a 54-58 week delivery time wait and we are selling 30% less than we normally do to this segment.” Normalcy, he added, is not likely before September this year.Auto parts makers embed chips in their sub-assemblies like light or dashboard clusters. “There is a $2 chip in a light or dashboard cluster, but if it is not available the vehicle cannot be made,” said Mohan. Even global parts majors with dedicated chip sourcing have taken a hit on their Indian supplies. “Imports of Bosch is anticipated to be impacted leading to reduced ability to deliver to Indian OEMs. This is a structural challenge in terms of overall capacity in semiconductors and it will be a medium to long term challenge,” said Sandeep N, executive director and head of sales — mobility solutions, Bosch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/automobile-industrys-semiconductor-crisis-is-exacerbated-by-use-of-older-generation-chips/articleshow/89126472.cms||---

Of these, 12 were in Tondiarpet and the remaining in Teynampet zone. In another 12 locations in Tondiarpet, water didn’t have residual cholrine as mandated by the health department. As per the recent data available, between January 1 and January 19, 2022, the civic body lifted 356 water samples. In those, 17 contained E-Coli and in in Tondiarpet, Royapuram sewage contamination was found in 12 places. As 30 other locations had sewage overflow, they were referred to the Chennai Metrowater and Sewerage Board for rectification. The civic body’s sanitary officers collect these samples every week from pumping stations, water lorries both private and public, public fountains in main roads and also in tail-end areas near residences in various locations. It is also collected from restaurants, marriage halls, community centres, gyms and other commercial establishments. There are more than 17,000 public fountains in the city and 2,000 of them are in core residential areas. More than 4,500 water tankers supply water of which about 500 belong to metro water. Metrowater supplies about 895MLD every day and piped connection is given to 8 lakh houses. “We lift samples randomly but also when we get more complaints of diarrhoea cases from from public health centres in specific areas,” said additional city health officer, S Mahalakshmi. She added that the contamination is usually higher post floods and in populous areas or where pipelines are old. R Ulaganathan, a retired Metrowater official, said a major project on leak detection of water supply system was done 20 years ago, and could be undertaken again to study the reasons for the contamination. A Metrowater official said the agency was planning a zone-wise comprehensive water distribution in the core areas where the water pipelines were 30-50 years old.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/e-coli-found-in-drinking-water-samples/articleshow/89126475.cms||Komal Gautham

On Tuesday, after the intervention of Chengalpet collector Rahul Nath, the president held a meeting and informed the residents the NGO would get another plot to construct anganwadi and tuition centre. Construction of the two structures was begun seven months ago by Deepa Uma Shankar, a local NGO worker, with funds from Networking and Development Centre for Service Organisations. Due to floods and Covid, the project was delayed. It restarted recently but was stopped before Pongal by newly elected president N Nithyanandam. The president told TOI all he wanted was that he be informed about everything that happened at the village. “How can they not inform me,” he asked. Told that he had permitted the project, he said that as president he should know who entered and left the village. Deepa told TOI she had never faced any issues. “It is mere ego. I had met him [the president] and he gave a no-objection certificate to the project.

Installation of lights and laying of an approach road are expected to be over in a week. A senior official from the state highways department said the 2.06km-long flyover, covering the key junctions of Sholinganallur, Mambakkam and Madipakkam, will greatly reduce congestion on Tambaram-Velacherry road. On an average, 1.25 lakh motorists use the stretch daily. “With the completion of this flyover, those heading to Velachery from Tambaram area can reach their destination without delay,” he said. Construction of the flyover began in 2015, but was halted about a year later. Agreement with the then contractor was terminated and work awarded to a new one, who resumed the construction in 2018. The Madipakkam-Tambaram road now has two flyovers. The first was built to ease traffic flow from Medavakkam to Nanmangalam, for vehicles heading to Tambaram and beyond. The second was built to connect Tambaram with Velacherry (via Medavakkam). The construction of the first flyover faced a two-year delay. It was finally inaugurated in February last. As for the second, the delay was three years, said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/seven-year-feat-citys-longest-flyover-nears-completion/articleshow/89126479.cms||P Oppili

The single judge had also imposed Rs 1 lakh cost on the actor for delaying payment of the tax even after the Supreme Court confirmed the powers of the state in imposing the tax. Allowing an appeal moved by Vijay, the bench said to impute motives to a litigant or castigating him for taking a particular legal position or exercising his constitutional right is unwarranted. Noting that the observations of the single judge, apart from being unwarranted, are irrelevant to decide the issue, the bench expunged six paragraphs containing the observations from the order dated July 8, 2021. While moving the appeal, the actor informed the court that he had no quarrel either over the tax or the fine imposed by the single judge but was aggrieved only by the unjustified observations of the judge. He pointed out that the same judge had even simply dismissed a similar petition moved by an owner of a Rolls Royce Phantom which was double the cost of the car imported by him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/high-court-expunges-harsh-remarks-against-actor-vijay/articleshow/89126480.cms||---
---||Chennai||Covid hits Chennaiyin camp but game on Vs Bengaluru||Chennai: Chennaiyin FC are no longer insulated from Covid-19 with the club’s goalke-eper Vishal Kaith contracting the virus a few days ago. Coa-ch Bozidar Bandovic confir-med the development on Tuesday, the eve of CFC’s match against Bengaluru FC. “Kaith is the only player who has contracted the virus. His reports came on January 22, the day of our last match against NEUFC. Since then, we have been in isolation,” Bandovic told a media conference.The good news for CFC though is that no other player or support staff has tested positive so far and the team was finally able to conduct a training session after being cooped up at their hotel rooms for the last three days. However, the players will be tested again on Wednesday and a call on their participation in the match will be taken if anyone returns positive.On the pitch, CFC and Bandovic were faced with familiar problems of profligacy in their last match against NEUFC. CFC might have won the game 2-1 but the failure of their strikers Nerijus Valskis, Rahim Ali and Lukasz Gikiewicz to score goals has been a constant headache for the coach. “It’s difficult to identify what the problem is. With the games coming thick and fast, we are not getting enough recovery time. So it might have to do with the mentality of the players. After failing to score consistently, the players’ confidence might have taken a hit. It could also be a case of the players’ inability to handle pressure in front of goal. But we need to work together as a team to solve the issue,” Bandovic said.Despite the woes, CFC will start favourites against Bengaluru, a team which has been grappling with multiple Covid cases in the squad and injuries. Coach Marco Pezzaiuoli said his immediate concern is to get a team out for Wednesday’s match. “It’s not the time to see how we will be at the end of the season but to see how we will take on Chennaiyin. The only thing that can stop us from getting into the top-4 would be the Covid-19 disruptions. It is not easy to come out and play after being in the room for 12 days,” Pezzaiuoli said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/covid-hits-chennaiyin-camp-but-game-on-vs-bengaluru/articleshow/89126483.cms||---

Appearing for Sravanthi, senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli that this is one of the 10 cases involving GAIL as a party that Karnatak has decided to raise an inescapable question about grave breach of propriety. The bench lost no time in agreeing with Singhvi and asked, “How can he (Karnatak) hear the matter? It is a question of propriety. He has worked with GAIL for more than three decades. It is a simple case of breach of propriety.” Finding additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain appearing for the PSU, the bench said, “You are the government. If there are vacancies in members and the post of chairman, you appoint them. After they are appointed, such cases should be heard by persons who had no past association with the litigating parties.” The CJI-led bench had taken serious view of the Centre’s lethargy in filling up of posts in tribunals and told the government to wind them up if they cannot appoint their members, technical members and chairpersons, rendering them non-functional. The CJI had lamented that though the selection panels, each headed by a SC judge, had recommended many names, the government was sitting over them. The process of appointments to tribunals had picked up speed after the CJI-led bench’s outburst last month. Finding the same problem of vacancy plaguing the work of APTEL, the CJI on Tuesday said the SC judge-headed panel had recommended names for appointment of the chairperson and members to the electricity appellate tribunal, but it seems the appointments have not yet been made. The bench issued notice to the Centre and attorney general K K Venugopal and asked “let us know when the appointments are being made”. In September, there was a standoff between the SC and the Centre as the latter asserted the right to reject names recommended by SC judge-led panels for appointments to tribunals. But a bench comprising CJI Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao had said that in a democratic country governed by the rule of law under the Constitution, the government cannot say it will not accept these recommendations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-gail-cmd-on-tribunal-bench-in-psu-case-gets-sc-lesson-in-propriety/articleshow/89126499.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This is expected to curb the under-invoicing of the product and smuggling via Myanmar to China. TOI had published a series of reports on human hair smuggling to China and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier conducted searches following TOI expose and booked cases against exporters involved in smuggling. The DGFT notification stated, "The export of human hair, unworked, whether or not washed or scoured, waste of human hair or any other form of raw human hair has been put under restricted category with immediate effect." Human Hair and Hair Products Manufacturers and Exporters Association welcomed the government move, but demanded a total ban in future. Benjamin Cherian, the founding president of the association, told TOI, "It is the first step to deter smugglers and those exporters resorting to under-invoicing. The DGFT notification will make the job of these illegal exporters tough as they have to get a licence following due procedure and scrutiny. However, we are afraid that some unscrupulous elements will still try to find a way. A complete prohibition would help in stopping illegal exports." He added, "India is the world's largest producer of human hair. Eighty per cent of world hair is produced here, but we make only 2% of value-added products such as wigs. The raw material is going to China. We have lost several jobs in the industry so far." The association asked the central government for help in sourcing better technology from Korea. "Bleaching of hair, wig making and other work can add value to the products. Currently, official exports are restricted to Rs 3,000 crore, whereas unofficial smuggling would be much more. Money is coming back via hawala, gold and other means from Myanmar and China," said Cherian. ED probe had revealed that around Rs 16 crore was paid to human hair merchants by Chinese online betting app companies as part of hawala transactions. Two human hair exporting firms based in Hyderabad alone got Rs 3.4 crore from the Chinese companies. TOI investigation had found that Myanmar citizens are permanently stationed in Hyderabad, purchasing human hair locally and then exporting it to Myanmar at under-valued prices. A probe under FEMA revealed that domestic merchants were aggregating and selling raw hair to foreign merchants based in Hyderabad, Guwahati and Kolkata. This was smuggled out by road via Moreh (Manipur), Zokhawthar (Mizoram), Aizawl (Mizoram) to Mandalay (Myanmar). Ultimately, it found its way to China where it was labelled as domestic Chinese hair and processed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dgft-curbs-on-raw-human-hair-exports/articleshow/89126501.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Instead they are in the process of reviving a water body to ensure that they have a ready source of water. As part of reviving the paddy fields, the Amballoor Padasekhara Samithi and the Kazhakootam Krishi Bhavan are reviving a pond named ‘Kottayath pond’ that will supply water to the Kottayathu field which is a part of Amballoor field. The pond is 150 meters away from the field. In order to supply the water efficiently, a channel was made to transport the water from the pond to the field. The land preparation, pond revival and channel works have been finished and the farmers are now ready to sow the seeds after ten days. The works were done by 20 workers from the national rural employment scheme under the leadership of Amballoor Padasekhara Samithi and Paada Samrakshana Samithi. Along with the paddy variety ‘Jyothi’, the Padasekhara Samithi has also decided to cultivate black gram and green gram by dividing the 50 cents of land into three. The Kottayath pond has been abandoned for several years and it was filled with algae and the protection wall was also damaged. According to the officials, these works can be finished within ten days. “The area has been left barren for more than 25 years. Due to illegal land conversion, the water sources were also destroyed. So we had to find another source of water,” said Deepa S, agriculture officer. “During the summer season, the water level always decreases. The decision to revive the pond was taken in order to manage water scarcity in the area. Before three years, there were only 12 acres of paddy and now Amballoor alone has more than 40 acres of paddy cultivation,” said an official from Kazhakootam Krishi Bhavan. “The area was once known for its paddy cultivation and most of those areas were levelled for other purposes. We started retrieving our fields in the past five years. The number of farmers and fields has also increased. At first, the number of farmers was six and now it is 30,” said Shahjahan A, a member of Ambaloor Padasekhara Samithi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/water-scarcity-lead-way-to-revival-of-ponds-for-farming/articleshow/89124431.cms||---

Under the contours of the scheme approved by the government, all the branches of PMC Bank will operate as branches of Unity SFB, a release from the RBI said. Unity SFB “is making necessary arrangements to implement the provisions of the scheme”. The central bank’s release said, “The scheme of amalgamation notified today envisages takeover of the assets and liabilities of PMC Bank, including deposits, by USFBL in terms of the provisions of the scheme.” In September 2019, the RBI had forced out PMC Bank’s board. The central bank’s auditors detected a major fraud in PMC Bank’s books involving real estate firm HDIL. It was found that, for several years, the bank’s top management had used fraudulent accounts to lend to HDIL to fund its real estate projects and thus massively violated RBI’s single-party lending rules. After the fraud was detected and the RBI limited the bank’s operations, there was massive outrage among several of the lender’s customers, some of whom had kept their life’s savings with it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-clears-pmc-banks-merger-with-unity-sfb/articleshow/89125166.cms||---
---||Business||Sense of purpose is key to staff’s ownership mindset||By Prabir JhaOver the last some months, I have had many potential clients reach out for help in building a better ‘ownership mindset’ in their workforce. The trend is palpable. Companies, established and emergent, are struggling with attracting and retaining talent. Still worse, they are unable to create the passion and engagement even with the teams that stay, till they stay. And the worrisome refrain is, “They don’t have an ownership mindset to deliver impact”. Some of the worry is legitimate as the contemporary workforce is typically less tethered in its outlook and more mercenary in its aspiration. But a bigger worry is the blind spots I see with organisations. They are equally not as okay as their workforce. To expect an ownership mindset by default is both naive and vain. And yet, there is a need to build greater belongingness, more accountability and enhanced sense of ownership among the rank and file. There are some typical issues and possibilities that cut across most contexts… * The P-factor: A powerful purpose — howsoever transactional the business or the role — is key to the journey of ownership mindset. Why does the firm truly exist beyond the mundane? Why does someone want to work there beyond the need to earn a livelihood? The answer lies in visualising and powerfully communicating the purpose of existence. Every firm somewhere is solving a bigger purpose. But they have not thought deep enough to understand it, forget communicate effectively to the last person. Step back. Ask yourself some more fundamental questions. How are you making a difference, howsoever small, to any part of the planet or community? If not, what could you do differently to answer in the affirmative? People today are not just looking for a job, they are seeking a purpose to serve. You just have to offer one. * Help build significance: Corporations must dramatically change their thinking of keeping their employees in little boxes. They must continually educate and communicate how each role, irrespective of function and grade, contributes to the success of the company. In my experience, many senior leaders and HR struggle to explain. I once had a promoter even ask me why I was initiating sharing communication of things across the entire company rather than the usual senior group. “They will not understand,” he had said. And this is a reason why the baton drops. The power of understanding the connect of one’s efforts with a larger outcome is not to be debated. Leaders just have to think of simple ways to explain this link if they want to create a culture of ownership. * Crack the 3 Cs: Connect, communicate and celebrate are three big ways to build a sense of ownership mindset. Is every individual truly connected within the organisation? Many firms have silos, sometimes obvious ones and at times less palpable ones. Do people truly think their workplace allows them to work seamlessly across levels, functions, businesses and geographies? In many firms, there is not enough ‘boundarylessness’. Likewise, do firms truly listen to what is being said (or what is being said through silence)? Is there a true culture of dialogue, ideas exchange, respect for disagreement? Without this, there can be no expectation of an ownership mindset. Finally, do firms celebrate enough? And do they celebrate collective successes wide and deep enough? Many firms don’t, as they think it will build complacency — one of the biggest myths with leadership. If people feel treated selectively or indifferently, it is unwise to expect them to feel like owners of their companies. * Performance & rewards philosophy: While the obsession with endless quantitative goals is rampant, the philosophy does not always promote a mindset of ownership. Ownership implies doing the right things for the company at all times. Not just chasing the ‘what’ but just as equally tracking the ‘how’ is crucial. But the quest for win-at-any-cost promotes many behaviours and clique formations that switch off many people. Some firms then become hijacked by coteries, which surely cannot build a sense of ownership. Similarly, financial rewards or career experiences, including investment in all-time learning, is what people expect. But the track record in many companies is to cut back on investments and rewards for people. Abrupt downsizing as a silver bullet response to any business challenge surely does not send a signal of cultivating an ownership mindset. These are not easy questions. But without taking a strategic view, ownership mindset building is a pipe dream. It is not about appeasement, nor socialism. It is about integrity. Do the right things with your people if you want them to do right for you. * Empowerment: The last big obstacle to building a sense of ownership is the experience of empowerment. Many organisations have become too laddered and decision rights have thus also been moving north. The culture of leadership of many companies is not letting go of their powers and authority for a range of alibis — which is very common. This is very frustrating for many people. Checks, compliances and controls have over-dominated trust, skill or leadership building. Over time, this creates a catch-22 situation where people are not seen as experienced or competent enough to grow. Fear of failure becomes a bogey. And the gap between the north and south of a firm only grows, creating disillusionment. How then can one expect the tribe to demonstrate an ownership mindset? This culture is an aberration in a world increasingly getting digital. Companies need to be reminded that trust begets trust. An ownership mindset with the workforce cannot thus be the start point. It is the end point. Corporations have a lot to do for their people to believe they can think, feel and do as owners. Simple stock grants as a throwaway does not build an ownership mindset. Believing in them and enabling them to believe in the organisation is what secures an ownership mindset. Don’t expect it be instant coffee. Brew well.

Initially, it hit an intraday low of 56,410 after which bargain hunting at lower levels lifted the index and this improved investor sentiment a bit. However, traders were keeping their fingers crossed as the US markets continued to slide later in the evening. The Indian markets are closed on Wednesday. So, when local markets open on Thursday, traders here will have to account for two trading sessions outside of India. The session started on an extremely bearish note and the sensex dipped to the day’s low, but soon the recovery started. After some volatility, the index finally closed in the green after five sessions of ending deep in the red. Tuesday’s gains came despite a Rs 7,095-crore net selling by foreign funds, while local institutions were net buyers at Rs 4,544 crore. So far this month, foreign funds have net sold over Rs 22,100 crore (nearly $3 billion), BSE and CDSL data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-5-day-losing-streak-sensex-sees-bounceback/articleshow/89125160.cms||---

Mehta also continues as president - South Asia, since India is among the top three priority markets for Unilever, and HUL is a listed entity. On Tuesday, Unilever said it will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct business groups — beauty & well-being, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream. Each business group will be fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth, and profit delivery globally. Since the focus is moving away from regions, the need for a COO with P&L responsibility for all markets — a post that was created in 2011 with Harish Manwani as the first COO — now becomes redundant. Nitin Paranjpe, who’s currently the COO of Unilever, will take on a new role as chief transformation officer and chief people officer, wherein he will lead the business transformation and head the HR function. Leena Nair, who was earlier heading the people function as the CHRO of Unilever, is moving on to lead Chanel as CEO. In a statement, Unilever CEO Alan Jope said, “Our new organisational model has been developed over the last year and is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business. Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this.” An HUL spokesperson said, “We will continue to have executive leadership of Sanjiv Mehta, CMD, under the supervision and guidance of the HUL board. We have a mutually beneficial and interdependent relationship with Unilever Group, bringing the best of trends, innovations and capabilities to the Indian market. We will continue to leverage this organisation structure to serve our consumers and customers even better. Changes, if any, will be announced in due course.” The objective is to enable Unilever to benefit from its scale and global capabilities. The proposed new organisation model will result in a reduction in senior management roles of around 15% and more junior management roles by 5%, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally. Jope recently drew some flak from a section of investors who felt Unilever was focusing more on purpose and less on profits. Jope also came under criticism for his repeated attempts to acquire GSK’s consumer division. In the new set-up, which is effective April 1 this year, Fernando Fernandez, EVP - Latin America, has been appointed president - beauty & well-being. Fabian Garcia, president - North America, has been appointed president - personal care. Peter ter Kulve will continue in his role as president - home care. Hanneke Faber, president - foods & refreshment, has been appointed president - nutrition, while Matt Close, EVP - ice cream, has been appointed president - ice cream. Reginaldo Ecclissato, chief supply chain officer, will lead the supply chain and Unilever business operations as chief business operations officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mehta-retains-top-position-at-hul-as-unilever-rejigs-business-model/articleshow/89125129.cms||---

According to auto industry insiders, that is one of the reasons why older bestselling cars and SUVs and even two wheelers are facing such a crippling supply shortage of semiconductor chips. “Over 30% of the chips used in India are older generation and since the auto industry is lower down the pecking order when it comes to chip consumption, the chip industry has not been focusing on these older generation chips.” Auto OEMs, he added, have not moved from “legacy to other modes particularly in some of the older best selling models. The new launches use newer generation chips where the supply constraint will slowly ease out. But the problem will persist with older models,” said Hemal Thakkar, director, Crisil Research. Auto parts’ makers are also feeling the legacy pinch in this regard. “The generation of chips that the auto industry uses is five years behind smart phones and consumer durables. Hence in supply terms, it is even lower down the pecking order of priority,” said Vikram Mohan, MD, Pricol. Pricol, he added, is addressing this problem by “onboarding new chips and getting OEMs to homologate,” because the “cost impact is minimal — $2-$3 per vehicle.” The consumer electronic industry in India is also facing something similar with older-generation products that use legacy mode chips. “In India, air conditioners don’t use too many chips and with supply chains impacted, we now need to order nine months to a year in advance,” said Gurmeet Singh, CMD, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India. What’s worse, the chip shortage, which has so far been very acute in passenger vehicles, is not getting sorted out in a hurry and is now spilling over to two wheelers too. “This current crisis will take till June-July to be sorted out,” said Thakkar. In two wheelers, which use less chips than PVs, there is a “blood bath” said Mohan. “There is a 54-58 week delivery time wait and we are selling 30% less than we normally do to this segment.” Normalcy, he added, is not likely before September this year. Auto parts makers embed chips in their sub-assemblies like light or dashboard clusters. “There is a $2 chip in a light or dashboard cluster, but if it is not available the vehicle cannot be made,” said Mohan. Even global parts majors with dedicated chip sourcing have taken a hit on their Indian supplies. “Imports of Bosch is anticipated to be impacted leading to reduced ability to deliver to Indian OEMs. This is a structural challenge in terms of overall capacity in semiconductors and it will be a medium to long term challenge,” said Sandeep N, executive director and head of sales — mobility solutions, Bosch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/motowns-semiconductor-crisis-is-exacerbated-by-use-of-older-generation-chips/articleshow/89124458.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

---||Nagpur||22 from three gangs charged under MCOCA in one day||Nagpur: Twenty-two members of three gangs, two operating in multiple states, were booked under stringent Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) in one day setting a new benchmark for Nagpur city police. Out of 22, seven were caught from other states for different offences registered against them. City police under CP Amitesh Kumar has invoked MCOCA against interstate gang of fraudsters who had been allegedly duping medical admission aspirants across the country and defrauding them of crores of rupees in separate instances. Sources said the gang of fraudsters promising MBBS admission are likely to have offences registered against them in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and in different parts of Maharashtra including Mumbai. Crime branch team under additional CP Sunil Phulari and DCP Chinmay Pandit nabbed the key members of the MBBS admission gang, Pankaj Dubey from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and Chandrashekhar Atram from Delhi, in the last few weeks. Another member Rajesh Guha had fled from Kolkata when the crime branch went to nab him. The gang had promised a Pune-based doctor couple to help their daughter get admission at a government medical college. Eight members of this gang were slapped with MCOCA. CP Kumar said he wanted to put a brake on this fraud MBBS admission gang, as it targeted students and their parents duping them of substantial amount. “The gang had their tentacles spread across several states in India,” said Kumar. Sources in the crime branch said the admission gang members may have nexus in several private medical colleges, which too are under scanner now. Following Kumar’s intervention, additional CP Navinchandra Reddy also approved the proposal to book the gang of dreaded Madhya Pradesh-based bandit Changiram Gosavi and his son. The gang had committed dacoity at three places in Nagpur before getting nabbed. Five members of the gang were caught by crime branch from their den near Bhopal in MP.

Documents available at National Archives of India (NAI) related to correspondence between officials of Hyderabad and the Centre in 1950 show that hundreds of items of heritage value were taken away or purchased by civil and military individuals and government departments after the fall of Hyderabad in September 1948. The correspondence took place around the first Republic Day (January 26, 1950) on which ousted Nizam took oath as the Raj Pramukh (governor) of Hyderabad state. The correspondence also reveals that instead of insisting on the recovery of the invaluable items, the Centre directed Hyderabad state to identify all objects, make an inventory, fix monetary value for each and recover the amount from individuals or departments. The objects were listed under category of furniture without considering their imperial/heritage value. The insistence was more on the monetary value and monetising the objects. The value was arrived at 58,642. But in today’s world heritage market, some of these items listed as furniture would command a price not less than 50 lakh each, heritage expertssay. Heritage experts said that though the Centre monetised the intrinsic value of objects from the British Residency, it left behind just the lime and mortar structure for posterity. The government inventory shows how even small objects such as finger bowls, incense sticks stand, brass lamp holders and whisky counters have made their way to the residences of at least two ministers and senior officials. The NAI documents show there was a varied collection of objects, including Ajanta and Ellora paintings and a full size billiards table by John Roberts and Co, which were taken away by a military officer. There were paintings of 33 Residents and the Nizams. A large collection of Ajanta and Ellora paintings had also adorned the walls of the Residency. The Centre had given the paintings to the Women’s College when it was opened in the Residency building. The Ajanta paintings were given to the state museum. The British government vacated the Residency at Koti in Hyderabad after Independence. But it remained under control of the Nizam till Operation Polo in September 1948 when princely Hyderabad was merged with Indian Union. Later, Residency came under the control of the military administrator (1948-1949), interim Hyderabad state government (1950-1952) and later elected government of Hyderabad state (1952). The Residency building is now being renovated. But most objects that were once part of this edifice built over 200 years ago and royalty associated with them will be missed forever.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/many-artefacts-at-koti-went-missing-after-police-action-reveal-letters/articleshow/89126556.cms||Syed Akbar

While cops have arrested those behind the two gangs operating the rackets, they have so far not arrested anyone who bought such fake certificates. Cops have found that 75 people procured negative RT-PCR reports, while 50 got fake vaccination certificates. After the Task force police arrested P Laxman Naik (30), owner of Home Care Diagnostic Services in Asmangarh, Malakpet, on January 21, he confessed during interrogation to have obtained the negative reports by sending dummy samples to the testing lab. Laxman had been running the negative RT-PCR certificate racket for the past month and was charging Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000, cops said. “Due to Omicron variant surge, suddenly new travel guidelines came into place. Some people who had booked their domestic travel months ahead needed negative RT-PCR certificates as they couldn’t risk a real test. So, flyers going to states seeking RT-PCR negative reports, some travelling abroad and a few who booked pilgrimage trips utilised the services of Laxman,” said a Task Force official. Police have identified a few who obtained services of Laxman to make a trip to a place of worship in Jammu. One of them whom police contacted two days ago is in Jammu. While another from Nampally has not gone to Jammu and police are now trying to locate him. The main accused in the second gang, Md Tariq Habeeb (28), runs Image Diagnostic Centre in Asif Nagar, and was producing fake vaccination certificates in collusion with Kumari, a computer operator at a UPHC in Afzalsagar. Using her access to Co-Win portal, Kumari generated fake certificates for clients referred by travel agency owners Gulam Musthafa Shakeel and Abdul Basheer of Asif Nagar. Habeeb also used to provide negative RT-PCR certificates by sending dummy samples to lab for same clients. “Along with Habeeb and the two travel agency operators, Kumari has also been arrested,” Task Force inspector S Raghavendra said. “The travel agency was using Habib to help clients going to the Gulf for work. We are trying to locate those who paid for them,” Humayun Nagar inspector K Narayan Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fake-papers-fuelled-gulf-local-trips/articleshow/89126557.cms||---

Police found several used buckets of top dairy brands from the factory premises. Ravindar Rao, manager of Mahendri Dairy Products, was taken into custody and a cheating case was registered. Patancheru deputy superintendent of police Bheem Reddy told TOI that the factory management was using a mix of milk, skimmed milk powder and chemicals to make curd. “Around 50 top brand used buckets which are being filled with curd, made in the factory, were found. They are supplying this to hotels, mostly in the Old City. Every day, they are supplying 1,000 kg to 5,000 kg of curd. Even the milk powder they are using is not branded,” he said. The factory is owned by Pavitra Dairy Products Private Limited and was leased to Mahendri Dairy Products owned by G Venkateswara Rao. “We found milk, curd, kova sweet, paneer and ghee. Most of the products are not up to the market standards. They are selling all top brands adulterated for a lesser price. It is a major health hazard. We have informed the food inspector of the area for strict action,” said Bheem Reddy. Ravindar Rao told cops that Mahendri Dairy was supplying the products to hotels in Old City. “We seized 6,000 litres of white liquid, which they are claiming as milk. The factory has huge milk containers and machines for packing. It also has a testing lab,” the DSP said. Sareen Kumar Gogi of Pavitra Dairy told TOI: “Due to the pandemic, we closed down the factory. For six to seven months, there were no operations. We have recently leased the unit to G Venkateswara Rao. For the past two months, he has been running the factory. We are not operating the unit.” Sareen Kumar said: “Venkateswara Rao said he wanted the factory on lease for chilling purposes. However, buying empty buckets is a violation. Skimmed milk powder can be used to balance solids-not-fat (SNF) in the milk procured which is not a violation.” Venkateswara Rao was not reachable on phone.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/milk-unit-raided-adulterated-products-of-top-brands-seized/articleshow/89126562.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

On Tuesday, KTR laid foundation stones and inaugurated several projects worth Rs 499 crore in the city. While addressing a public meeting at Gajularamaram after inauguration of a sports park, KTR said, “The Telangana government is ready to spend Rs 5,000 crore to build skyways. For the past seven years we have been asking the Centre to allot the defence land, but there has been no reply. The Telangana government is committed to infrastructure projects and we will start the work on a flyover at Suchitra at Medchal.” KTR said that the state government is building 31 ‘sewerage treatment plants’ (STPs) in Greater Hyderabad and its periphery at a cost of Rs 3,866 crore to achieve 100% conversion of sewer water into treated water. The minister laid a foundation stone for the STPs building under package-III at Quthbullapur. He also laid a foundation stone to widen the road between Bachupally and ORR. Later, he inaugurated the urban forest & multi-purpose function hall at Chintal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ktr-slams-centre-for-not-giving-land-in-scb-for-skyways/articleshow/89126569.cms||Sunil Mungara

But the same cannot be retrospectively applied to those who were there prior to the amendment and opted for the civil service,” the court said. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji pronounced this judgment after hearing scores of pleas filed by constables whose total service stood reduced drastically on account of an amendment to rules brought in by the state government on February 6, 2018. By this amendment, the state said that only seven years of the past service of AR constables would be counted the moment they came on transfer to the civil police wing regardless of their total service in the AR wing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-clears-decks-for-cops-promotions/articleshow/89126575.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Covid cases in Gujarat could be higher as 1 lakh self-test kits sold daily||AHMEDABAD: After a day of below 15,000 cases, Gujarat on Tuesday again recorded 16,608 daily Covid cases. Three out of four major cities of Gujarat recorded an upward trend in cases. The state recorded deaths of 28 active patients, the highest in the past eight months. With the update, Gujarat recorded deaths of 200 active patients in a matter of 36 days – the last 100 being in the last five days. Meanwhile, experts pointed out cases could be higher as estimates by the Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists' Association (FGSCDA) put the sale of self-examining rapid antigen test (RAT) kit to one lakh per day. While the licensed distributors are empowered to sell these kits, the test results are not documented. In prevalence of such a scenario, the ‘undocumented tests' at par with the daily testing of about 1-1.3 lakh according to the state government figures. At the conservative test positivity rate (TPR) of 10%, the state may have about 10,000 undocumented Covid cases daily, said experts. "Gujarat is home to at least 25,000 chemists and medical stores. Each of these stores sell a minimum average of four to five self-testing kits every single day. Over the past month or so this number has easily gone up by one-and-a-half times," said Alpesh Patel, chairman, FGSCDA. ‘Patients must corroborate results with RT-PCR testing’Chemists attribute a surge in sales to more awareness and convenience. "Self-testing kits are convenient to use at home. With growing awareness about the availability of these kits, more people are buying to use them. At each of our 80+ stores, some five to eight kits are sold every day. The sale has particularly increased lately with more cases and increased turnaround time for RTPCR test reports," said Ankur Aggarwal, founder, Medkart. Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) – Gujarat has only permitted sale of these kits to certain licensed distributors. "Only licensed distributors are empowered to sell the self-testing kits. It is not classified under Schedule H so that it is easily available as an over the counter product. However, people must understand that these kits are only 70% effective and therefore, may lead to false negatives or even false positives. Those who have symptoms must go by RTPCR tests from designated labs only," said HG Koshia, commissioner, FDCA – Gujarat. Several doctors, too, advise on corroborating the results of RAT self-testing kits with RTPCR tests. "Since self-testing kits are basically Rapid Antigen Tests, it may either cause unnecessary panic or even lead to unnecessary confidence with a false negative test. Patients must corroborate these tests with RTPCR tests and go by the doctor's advice," said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president, Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes' Association (AHNA). "With reduced severity of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the important aspect is to closely monitor the rate of hospitalisation and ICU admissions of patients who test positive," Gadhvi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cases-in-guj-could-be-higher-as-1l-self-test-kits-sold-daily/articleshow/89126578.cms||Niyati Parikh

The accused has been identified as Mukesh alias Subash. A police uniform, fake identity documents, name plates and some photographs were recovered from his possession along with Rs 10,000, police said. On January 20, Salman, a resident of Shastri Park, told police that a man in police uniform robbed him of Rs 10,200.

---||Kolkata||Non-Covid admissions surge in Kolkata hospitals as footfall dips sharply||KOLKATA: Non-Covid admissions have started crawling up across Kolkata’s private hospitals that have seen a significant drop in Covid admissions over the last five days. The plunge has been between 30%-50% a day on an average at most hospitals, which, the hospital authorities pointed out, is consistent with the slide in the total number of affected in the state and the city. This has not only made hospitals reverse their earlier plan of extending Covid units but they are also reconverting Covid beds into non-Covid ones. At some hospitals, non-Covid admissions have doubled over the last week. The AMRI Hospitals have converted 35 Covid beds into non-Covid ones across its three units and is ready to convert more depending on the demand for non-Covid treatment, said CEO Rupak Barua. Occupancy, however, remains high at its Covid critical care units that have 120 beds. “Our non-Covid patients have shot up from 250 last week to around 350 now. Covid admissions, on the other hand, are dropping by 10%-15% everyday,” said Barua. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), Covid admissions have dropped from around eight per day 10 days ago to around four a day for the last three days. “There has been an increase in non-Covid admissions by 25% over the last week. While the number of admitted Covid patients remain constant at 95 for the last one week, positivity rate has plummeted to 20%,” said zonal head R Venkatesh. At Woodlands Hospital, Covid admissions have significantly declined over the last few days while non-Covid admissions have more than doubled. "While a week ago, the average Covid daily occupancy was 54, in the last four days, the figure has dropped to 42. Last Monday, around 30% of our total occupancy comprised non-Covid patients, while this Monday, the figure hasgone up to 70%," said MD & CEO Rupali Basu. At Belle Vue Clinic, the number of non-critical Covid beds is down to 28 from 80. "We have started using these beds for non-Covid treatment, which is now on a revival path, along with our OPD. Surgeries, too, have gone up while the number of RT-PCR tests has dropped sharply," said CEO P Tondon. At Charnock Hospital, Covid admissions have dipped by 30%. "This has led to a rise in non-Covid admissions which have now reached 40% of our capacity. We expect it to double over the next two weeks," said Charnock mamaging director Prashant Sharma. At Peerless Hospital, the total number of Covid patients has dropped from 81 on January 16 to 62 on January 23, while the number of non-Covid patients has swelled from 133 to 205 durin this period.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/non-cov-admissions-surge-in-city-hosps-as-cov-footfall-dips-sharply/articleshow/89126583.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Traffic fines set to really sting as Bengal implements stricter rules||KOLKATA: Get ready to cough up as much as Rs 5,000 if you are caught talking on your mobile while driving, or if you jump a traffic light. Traffic fines in Kolkata and the rest of the state are set to increase by up to tenfold, following the amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act and hike in compounding fines for different traffic offences kicking in. The revised notification comes more than two years after the state government had decided against implementing the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, as it was against the imposition of such steep fines. While dangerous or rash driving (talking on mobiles and jumping signals come under this) and racing will initially attract a fine of Rs 5,000, the driver will have to pay up Rs 10,000 if the person commits another fine within three years. The fine for not carrying a valid pollution under control (PUC) certificate will attract a fine of Rs 10,000 and the driving licence confiscated for three months. The amount is similar for plying vehicles without valid registration, fitness certificate or permit. Not adhering to personal safety protocols, such as wearing seatbelts and helmets, will be a fine of Rs 1,000. For the latter, the offender will also be disqualified for holding a driving licence for three months. If a person whose licence is disqualified for an offence is caught driving, s/he will be fined Rs 10,000. Any unauthorised alterations to their vehicles can be fined Rs 1 lakh. Traffic cops have also been empowered to enforce silence zones in the city. If someone blows a horn near a hospital, school or any other silence zone, the person will be fined Rs 1,000 for the first offence and Rs 2,000 for repeat offences. Taxi refusal, a major problem in the city, will henceforth invite a fine of Rs 500. Transport officials said a spurt in accidents and revenue loss were the primary reasons for the state changing its mind on the implementation of the amended act. "Many states have implemented the enhanced fines. This was leading to a revenue loss for the state. More importantly, we saw a number of accidents where there was major negligence by the drivers. With the sharp rise in vehicles, such negligence cannot be accepted on the road. Hence we decided to notify the enhanced fines," said a transport officer. The city police said it would update the citation app with the newly compounded fines before implementing the enhanced penalties. "Sergeants will now prosecute violators according to regulations laid out in the new notification," said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. There were mixed reactions from motorists. Sourav Sikdar, a Salt Lake resident, said, "Traffic offences are common in the city. With an increase in fines, people will think twice before committing an offence. Safety on city roads will definitely increase." But Behala resident Satadru Banerjee countered that it would lead to under-the-table deals. "Increase in fines for the second time, especially, for those without helmets will only increase bribes. The fines for second-time violation should have been Rs 800 and not Rs 1,500."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/traffic-fines-set-to-really-sting-as-bengal-implements-stricter-rules/articleshow/89126584.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bengal ex-CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refuses Modi government’s Padma Bhushan award||KOLKATA: Former Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has declined the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian award, announced by the Narendra Modi government on Tuesday. “I am not aware of the Padma Bhushan award being conferred on me. No one communicated it to me. If I was selected for the award, I decline it,” the ailing former CM said in a written statement late in the evening. CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury attributed a similarly worded statement to Bhattacharjee and shared it on his official Twitter handle. Bhattacharjee served as the state’s chief minister from 2000 to 2011, occupying the post after the longest-serving CM, Jyoti Basu, stepped down. His loss in the 2011 assembly poll — after heavy criticism over the handling of the Singur and Nandigram agitations — marked the end of the 34-year-old communist government and the rise of Mamata Banerjee. Bhattacharjee, incidentally, was one of the communist leaders who pushed the CPM into a reassessment of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Communists had derided the icon over his alignment with Japan in 1942. The change in stance had begun from 1989, when communists started garlanding Netaji’s statue on his birth anniversary, along with Forward Bloc. In 2003, during the icon’s 105th birth anniversary celebrations, Bhattacharjee publicly admitted that their long-held assessment of the leader was wrong. According to sources, the former CM’s wife, Meera, received a phone call from the Centre around 2pm about the honour. She broke the news to him, to which he reportedly smiled. But when the MHA announced the Padma list, Bhattacharjee told her he wouldn’t accept on personal grounds. MHA sources told TOI that home secretary A K Bhalla had called Meera up in the morning to inform her about the Padma Bhushan. But Bhalla could not talk to Bhattacharjee directly because he was told the CPM veteran was not well. According to party sources, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra got in touch with the Bhattacharjees, and left it to the former CM to take the final call. CPM insiders felt Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had done right by refusing the award because Marxists were not inclined to receive awards for public service. The party later echoed this sentiment through a tweet: "Com. Buddhadeb Bhattacharya who was nominated for the Padma Bhushan award has declined to accept it. The CPI(M) policy has been consistent in declining such awards from the State. Our work is for the people not for awards. Com EMS who was earlier offered an award had declined it." The Rao government had proposed Padma Vibhushan for Kerala ex-CM EMS Namboodiripad, which he refused. Bengal ex-CM Jyoti Basu turned down a Bharat Ratna from the UPA I government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ex-cm-buddhadeb-refuses-modi-govts-padma-award/articleshow/89126538.cms||---

They claim that they have a right to hunt and exercise the right during the hunting festivals.But Calcutta High Court has put an embargo on ritualistic hunting of wildlife in south Bengal by its orders of 2018 and 2019.Activist Soumyadip Mondal was the first to reach the spot on Monday evening after receiving a tip-off from a fisherman of Bharatpur 1. Mondal is from an NGO, Human & Environment Alliance League, which works on conservation of biodiversity and mitigation of human-animal conflict. Displaying exemplary courage, he intercepted the 20-member team armed with bows, arrows and spears and called police as well as the Kandi ranger. The accused were taken to the police station, where charges were drawn up. Their bail applications were rejected and all were remanded in jail custody till February 8.“So many people have never been arrested at one time for a wildlife offence. We hope this will serve as a stern warning to others and act as a deterrent,” Mondal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/20-birbhum-tribals-held-for-hunting-in-murshidabad/articleshow/89126586.cms||---

It will continue till March 15. Earlier, the programme was planned from January but it had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, Paray Samadhan — a sub-programme under Duare Sarkar to address local problems — will be addressed through the Paray Samadhan camps, which will be held between February 1 and March 15 to resolve local gaps in infrastructure and services. So, both the Duare Sarkar and Paray Samadhan camps that were postponed are being rescheduled for February.An official said the DMs have been asked to follow Covid-19 safety norms and arrange all the camps. During the last Duare Sarkar camps there was a mad rush for the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, under which there is a direct cash transfer to the women without government jobs in the 25-60 years age group. Around 1.6 crore women had enrolled for the Duare Sarkar camps held between August and September. Swasthya Sathi, the health cards issued by the state government, too were in high demand among those who had attended the camps.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/duare-sarkar-set-to-resume-from-feb-15/articleshow/89126588.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Niti Aayog study to scan expenses, projects of tea, 3 other agri boards||Kolkata: The Niti Aayog has ordered a detailed evaluation study of India’s four agri-commodity boards — Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board — and their schemes, upon an instruction from the department of expenditure under the Union finance ministry. For over a decade or so, the utility, functioning and importance of these agri-industry regulators have been under the Central government scanner. Sources believe that the latest process as initiated by the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) of Niti Aayog seems to pave the way for a merger or a complete dissolution of this quartet.In a letter dated January 13 this year, the Niti Aayog informed Union commerce secretary B V R Subrahmanyam that these evaluation studies will involve “analyses of time series data and information contained in documents such as annual report, other progress reports, scheme documents and evaluation reports, as well as multi-stage primary survey involving national, state, district, block and village-level stakeholders and beneficiaries of the schemes…”Replying to a question on the possible impact of the study, K N Raghavan, deputy chairman of the Tea Board, said that it would help get new inputs to improve the plantation industries. “Merger and dissolution of agri boards can happen only through a big policy decision at the top. This study would focus on reorientation of various parameters of the boards to uplift quality, exports and value-added business. We’ll look after quality and focussed promotion for a better return on investment through effective use and rationalisation of resources.” At a time when the Centre is planning to repeal the Tea Act of 1953 and the Coffee Act of 1942, to be replaced by new regulations, the whiff of the merger or disbanding of the agri boards has resurfaced.K G Jagadeesha, secretary of Coffee Board, told TOI: “Such a detailed ground-level study is expected to bring in some changes in our functioning. It may come up with unique ideas for the sector’s uplift. But we can’t discuss on it as it is in a premature stage.”Arijit Raha, secretary-general, Indian Tea Association (ITA), feels that the roles played by the tea and any other agri boards cannot be ignored. “Tea Board functions as a reference point for advocacy. Dissolving it will only add to the current woes of the industry. We are keenly waiting to see the study result with the latest feedbacks,” he said. The consultancy work of the study, involving field work and draft preparation, will be done by AJNIFM and ISSRF for Tea Board and NILERD for the three other boards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/niti-aayog-study-to-scan-expenses-projects-of-tea-3-other-agri-boards/articleshow/89126590.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Sextortion gangs target doctor and bank manager||Kolkata: Cops have warned netizens of sextortion gangs, operating from north India, after a doctor of south Kolkata and a bank manager were allegedly targeted in the city a couple of days ago. The victims alleged to have received video calls through social media platforms where the accused sought to interact with them for consultation, said cops.The bank manager, who lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police, stated that as soon as he had received the call, a woman started texting him and suddenly, she played an obscene video. Having realized that he was being trapped, the bank manager disconnected the call. After two hours, he got an extortion call and the person on the other side of the phone threatened him, saying that he had committed an illegal act. The manager informed both the Jadavpur police and detective department about the matter. This was for the third time in the city that a doctor fell victim to such crime. “I received a WhatsApp call and was asked whether I could see anything. Seconds later, I saw a video where a young woman was indulging in obscene acts,” said the doctor.Cops suspect that the members of Bharatpur (Mewati) gangs or other offshoots in the city might be behind such crimes. Four such FIRs have been lodged with the police in the recent past. Last year a 61-year-old paediatric endocrinologist had fallen prey to cyber fraud while offering to treat a patient, who had sought his consultation through a video call. The Phoolbagan police had arrested two persons from Rajasthan in connection with this incident. Similar threats from another gang had forced a personal assistant of actor Ankush Hazra to end his life in March last year. That time too, a man from Rajasthan was nabbed and his minor son was also apprehended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sextortion-gangs-target-doctor-and-bank-manager/articleshow/89126596.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||219 drink-drive cases in Kolkata in six days||KOLKATA: Ever since breathalyzer tests were reintroduced in the city six days ago, the city has recorded 219 cases of drink-driving. As many as 112 cases were recorded this weekend and another 88 were recorded on Monday and Tuesday. All raids had begun from 9pm across 30 odd points in the city. The accident near Sulekha crossing last Saturday — where one person lost his life and six others were injured when a 33-year-old man allegedly drove a sedan under the influence of alcohol — might just be a tip in the iceberg, said cops. “Each night, we have witnessed a rise in prosecutions as compared to the last one. The only exception was Tuesday. While there is always an increase in such cases on weekends, the jump this time is noticeable. We had recorded 950 odd drink-driving cases between November 8 and December 31 last year at an average of 19 cases per night before the Covid third wave forced us to discontinue the raids. The statistics cover the last weekend of December, when case count usually remains high. But in the past six days (till Tuesday) when we reintroduced breathalyzer tests yet again, we have been prosecuting 37 motorists and bikers on an average each night," said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Police said they were worried as the Sulekha incident was not a one-off fatal accident linked directly to drink-driving in the past week. A pedestrian died near RSM Square last week after a mini truck — whose driver was reportedly drunk — crushed him at night. "At night nakas, we found that young men and women were drinking alcohol inside their vehicles as the bars had shut early due to night restrictions," said a sergeant from Beliaghata traffic guard. The traffic brass has now asked all ACPs to proactively recommend temporary cancellation of licences to the state transport department to send out a strong message. The maximum drink-driving prosecutions took place in the east and south guards, the areas around New Market-Park Street-Middleton Street-Park Circus. The Kasba traffic guard — under which many pubs operate on both sides of Bypass — along with Jorabagan traffic guard (that covers bars of CR Avenue and the red-light area) and Beliaghata guard (covering a part of Bypass) also registered multiple prosecutions. Lalbazar brass has now asked police in the Jadavpur-Behala belts to increase drink-driving prosecutions after the Sulekha accident. OCs and additional OCs of all 25 guards have been instructed to be present on the road during special night nakas on weekends. The decision follows some hard statistics collected on Sunday night — the east, south and Jadavpur guards ended up prosecuting 17 people. Incidentally, two of these three guards have witnessed fatal accidents due to drink driving in the past six days. Police said these 219 prosecutions have taken place with limited resources, barely 60% of sergeants have taken their Covid booster vaccine and since only those cops who are vaccinated thrice can carry out prosecutions, naka checks in the city have been fewer than usual. Commissioner Vineet Kumar Goyal has laid out certain strict guidelines and an SOP has been set up on how these checks will be conducted. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said they will ensure that breathalyzer tests are carried following the set SOP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/219-drink-drive-cases-in-kolkata-in-six-days/articleshow/89126597.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||PIL draws attention to Maidan’s poor shape, pleads for upkeep||Kolkata: A PIL has been filed at the Calcutta High Court about the deteriorating condition of Maidan and seeking urgent measures to nurse it back to health.The petition filed by green activist Subhas Datta has highlighted the lack of maintenance of the 988-acre green space that is not just the city’s lungs but its largest environment asset as well.While Maidan draws people by the droves each winter, the situation has become more acute during the pandemic with lakes and parks either closed for months or open for only a few hours a day. Consequently, people from all over the city now converge at Maidan. These include those who wish to play, others who want to picnic or simply spend time with friends and family. When they leave Maidan around dusk, they leave it scarred by makeshift clay ovens and ravaged by litter and plastic.Police have conducted drives to remove illegal parking of two-wheelers and step in when they spot a fire being lit. But given the expanse of the green, violations have been rampant. Though the PWD has set up toilets in the Maidan area, lack of water and flushing facility means these are unusable. Visitors have turned parts of the Maidan into an open air toilet. The petitioner has also drawn the court’s attention to the poor condition of the waterbody that is now covered with hyacinth. “There is a need to care for the Maidan. Apart from a clean-up drive, there needs to be rules on how to use the Maidan without causing damage to it. Also, when there are so many visitors, there will have to be public convenience facilities like toilets. These need to be maintained properly so that people can use them,” Datta said.He has urged the court to set up a monitoring committee to control and regulate the activities inside the Maidan. “The misuse and abuse of the Maidan must stop,” said Datta, who was instrumental in getting the Kolkata Book Fair and Lexpo shifted to alternative venues to stop pollution in the Maidan.Rugby team Jungle Crows founder Paul Walsh, who is a regular user of the Maidan, felt citizens required to feel responsible about the precious space and realise that once lost, the Maidan would never be back. “This is an amazing place that needs to be protected. It is sad that some people use it as a dustbin and toilet,” he rued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pil-draws-attention-to-maidans-poor-shape-pleads-for-upkeep/articleshow/89126599.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Goa pattern’ for Maharashtra local body polls?||Nagpur: The Goa pattern, where two of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents Shiv Sena and NCP have entered in pre poll-alliance while Congress has decided to go solo, is very likely to be replicated in the local body polls for Maharashtra. While both Sena and NCP are eager for an alliance, Congress seems fixated on going alone. Shiv Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut told TOI that pre-poll alliance between the three is necessary. “If we contest together than it will be beneficial to all. Each one fights to their strengths and adjusts for seats accordingly,” said Raut. Known as the architect of MVA, Raut is one of the few leaders in the country who has direct and unrestricted access to both Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. His proximity to both gives Raut a vantage point when discussing poll alliances. Raut said, “In Goa we talked to Congress but it did not agree, so we are going ahead with NCP.” But for local body polls here in Maharashtra, Raut is confident of an arrangement being worked out. “I believe that a coalition will happen, 100% it will happen,” said Raut. “As I said the key is how much people agree to adjust in the alliance. For example in Nagpur, Sena will play junior partner role. Similarly, others have to do the same (elsewhere),” said Raut. State cabinet minister and NCP leader Jitendra Awhad agreed, saying that MVA has a better chance of making an impact. “An alliance puts MVA on a strong footing. Parties too are aware in which area they wield influence, so the strongest candidate becomes the face,” said Awhad who is representing NCP for Goa’s seat sharing plans with Sena. But local politicians, who have more chances of getting a ticket if all parties go solo, may weigh in on party leadership. Raut said, “Of course, pressure is there from local leaders, but in the end we need a broader perspective.” Awhad said, “It is our job to convince the local leadership about the larger interest.” Local Sena and NCP leaders too seem to be on the same page. Dushyant Chaturvedi, Sena’s samparkh pramukh, said, “The party’s decision will be final and obviously the benefits of entering into an alliance are well known. But as part of my duty, I have to be prepared for every eventuality.” NCP’s city chief Dhuneshwar Pethe said, “MVA came together to stop BJP and the same will happen in the local body polls too. In case of alliance we will explain to our party workers to think of the bigger picture.” Going by both Raut and Awhad’s statements, the NCP-Shiv Sena tie up is a certainty and all that Congress needs to do is say “yes”. Congress, however, is not in the mood to commit. Senior Congress leader and cabinet minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “Even though we all three are part of MVA, we all have a right to expand our party. In the recently held nagar panchayat polls, going solo helped us create a member base and new leaders emerged. We will now analyze this and take decision later.” Congress’ state unit chief Nana Patole has always said that the party intends to fight solo.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/goa-pattern-for-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/89124556.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

CVCs have been set up at hospitals, dispensaries and schools. SDMC has also started a Covid helpline to provide proper consultation and guidance by doctors to Covid-positive patients in home isolation. Among its hospitals, 100 oxygen beds have been arranged at Mata Gujri Hospital in Tilak Nagar and two oxygen plants have also been installed. Suryan urged people to take both doses of vaccine as a shield against Covid-19. He also requested everybody to follow the safety guidelines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/south-corpn-crosses-20l-dose-mark-on-vaccination/articleshow/89125146.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tech upgrade plan after cars crush dividers at accident spot in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Dangerous driving at night is not necessarily confined to wider roads. Neither is drink-driving to areas hemming with pubs. Barely 72 hours after the fatal accident that killed one pedestrian and injured six others opposite Krishna Glass Factory, Jadavpur traffic guard learnt it the hard way. Barely 24 to 36 hours after they finished setting up plastic cones at Sulekha crossing, several of them were found damaged on Tuesday. “We had to remove some of them as they had been damaged beyond repair. While it can be argued that motorists were not expecting them in the middle of the road, this proves that lane jumping and speeding is common even on the two-lane SC Mullick Road,” said a traffic cop. “We have indeed decided to remove or replace a few cones,” said DC Traffic (South) Atul V. Raids at Jadavpur and Garia guards after the accident have led to at least 10 drink-driving prosecutions. Across important but heavily congested roads like SC Mullick Road, NSC Bose Road. MG Road (Haridevpur connector) or James Long Sarani, cops are planning to install multiple CCTV cameras. While speed guns have already been installed at SC Mullick and NSC Bose Road, a proposal has been prepared to install a few more. Other necessary traffic technology — like use of reflective mirrors and median strips — has been proposed. “A major change in street furniture — like setting up of additional traffic signals — has brought down speeding on all roads leading to Garia. Now, instead of pedestrians, speeding and reckless driving are leading to accidents,” said a senior officer from the planning department. The cops, however, are putting maximum focus on prosecutions. “There cannot be a better way of crackdown than prosecutions. That process is already underway. We hold naka checks each day. We have also formed special teams who will man the roads and take appropriate action against violators. But importantly, we are trying to set up strong evidence against the accused and trying to keep him in custody for a longer duration,” said an officer. “There isn’t any one reason behind negligent driving, hence there is no one-fix solution. Road conditions, a sudden urge to speed, inadequate lighting and the rise in the number of pedestrians on the carriageway are all to blame,” said an officer from the fatal squad of traffic police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tech-upgrade-plan-after-cars-crush-dividers-at-accident-spot/articleshow/89126600.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Burglars target Salt Lake houses, attack policemen while fleeing||Suman Chakraborti & Mayukh Sengupta KOLKATA: Residents of Salt Lake’s AH Block together thwarted an early-morning robbery on Monday as they first spotted the culprits and then, alerted each other as well as the cops, and then waited in silence till police arrived. A team from the Bidhannagar East police station reached the spot in no time and were about to catch the two culprits as they came out of AH 193, but one of the accused bit a constable’s hand and another one flung open an iron gate into a sub-inspector and fled. As the two escaped, they left behind a laptop and a mobile that they had stolen as well as iron rods and chisels that they had brought to cut open doors and grilles. Police are yet to track them. “On getting a call, our patrolling cops from the Bidhannagar East PS reached the spot and attempted to catch them. While police managed to recover a laptop and a mobile, the two accused fled. In the scuffle, one constable was bitten on his hand,” said Surya Prasad Yadav, deputy commissioner (headquarters) of Bidhannagar City Police. Residents TOI spoke to said they started hearing noises around their houses around 3.45am on Monday. “We heard some noise coming from our garage roof and saw some people in black clothes leaving towards the next house,” said Nilima Bhuinya, a resident of AH 195. The accused apparently tried out other houses before targeting AH 193. “My son saw torch light aimed at our house. We saw two men crossing over the gate of retired professor Pranabesh Jana’s house and breaking the front grille gate to enter the ground floor, which has the back office of a company. One of them climbed up to the roof. We called up the Bidhannagar East police,” said Sumit Goswami, a resident of AH 216. He alerted other neighbours, as they waited for cops, quietly keeping a watch from their darkened rooms. The accused entered the ground floor of Jana’s house, AH 193, where two employees of the back office were sleeping. The accused took away a mobile and a laptop. As the two walked out, they saw cops waiting for them and a scuffle broke out. One of the accused bit a constable and another flung open the gate at a sub-inspector and fled, leaving the gadgets. By then, Jana and other neighbours woke up. “We used to have night patrolling that was arranged by the Block committee. It was withdrawn some years ago,” said Jana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/burglars-target-salt-lake-houses-attack-policemen-while-fleeing/articleshow/89126602.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shaken by robbery attempt, Salt Lake residents demand night patrol, CCTV cameras||KOLKATA: The robbery attempt at Salt Lake’s AH Block has shaken up residents, who demanded immediate security step-up, especially inside the blocks, and police patrolling till morning. “Police patrolling needs to be increased across Salt Lake, especially at the entry points of blocks, like that in CR Park in Delhi. We will also discuss a proposal to reintroduce the old night guard system by handing over the responsibility to professional security agencies,” said Arunava Hazra, a resident of CD Block Committee. Jayita Goswami of AH Block in Salt Lake, where the robbery was attempted early on Monday, also pointed at the need for installing CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood. “There was a night patrolling system in our Block some years ago but that was withdrawn at some point. We will discuss the matter with the block committee and propose to reintroduce night patrolling and install CCTV cameras,” said Goswami. Residents of several Blocks and representatives of multiple block committees TOI spoke to said there had been talks of installing CCTV cameras, especially after major crimes in the township, but it never materialized. “Thefts have taken place in our Block. We installed eight CCTV cameras at the BE Block community centre that covers the entire BE park. We plan to install wireless CCTV cameras at all the 10 entry points of the block to keep check of outsiders,” said BE Block Nagarik Sangha secretary Narottam Dutta. Some block committees, like AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha, have their night patrol systems that run on minimal contribution from residents. “It would help if residents contribute to the block committees to help re-introduce the night guard system that will be alert and will keep an eye throughout the night,” Bidhannagar Welfare Association secretary Sarat Mullick. Cops, who are on the lookout for the accused, said they had stressed the need for installing CCTV cameras by block associations. “Our duty is to secure the main thoroughfares and junctions with CCTV cameras but it is the duty of residents to secure their own neighbourhoods with surveillance cameras. It acts as a deterrent and also help track criminals,” said a senior Bidhannagar City Police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/shaken-residents-demand-night-patrol-cctv-cameras/articleshow/89126604.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid combat focus on Ballygunge with 5 containment zones||KOLKATA: The Covid combat team has now shifted its focus on Ballygunge and adjacent neighbourhoods, which now have five of the city’s nine micro-containment zones. After being on the containment lists in the first two waves, the Ballygunge area—falling under wards 65 and 69—is back under watch again. The new containment list drawn up on January 24 name Bright Street, Iron Side Road, Ballygunge Park, Ballygunge Circular Road and Gurusaday Road apart from Southern Avenue, Tangra and Middleton Street. All the Ballygunge addresses reported fresh cases on January 18 or 19. TimesViewThe focus should now be on the areas that still seem to have a larger share of cases. We should get the number of cases as low as possible and as soon as possible; it will help open up the economy even more.“While cops from local police station have been asked to keep a vigil on movements of residents of high-rises and apartments, KMC tele-callers have regularly been keeping in touch with families of the affected. We have assured the families we will send our team for swab collection of the aged and infirm,” said a KMC health official. But unlike the previous times, the combined efforts of the residents, cops and KMC officials are bringing the number of cases down.Different steps have been taken, including strict testing, naka checking and a host of entry rules for outsiders. Govind Saraf, secretary of residents’ association of Park Towers, which has come out of containment list, said, “We extended our support to KMC-KP team that led to removal of the containment tag from our building.” Police and KMC sources said there were a couple of reasons for bringing the complexes under containment, despite not being in congested areas. “We are considering all addresses next to each other and with more than five cases. But we have asked police to set up just one guard rail near the entrance and we will extend any help required,” said Sandip Ranjan Bakshi, Borough VIII councillor. Sources said another reason was to keep the virus from spreading among the domestic help who go back to their homes outside the city. “If we contract the virus, we might spread it if we do not get tested on time,” said Soma Laha, a retired CU professor.  “KMC tele-callers contacted us daily. Police also asked us about our test updates,” said Chandra Chatterjee, another retired professor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-combat-focus-on-ballygunge-with-5-c-zones/articleshow/89126606.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: RT-PCR push for kin of serious patients in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Samrat Sen, a resident of Jadavpur’s Sulekha and a banker on Monday registered his father-in-law’s name with Covid-admission cell of Swasthya Bhawan to shift the Covid-critical patient from a private hospital to a government Covid-designated hospital. On Tuesday, Sen got a call from the state health department inquiring whether the immediate family members of the critical patient had their Covid tests (RT-PCR) done? When Sen answered in the negative, the caller gave a 72-hour deadline for the Sen family and confirmed that if no tests were done within the timeframe, the state health department would send a team to their Jadavpur address for collection of swabs. Sen said they would themselves get tested for Covid without waiting for the Swasthya Bhawan workers to do the job. “Right now I am busy with the treatment of my father-in-law. I shall arrange for an RT-PCR test for every single member of the family who has come in close contact with the patient,” Sen said. According to the revised protocol, testing rules in community settings will be done for symptomatic patients who are close contacts of a confirmed positive case, asymptomatic contacts who are above 60 and those who have comorbidities, symptomatic pregnant women, asymtomatic pregnant women nearing labour if they are close contacts and those requiring international travel. In cases where the tele-callers are finding either of these they are asking for a test report within 72 hours. As part of contract tracing, the state health department and the KMC have decided to conduct a mandatory RT-PCR test on persons who are coming in close contact with a Covid positive patient. The state health and KMC tele-callers who are engaged in contract tracing are giving a 72-hour deadline to the relatives of a Covid positive patient to get tested. Otherwise the state and the civic body are sending their own teams for collection of swabs. According to a KMC health department official, the tele-callers have been asked to take the contract-tracing job seriously to prevent spread of the infection in the neighbourhoods where multiple addresses had or are still having Covid positive patients. The tele-callers have also been advised to take note of the fact whether adequate tests were being done to determine the presence of the infection in the residents of the high-rises and apartment buildings where more than four persons have been tested positive. A KMC Covid combat team member said the stress for testing was laid more on the families where some Covid positive patients are suddenly turning critical. “We are keeping an eye on the Covid positive patients who despite having no co-morbidity factors are turning critical. In such cases, the family members must get tested,” the civic official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rt-pcr-push-for-kin-of-serious-patients/articleshow/89126608.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Youth starts e-petition on ‘high’ test cost in Bengal||Kolkata: A city youth has launched an online petition on RT-PCR test cost, which he claimed is several times higher than other states.Currently, the cost at Bengal private labs is capped at Rs 950 plus home collection charges while tests at government labs are conducted free of cost.The last time Bengal government revised this rate was in December 2020, more than a year ago while many states have revised it in recent times capping prices between Rs 300 and 700.Labs across the country, including Kolkata and rest of the states had started by charging price of Rs 4,500 per RT-PCR test, a rate fixed by ICMR.Later, states started capping the cost once the cost of reagents started coming down. The Bengal government, too, had revised the rates three times, the last being on December 3, 2020. Since then the rates have remained at Rs 950 per tests with an additional Rs 15 per km being charged for home collection.An RT-PCR test at Delhi now costs Rs 300 at private labs after the government brought it down from Rs 500 a few days ago. In Mumbai, it costs Rs 500 after the Maharashtra government revised it in December-beginning. The cost in Kerala, Gujarat, UP, Karnataka and Chandigarh is fixed at Rs 500, 400, 700, 500 and 299, respectively.Private labs said that the cost of reagents have come down but only slightly since December 2020. According to sources, a kit including, viral transport medium still costs around Rs 650 to 700, a reduction of about Rs 100. “It could be that the manufacturers are offering the kits at a much lower rate in those states, may be after the intervention from the respective governments. In Bengal, also, the cost of kits had come down slightly but not to the extent to lower the test cost to Rs 500 or 700,” said a source at a private lab.“I recently had to take an RT-PCR test as I developed symptoms. I found that the charge in Kolkata was much higher than other states. Why would people in Bengal have to pay four to five times higher than other states? Imagine the amount in case the whole family of four-five people needs to undergo the test,” said NGO worker Ajay Mittal, who has launched the online petition.Mittal felt that the high cost could be one reason why many people are either avoiding the RT-PCR tests or going for the much cheaper home tests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/youth-starts-e-petition-on-high-test-cost-in-bengal/articleshow/89126609.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A security guard was killed and two others were injured in the accident on Monday. The duo is undergoing treatment at RG Kar and said to be out of danger.Forensic officials visited the hotel and said they didn’t find any traces of chemical explosion, ruling out the earlier version by fire officials who suspected either an LPG or a gas built-up inside the empty reservoir leading to the deafening sound. Police said the lid of the reservoir had collapsed and got lifted in such a manner that it trapped security guard Chandra Sekhar Bera between the lid and an electrical panel leading to his death. Two others, security guard Shankar Chakraborty and flower decorator Debashis Singha, fell inside the reservoir and became unconscious.

While actor Victor Banerjee was awarded Padma Bhushan, Agarwala, Saren, Bandyopadhyay and Singh were awarded Padma Shri. Kolkata’s very own Ustad Rashid Khan, too, was conferred the Padma Bhushan from UP, where he was born. Ninety-year-old legendary singer Sandhya Mukhopadhyay turned down the offer when a government official called her from Delhi on Tuesday evening. “I am not keeping well. They called me before the official awards. This is so humiliating. I have never run after awards and rejected this. The love of my listeners is my greatest award,” she said. Her family members are equally miffed with the government’s decision. Her family members are equally miffed with the government’s decision. Daughter Soumi Sengupta said the award has come in too late. “She is the seniormost artist in Bengal now. She recorded her first song at the age of 12. She has never craved for awards. She has not been keeping well and is also not in a position to go to Delhi and receive an award. Frankly speaking, conferring a Padmasri on her when she is 90 is nothing short of an insult,” Sengupta said. Chattopadhyay refused the award on Tuesday morning. A tabla player from the Farrukhabad gharana, he is a disciple of Pandit Jnan Prakash Ghosh. A recipient of the President’s Award in 1970 and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2002, he became the youngest tabla player to perform in the House of Commons 20 in 1989. “I would have accepted a Padmasri if it had been conferred on me in 2010. But this is 2020 and I am not going to accept it at this stage in my life. My contemporaries and juniors including Ajoy Chakraborty, Shahid Parvez, Rashid Khan, Vijay Ghate and Satish Vyas have been conferred with the Padmasri long back. Why humiliate me this way?” Chatterjee asked.  He added other artists had received calls from the central government to request him to accept the award. “But they all refused because they feel that it is my personal decision. They too feel I deserve nothing less than Padmabhushan. There are five universities in India where Zakir Hussain and I am taught as part of the syllabus. Why humiliate me this way? Even the likes of Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia and Pt Shivkumar Sharma have supported my decision of refusing the award,” he said. Khan was announced as a Padma Bhushan recipient 16 years after being conferred the Padma Shri. “Sandhyadi should have been given a Padma Bibhushan long ago. Anindoda too should have got a Padma Bhushan. They are so senior and have served the cause of music for so long,” said the vocalist from Rampur-Sahaswan gharana. The 53-year-old vocalist received his Padma news on Tuesday morning from a government official. “I just heard “apni pachchhen (you are receiving),” he said. A tad surprised with Uttar Pradesh being mentioned as his state, Khan said, “I was born in Uttar Pradesh’s Budaun and came to Kolkata at the age of 10. Bengal is where I belong. Being conferred a Padmabhushan by the Indian government is a matter of great pride. I want to request the central government to make Indian classical music a part of our school syllabus. Students should learn it just the way they learn maths and science,” he said. Indian Statistical Institute director Sanghamitra Bandyoadhyay said, “The country has acknowledged my work on several occasions. It is a great honour.” The Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awardee was appointed as the first woman director of the ISI in 2015.

---||Kolkata||Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar lashes out, most politicians term diatribe ‘unwarranted, half-truths’||KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar chose a ceremony to pay tribute to Dr BR Ambedkar in the assembly on the occasion of National Voters’ Day on Monday to launch yet another diatribe against the state government, prompting most Bengal politicians — excluding those from the BJP — to criticize the move and term it unfortunate. Trinamool Congress said the governor and the BJP were frustrated with the latter’s electoral reverses in the state. “Democracy is in deep peril. Governance is much away from constitutional norms,” Dhankhar said over alleged post-poll violence in Bengal. He also held that Bengal was the only state where the chief secretary and DGP didn’t respond to the governor’s call for a meeting at Raj Bhavan. “Government officers in the state do not follow the rule of law. Their actions are far distanced from constitutional norms and conduct regulations. They’re playing with fire,” the governor said. Trinamool senior and MP Saugata Roy contested the governor’s claims, saying: “Elections are conducted by the Election Commission and the State Election Commission. The Election Commission gave certificates to West Bengal after the 2021 assembly polls. The governor is denigrating constitutional bodies.” Roy said Dhankhar “keeps talking about his constitutional responsibilities, but doesn’t heed the constitutional direction that the governor should act on the advice of the council of ministers”. Dhankhar also cautioned assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee, who was standing beside him, over the tone and tenor of the letters Banerjee wrote to him over the bills that the Speaker claimed were pending with Raj Bhavan. “No file is pending with the governor with respect to any bill. I have raised issues on the Howrah Bill but am yet to get a response from the government,” Dhankhar said. Speaker Banerjee was taken aback with the manner in which the governor chose the assembly premises to say all these. “He (governor) could have called the media at Raj Bhavan. What he did is unwarranted and discourteous. I can only say that I stick to what I wrote to the governor,” Banerjee said. Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury endorsed the governor’s contention on democracy in regard to local body elections. “Only 34% of voters could exercise their right during the last panchayat polls and 70 people were killed. The State Election Commission should ensure that local body elections (civic polls and panchayat polls) are held peacefully,” he said. CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty held that what Dhankhar had said was “half-truth”. “I fail to understand whether he gave the speech as governor or as Jagdeep Dhankhar. What the governor said was half-truth. There is no denying that there is lack of democracy in Bengal. But the situation in Tripura or Delhi is no different,” he said. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said: “The governor has said what we have been saying for quite some time. Terror rules supreme in Bengal. Democracy is in peril.” Dhankhar also accused the Speaker of “blacking out” the governor’s address in the assembly and questioned running the Maa canteens before budgetary allocations were made. The governor wanted the CM to place the inquiry report on the purchase of materials for Covid management. “Any communication from the Union government to the state government doesn’t reach Raj Bhavan when a copy should reach me,” Dhankhar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/guv-lashes-out-most-politicians-term-diatribe-unwarranted-half-truths/articleshow/89126617.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||BJP rebels: Central leaders ignoring Bengali ‘asmita’||Kolkata: Rebel BJP leaders stepped up their defiance a day after the “temporary suspension”, training guns this time against the party’s central leaders and likening its 2021 assembly poll fight to the Battle of Plassey in which the British defeated Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah because of bad war strategy and the “enemy within”.“The BJP national (organization) secretary had belittled the Bengal BJP leadership. He said the party would win Bengal polls without Dilip Ghosh and Subrata Chatterjee. All these leaders from outside left the Hastings office by noon after election results poured in,” suspended state BJP spokesperson Jayprakash Majumdar said on Tuesday. Calling party rival Mamata Banerjee one of the “finest election strategists”, Majumdar further said: “You all know how Mamata played to Bengali ‘asmita’ while our party sent central leaders to Bongaon where people don’t understand Hindi.”Former Bengal BJP vice-president Ritesh Tiwari said much the same while taking a dig at the party brass. “Leaders were brought in from outside giving Trinamool a chance to coin the outsider term. I had alerted them that bringing in people from other parties will not go down well with BJP, but none would listen,” Tiwari said. Majumdar spilled the beans, saying the BJP brass didn’t even allow a frank analysis of the poll debacle. “Those who made an effort to do analysis were silenced, their microphones in virtual meetings were muted.” He said BJP activities against post-poll violence were “confined to courtrooms” and there was no plan to reach out to suffering party activists. “Unlike Mamata, who hit the streets and mobilized people against the Left Front government from 2008, our party restricted the battle to courtrooms.” Majumdar pointed out that the newly appointed state president had been three years in the organization, while the “all powerful” state (organization) secretary was in the party for two years. Both leaders said their “suspension” was pre-planned. “The new state president had issued a notice dissolving all committees. Let the state president come clean when the BJP state executive formed the new disciplinary committee,” Majumdar said.Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said: “He (Jayprakash) told the media, he didn’t ask anything from me. And I don’t know how far he is eligible to raise questions on the disciplinary committee.”BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said these leaders’ problems couldn’t be resolved by talking to media. “There are ways to resolve problems within our party,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-rebels-central-leaders-ignoring-bengali-asmita/articleshow/89126619.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Pench tiger ‘Mystery Male’ injured in hit-and-run on NH7||NAGPUR: In a hit-and-run case, an adult male tiger (T1) from Chorbahuli range of Mansinghdeo wildlife sanctuary in Pench Tiger Reserve, also known as ‘Mystery Male’, was injured on Tuesday. The tiger is suspected to have been hit by a speeding vehicle either in the night or during the wee hours while crossing the NH7. The incident came to light around 10.15am when a family, which was on its way to Nagpur from Narsinghpur to treat its son, had stopped close to the guide wall near Paoni to attend nature’s call. A woman from the family, aged around 58, went a little deep in the forest and didn’t have any idea about the tiger that was lying injured. She learnt about the tiger when it attacked her. Hearing her screams, her husband, aged around 64, rushed towards her but he too was attacked. Both suffered minor injuries and were admitted to a private hospital in the city and were discharged in the evening. Nagpur deputy conservator of forest Bharat Singh Hada said the tiger was tranquillized by a team of veterinarians from Transit Treatment Centre, Seminary Hills, and shifted to Gorewada. “It seems to be a case of a road hit. The incident must have occurred at night and the tiger couldn’t have walked due to injuries. The spot where the tiger was found is an FDCM forest,” Hada said. Deputy director of Wildlife Research and Training Centre Dr Vinod Dhoot said the 10-year-old tiger is critical as its left hind limb has been fractured. “We have administered pain killers, saline and antibiotics,” he added. This is the second incident in the last three years involving a tiger in a road accident. On February 2, 2019, a tiger was seriously injured after a speeding car hit the animal near Harnakund village. The latest incident has again brought to the fore the curtailed wildlife mitigation measures, that were reduced under political pressure. Milind Pariwakam, road ecologist and member of the transport working group of the IUCN-Connectivity Conservation Specialist Group, said these repeated accidents are due to the lack of fencing and noise barriers as tools to mitigate the negative impacts of NH7. “NGO Srushti Paryavaran Mandal had suggested these in February 2016 but they were not accepted by the high court,” he said. Pariwakam added, “In February 2019, I had suggested the inclusion of fencing and noise barriers, but this was rejected by then chief wildlife warden NH Kakodkar.” The ecologist said Madhya Pradesh forest department supported such demands and got 42km of fencing and noise barriers implemented, making the mitigation measures safer for wildlife. “Maharashtra forest department should learn from such measures. We just need about 17km of fencing to make our mitigation structures more effective,” he added. \ Udayan Patil of Srushti Paryavaran Mandal said, “WII scientists and forest department officials who forgot to include these measures initially while clearing the project and later on rejected the suggestions are responsible for the deaths of these wild animals. Every tiger taken out from the wild population is akin to a case of poaching.” The incident exposes how poorly the mitigation measures have been implemented. In 2012, a Wildlife Institute of India (WII) report had suggested 48 structures on NH7. These included 16 underpasses, 15 bridges, and 17 culverts. But due to political pressure, the WII itself reduced the mitigation measures to two 750 metre and one 300 metre underpasses. However, a WII survey in 2020 revealed that there was a 127% increase in the use of wildlife underpasses. In 2019, 155 crossings by tigers were recorded while in 2020, 352 crossings were recorded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/pench-tiger-injured-in-hit-and-run-on-nh7/articleshow/89124614.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The petitioner, Jaya Thakur, a Congress worker, contended that the Constitution provides for election to panchayat and urban local bodies before the expiry of their five-year term. She said that the term of panchayat bodies and urban local bodies had expired in 2019, but fresh elections have not taken place till now.In the previous hearing, the State Election Commission had told the court that it wrote to the state government several times for holding elections to panchayat and urban local bodies but in the wake of the Corona pandemic, the state government didn't issue notification for the election. During hearing of the petition on Tuesday, the state government sought time to file a reply in the matter.

Congress retorted that BJP should look at keeping its own house in order, pointing out Guna MP K P Yadav’s letter of complaint against Scindia supporters to BJP national president JP Nadda. “Kamal Nath has told Digvijaya Singh that he is the third son of Indira Gandhi,” Mishra said. “I heard the conversation, which was so dictatorial. There is no democracy left in Congress. After listening to the viral video of two former CMs in an amusing argument in the presence of party workers, one can only think about the future of Congress,” the minister remarked. Former PM Indira Gandhi had called Nath her ‘third son’ when she came to Chhindwara to campaign for him in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections. It was the first time Nath was elected to Lok Sabha. Reacting to Mishra, Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said, “Our leaders talk to each other. Narottam Mishra should stop bothering about Congress and look into the disputes between leaders in his party first. He should speak about the dispute between state BJP chief V D Sharma and CM Chouhan.

And more than 50% of these deceased were aged above 60 years. The youngest among the deceased was aged 5 days old, who died in Gwalior district on January 20 and the eldest person to die was 97-year-old, who died of Covid-19 in Ujjain district. Majority of the patients who died of Covid-19 in this wave till January 23—were one thing in common, 13 had either diabetes or hypertension or both, said sources. Majority of the deaths took place in past one week, i.e. between January 16 and January 23—when 23 deaths took place. Thus overall out of 37 deaths, 62% deaths took place in the past one week. Prior to this only 14 deaths took place in the first 15 days of this month. Among the 37 deceased, 7 were female patients and remaining 30 were males. The total case fatality rate (CFR) which is the ratio of total confirmed deaths to total confirmed cases, has been far lower compared to the previous waves, said sources. The CFR in second wave was above 0.50 and in the third wave it has been below 0.10 on maximum times, barring in the first week of January when cases were low and a few deaths were reported, and the CFR touched 0.32, sources said. Sources said that the death rates has been lower in this wave compared to the previous wave and it could primarily be attributed to the fact that now majority of the population has been vaccinated now. Apart from vaccination, it is important to ensure that people strictly adhere to the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, it is only then that we could expect that third wave wanes away, added sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/35-of-37-patients-who-died-of-covid-in-jan-had-comorbilities/articleshow/89126674.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Bhopal||MP HC go-ahead for offline exams in colleges, varsities||BHOPAL: A division bench of MP high court on Tuesday allowed offline exams in colleges and universities of the state with the presence of 50% of the students in a day. With this, the court disposed of a petition filed by a law student from Rani Durgavati University, Jabalpur, seeking a direction to hold online exams for college and university students in the wake of the third wave of Covid. Deputy advocate general Swapnil Ganguly, who appeared on behalf of the state government in the case, told the court that students infected by Coronavirus would also be given a chance to appear in the exams two weeks after the exam date under complete Corona protocol. President of Law Students' Association in Rani Durgavati University, Vishal Baghel, in his petition contended that the university had decided to organise exams in offline mode towards the end of the last year because the Corona cases had dropped drastically then. But, the situation has completely changed now. We are amidst the third wave of Coronavirus. Cases of Coronavirus are spiralling. In such a situation, holding exams offline won't be advisable. Under pressure from the students' unions, the university administration postponed the exams which were slated to begin from January 20 but it has only been postponed by a week. The exams will be taken through offline mode by January 27, which is risky for the health and lives of the students. He prayed the court to direct the university administration to hold exams online. The division bench of chief justice R V Malimath and Justice Purusendra Kaurav had asked the deputy advocate general to take instructions in the matter from the state government. Ganguly on behalf of the state government told the court that the exams would be held in offline mode and with the presence of 50% of the capacity students. Students, who have Corona infection, would also be given a chance to take the exams later on. Following arguments from both sides, the court allowed the state government to organise college/university exams offline and disposed of the petition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-go-ahead-for-offline-exams-in-colleges-varsities/articleshow/89126676.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||LDF govt targets Lok Ayukta; ‘black act’, warns legal experts||Thiruvananthapuram: The state government is set to amend the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act through an ordinance to prevent any verdict of the anti-corruption agency from being binding on it, a move that legal experts said was an attempt by the executive to render the institution of Lok Ayukta toothless and to usurp authority that clearly belonged to the higher judiciary under the constitutionally mandated principle of “separation of powers”. The draft of Kerala Lok Ayukta (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 has been sent to governor Arif Mohammed Khan for his assent. The draft ordinance has proposed amendments to the principal act — Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, 1999 — by replacing sub-section (1) of its section 14. The section empowers the Lok Ayukta or an Upa Lok Ayukta to make a declaration in its report that a public servant, against whom the complaint is made, should not continue to hold his/her post if the allegation against him/her is substantiated. "Where the competent authority is the governor, the government of Kerala or the Chief Minister, he or it shall accept the declaration," it further states. It is this part of the section that makes a verdict binding on the government and is now proposed to be amended. The amendment says, “where the competent authority is the governor, or the chief minister or the government of Kerala, he or it may either accept, or reject the declaration, after giving an opportunity of being heard”. With the chief minister away in the US for treatment, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan took it upon himself to explain the government’s rationale for the amendment, saying that it was aimed at curbing the “unbridled” powers of Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, the only act of its kind in the country that didn’t have any provision for appeal against its verdict. The opposition pointed out that the amendment has been proposed when complaints against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over utilization of the CM's distress relief fund and higher education minister R Bindu over the re-appointment of Kannur university vice chancellor are pending before the Lok Ayukta. Opposition leader V D Satheesan has sent a letter to the governor urging him not to give assent to the ordinance. The rulings of Lok Ayukta had presented some embarrassing moments for the LDF, including the one that led to the resignation of former minister K T Jaleel in the previous government for appointment of his relative in the Minorities Development Corporation. Former UpaLok Ayukta Justice K P Balachandran said the proposed amendment shows that the government wants to save itself from any verdict that is against it and also sends out a message that only those who play to the government's tunes are wanted in the post. “It is clear that the government is not interested in maintaining the independence of the body. If the amendment is incorporated, it would be better to dissolve the body,” he said. MR Rajendran Nair, founder president of anti-corruption people’s movement-Kerala and senior lawyer in the Kerala high court dismissed fears of “unbridled” authority. “The constitution is based on principle of separation of powers. A judicial function is being exercised by Lok Ayukta. Once they exercise it, only a higher judicial forum can address it. According to the law, there is no appeal. If there is a feeling that the LA has acted without following the law or in a biased manner, then they can be taken to a higher judicial forum, namely the high court or Supreme Court”, he said. It is learnt that law minister P Rajeeve had met the governor on Monday before sending the draft ordinance to him and explained the proposed amendments. Legal experts said the governor, if he wishes, can send the draft back to the government asking it to reconsider but he will have to sign the ordinance if the government sticks to its stand. The ordinance was reportedly approved during the last cabinet meeting. Minister Rajeeve said the process for ordinance had begun last April during the tenure of the previous government. Two high court verdicts had noted that the Lok Ayukta had only recommendatory jurisdiction and the advocate general also gave a legal opinion that Section 14 of the act was in violation of a few constitutional articles, the minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-govt-targets-lok-ayukta-black-act-warns-legal-experts/articleshow/89126679.cms||---

---||Delhi||Why the delay in appointment of permanent VC, asks JNUTA||New Delhi: With M Jagadesh Kumar completing a year as Jawaharlal Nehru University’s acting vice-chancellor, JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Tuesday raised several questions to the education ministry over the non-appointment of a permanent VC despite it being over a year. The teachers’ body claimed that significant policy decisions were being pushed through by Kumar and that they would have far-reaching consequences for the varsity. “Directives issued by the Ministry of Education and provisions of JNU’s own statutes explicitly forbid vice-chancellors whose tenures are formally over from taking decisions on policy matters of a substantive nature. Several other central universities that had a similar vacancy have had new appointees. What then explains the delay in the case of JNU?” it asked. In a statement, JNUTA also said that “financial bottlenecks due to administrative incompetence have meant that regular academic and outreach programmes have suffered and that several faculty members have had to face cutbacks in research support.” “Regarding filling of teaching posts, particularly the reserved positions, there have been inordinate delays due to wilful misrepresentation of the roster system by the vice-chancellor, to rectify (for) which faculty members had to move court. While the new roster still has many limitations that have been pointed out by the petitioners, the administration has made no attempts to rectify these anomalies,” JNUTA said. Claiming that the functioning of the university over the past year was “less than satisfactory,” the teachers’ body asked, “Can a caretaker VC be allowed to run the university as per his own personal whims and fancies? Can the ministry afford to remain silent in such a situation...? and how soon will the ministry announce a full-time VC for JNU?” Senior officials of the university administration could not be reached for a comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-the-delay-in-appointment-of-permanent-vc-asks-jnuta/articleshow/89125230.cms||TNN
---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation engages to keep squatters away from Chandni Chowk||NEW DELHI: Taking strict steps to ensure encroachments won’t be back on the roadsides in Chandni Chowk after their removal, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has deployed 90 civil defence volunteers in the area. They have been divided into 29 beats for checking illegal encroachments from the Red Fort to the Fatehpur Masjid, said an official. This is in addition to their task of managing the rickshaws on this stretch and helping the pedestrians. “We have carried anti-encroachment drives with multiple departments at least 65 times since April 2021 and simultaneously written to Delhi Police to ensure the stretches remain free. During these drives, we covered 135km area and cleared all encroachments from the public land. While the action will continue, we have asked the civil defence staff to immediately report to us in case any encroachment reappears,” said the official. The corporation carried out a major anti-encroachment drive in and around Chandni Chowk in the past five days following Delhi High Court’s direction and traders’ complaints about the increasing number of illegal squatters by the roads despite the area being a no-squatting and no-hawking zone. On Monday, encroachments were removed from a 3.5km area, including HC Sen Marg, Cycle Market, around Parade Ground parking, New Lajpat Rai Market, Netaji Subhash Marg, areas around Jain Mandir, and SRDC Road and confiscated 80 items. On Tuesday, it removed the encroachments around Shani Mandir. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Vypar Mandal, said the action was taken on Tuesday against illegal loading-unloading on public land. “The court has asked the civic body to submit an action-taken report in a week and the next hearing is scheduled on February 10,” he said, adding that notices were also served to the allotted tehbazari sites in the market, a no-squatting zone. “But the real challenge will come after the Republic Day celebrations,” Bhargava said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/n-corpn-engages-to-keep-squatters-away-from-chandni-chowk/articleshow/89125754.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Lok Ayukta powers curbed to fuel corruption’||Thiruvananthapuram/Kozhikode: Congress and BJP launched a scathing attack on the LDF government over its decision to amend the Lok Ayukta act saying it will curtail the anti-corruption body’s powers and fuel corruption. Opposition leader V D Satheesan wrote to governor Arif Muhammed Khan asking him not to give his assent to the ordinance as the government’s move comes at a time when complaints against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and higher education minister R Bindu are pending before the Lok Ayukta. A UDF delegation led by the opposition leader will meet the governor in this regard on Thursday.BJP state president K Surendran said the government has proved that it can go to any extent to protect the corrupt. K T Jaleel had to resign on the basis of the Lok Ayukta’s verdict and the CM’s move is to avoid such situations in the future, he said. The Lok Ayukta is already considering a petition against the chief minister that the funds from the CM’s distress relief fund have been granted to ineligible people, he pointed out.In his letter to the governor, the opposition leader said the proposed ordinance will curtail the Lok Ayukta’s powers to mere advisory in nature. This is against the very essence of the institution established to curb corruption and mismanagement. “Its role in preventing corruption and resolving common man’s grievances is huge. That is the main reason why, under Section 14 of the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, 1999, it has been given the authority to direct corrupt public officials to quit office. It acts as a powerful deterrent to public officials who shamelessly plunder public coffers and taking away its powers will spell doom to the entire institution,” he said. Satheesan said Lok Ayukta is the only effective tool left in the state after the amendment of the prevention of corruption act mandating that pre-permission is required to register a case against the ministers or officials. The government’s move to make the Lok Ayukta toothless also involves a covert motive to protect itself if allegations of corruption come up against the proposed Silverline project, he said. Satheesan added that when the CPM national leadership had made it clear in the Parliament that the Lok Ayukta should be strengthened, the Left government in the state is going against it.Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said the government is trying to clip Lok Ayukta’s wings in the fear that it may face a backlash from the court. The anti-corruption body is considering several government policies and projects. He said when he was the chief minister, several petitions were filed against him in the Lok Ayukta, but those were dealt with legally. Trying to destroy the organisation itself is anti-democratic, he said. He said the government should make clear why it was so urgent to come up with amendments for an act that was passed in the assembly by the E K Nayanar-led government in 1999, when the assembly is set to meet next month. "CPM is planning to carry out corruption by making Lokayukta just a scarecrow. It is the latest example of CPM trying to control all Constitutional institutions," said BJP’s K Surendran. IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty said the LDF government has made Lokayukta irrelevant by curtailing its powers and added that the government will have to face strong protests against the move. He said that the move is to set the stage for the ruling front to act as per its will. "It is a decision which will affect the rights of people. It is clear why the state government is now thinking of Lokayukta as an inconvenience," he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/lok-ayukta-powers-curbed-to-fuel-corruption/articleshow/89126682.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM state secy breaks silence||Thiruvananthapuram: CPM has finally reacted to the clash between CPM and CPI workers in Pathanamthitta. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the party would investigate the CPM-CPI clashes in Pathanamthitta. “CPM and CPI workers are not supposed to attack one another. We will enquire what happened there,” said CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan to reporters in the capital on Tuesday.The video of two CPI activists getting thrashed at Angadical in Pathanamthitta had surfaced on Sunday. Later, CPI came out with an allegation that it was CPM sympathizers who beat up the party workers following a dispute that occurred on January 16 during an election to Angadical cooperative bank. The persons, who were attacked in that video, were identified as party workers by CPI. Kodumon CPI local committee secretary Suresh Babu and MK Udayakumar were assaulted, CPI sources had said.On Tuesday, CPI mouthpiece Janayugom published an editorial condemning the attack as ‘goonda attack’. Without naming the CPM, the editorial said the attacks in Pathanamthitta in connection with a service cooperative bank election stooped to the level of criminal-goonda activity. It’s a fascist strategy,” it stated.When asked about the severe online criticism poet-lyricist Rafeeq Ahammed had to face from ‘CPM workers and supporters’, Balakrishnan said that the CPM had no role in such attacks and the party was against such attacks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-state-secy-breaks-silence/articleshow/89126684.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Conversion rate of hospitalisation at 4%; 95% under home quarantine||Thiruvananthapuram: While the state capital has slipped into category C with stringent regulations, the hospitalization conversion rate in the district as on Tuesday was 4.04%. Going by the present figures the conversion rate in private hospitals is more than that of government hospitals. While private hospitals recorded a conversion rate of 2.13% as on Tuesday, in government Covid hospitals it was less than 1 % - 0.84%. About 95% of active cases are in home quarantine and the conversion rate in secondary line treatment centres and first line treatment centres are also below 1 % in the district.Contrary to the second wave, conversion rate with regard to oxygen beds, ICU and ventilators are also below 0.5%. The conversion rate for ventilators is the lowest; 0.07%.In the Medical College Hospital of around 28 cases in ICU, only five patients in the relatively young age category have developed Covid pneumonia. Remaining persons are elderly people with comorbidities. The health officials taking care of such patients said that they have other serious ailments and Covid has emerged as an added infection. One probable challenge for the district where conversion rate towards hospitalisation has been very low even after three weeks into the third wave is that elderly people with co-morbidities could fall prey to Omicron variant. “They are a category that has remained immune to the infection in the first two waves. Probability of these people falling sick in the third wave is higher. The next two weeks will be crucial in terms of all-cause mortality. At present our biggest challenge will be to save the lives of this category that we have managed to protect in the first two waves,” a health official said.The district’s low rate of hospitalization in the first three weeks of the wave despite active cases going above 45,000 is mainly due to the manner in which infection patterns remained in plateau mode in the district for many months post the second wave. “Many people acquired infection either after the second wave or towards the fag end of the second wave. This has resulted in them gaining neutralizing antibodies which could give them an immune cover against serious nature of infections. Also high rates of vaccination could result in hybrid immunity. Having said that, all these present trends should not be mistaken for a sense of calm. The next two weeks will be crucial for the district,” the health official added. The fact that many people are opting for home care and self-testing with the belief that vaccination could give them a protective cover has also eased the burden on hospital infrastructure. Delayed arrivals, brought dead cases, death in transit are possibilities which the health team is keen on averting at any cost at present. The vacancy percentage of ventilators in private and government hospitals was 64% and 83% respectively. As for ICU, 33 beds out of 68 in the government sector were vacant till Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/conversion-rate-of-hospitalisation-at-4-95-under-home-quarantine/articleshow/89126686.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The commission chairman Justice Antony Dominic has ordered the probe rejecting an inquiry report submitted by the City Police Commissioner in favour of the officer. The commission has also ordered to review a case registered by the Museum police against the school teacher related to the incident.The commission's order is against Riyaz Khan, sub inspector (grade) of Poojapura police station. Jackson, a teacher of St. Thomas School, Poonthura, is the petitioner. According to the petition, the incidents related to his complaint took place on April 22, 2021, in front of the Cotton Hill Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, while Jackson was waiting outside the school to pick up his daughter, who was attending higher secondary board exam.The petitioner alleged that SI Riyaz Khan and another civil police officer were on duty there as part of security cover for the electronic voting machines stored in the school ahead of the assembly election. The duo behaved rudely towards a few parents waiting outside the school. Witnessing this, Jackson intervened and questioned their attitude. But, the officers responded by verbally abusing him in front of his daughter. The officers also summoned their colleagues from Museum police station, who took the teacher to the station and booked him for obstructing the officers from discharging their duty. They also confiscated the registration certificate of his vehicle while taking him into custody.Justice Antony Dominic held in his order that the probe must be conducted by an officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. The commission also held that a mere quarrel does not amount to obstruction of duty and hence the case registered by the Museum police has to be reviewed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/hrc-orders-probe-against-cop-for-humiliating-teacher/articleshow/89126690.cms||---

Instead they are in the process of reviving a water body to ensure that they have a ready source of water. As part of reviving the paddy fields, the Amballoor Padasekhara Samithi and the Kazhakootam Krishi Bhavan are reviving a pond named ‘Kottayath pond’ that will supply water to the Kottayathu field which is a part of Amballoor field.The pond is 150 meters away from the field. In order to supply the water efficiently, a channel was made to transport the water from the pond to the field. The land preparation, pond revival and channel works have been finished and the farmers are now ready to sow the seeds after ten days. The works were done by 20 workers from the national rural employment scheme under the leadership of Amballoor Padasekhara Samithi and Paada Samrakshana Samithi.Along with the paddy variety ‘Jyothi’, the Padasekhara Samithi has also decided to cultivate black gram and green gram by dividing the 50 cents of land into three. The Kottayath pond has been abandoned for several years and it was filled with algae and the protection wall was also damaged. According to the officials, these works can be finished within ten days.“The area has been left barren for more than 25 years. Due to illegal land conversion, the water sources were also destroyed. So we had to find another source of water,” said Deepa S, agriculture officer.“During the summer season, the water level always decreases. The decision to revive the pond was taken in order to manage water scarcity in the area. Before three years, there were only 12 acres of paddy and now Amballoor alone has more than 40 acres of paddy cultivation,” said an official from Kazhakootam Krishi Bhavan.“The area was once known for its paddy cultivation and most of those areas were levelled for other purposes. We started retrieving our fields in the past five years. The number of farmers and fields has also increased. At first, the number of farmers was six and now it is 30,” said Shahjahan A, a member of Ambaloor Padasekhara Samithi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/water-scarcity-lead-way-to-revival-of-ponds-for-farming/articleshow/89126691.cms||---

Of the 2,85,365 active cases only 3.8% people are admitted at hospital or other treatment centres. Among the ones who are undergoing treatment in hospitals, only 0.7% require oxygen beds and 0.4% patients are in ICU. Hence there is no need to panic over the exponential increase in the number of cases, she said. Of the total 3,107 ICU beds in state, 1,328 are occupied by Covid and non-Covid cases, which amounts to only 42.7%. Among these Covid patients are 385 and 57% of ICU beds are vacant now. The state has a total of 2,293 ventilators of which only 14% are occupied by Covid and non-Covid patients, George added. The minister said that people aged between 20 and 30 years are affected the most during the third wave. Additionally, more healthcare workers are also getting infected and this is a matter of concern. On Tuesday, 506 healthcare workers tested positive. In the wake of more healthcare workers being infected, state health department has decided to appoint 4,971 people on a temporary basis at various hospitals, first and second-line treatment centres. The people who had worked in Covid brigade earlier will be given preference during this appointment, said the health minister. The department has also decided to set up Covid control rooms in all government medical college hospitals to coordinate Covid cases in respective districts. The minister said only category C patients will be treated at medical colleges and no hospitals shall refer patients in category A and B to medical colleges. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/57-icu-beds-are-vacant-in-state-minister/articleshow/89126693.cms||---

Torrent Pharma’s US revenues dropped 20% at Rs 235 crores in Q3FY22. “Due to the prolonged delays in reinspection of our US facilities on account of the pandemic, coupled with higher than anticipated pricing pressure, our US business has been adversely affected during this quarter,” said Samir Mehta, chairman, Torrent Pharma. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/torrent-pharma-net-profit-down-16-in-q3-fy22/articleshow/89126695.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘95% of properties in nagarpalikas are illegal’||AHMEDABAD: Just as the survey of buildings or properties with mandatory Building Use (BU) permission is on across the state, it has come to light that an estimated 95% of the 34 lakh-odd properties that come under the municipality or nagarpalika jurisdiction in Gujarat do not have legal BU permission, said senior urban development officials. The officials claim that the purpose of the sample survey of 8,000-odd buildings in the state is to help draft a legislation that will be a roadmap for every citizen to compulsorily get a BU permission for his/her property. The survey is expected to be completed by February 20. “The exercise was undertaken after the high court questioned, why despite the GRUDA Act, there were several buildings in Gujarat that were devoid of legal BU permission. The truth is that people in municipalities and municipal corporations never came forward to get BU permission due to revenue issues,” claims a senior urban development department official. While highlighting the issue within nagarpalikas, the official told TOI that in case of older buildings constructed before 2007, authorities or citizens did not really care whether properties were built on land with non-agricultural (NA) clearance and, in this process, avoided applying for BU permission. After 2008, the state government made NA permission compulsory ahead of applying for BU permission. “This flip-flop and lack of clarity on mandatory processes prior to BU requirement was the reason for this massive confusion. It also stopped people from coming forward. Now we are stuck with buildings which have 2-3 floors that are not part of the original building plans across municipalities and municipal corporations,” adds the UD official. He also pointed out that GRUDA Act or impact fee law was implemented without conducting a scientific study. “The anomaly of BU nod persisted despite the implementation of The Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorised Development Act in 2001, which was an effort to regularize buildings made prior to November 22, 2000. A decade later, the same Act was again brought into force to regularize buildings constructed prior to March 28, 2011. Both these efforts did not solve the issue of buildings without BU,” added the senior UD official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/95-of-properties-in-nagarpalikas-are-illegal/articleshow/89126696.cms||Paul John

The murals will be painted under the civic body’s ongoing cleanliness awareness campaign. “This is part of our campaign to bring awareness on issues such as waste management such as plastic segregation, wet and dry waste segregation and overall cleanliness habits of citizens. We have invited bids from private firms for this project. Zonal sanitation officers have been asked to identify walls along main roads which are visible to people on which murals can be painted,” said an AMC official. The official said the civic body, with public support, can achieve its targets. “Despite our door-to-door garbage collection service, many people dump their garbage on the roads. There are big dumpsters kept but people don’t bother to throw waste in the dumpster. These habits can be changed only with awareness,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/walls-in-city-to-get-cleanliness-murals/articleshow/89126699.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Bird Race: 356 species sighted in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The ‘Bird Race’ held on Sunday sighted 356 unique species of birds in one day. This represents about 50% of the total avian biodiversity in the state. The red-breasted goose was sighted for just the second time in the state, at Thol lake on the outskirts of the city. The red-breasted goose, a resident of Arctic Siberia, was spotted for the first time in Gujarat in January 2021 at Nalsarovar. This year too there were reports of it at Nalsarovar but it later went missing. It was then spotted at Thol lake during the bird race. Uday Vora, former chief conservator of forests and member of the Gujarat Bird Conservation Society, said that the major number of unique species, 174, were recorded in the coastal belt of Mahuva and Rajula. Vora said Nalsarovar, Thol and Vadla recorded 160-odd species. Of these, several species were common at all the three major lakes of Ahmedabad district. He said these 356 species were recorded at 235 sites in the state, including village ponds or makeshift ponds where rainwater accumulated. Sighting of 356 species represents about 50% of the total avian diversity in the state. He said the bird race was just a one-day affair and even with limited staff they managed to cover the entire state. The objective was to explore the greatest number of areas and teams were sent to places relatively less familiar to them. “Bird Race 2022, Gujarat, was probably a first-of-its-kind event in the country. Bharat Jethwa, an ornithologist who was part of the organizing committee said that with the success of the bird race, the organisers have got offers from birdwatchers in Odisha, Assam and Madhya Pradesh, to hold similar events there. Another organizer said counts should also be taken, and a few days should be added to the event so that actual bird numbers in the state could be mapped, suggesting that the Gujarat forest department take it up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bird-race-356-species-sighted-in-state/articleshow/89126701.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

He was nabbed after the police managed to track his bike using a traffic challan. The arrested man has been identified as Prem Kumar, a resident of Uttam Nagar. He was previously involved in at least 10 criminal cases. Around 6 pm on Saturday, a call was received at Sarai Rohilla police station that the woman had been stabbed. A police team that reached the spot took her to a hospital. The woman told police that while she was alone at her house, a man barged in and demanded money at knifepoint. When she tried to run out of her house, the accused stabbed her in her stomach, shoulder and snatched her mobile phone. “Our teams managed to trace the registration number of the motorcycle used by the suspect. They then obtained the bike’s challan details and found that one Randhir Singh was fined for riding without a helmet in Delhi on December 24, 2021. A team visited the address and found that the motorcycle was being used by one Prem Kumar,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi. “Kumar was then tracked and arrested from Nawada village,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/35-yr-old-held-for-stabbing-robbing-former-colleagues-60-yr-old-mother-in-n-delhi/articleshow/89125209.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation moots no tax for homes under 500sqft||NAGPUR: Citing it as a gift to Nagpurians on the eve of 75th Republic Day, all political parties in the general body of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) decided to give tax exemption to residential properties measuring 500 sq ft and below. The decision is likely to benefit over 2.5 lakh property owners but cause a loss of Rs120 crore to the cash-strapped civic body. TOI on January 5 had reported about NMC’s property tax consultative committee’s decision to recommend the exemption on the lines of Mumbai. The proposal was tabled before the general body on Tuesday. Pronouncing the resolution, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said, “Chief minister should have taken decision for the entire state but limited it to Mumbai. Even, the second capital was not selected. Therefore, we took our own decision. The NMC administration should ensure approval from the government,” he said. NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram said, “There are likely over 2.5 lakh properties of 500 sq ft and below. Annual demand of these properties is around Rs30 crore per annum. Also, there is an arrears of Rs90 crore on these properties,” he said. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre suggested implementation of the benefit to eligible persons from January 25. “There can be no better gift for this people on 75th Republic Day. Arrears of Rs 90 crore reveal they are unable to pay the tax. Losing revenue of Rs30 crore per annum will not make any difference to NMC. We can easily manage this by bringing new revenue sources,” he said. Dharampal Meshram, corporator from Thakre’s party, differed with the latter’s suggestion. “NMC administration should first study whether the government would pay the revenue loss in case of Mumbai. We should demand reimbursement from government,” he said. He said that there is a possibility a few properties in slum areas not getting the benefit. “Few shanties have an area of over 500 sq ft. Such persons are ineligible to pay tax. Some criteria should be fixed to extend the benefit,” he said. Leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve, BSP group leader Jitendra Godeshwar and others supported the resolution. An NMC official said that chances are flats in some areas can become eligible for the benefit. “Their owners are capable and do not need exemption,” he said. Thakre said a proper team should be formed to implement and give orders to government. As per NMC’s data, there are around 6.5 lakh properties in the city, which means 38.5% are likely to benefit. NMC’s officials denied having any information about the criteria framed to extend benefits to eligible people in Mumbai. Cabinet had approved exemption as Shiv Sena had promised it during 2017 municipal elections. The state’s urban development had stated decision will be implemented from April 1. Around 16.14 lakh residential properties are likely to get relief of Rs462 crore by decision taken by MVA government led by Uddhav Thackeray. Immediately after cabinet’s decision, three legislators from the city — Congress city president Vikas Thakre, BJP city president Pravin Datke and Krishna Khopde — had requested the CM to extend the benefit to entire state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nmc-moots-no-tax-for-homes-under-500sqft/articleshow/89124607.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

However, the silver lining for the city was the fact that 5,978 patients were discharged. That translates to about 13% more discharges than new cases. The city had not witnessed a drop in active cases in at least 2.5 months. On the other hand, mortality due to Covid-19 continued to rise in the city, from 6 on Monday to 10, the highest in the past eight months. The last time the city had recorded 10 deaths was on May 19 last year when it was still reeling from the impact of the second wave. With the update, the daily mortality rate for the city rose to 0.2% compared to about 0.1% two days ago. City-based hospitals said that while Omicron is the dominant variant, the cases of Delta are still prevalent, and genetic sequencing will be able to pinpoint whether the deaths are caused by the new or the old variant. Ahmedabad in the past five days has recorded the deaths of 35 patients at the average of seven. “Hospitalization is rising steadily, and those with existing comorbidities and those who are above 65 years of age need intensive care,” said a senior city-based critical care specialist. “It is likely that mortality is higher in this group.” The test positivity rate (TPR) for the city on Tuesday was 29%, as it was on Monday. However, against 15,000-odd tests on Monday, the number rose to 18,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/more-discharges-than-new-covid-cases-recorded-in-city/articleshow/89126702.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Releases deferred, multiplexes left deserted||By: Kaif Shaikh AHMEDABAD: Deferred releases of new films and rapid spike in coronavirus infections over the past two weeks have left multiplexes and cinema halls across Ahmedabad deserted again. Footfalls have fallen significantly over the past three weeks, compared to December. Theatres are again forlorn as new movie releases are being held off, causing distress in the industry. Jigar Nayee, unit manager of a Ghatlodia multiplex, said, “We saw a 50% decrease in footfalls in the first two weeks of January and now it is almost as if there is no business. While December suggested a recovery and greater inflows of people, business has dried up over the past three weeks. We now run three shows a day instead of six. Business is usually curtailed in February and March due to exams, but this time the situation seems grave.” Multiplex owners are forced to cancel shows and downsize operations to reduce overheads. Ahmedabad-based WideAngle Cinema reduced its number of shows per day from 30 to 6 due to nearly 90% less occupancy and cancelled night shows. “This is also due to movie releases being cancelled or postponed. We have been screening the same old movies for almost a month,” said Neeraj Ahuja, manager of the multiplex. Interestingly, even cinemas which have a fully outdoor set-up are not doing business, amid the ongoing third wave of Covid-19. Drive-In cinema in the city, which used to run at near-full capacity every day in December, has now come down to one screening a day. Anand Bhatt, manager of the cinema, said, “Because of the curfew timings and the outdoor screen only suitable for night shows, we cannot organize more than one show a day. The theatre has a capacity of about 600 cars but only 10-15 show up in a day. December made us hopeful with new releases and increased footfalls, but unfortunately that didn't last long.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/releases-deferred-multiplexes-left-deserted/articleshow/89126703.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Restaurateurs seek police support||AHMEDABAD: Even though the state government announced a change in guidelines permitting restaurants to deliver food round the clock, only a few continued delivering till late after restrictions eased from Sunday. A major hindrance was delivery personnel and restaurant workers being stopped by police at check points during curfew hours from 10pm onwards. Representatives of Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, Gujarat, urged the Ahmedabad police commissioner for aid. A representation was made on Tuesday. “We asked the Ahmedabad police commissioner to allow people with identity proof to pass during curfew hours. Our businesses have been hit over the past two years and permitting deliveries round-the-clock is one way for restaurants to sustain. A lot of students, IT professionals, resident doctors and youngsters tend to order in food late at night and this brings us business,” said Narendra Somani, president, HRA, Gujarat. A copy of the representation was also sent to director general of police, Gujarat. HRA estimates suggest that roughly 85% of hoteliers’ and restaurateurs’ revenues come from dine-in business during the evening. However, this has taken a major hit with the curfew being in place from 10pm onwards and with Covid-19 cases witnessing a massive rise. “Permitting deliveries will help restaurants sustain when dine-in footfalls have remained less. We will be grateful if restaurant staffers and food delivery workers are allowed to move during curfew hours with proper ID cards or the department must make provision for curfew passes,” said Somani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/restaurateurs-seek-police-support/articleshow/89126704.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||47L new names in revised voter list||Ahmedabad: Gujarat’s revised electoral rolls have added 47.29 lakh new names since the last assembly polls in 2017, taking the total number of voters in the state to 4.85 crore. This is an increase of 13.03 lakh voters since 2021. As many as 19.83 lakh voters have been deleted from the list since 2017—either they have migrated or are dead or because of duplications, the names have been struck off. Of these, around 25% or 5.31 lakh names were deleted in the revised electoral rolls published this month. In 2021, a total of 3.92 lakh names were deleted. The data reveals that in the electoral rolls revised in January 2020, two months before the Covid outbreak, 4.60 lakh voters had been added while in two years 9.23 lakh names were deleted from the list. Anupam Anand, CEO Gujarat, said, “As per the ECI guidelines, we have aggressively tried to enroll maximum possible new voters through various sensitization activities. The ECI has issued directions for dynamic updation of the voter list and so we expect a greater number of new voters before the 2022 polls. We request all stakeholders to come forward for enrolment.” The officials said that there had been a massive push to enroll electors since 2020 owing to local body elections. Also, for the past two years both the parties have been going all out to ensure that young supporters are enrolled and the respective party gets maximum benefit. The officials said that just before the 2017 election some 8.8 lakh voters were added to the rolls and the same in 2019 was 8.6 lakh. Hence, ahead of election, the parties ensure that there is maximum enrolment. The officers said that the deletion of nearly 5.3 lakh names in the revised rolls, against an average of 4 lakh every year, needed to be looked into. They believe the numbers may have reduced because of duplication, or the voters may have migrated due to fear of Covid. BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, the party’s youth and women’s wing have been conducting extensive activities to reach out to new voters and encourage them to enroll their names. “Young voters and women are always with the saffron brigade,” he said. Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “The party had launched a special drive to ensure that the voters from our pockets are not left out and that more youths came forward to register themselves. Besides, we had written several letters to the election commission regarding deletion of names from the voters’ list.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/47l-new-names-in-revised-voter-list/articleshow/89126707.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The awardees include Swami Sachchidananda for Padma Bhushan, and Dr Lata Desai, Dr JM Vyas, Malji Desai, Savji Dholakia, Ramila Gamit, Guruprasad Mohapatra and Khalil Dhantejvi for Padma Shri. Mohapatra, a Gujarat-cadre IAS officer, and Dhantejvi, a poet and ghazal maestro, were posthumously conferred the award. Swami Sachchidananda, a noted Gujarati author based in Dantali, Anand, has also won literary honours earlier. Dr JM Vyas, vice-chancellor of National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU), told TOI that it was a moment of great pride for the forensic science fraternity in Gujarat and across India. “I feel humbled and deeply honoured. It has been a long journey and I am happy to be associated with some of the landmark institutions in the field of forensic sciences in India,” he said. Maljibhai Desai, associated with Gandhi Ashram at Zilia in Patan district, and former MLA, told TOI that he has been in public life for the past seven decades. “I have worked as a panchayat pramukh and as an MLA and am satisfied with my contribution to education and rural development sectors. It feels good that I could inspire a few to continue the work,” he said. Mohapatra’s colleagues were ecstatic and termed the Padma Shri a fitting tribute for the late bureaucrat’s tireless work. “Ahmedabad would remember him for the mega projects he set in motion, introducing the model roads and laying the foundation for green projects at Pirana,” said his former colleague. Khalil Makrani, who passed away in Vadodara last year at the age of 82, wrote under his pen name Khalil Dhantejvi. A doyen of Gujarati ghazals, he has not studied beyond class IV, but his renditions enthralled connoisseurs across the globe. His famous poem ‘Ab main ration ki kataron mein nazar aata hoon, apne kheton se bichhadne ki sazaa pata hoon’ was sung by Jagjit Singh. Dr Lata Desai and her husband Dr Anil founded the Society for Education, Welfare and Action-Rural (SEWA Rural) in 1980 in Jhagadia, Bharuch. The couple had returned from the US to dedicate their lives to rural development. Her family said that the award was a huge honour for the work carried out in the past four decades. Diamond baron Savji Dholakia was honoured for his social work initiatives. Ramila Gamit could well be termed the ‘Sanitation Woman of Gujarat’, having built 700 toilets in different villages of Tapi with her team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/padma-honours-for-8-from-gujarat/articleshow/89126710.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||6 from Gujarat on way to US abducted in Turkey||AHMEDABAD: As Gujarat contends with the news of four from the state freezing to death near the US border, it has emerged that two families from a Gandhinagar village have gone missing en route to the US via Turkey. These two families comprise six members, according to Gandhinagar Police. Sources in police said that two different Patel families from a village in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar had left for the US via Istanbul. The sources said that they were abducted by human traffickers in Istanbul and have been held to ransom. “One family consists of Tejas Patel, his wife Alka, and their son Divya,” said an officer of Gandhinagar Police. “The second family’s members are Suresh Patel, his wife Shobha, and their daughter Foram. They had left their village for the US in the last week of December or the first week of January.” The officer said that the Indian embassy in Istanbul received a complaint about the abduction from the relatives and friends of the victims. A team of the CID (crime) has been trying to reconstruct the families’ itinerary: how they went to Istanbul and how they intended to reach the US. The officer refused to name the village because of the ongoing investigation. Jagdish Patel, his wife, and two minor children who perished near the US border had been sent off on their travels by an agent of their taluka. Police sources said the same shadowy travel agent may be involved in sending the two families to Istanbul. Jagdish Patel, 35; his wife, Vaishali, 33; and their children Vihanga, 12, and Dharmik, 3, were found dead near the Canada-US border. They were reportedly separated from a larger group of Indians who made it across the border to the US in -35 degrees celsius temperature. Their bodies were found just 10m from the US border on the Canadian side.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/6-from-guj-on-way-to-us-abducted-in-turkey/articleshow/89126713.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Office-bearers of the Surat firm showed turnover of Rs 46 crore and Rs 31 crore in 2015 and 2016, respectively, but showed employment benefit expenses at just Rs 3.38 lakh and Rs 1.81 lakh in these two years. On checking the records of the company, massive financial irregularities were found, and it was also revealed that they were working in nexus with Sang. The FIR says that Sang had carried out dummy transactions to settle hawala accounts.The other FIR states that a resident of Navrangpura and chartered accountant, Vishal Kapuria, in connivance with “unknown Chinese nationals” floated a firm in Junagadh in 2011. Using the firm, they had in 2011 announced an investment scheme with the promise of doubling investments. They later cheated citizens of Gujarat of Rs 360 crore, the FIR states.

---||Ahmedabad||Love or hate China, you cannot ignore it: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: While hearing a case about anti-dumping duty levied on Chinese goods, a bench of the Gujarat high court made a passing comment on Tuesday that whether you love or hate China, you cannot ignore it. The high court has temporarily stayed implementation of the notification issued on Monday revoking the decision of levying anti-dumping duty on PVC flex films imported from China. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore was hearing a petition filed by one Qrex Flex Pvt Ltd against the designated authority’s withdrawal of anti-dumping duty on Chinese goods. The judges asked the central government whether there can be a uniform policy on this issue. The court was informed that the law mandates a quasi-judicial investigation and review in this subject. On the desperation by local industries against the revocation of anti-dumping duty, the judges commented, “At the end of the day, whether you love China or hate China, one thing is certain that you cannot ignore China.” According to the case details, the central government had imposed anti-dumping duty on import of PVC flex films from China in August 2016 for five years. As the arrangement was nearing an end in August 2021, the association of industries dealing in the goods requested the government for a review and extension in order to protect local industries. On June 30, 2021, the Centre extended levying of anti-dumping duty for six months; the period was to end on January 31. But in October 2021, the Director General of Trade Remedies recommended withdrawal of the duty citing reduced import of this goods from China. The association of local industries approached the Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) against the recommendation. A week before the end of the extension period, the Centre issued a notification on Monday and revoked the protection for local industries. The petitioner approached the HC and submitted that a special bench at CESTAT is not available and there is no likelihood of a decision on revocation of the duty in such a short time. The HC suggested that till the time the tribunal decides on the appeal, the court may stay operation of notification for four weeks. However, additional solicitor general Devang Vyas requested the court to grant a couple of days so that he may consult the authority on this issue. The HC has posted further hearing on Thursday and sought the government’s response. It has stayed the notification’s implementation till the Centre clarifies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-love-or-hate-china-you-cannot-ignore-it/articleshow/89126720.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice to I-T department for tax on death compensation||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has issued a notice to the Income-Tax department after a petition questioned the tax demand on death compensation granted by a US court. The compensation was awarded by the court to the family of Trupti Dalal, a victim of 1986 Pan Am flight 73 hijacking incident. Kalpesh Dalal has filed a petition in the HC objecting to I-T department’s notice issued on March 31, 2021 seeking to levy tax on the compensation amount. His wife Trupti was one of the 43 victims of the terror attack on the flight in September 1986. It had taken off from Mumbai for New York and landed in Karachi for a layover when four gunmen took control of the aircraft and killed 20 people. Dalal’s advocate submitted that the Libyan government took responsibility for the incident and paid $1.6 billion in compensation to the US government in 2004. The victims’ kin then filed a lawsuit in a US court for compensation. A compensation of Rs 34,24,526 was disbursed to the Dalal family between 2012 and 2014. In 2014, when the I-T department issued a summons for investigation into receipt of the compensation, it was informed that the amount was received as a result of the lawsuit in the US. In 2021, the I-T department reopened the assessment considering that Dalal sought to escape income assessment. It once again issued notice to Dalal and sought to levy tax on the compensation amount. He has challenged the I-T notice and questioned whether the amount received towards compensation on US court’s order can be considered taxable at all. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore issued notice to the I-T department and sought a reply on whether death compensation amount awarded by a court of foreign country is liable to be taxed, and under which provisions of law it intends to levy the tax. The high court has temporarily stayed the department from proceeding further in this case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/court-notice-to-i-t-dept-for-tax-on-death-compensation/articleshow/89126721.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gold price touches Rs 50,500 per 10 gram||AHMEDABAD: In the run-up to the meeting of the US Federal Reserve and amid escalating geopolitical tensions, the gold price has continued its steady rally. The yellow metal was priced at Rs 50,500 per 10 gram on Tuesday in the Ahmedabad market. Even silver prices rallied on Tuesday surging past the Rs 64,000-mark to settle at Rs 64,500 per kg. Analysts predict an upward trend in gold prices in the days to come. “We expect a surge in prices of both gold and silver,” said Hemant Choksi, a city-based bullion trader. “Gold prices are expected to touch Rs 55,000 per 10 gram in the coming few days in the wake of escalating tensions with the US providing military aid to Ukraine amid rising friction with Russia.” He added: “The silver price is also expected to rise and settle in the range of Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 per kg.” While gold demand is relatively muted in the local markets, silver demand has picked up well, from both industries and bullion investors. “At least 2 tonnes of silver is being procured from exporters every single day in the market and much of this is for industrial use,” Choksi said. “Of late, the demand from investors is equally good because they are anticipating better returns in the days to come as prices go up.” With the onset of a new Covid wave and several weddings getting deferred, gold demand has also taken a hit over the past three weeks. “Even though gold prices were favourable and steadily hovering around Rs 49,500 per 10 gram, gold demand was muted,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). “In the first half of January, the demand was low primarily because of the kamurta period.” He added: “Soon after, as Covid-19 cases saw a rapid increase and weddings got cancelled, the overall demand came down.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gold-price-touches-50500-per-10g/articleshow/89126722.cms||---

The App would be applicable to both prescription-based and over-the-counter purchases. The intention behind the initiative is to identify suspected or vulnerable individuals and conduct early tests as these health conditions form the primary symptomatology of Covid-19. Apart from detecting and tracing early cases, this would help in preventing the spread of the disease. The department could so far identify 16.8 lakh people, who purchased medications for various conditions such as fever, severe acute respiratory infection, influenza-like illness, etc., through the App. Of these 16.8 lakh individuals, the department collected Covid-19 samples from about 9.8 lakh people. About 2,000 people have been tested positive for the pandemic. The department also identified that 8,516 people have bought rapid testing kits for Covid-19. Going by the cumulative caseload, these numbers could be just the tip of the iceberg as many customers will be hesitant to share their data or the medical shops cannot always afford time extracting personal information from the consumers. According to the officials, persons purchasing medications for fever and related conditions are likely or potential Covid-19 cases. The medical stores have been asked to upload data of the consumers in the App. Consequently, the concerned medical officer will collect Covid-19 samples from these individuals. Drug inspectors have been tasked with ensuring proper data entry by the medical shops. The health department has again focused on over-the-counter medicine purchases in view of the sudden surge in the cases during the ongoing third wave. As Omicron is believed to be milder than the Delta variant, people are skipping tests or going for self-testing and even self-medicating instead of approaching qualified medical professionals. While some are relying on the treatment protocols being floated on social media groups, the others are taking a cue from the prescriptions given to their friends or relatives. State Covid-19 nodal officer and Director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu asked the public to contact a doctor if they develop any symptoms similar to that of Covid-19 instead of self-medicating. “Medications should only be used under the supervision of doctors. Prompt testing is crucial to identify the cases,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/covid-pharma-helps-health-dept-track-16-8l-ppl-so-far/articleshow/89126724.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Daltonganj received 5.6 mm rain till Tuesday morning, while Ranchi and Jamshedpur remained dry till Tuesday evening after recording trace rain overnight. The weather office, however, predicted isolated rain in northeastern districts of the state (Giridih, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Dumka, Godda, Pakur and Sahebganj) on Republic Day and predicted dry weather and clear skies in the rest of Jharkhand.“Many places may have dense fog, while other parts will experience shallow to moderate fog on Republic Day morning,” Abhishek Anand, scientist at IMD Ranchi, said.Even though night time temperatures remained higher than average, IMD predicted a drop in mercury by two to four degrees in the next two days. Ranchi, which recorded 12.9 degrees Celsius on Monday, is set to experience a return of winter nights as mercury levels are likely to fall to single digit mark by January 27.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: 46,000 beneficiaries sign up for petrol subsidy scheme||RANCHI/SINDRI: As many as 46,000 ration cardholders have signed up to avail benefits of the state government’s new subsidy petrol scheme which will be launched by chief minister Hemant Soren from Dumka during the Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday. Officials of the state department of food, public distribution and consumer affairs said till Tuesday morning, 46,000 applications were received from beneficiaries covered under the Centre’s National Food Security Act (NFSA) in Jharkhand in the newly launched CM Support App and have been verified and cleared for the scheme. While food and civil supplies minister Rameshwar Oraon and department secretary Himani Pandey did not respond to calls, a senior officer in the department said, “The applications have been verified at two levels — by district transport officers and district supply officers. After the scheme’s launch on R-Day, we hope to see a rise in the number of registrations,” a senior officer in the department said. Other department officials said as many as 9,000 vehicle owners from Ranchi registered for the scheme while 8,500 registered from Dhanbad. Officials in Dhanbad said the response to the scheme is low. Bokaro and Dumka had around 6,000 registrations till Monday evening. The state government had said nearly 20 lakh ration card holders having two-wheelers will be covered under the scheme, which will provide Rs 25 subsidy for a litre of petrol or a maximum of Rs 250 per vehicle owner who has bought the fuel from pumps at the market rate. Dhanbad DSO Bhogendra Thakur said there were 5.2 lakh ration cardholders in the district of which 4.34 lakh have red and yellow cards. Around 5.72 lakh bikes are registered across the district. “The numbers can be less because many beneficiary families do not own bikes,” Thakur said. Nearly 1,000 applications were rejected because of the mismatch in the names of the owners and registration numbers. Notably, the beneficiaries will be eligible for a monthly subsidy of Rs 250 for 10 litres of petrol, which will be credited to their bank accounts through direct benefit transfer. The Jharkhand government has estimated a monthly expense of Rs 50 crore for the scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/46k-beneficiaries-sign-up-for-petrol-subsidy-scheme/articleshow/89126741.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Civil service aspirants welcome postponement of Jharkhand Public Service Commission’s exams||RANCHI: Jharkhand State Students Union (JSSU) members on Tuesday welcomed the Jharkhand Public Service Commission’s (JPSC) decision to postpone the combined civil services main examination scheduled from January 28. The JPSC during hearing of a letter patent appeal informed the Jharkhand high court on Tuesday that it was ready to reconsider the claims of the appellants and verify the preliminary merit list. The JSSU, which had staged a dharna for around 50 days at Morhabadi ground demanding cancellation of preliminary results and holding of fresh examination, gathered at a venue near Morhabadi to celebrate the announcement. JSSU president Devendra Nath Mahto said the amended results were not a solution to the issues raised by them. He alleged that violation of rules, corruption and irregularities took place during the exercise. He claimed that students with serial roll numbers have passed from one of the centres. He added there were also talks of paper leak before the examinations. Mahto said, “The examination should be held only after clearly defining the reservation policy. The reserved category students securing more marks than the general candidates should qualify in the general category.” Opposition BJP too hailed the development stating that it proved that the conduct of exam wasn’t done fairly.

The prestigious management institute has published an article appreciating the success story and endeavour by Rajkot district administration to provide a livelihood to the members of LGBT community, which has been pinned as a case study on its portal. Rajkot was one of the 30 districts in India selected by the central government for presenting a national skill development plan. Three districts of Gujarat — Rajkot, Patan and Surendranagar — were selected under this plan. Rajkot had prepared a plan of inclusive skill development of LGBT community which was shortlisted by the central government. The state government also recognized this effort and wanted to implement this model in all the districts of Gujarat. The IIMB article states, "The community members themselves are not aware of their rights, they live in underdeveloped pockets, cut off mainstream society, restoring to begging and sex work." It further said, "During the pandemic and lockdown their livelihood was severely affected, pushing them into poverty." Hiralchandra Maru, in charge of this project who also authored an article for IIMB said, "This project was not possible without the support of Lakshya Trust and Rajkot district administration's positive approach." As a part of its project on the skill development of marginal people, the Rajkot district administration conducted a round of conversations with the members of the LGBT community to understand the challenges and struggles of their everyday lives. At the end of multiple interactive sessions, officials could select and convince 15 people from this community to take skill development training. These 15 people were interested in making careers in the information technology sector. The committee then contacted potential employers to understand their requirements and prepare a short course based on that. In September and October, 11 candidates participated in the training of Course on Computer Concepts (CCC) and were awarded certificates of completion on October 30 after which, all of them got placements. Rajkot collector, Arun Mahesh Babu said, "IIM-Bangalore has taken up our efforts as a case study. They have acknowledged the work that has happened here. The labour department has now issued an order to include LGBT community in the skill development programme and replicate the Rajkot model across other districts." The district skill committee of Rakot received an award from Gujarat state aids control society for being a pioneer to bring LGBT community members into the mainstream. An LGBT beneficiary said, "This is the first even in our lives where we are getting so much respect and dignity. Earlier, people shunned or even hated us — it may not have all gone away, but we feel that Rajkot has accepted us as we are and have started giving us an opportunity to live an equal and dignified life."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/rajkots-success-story-of-lgbt-inclusivity-reaches-iimb-portal/articleshow/89126747.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The deceased, identified as Pravin Shukla, was reported to have taken the extreme step after being caught cheating during an examination on Tuesday, the police said. He studied at a private college. His family said that his mobile phone was seized by the college authorities. Police said Pravin used a licenced weapon of his father, who is an assistant sub-inspector (traffic), to kill himself. “His classmates said he was caught cheating in the exam on Tuesday morning. He came home and shot himself with his father’s rifle,” station in-charge Indramani Patel told the media. Pravin was living alone in the house for the past year as his parents had moved out to Chhoti Paltan area. In CCTV footage of the society, the youth is seen coming back from college on a motorcycle at 11.47am. He parks his bike and takes the stairs. Deceased's brother-in-law, Dipendra Tripathi, who lives in the same township, said that he used to come back from the college before noon and have lunch at their house. On Tuesday afternoon, when he did not come for lunch till 1pm, they tried calling him on his mobile phone, but nobody picked it up. Later, his wife (Pravin’s elder sister) went to check on him and found the gate locked from the inside. When he did not respond to the doorbell for long, she called her father to come with another key and they checked inside only to find him lying in a pool of blood in the bathroom. “The rifle along with ammunition was brought home during Diwali for puja,” Tripathi told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/caught-cheating-in-exam-bba-student-shoots-self-at-home/articleshow/89126745.cms||---

---||Indore||More recoveries than new cases for first time in 3rd wave||Indore: For the first time in the third wave and nearly a month into it, recoveries outnumbered new Covid infections on Monday night. It’s a glimmer of hope amid three days of dropping Covid infections statewide.According to the district bulletin, 2,104 patients recovered while 1,963 new cases were detected. This came in the back of a dip in daily cases for two consecutive days.Daily infections dipped from an all-time high of 3,372 on January 22 to 2665 the next day and 1963 on the night of January 24. It’s a hope-inspiring 40% drop in two days.Crisis committee member Dr Nishant Khare told TOI, “It is a good trend that daily infections are dropping in the district and the number of recovered patients has surpassed it. It doesn’t however qualify to say that we have passed the peak because it would be too early to say that. In case this trend continues for a week, then we can say something about peak.” He pointed out that in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai, there was a dip for a couple of days before daily infections increased again. “So, we have to wait for another three or four days to come to any conclusion,” said Dr Khare.The daily positivity rate also dipped on Monday night after shooting to an all-time high to 30.5% in the district. Health authorities identified 482 areas corresponding to 1,963 Covid-19 infections, 29 of them reporting cases in double-digits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/more-recoveries-than-new-cases-for-first-time-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/89126752.cms||Antriksh Singh

---||Delhi||Hardly any moment in the sun this January in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhiites have seen a bleak and harsher winter this year, with high moisture and low-lying clouds keeping the sun blocked for the better part of January. So far this month, the city has recorded 11 days with lower daytime temperatures (the maximum staying below 17 degrees Celsius). This is the highest since January 2015, which also saw 11 such days. With nearly a week still to go before the end of the month, it is expected that this winter could breach the record of January 2003, which had seen 18 such days. R K Jenamani, senior weather expert at India Meteorological Department, pointed out January had so far seen one of the longest spells of ‘cold-day’ conditions. At least eight to 11 ‘cold’ days have been recorded so far, either throughout the city or in some parts. “Wednesday is expected to be a cold-day again,” said Jenamani. According to IMD, a “cold day” is when the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below normal. Moreover, Jenamani added, Delhi has also recorded the highest rainfall for January in the past 122 years and very low sunlight or clear sky, making this winter “unique”. “Delhi has experienced a unique winter this time. There has been lower fog formation in December and January, more cloudy days and highest rainfall for January in the past 122 years, almost no sun since January 7, and also one of the highest cold-day seasons,” he said. Explaining the reason behind such a unique phenomenon, the weather scientist pointed to a “warmer December”, saying while there were no western disturbances till that month, it was later followed by a number of them. A western disturbance (WD) is high moisture air flowing from the Mediterranean Sea towards Eastern Himalayas via Iraq and Pakistan. This leads to snowfall in the hills and rains in the northern regions, including Delhi. “There were consistent and back-to-back western disturbances from December 28 onwards till January 10, and then again on January 21. When the gap between two western disturbances is more, there are cold spells. The western disturbance on January 7 was a slower one, which led to rains from January 5 to 8 and, therefore, accumulation of moisture, low-lying clouds and fog,” Jenamani said. He added that the phenomenon took place on a very large scale over a large geographical area of northern India. “There were conditions that promoted a colder spell, as the moisture mostly kept the sun out and the temperature never stayed normal throughout January,” Jenamani said. He further pointed out that the whole season of winter so far had also seen very low fog hours, which means visibility less than 1,000 metres. “From December to January, we have seen only 45 days or 252 fog hours against the usual 52 days or 570 fog hours. Last time, it was in 1991 that the total fog hours were low, at 42 days or 255 hours. Thus, so far, the fog hours this winter have been the lowest in 30 years,” said Jenamani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hardly-any-moment-in-the-sun-this-jan/articleshow/89125223.cms||Kushagra Dixit

This is the first satellite tagging of the Olive Ridley sea turtle on the western coast of India. The Maharashtra coast has sporadic nesting of Olive Ridley sea turtles. Till now, Olive Ridley sea turtles have been tagged only on the east coast of India. APCCF Virendra Tiwari, who heads the Mumbai mangrove conservation cell, said, “The turtle was tagged as part of the research project ‘Tracking the migratory movements of Olive Ridley sea turtles off the coast of Maharashtra’. The study is being done by the Mangrove Foundation, Maharashtra forest department, and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. This study will help in understanding the movement pattern of Olive Ridley sea turtles off the coast of Western India. Tiwari said the department plans to tag five Olive Ridley sea turtles under this project, of which the first one has been tagged in Velas. “This turtle has been named ‘Prathama’ as it is the first to be satellite tagged in Maharashtra, and it also signifies the start of a new era in sea turtle conservation in the state,” he said.Four more Olive Ridley turtles will be tagged from different beaches in Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg, where the nesting of these turtles has increased due to better conservation efforts. From 233 nests in 2018-19, the nests of this turtle species have doubled to 475 in all three districts. This led to more turtle hatchlings being released to the sea in 2020-21. The APCCF added that the sea turtle conservation program being carried out by the forest department along with the local communities and NGOs includes locating Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites, excavation and the relocation of eggs to the hatchery site.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/in-a-first-olive-ridley-turtle-satellite-tagged/articleshow/89124670.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It’s been 23 days since the 15-17 vaccination drive began. “We surpassed the targeted number of Covid vaccinations among kids in this age group around 3pm on Tuesday,” district immunisation officer Dr Sudhir Modi told TOI. The administration had a target of inoculating 1,42,115 children. “By 6pm on January 25, 1,42,296 kids had been given their first dose,” said Dr Modi, adding that since January 16, Dhar has consistently remained on top of the charts in MP. It hasn’t been an easy ride. “There were some issues and challenges in four tribal blocks — Gandhwani, Bag, Tirla and Dahi. These are the remotest regions. Once the target areas were identified, a mass mobilisation programme was carried out there.” “The last 1,000 kids were left in these areas. We traced them and inoculated them in the last two to three days to achieve 100% first-dose coverage,” said Dr Modi. Officials also had to reconcile differences in the number of students registered on the Samagra portal and data received from schools, said Dr Modi. “We took the help of ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, Patwaris and other staffers to identify kids not registered in schools in the district. A vaccination team was deployed on Kukshi Naka to inoculate kids in buses,” said Dr Modi. “It all helped. But, everything doesn’t remain so smooth. There was a day when we ran out of vaccines,” he recalled. Administrative officers helped arrange vaccines from Indore’s stock, and Indore agreed to share around 10,000 doses. “The whole process of approval and other paperwork took just 30 minutes and the stock was sent to us. The teams responded brilliantly and all these doses were exhausted the very next day. This shows the excitement and hard work that helped us achieve this feat,” added Dr Modi. The records show that till Tuesday 7.30am, Dhar was No. 1 with 99.4% coverage, followed by Panna at 88.3%, and Bhopal in third spot with 86.8% coverage. Indore is a poor 33rd, with 71.3% coverage in this category and Dewas is at the bottom.

There are few private schools over which power lines have been drawn and the onus is on the school management to re-route the cables and make the campus safer for students, clarified officials.At a village in Tumakuru district, a 15-year-old boy died of electrocution after an iron pole he was carrying to hoist the flag came in contact with a live wire during Independence Day celebration at a government school. Subsequently, Karnataka High Court took the matter seriously and directed the authorities concerned to ensure that power cables are not over the school buildings or premises to ensure safety of students. All five power companies have been directed to re-route power cables following the incident.Chamarajanagar division executive engineer (electrical) R Poorna Chandra Thejaswi said: “Following the directive we have taken up the work on a war footing basis and have re-routed cables of nearly 85% of schools within a month.”“There are 465 schools in our division of two taluks of Chamarajanagar district of which 135 schools were found hazardous as power cables were drawn over the school campus. The work to re-route cables was assigned to respective assistant executive engineers in mid-December and since then we have completed work of 114 schools,” the official disclosed.Chamarajanagar deputy director of public instruction SN Manjunath said rerouting of power cables from the school campus has been completed at many schools. In some schools, teachers and students have expressed happiness over the removal of electricity poles from the school ground as it has helped them use the areas for sports and physical activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/re-routing-of-power-cables-from-school-campus-nears-completion/articleshow/89126768.cms||---

Addressing a press conference here, BJP state spokesperson and SC/ST Morcha president Naveen Markandeya said the minister had slapped a person who posed a question to him about the arrangements being made for an uninterrupted supply of water in the region. Markandeya demanded the minister’s dismissal from the cabinet.However, urban development minister Dr Shiv Dahariya denied the charges against him explaining that he had gone for ‘bhoomi pujan’ programme on January 9 where local elected representatives and villagers were present. While a group of women were discussing water shortage, anti-socials created ruckus and security personnel removed them as they were using abusive language, Dahariya said. He claimed that some BJP members were involved in creating the ruckus.BJP spokesperson Sanjay Shrivastava said ever since the Congress came to power, its ministers, parliamentary secretaries and MLAs have become intolerant towards the people and whenever someone questions the functioning of the government. “Political vendetta is the new normal under this government. The administrative machinery is after people who raise their voice against the Congress government,” the BJP leader said adding that there is an atmosphere of terror and even sitting Member of Parliament and former MPs are being tagged as absconders by the police.

The tumor in patient’s heart caused breathlessness and blood was coming with sputum. Doctors warned that if this condition prolonged any longer then the patient could succumb to the disease. As per Dr Sahu, this is probably the first such surgery in Chhattisgarh. According to a study, only one in 10 crore people have this type of tumour. This complex operation is called beating open heart surgery, which involves several risks and challenges. However, post one week of the surgery the condition of patient is stable and had been discharged on Monday, the surgeon said.The patient was complaining of breathlessness for the last four months. Besides, blood was coming along with sputum on coughing recently. The patient said that he went to many hospitals but all doctors failed to diagnose the root cause and gradually his condition started deteriorating. In the meantime, he started getting treatment done at Ambedkar Hospital, where it was found in the investigation that the disease is not in the lungs, but in the heart. The investigation also revealed that there is a tumour of 4x4 size in the heart. The tumour was affecting the pumping and valve mechanism of the heart. It is very rare of developing lump inside the heart, which was a challenge for the surgeons to remove it from heart, said Dr Sahu.Dr Krishnakant Sahu said that before doing any open heart surgery, the patient's heart chamber is opened, and is given the support of the heart lung machine. After this, with the help of cardioplegia solution, the heartbeat is stopped but in this case the help of heart lung machine was taken and the tumour was removed from the heart without stopping the heartbeat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/in-rare-feat-docs-remove-tumour-from-beating-heart/articleshow/89126778.cms||---

Forced to go virtual for canvassing votes, the Congress central leadership will start rallies on January 27, and there will be a flurry of virtual mass connect programmes for election-bound Goa, Uttarakhand, Manipur, UP, by Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and possibly Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. While Priyanka will focus on UP, she is expected to address a few programmes for other states also, especially Uttarakhand.

---||Jaipur||Jhajharia, Lekhara will strive to inspire specially abled||Jaipur: It was never about disability, but about intent. Intent to achieve big. For both the para athletes from Rajasthan, javelin thrower Devendra Jhajharia and shooter Avani Lekhara, their dreams came true when they dominated the stage last year at the Tokyo Paralympics. And on Tuesday, winning Padma awards for their outstanding performances at the biggest sporting arena, was the cherry on the cake.Jhajharia was awarded with Padma Bhushan while Lekhara with Padma Shri. JHAJHARIA THANKS PM MODI: “I would first like to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for felicitating me with the Padma Bhushan as it is for the first time that a para athlete has won this award. This will definitely encourage other specially abled people to aim for bigger things in life,” Jhajharia said from Gandhinagar where he is currently training at the Sports Authority of India (SAI). The javelin thrower added that the award has increased his responsibility and he will keep working hard to win more medals for the country. The 40-year-old is the only Indian to have won three medals in consecutive outings at the Paralympics. He won the silver in Tokyo and has two gold medals which he bagged in Athens 2004 and Rio 2016. The paralympian has an amputated left arm almost till elbow and competes in javelin F46 events.Jhajharia says that it is not just rigorous training, but also unflinching support from family and coaches has helped him reach greater heights. “It is a very proud moment for me, my family. I have worked hard to reach here and I am glad that I never let my disability stop me from dreaming big. My family and coaches have been my biggest support system who facilitated me in my pursuit to become a top athlete,” he added.LEKHARA ON TARGET: The rifle shooter Avani, who won a gold medal in 10m air rifle standing and a bronze medal in 50m rifle 3 positions at Tokyo Paralympics, concurs with Jhajharia and says that the award brings along with it a lot of responsibility. “Padma Shri is a very very big honour and I am extremely humbled by this award. I am proud to be considered for this huge honour. It shows the power of sports and how the achievements go beyond the realm of the sporting world. To win a civilian award shows yet again how crucial sports is in the country and the responsibility on my shoulders go way beyond sports. I will continue to give my best in sports and inspire future athletes,” said the 20-year-old paralympian, who has been wheel-chair bound since 2012 when she met with an accident that left her paralysed from waist below. The para shooter was expecting to win the award. “She was confident about winning it. But when she checked the award list on the internet, the last page did not show. She was disheartened and informed me about it. I asked her to check again as I had already started receiving congratulatory messages from friends. Then we both reloaded the list and finally saw her name on the fourth page,” shared Avani’s father Praveen Lekhara. No doubt it was a momentary confusion, for Avani has hardly got her ‘target’ wrong in the last few months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jhajharia-lekhara-will-strive-to-inspire-specially-abled/articleshow/89126795.cms||---

Prior to Covid, wholesalers used to sell 1.5 lakh tricolour but now the sale has dipped due to the lockdown and closure of educational institutions. “Hawkers who sell flags on the streets are our biggest customers these days. They sell flags at traffic signals or from temporary roadside shanties. Last year, we used to supply flags across Rajasthan and nearby states as well. But all the business is shut because schools and colleges where Republic day was celebrated are also closed,” said Lokesh Aggarwal, owner of Chhagan Lal & Sons, a wholesale shop at Tripolia market. All educational institutions, offices and private clubs, which usually hoisted the national flag at their campuses on the occasion, are shut due to the pandemic, which has adversely impacted the sales. Till last year, students and people attending private parties used to purchase these flags, which has now gone down to zero. A flag shopkeeper in Ajmer said that their main source of income is political party flags during elections. Currently elections in UP, Punjab and other states are giving a good business to flag makers in Rajasthan. Pappu Lal, a flag seller at JDA circle, said that last year, he earned around Rs 3,700 by selling flags at traffic signals. “Earlier, people used to purchase flags for their school going children but now schools are closed. This year sales are down and I fear if I will be able to sell all the products I purchased,” said Lal. Majority of women in slum areas of the city who were hired to make tricolour flags earlier are now completely dependent on stitching political party flags due to elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/pandemic-hits-tricolour-sales/articleshow/89126805.cms||---

They were given by its finance department to the bidders of the proposed five-star hotel in Mihan after their bids were rejected on technical grounds. The cheques drawn in the name of Bank of Baroda (BOB) and were given after a gap of three months and following continuous follow up with MADC authorities. It was only when they managed to contact MADC managing director Deepak Kapoor, who intervened to refund their amounts, the bidders got their cheques. Kapoor, also the MADC vice chairman, said the matter was reported to him after office hours and it was not possible for him to make any enquiry while sitting in Mumbai. “On Wednesday morning, I will take up this issue on priority and would try to find out the exact reason,” he told TOI. The bounced chequesMADC finance officer Anisha Godani told TOI that she received information about cheque bounce at 8.30 pm and she immediately contacted the BOB officials in this regard. “They told me that our accounts have sufficient funds and there might be some technical reason behind the mess. I have screenshots of all the amounts in our accounts today. Now the BOB officials said they would be able to explain the mess only on Thursday when the bank reopens after a Republic Day holiday,” she said. The bounced cheques were handed over to Pramod Korde in the name of ‘Spectrum Advertising Agency’ and chartered accountant Sanjay Mukewar’s wife Rashmi in the name of ‘Sam Real Estate and Farming Private Limited’. Both had deposited Rs 1.75 crore each as Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) in October last year for bidding for the hotel tender, which is still to be opened. After their bids were rejected, they demanded their money back. However, the MADC officials kept them on tenterhooks for nearly three months. “I have borrowed the money from the market to bid for it along with my friends. Now, they not only delayed the refund, but also bounced my cheques of Rs 1.75 crore of BOB. I was shocked to get a cheque bounce message in my HDFC account, due to insufficient funds in MADC account,” Korde told TOI, adding that he had suffered losses due to MADC. Mukewar said they were not expecting such treatment from organisations like MADC, which is looking after big budget projects like Mihan and airports at Shirdi. “I received the cheque bounce message in the evening and I immediately contacted the authorities, but did not receive satisfactory replies,” she said, demanding that MADC should provide demand draft instead of cheques or deposit the amount directly into their accounts. Other senior officials told TOI that they had a conversation with MADC chief financial officer (CFO) in Mumbai, who clarified that there were sufficient funds in their accounts and there was no way cheques could be bounced due to lack of money. “He informed us that there may be technical reasons for bouncing of cheques.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/madcs-cheques-worth-rs-3-50-cr-bounce-officials-say-tech-glitch/articleshow/89124708.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Additional commissioner of police (Crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said that police arrested Rajdeep Barad (25) and Ashish Vishnoi (30). “Based on their interrogation, we alerted Sriganganagar police and they arrested one Nishant with seven illegal firearms there,” he said. The crime branch had launched operation Action Against Gun (AAG) recently and received specific intelligence that two dreaded criminals were present in the city with a huge cache of arms and ammunition. A team of two inspectors was roped in and they arrested Barad and Vishnoi, both natives of Sriganganagar. Besides two pistols, the team also seized seven live cartridges from them. Police learned that the accused had a rivalry with a Bikaner-based gangster, for which they were amassing guns and cartridges. The preliminary investigation showed that Vishnoi and Barad had purchased guns from Indore in Madhya Pradesh and sold seven of them to one Nishat in Sriganganagar. They also delivered nearly seven high-quality weapons to a Haryana-based criminal. Besides their tangled web of gang ties, the family of a police inspector posted in Haryana was also under their radar. As per the police, one gangster had told the duo to follow the inspector’s brother to teach him a lesson. Lamba said that the accused had sheltered members of other notorious gangs, including the Lawrance Bishnoi gang. Ashish Vishnoi allegedly admitted to having run Lawrance’s gang in Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar, and Bikaner. The police, however, have yet to corroborate his claims. “ We suspect that they had come to deliver a consignment of illegal weapons here, investigation is underway to zero in on their prospective customer,” he said. The crime branch sift through the two accused’s criminal antecedents and discovered their footprints in an alleged bid on a person for Rs 1 crore extortion in Sriganganagar in 2020, and two other similar cases of firing for extortions in Sriganganagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/two-gangsters-held-with-arms-in-city/articleshow/89126808.cms||---

Icestocks have a gliding surface, to which a stick is attached. In this sport, the competitors slide ice stocks over an ice surface, aiming for a target to cover the longest distance. “I came to know of the sport from a friend and developed an interest,” said Drashti Vasava, a 22-year-old who won the bronze medal. “Since it does not snow here and there are no ice rinks, we practice on the roads of Surat. Before the championship, we camped in Srinagar for about a month and practised on ice,” said Vasava who is from the remote tribal village of Thava near Netrang in Bharuch. This is not her first swipe at the sport. She bagged a silver medal in the summer games in September 2021.Khyati Gamit, a tribal sportsperson from Songadh of Tapi district who won the silver medal, said, “I started playing the sport a year ago. Now, I am considering a career in it. Since it is a growing sport, we have to struggle to get basic facilities. However, I am happy to have won a medal despite the limitations we have to face.”Pruthvi Bhoye, a 21-year-old bronze winner from Ahwa in Dang, said, “It is a lesser known sport. I got to know of it while I was learning taekwondo. I became good at it in a short period and won the medal."Vikas Verma, vice president of Ice Stock Sport Association of Gujarat, said: “Icestock is now recognised by the Winter Olympics and will be part of it in 2026. We started playing the sport a few years ago and our players are already bagging medals.” Verma too won a bronze medal in the master category.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/state-players-stock-medals-at-icestock-competition/articleshow/89126811.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Surat||Gujarat: Valsad couple’s marital journey begins with police station ‘phera’||SURAT: It was sight to behold for a new bridegroom and a wedding entourage of seven baraatis — all clad in wedding finery — being escorted into Valsad town police station on Monday night. However, cops’ wedding gift allegedly resonated loud on the groom’s cheek. “Police slapped me and told we will bring you to new home” said Piyush Patel, the groom, who along with his bride and others were found moving around during curfew hours on a railway overbridge. The party was allowed to go after almost two hours from the police station and not before being served a notice by the police. Following the allegations, Valsad superintendent of police has ordered an inquiry into the incident. As part of the vehicle checking during curfew hours, cops stopped three vehicles of the Patel family at around 12.30am. One of the car, in which Patel was seated with his bride, was decorated in wedding paraphernalia. Police asked the party for venturing out during curfew hours when they claimed that they got delayed due to rituals. Not satisfied with their replies, the police brought nine persons including Patel and his wife Sonal, his parents and other relatives to the police station. Police also registered an offence under various sections of Indian Penal Code section 188 (Disobedience to order duty promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act) and The Epidemic Act. The 24-year-old groom is a vegetable vendor and resident of Tariyavad in Valsad. “One day before my marriage, the police declared night curfew in Valsad. Thus, obeying the new guidelines, only a few members of our family went for the marriage ceremony. Due to delay in some rituals, we finally left the venue that late, which was our mistake,” Patel told TOI. Alleging of being slapped by a cop, he said, “It was very upsetting and humiliating at the manner in which they handled me and my family. After finishing legal procedure for around two hours, the police allowed us to go home with a warning to remain present before the police with a guarantor for bail.” V D Mori, police inspector of Valsad town police station said, “We registered an offence as per the law. They went out for dinner, when the police party stopped their vehicles. Police did not arrest or even detained them. They were allowed to go after being served notice immediately and completion of legal procedure.” “The family did not report of any harassment by the police to us. From media report, I have ordered an inquiry and a deputy superintendent of police is inquiring into the allegations,” said Rajdeepsinh Zala, superintendent of police, Valsad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/duos-marital-journey-begins-with-police-station-phera/articleshow/89126816.cms||---

This will create a challenging situation in the future, said Dr Chandresh Jardosh, city-based general physician, “Covid-infected persons are not consulting the doctors. They are taking antibiotics, even if it is not required and are also leaving the course incomplete, which is a major threat. This will develop resistance among the individuals and will not be helpful in curing them in the future,” said Dr Jardosh. As Covid cases, going by the government data, have seen significant drop in the city over the past two days, experts are pointing at the base of the iceberg where many with infections have probably not got any medical help at all. Dr Dilip Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that there is nothing like ‘non-harmful medicine’. “Every medicine has side-effects, and the treating doctor knows why some of the medicines are prescribed to a specific patient. There could be general medicines, but it should not be generalized. The wrong medication causes complications,” he said. Dr Mehul Shah, secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Gujarat state branch, said that rational and judicious use of medicines should be under guidance of the doctors only. “Otherwise we will invite other complications or masking of symptoms. We have already seen the impact of unnecessary use of steroids in the past wave,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/test-wary-city-self-diagnoses-and-self-medicates-doctors-give-warning/articleshow/89126817.cms||---

Health officials say that many people have been ignoring the symptoms, and warn that it may lead to complications.District surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh told TOI that because of the season, cases of fever and flu are being reported everywhere. “It is common that the virus will be more active during the winter. There are more than 170 viruses, including the rhinovirus, that causes flu, which is common in winter. It will be a big mistake if people do not get tested when they suffer from fever and other symptoms. Whichever is the virus, getting tested for Covid-19 is a must. People should compulsorily go to a nearby fever clinic and give their samples for the rapid antigen test (RAT) if they have symptoms. They should get the RT-PCR test done, if the RAT result is negative, but the symptoms still persist. People should not neglect it, just because the symptoms are mild,” he said.Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) Covid nodal officer Dr Annayya Kulal said that a large number of fever and flu cases are being reported in Mangaluru city. “Most of the fever cases are due to the novel coronavirus. Mangaluru city has contributed a large number of the Covid-19 cases in Dakshina Kannada district. Out of nearly 5,500 active cases in Dakshina Kannada district, 2,645 are reported in the Mangaluru city limits. Meanwhile, in Mangaluru Rural areas, there are 1,599 active cases,” he said.“The severity of Covid-19 symptoms, among those who have taken the vaccine is less,compared to those who are not vaccinated.

However, the police immediately removed the banner. Such acts of hatred can be stopped effectively, by booking suo motu cases against those putting them up,” Khader said, and urged the police not to wait for complaints. He also sought action against the printing agency that printed the banner found at Ullalabailu. “People of different faiths in Ullalabailu live harmoniously. People of all communities set up shops during the annual festival in Ullal every year. Now, some miscreants are trying to divide the people on religious lines. A case should be booked against those who put up the banner, and the printer who printed the banner. The licence of the printer should also be cancelled. Everyone has the right to conduct business in public places,” Khader said, referring to the banner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/act-against-banners-that-disturb-harmony-khader/articleshow/89126819.cms||---

The officials are visiting the apartments with a laptop, so that data can be updated, and the property tax can also be collected via online mode of payment. In case residents are unable to pay online, then a challan is generated, to help the residents to make the payment at bank branches, the mayor told the media on Tuesday. “There are over two lakh properties, including around 5,000 apartments in the city limits. After the online system of property tax payment was introduced on November 1, 2021, as many as 23,000 people have paid property taxes using the online application. A sum of Rs 7 crore in property tax has been collected since November. At present, the database on properties in the city, available with the MCC, is incomplete. The details of most of the properties furnished by property owners during the tax payment were not uploaded to the database. Most of the accounts do not have details of the khata changes with the new owners’ names. The introduction of an online property tax payment system will help the city corporation to update its database on properties, along with the tax collection,” the mayor said, adding that additional data entry operators will be appointed to help people pay property tax online from the MCC office.Once the online property tax payment system is streamlined, the MCC will start sending an SMS alert to the registered phone numbers, with the link to pay the tax, along with the amount of tax to be paid. To pay the tax online, citizens have to open the link www.mccpropertytax.in/public and enter a 10-digit mobile phone number to generate an OTP. Property owners should verify whether building number, khata number, property ID and their address is in order, and furnish the required details as sought, he said.MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said property owners should also update the name of the tenants, along with details of the property, if it is rented out. The details, including the road on which the property is located, type of property —commercial, residential or non-residential—should be mentioned. After furnishing the plinth area of property, along with other details sought, the tax amount will be generated, which can be paid through netbanking, using debit card, GooglePay, PhonePe, or bank transfer, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mcc-teams-visit-apartments-in-city-to-update-property-details-collect-tax/articleshow/89126820.cms||---

When contacted, as soon as the award list was published on Tuesday, Naik, aged around 70, was clueless about his selection for the award, but said that he was happy about being selected for it. He remembered Mahabala Bhat, who gave him the barren hilltop in the 70s.Known as the ‘Suranga’ man, he was first recognised by Varanashi Development and Research Foundation, Adyanadka. Shree Padre, agriculture expert and editor, ‘Adike Patrike’, an agriculture magazine, said he is a classic case of optimism and determination. “He developed a sustainable, lively resource from zero. Today he has a good garden, water resource and sustainable agriculture that is man-made. For me, he is a one-man army on a hilltop. But for his sheer optimism and determination, the greenery there could not have been developed. When he was digging suranga after suranga which failed, people ridiculed him,” said Shree Padre, who has followed Naik’s work for several years. Surangas are tunnels that go deep into hard laterite rocks, to reach groundwater, through which water flows perennially in a small stream, without the use of a pump. Naik has further improvised the traditional surangas, by creating a small reservoir.“It was after the fifth or sixth attempt that he got water. If somebody evaluates his work in terms of man days, his small garden, areca plantation, revetment and the earthwork, would amount to a few thousand man days. The hard work he has put in, serves a model for everyone. He does not have any ill-will or negative things to say about others. He was a coconut harvester who fell down from a tree, and had to spend a lot of money to get treated in hospital. His landowner gave him government assigned land. The land around his plot is barren. Only dry grass grows there. Nobody imagined that one man could convert a barren hilltop into a green space,” said Shree Padre.Over the years, his achievements have caught the attention of the national and international media. He has grown 300 arecanut palms, coconut trees, banana trees, pepper vines and cocoa on his land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/padma-award-for-man-who-turned-barren-land-fertile/articleshow/89126821.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The health department of the Nashik Zilla Parishad is of the view that by the first week of February, the daily number could start dipping.District health officer Kapil Aher said the Covid curve seems to have plateaued in the rural Nasik at present. The number of cases reported is between 600 to 900 every day over the past few days, and it can be assumed that the Covid curve has plateaued. In the hotspot talukas like Niphad, the daily cases have dropped from 900-1,000 to about 800, although there is a rise seen in some talukas.Given the current scenario, it can be expected that the curve might start dipping by the first week of February, said Aher. The infrastructure to treat Covid patients, however, has been strengthened. Dr Aher said that the priority continues to be to identify and test high-risk contacts of those testing positive.As of Tuesday, there were 6,108 active patients in the rural areas of Nashik. In Nashik taluka, there were 1,098 active cases, followed by Sinnar (822), Niphad (799), Dindori (521), Deola (457), Chandwad (347), Igatpuri (344), Yeola (343), Nandgaon (328), Baglan (301), Trimbak (259), Malegaon (182), Kalwan (139), Peth (123) and Surgana (45).Considering the figures of the entire district, there are 18,017 active patients.

During the second wave of the pandemic last year Jalgaon was one of the hospot districts.“The intensity of the ongoing third wave of the pandemic in our district is far less than what was witnessed during the second one. Although cases are on the rise, the case fatality rate (CFR) is 0.5% and hospitalisation is extremely low,” district collector Abhijit Raut said, adding that by and large people of the district in this third wave are more cautious than during the previous waves.According to him, all three patients who died so far had comorbid conditions. “The two prominent urban centres of the district, Jalgaon city and Bhusawal, have already peaked and cases will now witness a declining trend,” Raut said.The district collector said other urban centres like Chalisgaon and Chopda will witness rise in cases, but bulk of them would be under home isolation.“There was a unique pattern about the spread of the infection in Jalgaon district during the first two waves and this same pattern is continuing now as well. Initially cases spike in Jalgaon city and Bhusawal and later cases start rising in other urban centres before it spreads to rural Jalgaon,” Raut observed.He also appealed to the people to continue to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the infection from spreading.Chief medical officer of Jalgaon Municipal Corporation (JMC) Dr Ram Rawlani said the daily Covid cases are on a declining trend although the civic body is continuing with aggressive tracing and testing of high-risk contacts of Covid patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/jalgaons-case-fatality-rate-is-0-5-district-collector-raut/articleshow/89126830.cms||---
---||Delhi||New curriculum plan haphazardly drafted, claim DU teachers||New Delhi: A group of Delhi University (DU) teachers, including some of its executive council members, has written to the varsity stating that the recently released draft undergraduate curriculum seems to have been “haphazardly drafted”. There is also a growing concern among them regarding absorption of ad hoc and temporary teachers at DU. Teachers argued that reduced credits, as proposed in the draft curriculum, corresponded to lesser teaching hours that would lead to displacement of teachers. “Reduction of overall credit from 196 to 176 implies a loss of corresponding hours of teaching, thereby causing a reduction in the workload and displacement of teachers,” the letter to vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh read. “It further leads to the dilution of the syllabus content, as well as academic rigour. How is it possible to earn a maximum of 26 credits per semester when a semester can only allow a maximum of 22 credits? Does this imply the introduction of MOOCs (massive online open courses) from the backdoor?” it added. The proposed courses are also silent on practical segments for science subjects, teachers argued. Seema Das, a member of the executive council, pointed out, “There is no scope for practical or fieldwork in environmental science and sustainable development as it has been left with only two credits,” she said, adding that language and commerce courses will also result in a loss of workload for teachers. Claiming that adoption of the multiple entry-exit system (MEES) and the academic bank of credits will institutionalise a fluctuating workload and roster, Das said, “In the science stream, the exit of 15-20% additional students in the second year implies a total loss of four periods in a particular practical paper and loss of workload of two teachers per course.” According to the letter, MEES also formalises dropouts, mainly from marginalised sections of the society. “With the grant of certificates and diplomas, the academic standard of DU has been rendered to that of a community college,” it alleged. To ensure high academic standard and stability, absorption or permanent appointment without displacement must precede any kind of restructuring, the letter demanded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-curriculum-plan-haphazardly-drafted-claim-du-teachers/articleshow/89125285.cms||TNN

Taking cognizance of this, Aditya Thackeray had contacted the municipal commissioner and asked him to rework the design of the proposed flyover to save the trees. Thereafter, NMC commissioner Jadhav directed the officials to conduct the spot survey and make realignment of the flyover pillars to save as many trees as possible. NMC’s city engineer Shivkumar Vanjari said they are conducting a spot survey to redesign the flyover in such a way that maximum trees are saved. Vanjari said that they have already started working on this and the plan will be chalked out shortly.Meanwhile, tree lovers have started registering their objections over the cutting of trees for the proposed flyovers.

He is an innovative farmer from Annigeri town in Dharwad district. Being a mechanic by hobby, he developed an interest in agriculture in his inherited land of 60 acres falling in dry area. His experiments started with planting mango, sapota with intercrops like chilli and ber in the 1980s. His innovative ideas turned into reality in 1994 when he developed a device to separate tamarind seeds from the pulp after spending Rs 3 lakh and six months. In one day, this device can carry out the work equivalent to 500 labourers per day. Nadakattin started innovating in 1974 soon after he left school as he could not get up early in the morning and his father wanted him to become a farmer. At that time, he had developed a kind of bullock drawn tiller capable of deep ploughing in which whetting was not needed. He also invented a multi-purpose sowing machine in 1985. He established Vishwashanthi Agricultural Research and Industrial Research Centre in 1975. Now agricultural equipment named after ‘Nadakattin’ are famous across the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/innovative-dharwad-farmer-nadakattin-gets-padma-shri/articleshow/89126846.cms||---

After the third wave started in Haveri, over 354 children have contracted Covid-19 in just 15 days. The second wave also had affected children in the district and over 700 children had tested positive during the first and second waves. Now, children have been infected within a short period, and luckily hospitalization is less in number. Parents are negligent about getting their children tested even when they show symptoms. In the third wave, the pandemic has been spreading with high speed to the community, and children are easily infected because they are not maintaining social distance and not wearing masks. Luckily, no child has been hospitalised after testing positive in the district and all are getting treatment while in home isolation as because the intensity of the pandemic is very less. Admitting this, district surgeon Dr PR Havanur, who is also a Paediatrician, said, “This time schools are operating so children are exposed easily to the virus. so much so that more children have contracted the virus in the third wave than the previous two waves. But children have been recovering quickly because they have good immunity. Interestingly, they never think Covid-19 is very dangerous and they never bothered about the infection.” Dr HS Raghavendraswamy, the district health officer, noted that the intensity of the pandemic in the third wave is very low. All 354 children are recovering at home isolation and so there is no need to worry, he added. “We are requesting school authorities and parents, not allow children who symptoms to enter the classroom and immediately send them for at RT-PCR test. It will help curb transmission of the virus,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/over-350-kids-infected-in-past-two-weeks-in-haveri/articleshow/89126852.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Power department in private hands by April-end||CHANDIGARH: By the end of April, the power department of the Chandigarh administration will be transferred to Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution, a private company, owing to the central government directions following cabinet approval. Multiple aspects like infrastructure, employees and their transfer, financial benefits and other matters will be part of the privatisation exercise. “The Centre has sent us documents after its nod to power privatisation. The process will take two-and-a-half to three months. We are hoping to complete the process by the end of April or may be before that. It is a lengthy exercise, which requires a lot of paper work,” a UT official. Based on the nod of the central government to the company and sending the required documents and papers, the UT will now initiate the process to form a company and a trust. An agreement will also be signed between the UT and the company in the next few days. Moreover, since the power department has 700 regular employees with it, the UT has planned to keep only 70 employees (10%) with it and the remaining will be transferred to the private bidder with financial security and benefits. TimesViewThe takeover of the power department's transmission and distribution operations by a private entity may help revamp the infrastructure and cut the transmission losses, thereby improving the quality power received by consumers, but it could bring in a revision in the tariff too. The authorities should also ensure that there is a seamless changeover and the employees are impacted in a minimum way.The administration will also give all its equity to the company. The equity is comprising the existing materials and infrastructure of the power department. The value has already been calculated by the department. “The trust will be headed by the finance secretary and comprise officials and employees of the finance department and personnel wing. The trust will decide about all monetary benefits of employees. The benefitsof employees transferred to the compan will remain similar,” a senior UT officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/power-dept-in-private-hands-by-april-end/articleshow/89126865.cms||Deepak Yadav

The unit has been established with 3,225 solar panels spanning over six acres. “In 2019, we submitted a proposal to the Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, which is under the central government to establish a 2MW solar power unit.

With the support of the National Institute of Wind Energy, this unit was established,” said B Ashokkumar, an assistant professor and co-coordinator of the project. He said that at present, the electricity requirement for MKU is 1.4MW and the cost of electricity bills amount to around ₹25 lakh per month. “Through the unit, we will be able to account for 75% of the requirement. The electricity that is generated through the unit will be wheeled to a sub-station near Checkanurani. By generating electricity and supplying, we will then have to pay only the remaining sum as electricity bills. We expect to save around ₹15-16 lakh per month,” said Ashokkumar.

---||Madurai||Madras HC confirms life sentence awarded to man in murder case||MADURAI: Dismissing an appeal by a murder convict, the Madras high court has confirmed the conviction and life sentence awarded to him for murdering another man over a property dispute at Tuticorin district in 2010. According to the prosecution, the victim Thangavel was involved in cultivation on a land belonging to Mookammal at K Shanmugapuram village. The accused Muthuvel acted as a broker and arranged the sale of Mookammal’s property to Kamatchi alias Gandhi. When Kamatchi tried to evict Thangavel, he claimed ownership over the land and refused to vacate. On September 6, 2010, when Thangavel was standing near the library in the village and was talking with some people, Muthuvel assaulted him using a billhook causing his death. When Thangavel’s son Palaniraj who was standing opposite to the library saw this incident and attempted to save his father, Muthuvel threatened him too. Based on Palaniraj’s complaint, the Ottapidaram police arrested Muthuvel four days later. In 2011, the Tuticorin II additional sessions court convicted and sentenced Muthuvel to undergo life imprisonment for offence under Section 302 (murder) of IPC and five years rigorous imprisonment for offence under Section 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of IPC. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Challenging the conviction and sentence, Muthuvel filed the present criminal appeal before the HC Madurai bench in 2018. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that one of the peculiar facts in this case is, the disclosure of information by Muthuvel for causing the death of Thangavel. According to Muthuvel’s confessional statement, Thangavel threatened him for supporting the purchaser of the property. Therefore, Muthuvel was under constant fear that the Thangavel may kill him. Due to this reason, Muthuvel had killed Thangavel. The judges said that Muthuvel had attacked Thangavel with a billhook without any immediate provocation. The alleged previous threat by Thangavel has not been supported by any evidence. Therefore, this court finds that it is a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder and the charge for the offence under Section 302 of IPC, is well proved, said the judges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-confirms-life-sentence-awarded-to-man-in-murder-case/articleshow/89126892.cms||Kaushik Kannan

He urged the Centre to register its disapproval in the strongest possible terms as the Lankan authorities don’t have any legal rights to auction the boats from Tamil Nadu. Expressing disappointment over the process initiated by the Sri Lankan department, Stalin stated that this unfortunate development has come at a time when the Indo-Sri Lankan joint working group on fisheries is due to meet. The effort to auction has created alarm and distrust among the TN fishermen who have come forward with an accommodative frame of mind to find an amicable solution for this long-pending issue of the fishermen fishing in traditional fishing grounds in Lankan waters. According to an advertisement released by the director general of the department S J Kahawatta, all the 105 trawling boats - 65 in Karainagar (February 7), five in Kankesanturai (February 8), 24 in Kiranchi (February 9), nine in Thalaimannar (February 10) and two in Kalpitiya (February 11), are to be auctioned. He also said that the ministry of external affairs had requested the Tamil Nadu government to send a technical team to finalise the process and modalities to dispose of 125 (including the 105 to be auctioned) unsalvageable boats berthed in Sri Lanka. The state had also issued orders to depute officials and stakeholders to inspect and oversee disposal of the boats and to transfer the sale proceeds to the boat owners here. Even as the delegation was scheduled visit to Sri Lanka for this purpose, the effort to auction the boats without due consultation is bound to derail the efforts of the governments of India and Tami Nadu. The CM sought continuance of the efforts for transparent disposal of the 125 boats apprehended before 2018 and release of 75 boats and fishing gears apprehended after 2018. Meanwhile, Stalin also wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday expressing displeasure over India ‘being silent’ over atrocities meted out against Tamil Nadu fishermen and to bring such instances to an end. He was referring to the attack on the three fishermen from Pushpavanam near Vedaranyam, Nagapattinam district, by unidentified Sri Lankan nationals in the sea on January 23. The men are still under treatment. “This has become a matter of life and death for thousands of our fisherfolk whose livelihood is under serious threat. India cannot continue to be seen as a mute spectator as the rights of Indian fishermen are repeatedly trampled upon,” the CM stated. Meanwhile, former general secretary of the AIADMK, V K Sasikala has condemned the auctioning of the boats by Sri Lanka. She also said that the granting of permission to Sri Lankan fishermen to participate in the Katchateevu festival and denial of the same to Indian fishermen citing Covid as a reason, was unacceptable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/cm-seeks-pms-intervention-to-stop-auctioning-of-105-tn-fishing-boats/articleshow/89126893.cms||---

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S Srimathy closed a public interest litigation filed by S Kavivarman alias Suresh Kanna, CPM district secretary of Pudukottai district. The petitioner had stated that the firing range was established 20 years ago. The authorities who are incharge of the firing range should take all precautionary steps before commencing practice by hoisting red flags, inform the people of the nearby villages by sounding an alarm. He stated that though there are several rules and safety precautions which are to be followed in the firing range, they are not being followed properly. In 2001, a man Murugesan of Vilathupatti village sustained injuries as he was hit by a stray bullet from the firing range. Kavivarman stated that no compensation was given to Murugesan and he had to spend his own money for medical treatment. He stated that the authorities ought to have closed the firing range following the 2001 incident, however, they failed to do so. Due to this reason, a 11-year-old boy K Pugazhendhi of Narthamalai village was killed as he was hit by a stray bullet during the firing practice, in December 2021. He stated that he had submitted a representation to the authorities seeking to close the firing range and shift it to a remote place, in order to prevent such incidents in the future. Since there was no response, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/firing-range-which-caused-boys-death-closed-state-to-hc/articleshow/89126895.cms||---

The association held officials at the field level in the concerned departments responsible for the inferior quality.President of the association, S P Jeyapragasam urged the CM to procure jaggery from Tamil Nadu in the future for the benefit of the local agriculturists.The trade body also sought classification of jaggery as pure and those with added sugar. “Along with sugarcane juice, white sugar and maida are also added for making jaggery. Such jaggery loses its characteristics like texture within seven days of production. We have been requesting the Food Safety and Standards Authority to classify and to announce such jaggery as a different food product. But there is no permanent solution till date,” he said.The association reiterated its demand for immediate classification of jaggery made with sugarcane juice as sugarcane jaggery and the ones made from palmyrah juice as palmyrah jaggery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/poor-quality-jaggery-was-procured-for-pongal-gift/articleshow/89126896.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madras HC seeks response from govt on safety at amusement parks||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday sought a response from the state government as to whether rules and regulations have been framed to ensure the safety of the people visiting amusement parks in the state. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and S Srimathy sought the response with regard to the periodical maintenance of the rides, availability of doctors and with regard to facilities available to provide first aid at the amusement parks. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by J Razul Mydeen, a resident of Tirunelveli district. The petitioner stated that there are no specific laws governing the amusement parks industry in India though licences and safety audits were mandatory. To ensure the safety and stability of rides, permanent theme parks follow detailed guidelines formulated by the Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries, an industry-run body. She stated that these guidelines have been adopted by the Union government’s Bureau of Indian Standards. While certificates given by the bureau are valuable, they are not mandatory. The government agencies do not have experts to inspect rides and ensure that the standards are met. Many fatal accidents were reported in amusement parks frequently in India. In Tamil Nadu alone, nearly five deaths were reported in and around Chennai since 2006. She stated that a person is operating an amusement park inside his hotel premises with few rides at Melapalayam in Tirunelveli district with no proper permission. The park lacks safety measures and poses a threat to the lives of the people. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to the authorities to take action against the illegally operated amusement park.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-from-govt-on-safety-at-amusement-parks/articleshow/89126898.cms||---

However, pharmacies have been instructed to sell such medicines strictly with proper prescriptions and avoid over-the-counter sales. “There has been an increase in sales of especially paracetamol tablets. Usually between November and January, viral fevers, cold and cough are common but now there is Covid-19 too. People used to buy only one or two tablets of paracetamol earlier, but now, many are buying one or two strips. It has become a habit to store paracetamol like an essential item,” said K Manoharan, state president, Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association. He said they have been asked not to sell paracetamol without prescription strictly and refer customers asking for it to a doctor. Costing as low as one to two rupees a tablet depending on the brand, paracetamol is among the cheapest medicines. In Madurai, almost all shops ask for prescriptions if the medicine is asked in bulk. “Some customers, especially regulars, insist on getting paracetamol tablets without prescription. We try to give them two or three and ask them to come with only a prescription if more tablets are needed. It is a little difficult for patients too as not all fevers or body pains are due to Covid-19,” said a pharmacist on Kamarajar Salai. Pharmacies further said they have also been asked to try to keep track of names and phone numbers of those buying paracetamol or other medicines for cold and cough. “But, patients with other ailments, are facing difficulties. On the other hand, buying such medicines through e-commerce platforms is left unchecked,” said D Murugesan, a pharmacist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/covid-19-pushes-up-sales-of-antibiotics-paracetamol-tabs/articleshow/89126901.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The number of students getting medical seats is set to be more than last year, as only 13 got medical seats. In Madurai, as many as 88 students out of 300 who underwent the government NEET e-box coaching cleared NEET by scoring above 108 marks. Thirteen among them had scored above 200 marks. The top scorer was B R Priyanka from Avvai Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School who scored 414 marks. Harish Kumar from Elumalai Government Boys Higher Secondary School and S Aashika Rani from EVR Nagamayar Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School secured second and third positions with scores of 373 and 351 respectively. All top three scorers had given the NEET exam for the first time. As per the rank list, Aashika Rani also secured top position in Tamil Nadu within her community under the 7.5% quota. “We are expecting 20 students to secure medical seats. If some students can get through the open category, then there will be more chances for others. Students who secured above 300 marks have a very good chance to get a medical seat. We are hoping for the best,” said S Vennila Devi, co-ordinator for the NEET E-box coaching, Madurai district. Though some students have also got engineering seats under the 7.5% quota this year, they are also eligible and are set to attend the counselling. Teachers admitted it would have been difficult for government students without the 7.5% quota. The marks scored by the students are still comparatively less overall and from Madurai district, only one student has scored over 400. “Students were forced to give NEET exam last year by having to learn only from their homes. If offline classes had happened as usual, the scores may have improved,” said Devi. Once the counselling for 2021-2022 is over, interested students can take up e-box coaching for NEET exam 2022, for which online classes are set to begin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/at-least-20-students-from-madurai-may-land-mbbs-seats-in-7-5-quota/articleshow/89126903.cms||---

Khanna, who filed his nomination for the seat on Tuesday, has previously been the urban development minister, finance minister, and health and medical education minister of UP.From 1952 to 1989, the Shahjahanpur seat was won mostly by Muslim candidates, with one exception in 1969 when Uma Shankar Shukla from the Bhartiya Jana Sangh triumphed. The seat has roughly 37% Muslim voters.However, since 1989, Khanna has had an unprecedented run in Shahjahanpur. The sitting MLA, who belongs to the Punjabi community (that comprises only 1% population of the area), said he is aiming to equal the record of Congress' Ram Sewak, who won nine consecutive times from the Jagdishpur constituency in Amethi district. Khanna this time has been pitted against Tanveer Khan from the Samajwadi Party, a popular Muslim leader close to Akhilesh Yadav, and 32-year-old Asha worker Poonam Pandey from the Congress.Khanna, 67, plunged into politics during his days at Lucknow University in 1977 where he studied law. He contested his first assembly elections from Shahjahanpur in 1980 as a Lok Dal nominee and was defeated by Congress candidate Nawab Sadiq Ali Khan.Undeterred by his defeat, Khanna continued to work in Shahjahanpur, and in 1985, BJP awarded him a party ticket for the assembly polls. He was defeated by Congress' Nawab Sikandar Ali Khan by a margin of around 4,000 votes but was fielded by the BJP again in 1989 and he defeated Nawab Sikandar Ali. The results came as a surprise to many. After that win, Khanna said he never looked back, winning consecutive elections.According to 2022 data provided by the district administration, the total voters for the seat are approximately 4 lakh, with 1.87 lakh women. Nearly 37% belong to the Muslim community while 28% are OBC, and 20% Dalit. A cleric of a known mosque in Shahjahanpur said, “Khanna has been helping people of our community and has kept our city away from communal violence. He has developed a biodiversity park in the Kakra area of the city, which was Muslim-dominated and many have benefitted because of this. We find him approachable. He is always ready to help people.”SP candidate from the seat Tanveer Khan, meanwhile, said, "Khanna recently inaugurated a bridge which will take another six months to complete. Most of the development works started when SP was in power in the state. This time, he will be dethroned by residents of Shahjahanpur."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/bjp-mla-looks-for-record-9th-win-in-shahjahanpur/articleshow/89126906.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

At present, bagasse, the fibrous material received after crushing the sugarcane is utilized mostly as a fuel. National Sugar Institute is working on developing various value added products to enhance revenues of sugar factories and ‘Activated Bio-char’ is another such product in the series.At present, sugar refineries use ‘Ion Exchange Resins’ to de-colorize their sugar melt to produce superior quality sugar of low colour value. However, use of such resins escalates cost of production, besides generation of substantial quantity of effluents. The product development and laboratory scale trials were aimed to assess possibilities of replacing ‘Ion Exchange Resins’ with the ‘Activated Bio-char’ produced from bagasse, informed Director, National Sugar Institute, Professor Narendra Mohan. The laboratory scale trial for decolorizing the sugar melt are encouraging with a colour reduction to the extent of 30%.The ‘Activated Bio-char’ from bagasse has been prepared by carrying out drying the bagasse, grinding and screening it to desired particle size, conducting pyrolysis under anaerobic conditions, that is in the absence of air and then activating the surface through acid treatment under controlled conditions. About 10% recovery of ‘Activated Bio-char’ has been obtained from the bagasse. Thus, looking to the price of bagasse as Rs. 2000/- per MT, the cost of production is expected to be lower, said Shalini Kumari, Project Scientist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/sugar-institute-achieves-success-in-producing-activated-bio-char/articleshow/89126938.cms||---

Punarkala, who belongs to a remote Dailekh village in Bindrasaini district in Nepal, had left home due to mental health issues after the death of her husband 10 years ago. Her family thought they had lost her when she failed to return home. However, Punarkala was found by a Nepali watchman, Vasudeo, in Mainpuri district two months ago. Vasudeo posted her picture and details on social media, which reached Nepal. Her son, Mahesh, and daughter, Sushmita, came across the message and came to Mainpuri and identified her. On Monday, they took their mother back to Nepal. Vasedeo, who works as a watchman, found the missing woman loitering near a bus stand in Kishni are of the district about two months ago. When he interacted with her, she gave information about herself. Vasudeo clicked her photo on his android phone and shared it on social media. In the meantime, the woman had disappeared again from Kishni. On the basis of information received from social media, the woman’s family, including her son and daughter from Nepal, however, reached Kishni. A massive search was then conducted. It was when she remained untraceable, the family members had put up posters of the woman in the area. Finally, two days ago the woman was spotted in the Bewar area of the district. Another, Nepali man, living there, informed about the woman’s presence on the number given in the poster.

One of the accused posed as an SBI card helpline executive. The incident took place on October 23 and the police lodged an FIR on Tuesday after an inquiry.Dr Christina George, professor of anesthesiology at Christian Medical College and Hospital, said in her police complaint, “I planned to go to Udaipur for holidays and booked air tickets online. The next day, when I was on duty at the hospital, I received a call. The caller introduced himself as an executive of SBI card helpline. He told me details of the transactions made for booking air tickets. He said I would get reward points for the transactions and asked me to share OTP I received on phone.”Dr George said she did not share the OTP with the caller. “But a few seconds later, I received five SMSes that Rs 89,000 had been withdrawn from my account. I immediately disconnected the call,” she added.Dr George got her debit card blocked and reached the Ludhiana police cyber cell. Inspector Jatinder Singh, in charge of cyber cell-II, said, “We found that the money was transferred via PayU application. We contacted the executives of the application and got the account frozen. But before that the accused had transferred the money to four different bank accounts. The doctor said she did not share the OTP and the caller had all the details of her account. It seems she inadvertently shared some information or used an unsafe browser or a website.”  “It is a request to people not to share any details with unidentified callers and ensure that the websites they are using are genuine,” the cop added.Following the inquiry, the Division 3 police have registered a case against two accused identified as Shankar and Vinod Kumar of Uttar Pradesh under sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.
