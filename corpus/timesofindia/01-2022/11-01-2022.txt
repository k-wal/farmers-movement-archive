---||Business||Amazon files new legal challenges in dispute with Future Group: Report||NEW DELHI: Amazon has filed fresh legal challenges in its long-running dispute with retailer Future Group after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended a 2019 deal between the two sides, leading to a halt in their arbitration, four sources told Reuters on Sunday. The CCI last month suspended its approval of Amazon's 2019 deal with Future, denting the US e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to market leader Reliance Industries. The suspension jolted Amazon as subsequently a New Delhi court halted the arbitration proceedings between the two sides. Late on Saturday night, Amazon filed an appeal against the CCI suspension decision at National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, two of the sources said. Separately, two other sources said, Amazon also filed a challenge in the Supreme Court against the Delhi court decision in which judges last week that said Future-Amazon arbitration proceedings must remain on hold until February 1 in light of the antitrust suspension of the deal. Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The filings are the latest in the bitter legal dispute which has embroiled Amazon, Future and Reliance over what is seen as a battle for retail supremacy in India's booming consumer market. Reliance, run by one of India's richest men Mukesh Ambani, wants to expand its footprint by acquiring debt-laden Future, but Amazon has told CCI it believes Reliance's consolidated position "will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market". Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance. The US company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing. But after the CCI suspended that deal's approval, saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the deal, Future has argued Amazon no longer has any legal basis to pursue the dispute. Both of Amazon's appeals, to the tribunal and Supreme Court, are likely to be heard in coming days, two of the sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-files-new-legal-challenges-in-dispute-with-future-group-report/articleshow/88818602.cms||---

The programme was to commemorate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu as well as his return to Bangladesh from the Pakistan jail in 1971 on January 10, as well as the golden jubilee celebrations of the liberation of Bangladesh. Bangabandhu while flying back to Bangladesh after being released from Pakistan jail on this day 50 years ago had stopped at Kolkata to say thank you to the people of Bengal, said the minister. The foreign minister recalled the role of India during the Liberation War of Bangladesh and particularly how Indira Gandhi had helped in releasing Bangabandhu from the Pakistan jail. He thanked India for the friendship ties for the last 50 years as this year also is being celebrated as the golden jubilee of the Indo-Bangla friendship year. The minister also recalled how India had supported the refugees from Bangladesh during the war of 1971. Momen said that on April 18, 1971, the first foreign mission of Bangladesh was opened in Kolkata and that is why Kolkata occupies a special space in the heart of all people of Bangladesh. For which on this particular day when Bangabandhu had returned to Bangladesh 50 years ago his bust was inaugurated in Kolkata. Deputy high commissioner of Kolkata Toufique Hasan along with other diplomats paid floral tribute to Bangabandhu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bangabandhu-sheikh-mujibur-rahmans-bust-inaugurated-in-kolkata/articleshow/88818614.cms||Debasis Konar
---||World||Sanjay Bhandari sues French arms company over alleged unpaid ‘commission’ for Mirage upgrade, has ‘applied for political asylum in Britain’||LONDON: Alleged defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has applied for political asylum in Britain and also started a €11m (Rs 92 crore) claim against a French arms company in a French court which could jeopardise future sales of Rafale military aircraft to India, according to a British newspaper. The Daily Telegraph said it had seen the claim that Bhandari is making against Thales in a commercial court near Paris. Thales supplies the avionics equipment for Dassault Aviation’s Rafale aircraft. Bhandari is asking the court to order Thales to pay him commission that he says he is owed, which Thales denies. In his claim against Thales, Bhandari alleges that he was hired by Thales to secure a €2.4 billion (Rs 20,119 crore) contract to upgrade Mirage 2000 military jets for the Indian Air Force. The contract was signed in 2011. The Telegraph states that "Mr Bhandari alleges that from 2008 he helped Thales sell the upgrade of the Mirage jets by facilitating a meeting” with a senior Indian official. “He claims that he was due a consultancy fee of €20m (Rs 167 crore) but was only paid €9m (Rs 75 crore). Mr Bhandari alleges this was due to political factors in 2016 when he was close to the Indian Congress Party. At this time the ruling BJP party … started persecuting him, he claims. He fled to the UK where he is currently fighting extradition on unrelated matters and is claiming political asylum," the British newspaper stated. This is the first time it has been alleged that Bhandari, who fled to Britain in 2016, has applied for political asylum in Britain. According to the claim, Bhandari was paid by Thales via "an elaborate financial covert scheme in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries. A special subsidiary called Thales Middle East & Africa is alleged to have been in charge of the deployment of these financial structures". The claim alleges that Thales awarded offset contracts to two companies based in Bengaluru, which paid part of the sums received from Thales to a Dubai-based company called UHY Saxena Consulting, which paid fees due to Bhandari. The newspaper conjectured that the case could impact India’s future purchases of Rafale fighter jets. India is in the midst of procuring 26 twin-engine fighter jets for India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) INS Vikrant in a deal said to be worth more than $2 billion. A Rafale-M (marine) fighter jet arrived in Goa last Thursday from France and is being tested by the Indian Navy from its shore-based test facility in Goa. In March the Indian Navy will try out the F-18 Super Hornets supplied by Boeing in the US and then the Indian government will decide which one to order. The timing is significant as it comes just weeks before Bhandari’s main extradition hearing starts in London on February 21. India is seeking to extradite Bhandari from London to India to face charges of tax evasion in India between April 24, 2016 and September 22, 2019. He is facing multiple other probes and court cases in India. Thales denies the claims, saying it never hired Bhandari and does not use middlemen. A spokesperson for Thales told TOI: "Mr Bhandari filed a petition against Thales SA in a commercial court in June 2021 for the settlement of sums allegedly due to him on an aeronautical modernisation project. Thales firmly denies the claims by Mr Sanjay Bhandari regarding the sums allegedly due or any other payments to him by Thales SA. Thales has never signed a contract with Mr Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project. Thales complies with the law and applies a zero tolerance policy on corruption and influence peddling. The group’s integrity programme is regularly evaluated and amended to reflect changes in applicable legislation and best practices."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sanjay-bhandari-sues-french-arms-company-over-alleged-unpaid-commission-for-mirage-upgrade-has-applied-for-political-asylum-in-britain/articleshow/88818733.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The slain terrorists were identified as Imad Muzaffar Wani (21) and Abdul Rashid Thokar (20), said police. Thokar was from Kulgam’s Hasanpora Tabela area and had been active since December 5, 2021. Wani, a resident of Arigam in the same district, had also joined terrorist ranks last year. IGP (Kashmir Zone) Vijay Kumar, in a tweet, identified Wani as a “categorized militant” of Al-Badr, adding: “He (Wani) was involved in an attack on police personnel Mushtaq Waggay in Pulwama on December 19, 2021, in which he (Waggay) got seriously injured.” Late Sunday, a joint team of the Army’s 1RR, J&K Police and CRPF launched a cordon-and-search operation in Hasanpora Tabela based on intelligence inputs about two holed-up terrorists in the area, said a police officer. A gunfight subsequently broke out between the terrorists and the search party, in which the Al-Badr duo was killed, said the officer, adding that the encounter ended around 2.05am.

Representatives of several far-right groups had allegedly called for ethnic cleansing of minorities in the country, especially its 200 million-strong Muslim population. In a series of posts, Imran said the NDA government's inaction had emboldened extremist Hindutva groups operating under BJP's patronage to call for a "genocide of minorities in the country". The anti-Modi tweet storm coincides with Imran's government facing a backlash at home over serious administrative and financial failures. "The extremist ideology of the ruling BJP government was behind the provocations against India’s minorities," PM Imran said. "Under the extremist ideology of the BJP Modi govt, all religious minorities in India have been targeted with impunity by Hindutva groups." He urged the international community to take notice of the calls and act against them. "The extremist agenda of the Modi government is a real and present threat to peace in our region," Imran said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/imran-slams-modi-for-silence-on-haridwar-hate-speeches/articleshow/88818488.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Swiss bank UBS AG had obtained permission to issue a writ of permission against Mallya, his son Sidhartha and mother Lalitha, who live there, as well as British Virgin Islands-registered company Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, in October 2021 from deputy master Bowles at the London high court. The bank wants to evict the Mallya family and sell the house after Rose Capital, which owns the property, mortgaged the property to UBS as security for a five-year loan of £20.4 million (Rs 200 crore) in 2012. The loan expired on March 26, 2017, and the outstanding balance on that date was not paid. Rose Capital is owned by the Sileta Trust, a Mallya family trust. On Monday Rose Capital sought to get a stay saying it needed more time to realise assets to pay the lender back. UBS said it was opposed to the stay and wanted to go ahead with possession proceedings as the matter had already been delayed multiple times since 2017.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-judge-reserves-judgment-on-whether-vijay-mallya-is-to-be-evicted-from-posh-london-home/articleshow/88818883.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The bureaucrat-turned-politician was speaking at a programme organized by the Victory Inter College in Uttar Pradesh's Dohrighat on January 4. During the programme, Sharma paid tributes to late former Union minister Kalpnath Rai and said the light of development the latter has lit will be taken forward by the BJP. In an indirect swipe at the Samajwadi Party, the BJP leader said that while leaders like Rai cultivated a culture of development, there are others who cultivated the "virus of casteism". Stepping up his attack, Sharma said that he has been a student of political science for many years but never came across a brand of socialism where there are slogans like "khali plot humara hai" (empty plot is ours). "Where is socialism in appointing an SDM without qualification? Only BJP can do work in an honest and transparent manner," Sharma said. Sharma said that with the support of the people of the state, the BJP will fulfil the dream of creating a "Ram Rajya" in Uttar Pradesh. Addressing his supporters, the BJP leader said that he joined the party on January 14 last year and has now brought his report card to the public. "I will always be devoted to the people and would never back down from doing any work in public interest," he said. The former IAS officer also asked his supporters to reach out to him for any issue, be it pertaining to good roads or hospital facilities. He also expressed his gratitude to the "lakhs of people" who accorded him a grand welcome during his visit to Mau and said that he has a special emotional attachment to the soil of Sarayu river since his maternal family lived here.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-bjp-govt-can-ensure-honesty-transparency-up-bjp-vice-president-ak-sharma/articleshow/88819352.cms||---

---||Delhi||Marital ties ‘qualitatively different’, may shield spouse from rape charge: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The protection given to husbands from being booked for rape under the IPC may have to do with the “qualitative difference” between marital and non-marital relationships, the Delhi high court said on Monday. In preliminary remarks, Justice C Hari Shankar, as part of a division bench, tested claims and submissions made by a batch of petitions seeking to criminalise sex without consent in a marriage as ‘marital rape’. The court said while there can be no compromise with women’s right to sexual autonomy and any act of rape has to be punished, the “qualitative difference” is that in a marriage, unlike a live-in or a relationship, a spouse has an expectation and “to an extent a legal right” to establish conjugal/sexual relations with the partner. “That qualitative difference has a part to play in why that exception is there... we must appreciate the reason why it remains on the statute books despite the Verma Commission and Law Commission. For 150 years, the legislature has kept it,” Justice Shankar said, underlining that petitioners have to show pressing reasons why HC should strike down a provision. Adding a rider that these are not his firmed up views but only preliminary line of inquiry, Justice Shankar said one reason for Parliament keeping the exception intact might be the manner in which rape as an offence is defined in Section 375. “It is a wide definition, it says even a single instance of unwilling sex with unwilling party is rape,” he said. “Let’s take a newly married couple. On a particular day, wife says no... If for third day it happens, the husband says ‘am walking out’ but wife gives in. Do we categorise it as rape? He is exercising what he believes to be his conjugal right. It is rape if we knock off the exception,” the court said. “There is no compromise with a woman’s right to sexual and bodily integrity. A husband has no business to compel. (But) the court can’t ignore what happens if we strike down the exception. The husband goes to jail for 10 years if he does this even on one occasion… We need a much more incisive insight into the issue,” the judge said. Justice Shankar also expressed his reservations with use of the term “marital rape”, saying that calling it rape to define any form of an unwilling sexual relationship between a husband and a wife is “a kind of pre-decision”. “There is no (concept of) marital rape in India… If it is rape — marital, non-marital or any kind, it has to be punished. Repeated use of the word, according to me, obfuscates the actual issue,” he said. The bench headed by Justice Rajiv Shakdher — who stated he would “reserve” his “comment” and clarified the court was just having an open discussion — was hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation and All India Democratic Women’s Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/marital-ties-qualitatively-different-may-shield-spouse-from-rape-charge-delhi-hc/articleshow/88819926.cms||Abhinav Garg

Days after ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava said that molnupiravir has major health safety concerns, some of India’s top health experts said the benefits of the drug outweigh potential risks. Studies so far have shown no convincing side-effects among humans, they said. Late last year, India’s drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), had approved molnupiravir for restricted use in emergency situations. Read AlsoCovid-19: Maharashtra to exclude molnupiravir for ‘non-comorbids’ from new guidelinesThe state health department has decided to issue a fresh set of norms after drawing flak for including the new oral anti-viral pill, molnupiravir, for mildly infected “non-comorbid” Covid patients in the state’s newly revised treatment guidelines released on Thursday.However, questions were raised by the Indian Council of Medical Research about its potential to cause teratogenicity, mutagenicity, cartilage damage, and possible dangers to pregnant and lactating mothers. Coronavirus live updates“Here is drug which I am sure both CDSCO and DCGI have analysed before approving for use,” said Dr Govindarajan Padmanaban, a key member of the national Covid task force. “Any anti-viral at this stage is useful, and molnupiravir should be used taking all precautions as Covid cases are dangerously multiplying,” he said. Dr Dhruva Chaudhry, nodal officer for Covid for Haryana, said so far only animal studies have shown some side-effects. “The question is can a medicine cause cancer in humans after using it for only five days? There should not be any hesitation in using the drug among patients above 45-50 years with co-morbidities... “It’s a trade-off and it’s more in favour of benefits.” Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a task force member, said the drug should be used at a clinician’s discretion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/molnupiravir-gains-outweigh-risks-experts-counter-icmr/articleshow/88819998.cms||Bappa Majumdar

But there is no cause to panic as we are adequately prepared,” an official said.

Coronavirus live updatesOfficials also maintained that many modelling studies had been done in India to predict the peak and evidence from South Africa shows that cases powered by Omicron rises at an alarming speed but are also likely to fall with an equal velocity. Underlining that majority of cases are asymptomatic and mild, officials said expansion of vaccination coverage has helped keep hospitalisation low. “The infection in the current wave appears to be mild,” the official said. The health ministry data shows India’s medical oxygen production capacity has been ramped up to 19,236 metric tonnes per day from around 9,500 metric tonnes a day during the peak of second surge. “We do not know if we will even need that much medical oxygen with Omicron as it is an upper respiratory tract infection,” a senior official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-infrastructure-doubled-since-second-wave-ready-for-next-peak-govt-says/articleshow/88820127.cms||Sushmi Dey

"Well, we continue to closely monitor the situation. We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes. We've been pretty clear how we view Beijing's behavior in the region around the world. We believe it can be destabilizing, and we're concerned by the PRC attempt to intimidate its neighbours. We'll continue to stand with our partners on that," said Psaki while responding to a question on the India-China border dispute during a press briefing here. This comes ahead of the 14th round of the talks scheduled between India and China to resolve the standoff in eastern Ladakh. India and China will hold Corps Commander level talks on January 12 after a gap of three months. Earlier, the US Department of Defence in December last year expressed concern about China's military build-up near the demarcation line across its Himalayan border with India has compelled Pentagon to worry.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-closely-monitoring-india-china-border-dispute-concerned-by-beijings-attempt-to-intimidate-its-neighbours-white-house/articleshow/88820154.cms||---

The Nobel laureate has been detained since February 1 when her government was forced out in an early morning coup, ending Myanmar's short-lived experiment with democracy. The generals' power grab triggered widespread dissent, which security forces sought to quell with mass detentions and bloody crackdowns in which more than 1,400 civilians have been killed, according to a local monitoring group. A source with knowledge of the case told AFP the 76-year-old was found guilty of two charges related to illegally importing and owning walkie-talkies and one of breaking coronavirus rules. Junta spokesman Major General Zaw Min Tun confirmed the verdicts and sentences and told AFP Suu Kyi would remain under house arrest while other cases against her proceed. The walkie-talkie charges stem from when soldiers raided her house on the day of the coup, allegedly discovering the contraband equipment. The United States condemned what it called the "unjust arrest, conviction and sentencing" of Suu Kyi, which it said was carried out in "an affront to justice and the rule of law." "We call on the regime to immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and all those unjustly detained, including other democratically elected leaders," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. Monday's sentence adds to the penalties the court handed down in December when she was jailed for four years for incitement and breaching Covid-19 rules while campaigning. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing cut the sentence to two years and said she could serve her term under house arrest in the capital Naypyidaw. The total six-year jail term would mean Suu Kyi would not be able to participate in fresh elections that the military authorities have pledged to hold by August 2023. December's ruling drew international condemnation, and the Myanmar public reverted to old protesting tactics of banging pots and pans in a show of anger. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awarded Suu Kyi the Peace Prize in 1991, said it was "deeply concerned about her situation," with chairwoman Reiss-Andersen calling Monday's verdict "a politically motivated ruling." Journalists have been barred from attending hearings, and Suu Kyi's lawyers have been muzzled from speaking to the media. The verdicts come days after Cambodian strongman Hun Sen -- who currently holds the chair for regional bloc ASEAN -- held talks with Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw. ASEAN has sought to use its influence to defuse the Myanmar crisis, but Hun Sen's visit attracted criticism from rights groups and anti-junta activists. Under a previous junta regime, Suu Kyi spent long spells under house arrest in her family mansion in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. Today, she is confined to an undisclosed location in the capital, with her link to the outside world limited to brief pre-trial meetings with her lawyers. Besides Monday's cases, she is also facing multiple counts of corruption -- each of which is punishable by 15 years in jail -- and of violating the official secrets act. Deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch Phil Robertson condemned Monday's convictions. "The Myanmar junta's courtroom circus of secret proceedings on bogus charges is all about steadily piling up more convictions against Aung San Suu Kyi so that she will remain in prison indefinitely," he said in a statement. In November, she and 15 other officials, including Myanmar's president Win Myint, were also charged with alleged electoral fraud during the 2020 polls. Her National League for Democracy party had swept the elections in a landslide, trouncing a military-aligned party by a wider margin than the previous 2015 election. Since the coup, many of her political allies have been arrested, with one chief minister sentenced to 75 years in jail. Others are in hiding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/myanmars-suu-kyi-hit-with-new-convictions-jail-term/articleshow/88820192.cms||---
---||India||Dharam Sansad hate speech case: Supreme Court to take up plea against hate speech||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday assured Congress leader and senior advocate Kapil Sibal that it would take up a public interest litigation petition demanding action against those who indulged in hate speech and gave calls for armed action against the minority community at congregations in Haridwar and Delhi last month. Seeking urgent hearing of the PIL, filed by journalist Qurban Ali, Sibal told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli that though police have registered two FIRs, no arrests have been made despite lapse of almost a month. “’Shasatrameva Jayate’ (armed action may triumph), appears to be replacing our national ethos ‘Satyameva Jayate’ (truth alone may triumph),” he said in angst. The CJI assured him of early listing of the PIL before an appropriate bench and said, “We will take up this matter.” Ali said, “Hate speeches have been delivered between the 17th and 19th of December, in two events organised in Haridwar (by one Yati Narsinghanand), and in Delhi (by an organisation self-styled as ‘Hindu Yuva Vahini’) with the apparent objective of declaring war against a significant section of the Indian citizenry.” Open calls for genocide of Muslims were made in those speeches for achieving ethnic cleansing, he said, adding, “The said speeches are not mere hate speeches but amount to an open call for murder of an entire community. The said speeches thus, pose a grave threat not just to the unity and integrity of our country but also endanger the lives of millions of Muslim citizens.” Accusing police authorities of lackadaisical approach exemplified by non-slapping of Sections 120B, 121A and 153B of the Indian Penal Code, that squarely apply to the hate speeches, Ali said though FIRs named 10 people, those who made fiery genocide calls have been spared of Section 153A which deals with the offence of promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language. The petitioner cited a viral video in which one of the accused openly acknowledged a police officer’s allegiance with the organisers and speakers of the Dharam Sansad. “The contents of the speech feed into an already prevailing discourse which seeks to reimagine the Indian Republic as exclusivist, and that which has no space for other cultures, traditions and practices. Such a discourse is in itself violative of constitutional guarantees provided to minority cultures and religions in India,” he said. The journalist-petitioner said, “The speeches overtly and explicitly described Indian Muslims as usurpers of territory, and as predators of land, livelihoods and of Hindu women, thus creating paranoia and a completely manufactured feeling of being under siege amongst ordinary Hindu citizens. The discourse argues that Indian Muslim and Hindu citizens have competing interests, and for the latter to prosper and achieve cultural self-realization, the nature of the Indian Republic must be altered to that of a Hindu alone state. In its moderate form, the discourse advocates an active social and economic boycott of Muslims, and in some cases physical annihilation.” Uttarakhand Police had on January 3 filed an FIR under Sections 153A & 298 of the IPC against 9 people including Wasim Rizvi, Yati Narsinghanand, Sant Dharamdas Maharaj, Sadhvi Annapoorna alias Pooja Shakun Pandey, Sagar Sindhu Maharaj, Swami Anand Swaroop, Ashwani Upadhyay, Swami Prabodhanand Giri, Dharamdas Maharaj, Premanand Maharaj, he informed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dharam-sansad-hate-speech-case-supreme-court-to-take-up-plea-against-hate-speech/articleshow/88820176.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This included around 7.4 lakh health and frontline workers, and around 3.2 lakh elderly above 60 years of age. Reminder SMSs were pushed to more than 1 crore eligible recipients, inviting them to receive the precaution dose on Monday. Official sources say the low footfall could be due to multiple factors, including fear of infection, immobility among the elderly and increasing cases among health and frontline workers. Read AlsoCovid-19: 5%-10% of active cases needing hospitalisation so far, says govtAround 5-10% of the active Covid-19 cases have needed hospitalisation in the present surge so far, the health ministry data shows even as the Centre cautioned states that the situation is dynamic and demand for hospitalisation may change rapidly.States like Gujarat (1.6 lakh), Andhra Pradesh (1.2 lakh), Rajasthan (95,891) and Karnataka (82,384) administered the highest number of precaution doses. However, among the other major states, Uttar Pradesh – which will soon go to the polls – gave 59,628 booster shots, whereas Bihar administered 64,671. Madhya Pradesh received a footfall of 65,165, Maharashtra 49,524 and West Bengal 35,236 till 10pm. Meanwhile, the Centre clarified that no time limit has been set for Covid vaccination centres, and that they can operate till 10pm daily based on availability of human resources and infrastructure. Overall, about 91.3 lakh doses were given on Monday till 10pm, with more than 1 lakh sites conducting vaccination. According to the health ministry’s projection, nearly 3 crore health and frontline workers are estimated to be eligible in January to get the booster or “precaution dose” of Covid vaccine. Besides, nearly 2.8 crore people in the 60-plus age group with comorbidities are projected across the country. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu have most people in this category. However, very few such people may actually be eligible for receiving the third dose in January after completing the nine-month interval. The government has already clarified that ‘precaution dose’ will be of the same vaccine as the first and second dose. Those who got Covaxin will get Covaxin and those who got Covishield will get Covishield. Details of precaution dose will also reflect in the vaccination certificate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-10-5-lakh-receive-precaution-dose-on-first-day-of-roll-out/articleshow/88820246.cms||Sushmi Dey

DGP V K Bhawra said a police team from Nawanshahr seized six grenades, a 9mm pistol, a .30 bore rifle, live bullets and magazines from the arrested men, all of them natives of Gurdaspur district. The suspects were identified as Amandeep alias Mantri of Lakhanpal village, Gurwinder Singh alias Gindi and Parminder Kumar alias Rohit of Kharal, Rajinder Singh alias Malhi alias Nikku of Gunnupur, Harpreet Singh alias Dholki of Gotpokar and Raman Kumar of Ghazikot. The outfit had hurled hand grenades near Pathankot's Chakki Pull on November 11 and again outside Triveni Dwar of the Army's 21 sub-area on November 21. The DGP said the suspects had confessed to being in touch with ISYF (Rode) chief Lakhbir Singh Rode and his aides Sukhmeetpal Singh alias Sukh Bhikhariwal and Sukhpreet alias Sukh. “The entire cache of seized hand grenades, arms and ammunition were pushed in from across the international border by Rode. The arrested accused were tasked with attacking identified targets, mainly police and defence establishments, besides religious,” Bhawra said. The police also claimed to have confirmed Rode’s role in the killing of Shaurya Chakra awardee Comrade Balwinder Singh at Bhikhiwind on October 16, 2020, and hoarding IEDs, RDX, arms and ammunition at his relative Gurmukh Singh Rode's Jalandhar premises. The explosives and arms were confiscated in August last year. His aide Bhikhariwal, who is presently lodged in Tihar jail, was involved in the murderous attack on Shiv Sena youth leader Honey Mahajan at Dhariwal on February 10, 2020. He was deported from Dubai in December that year. Nawanshahr SSP Kanwardeep Kaur said the police registered an FIR on January 7 under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Explosive Substances Act and the Arms Act in connection with the Pathankot attacks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pathankot-grenade-attacks-terror-module-with-isyf-link-busted-6-held/articleshow/88820352.cms||---

The accident occurred around 7pm when the city-bound truck rammed the median and fell to its left, pouring the load of gravel on the cars and the bike. The deceased have been identified as Veenamma, 44, Keerti Kumar, 40, Indra Kumar, 14, and Neetu, 29, (all occupants of the first car), TJ Shivaprakash (lone occupant of the second car) and biker Jatin B George.

Police had a tough time in identifying the victims or contacting families as their mobile phones had security lock. "We removed sim cards from their phones and are using it in a basic handset and found some numbers. We can get more details on the victims after their families and friends reach the spot," an investigating officer said. The bodies were shifted to Rajarajeshwari Medical College and Hospital for autopsy. The truck driver fled the scene, leaving his vehicle behind.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad company now owns Mehul Choksi’s firm||HYDERABAD: City-based Ace Urban Developers Ltd now owns AP Gems and Jewellery Park Private Ltd, launched in 2001 in Hyderabad and later owned by fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi. It has gone into the hands of Ace Developers through corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) initiated and concluded by NCLT, Hyderabad. A bench of NVR Badarninath and A Veera Brahma Rao approved the resolution plan furnished by the resolution professional (RP). The company was referred to CIRP in June 2019 itself following an application by Phoenix Tech Tower company that sought initiation of insolvency process against the gems firm. Ace Developers agreed to pump in Rs 107 crore to clear the dues of the lenders and also to infuse fresh investment into the company. Assets of Choksi's firm comprising AP Gems and Jewellery Park company's two-acre land at Road No. 10, Banjara Hills, along with a five-storeyed building with 2 lakh square feet of constructed space were attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on October 17, 2018. The tussle over these assets is yet to attain a finality. Because the courts earlier upheld the claims of the ED that is investigating the Rs 6,000 crore scam allegedly committed by Choksi and his associates in Punjab National Bank. As the ED's attachments were made first and the insolvency process came in much later, the ED had an upper hand. What happens to the ED attachments now is an area where some clarity is still required. According to Anjali Agarwal, counsel for the ED, their attachment holds good because they moved in first. The case of the ED is that fugitive economic offender Choksi through his Gitanjali group of companies — Gitanjali Gems, Gili India and Nakshatra — in conspiracy with the bank officials and others defrauded PNB to the tune of Rs 6,097 crore. The PNB officials in connivance with Choksi had fraudulently issued letters of undertakings (LOUs) and foreign letter of credits (FLCs) worth Rs 3,011 crore and Rs 3,086 crore to Choksi's entities without following the prescribed procedure of obtaining required applications, documents and approval of the authorities and without making entries in the core banking system. Summons issued under sections 50(2) and (3) of PMLA to Choksi thrice in February 2018 went in vain. The ED then sought an NBW and fugitive economic offender tag on Choksi and got them issued again. The ED has also attached Rs 2,500 crore worth of assets belonging to Choksi and the Hyderabad assets were part of it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-company-now-owns-choksis-firm/articleshow/88820398.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

A fifth girl, aged nine, suffered grievous injuries and is undergoing treatment at a hospital.The girls who died have been identified as Vakila (19), Janista (18), Taslima (10) and Gulafsha (9). Hameed Sophia (9) was pulled out alive from under the soil and rushed to a hospital.Mustakim, the sarpanch of the village in Tauru division, said the five girls had gone to the small mound to bring soil for their houses. The mound, which was around 20ft high, had a special type of sticky soil that the villagers used to make ovens or clean their houses. “The mound was on panchayati land. Villagers were known to dig soil from the mound for their household purposes,” said Mustakim.The girls, according to the sarpanch, had started digging at the base of the mound, which caused the entire heap to collapse on them. As the girls screamed for help, a group of villagers rushed to the spot. “With a lot of effort, the villagers managed to pull out the girls. But by then, four of them had died. One was still breathing. We rushed her to the nearby hospital, where she is undergoing treatment,” the sarpanch said.Deputy commissioner Shakti Singh, who reached the village after coming to know about the deaths, said they would extend all support to the families of the girls. The girls’ fathers work as daily wage labourers.“I spoke to the SP and SDM in the evening itself. What we could gather as of now is that the girls were digging the soil from the base of the mound when the whole thing collapsed on them. It is indeed a tragic incident,” Singh added.The DC said they would carry out an inspection in the village and demolish any soil mound more than 5ft high. “We can’t wait for more such accidents to happen in the future. We will demolish all mounds that are more than 5ft high,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/four-girls-die-in-nuh-as-20ft-mound-collapses/articleshow/88820445.cms||Sagrika Kissu

While the minimum temperature was at 8.7 degrees Celsius — a notch above the normal — with shallow fog surrounded the city. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature is expected to drop further with the commencement of icy-cold northwesterlies into the region. On Sunday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 14.4 degrees Celsius, while the minimum was at 12 degrees Celsius. “With the passage of western disturbance, the winds direction has changed from warm south-esterlies to cold and dry north-westerlies which is causing a dip in temperature. Both the criteria to declare the ‘cold day’ condition have been satisfied today for Gurugram, while it has not satisfied ‘cold wave’ condition. However, the minimum temperature is expected to drop further and may touch 6 degrees in the coming days. With the high moisture content and dip in temperat-ure, moderate to dense fog condition is likely to prevail in the next 2-3 days during morning hours,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD Chandigarh. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature is expected to hover around 8 degrees Celsius, while maximum temperature is likely to touch 19 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The city AQI slipped to moderate category after one day of satisfactory air quality. The overall AQI reading was at 130, significantly up from Sunday’s 65. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in Delhi fell by four degrees on Monday, settling at 9.6 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s average, as the western disturbance withdrew from the region to bring back cold winds from the north and north-west. The weather office has forecast that the minimum temperature could hover around 5-6 degrees Celsius over the next few days. The maximum temperature, meanwhile, rose by three degrees to 18.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the season’s average, due to a clearer sky. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Sunday were 15 degrees Celsius and 13.8 degrees Celsius. While the morning hours on Monday did see shallow fog, visibility at the airport was still 800 metres. Weather analysts said due to the cleaner air, there are low chances of fog episodes in the region despite high moisture and low wind speeds. “The temperature drop in the region is gradual and there will be no cold wave in Delhi, at least for the next six days, though some of the neighbouring states may experience it. The minimum temperatures may drop to 5-7 degrees Celsius from January 13 onwards, with possibility of moderate fog in some isolated areas. There are no chances of intense fog episodes for the next few days, but we are monitoring the situation,” IMD senior scientist RJ Jenamani said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mercury-dips-further-brace-for-more-chill/articleshow/88820448.cms||---

The DTCP enforcement wing issued 46 recovery notices to landowners and builders of illegal colonies on Monday. The total amount sought is nearly Rs 16 lakh. The department would also serve other notices amounting to Rs 10 lakh within a week. Last year, the DTCP had decided to recover the cost of demolition drives from landowners and builders to check the mushrooming of illegal settlements and reduce the financial burden on the department. After conducting demolition drives over the past year, the department had prepared an estimate of the total expenses incurred, including the hiring of earthmovers and other resources. It is now seeking to recover that amount from nearly 450 offenders.District Town Planner (Enforcement) RS Batth said that the department has recommended that the deputy commissioner and the revenue department recover the amount as arrears from land revenue. “Till offenders pay the amount, the department can make a red entry in land revenue records,” Batth said. In its letter to the DC, the department said offenders are liable to pay the amount spent in demolition drives under section 10(3) of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Area Act, 1975. “The offenders have not deposited the requisite amount to date. So, we request you to direct the tehsildar concerned to recover the amount from the offenders,” the department told the DC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/recover-cost-of-demolition-from-violators-dtcp/articleshow/88820450.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

The imposter met the complainant in the case inside the NSG campus on several occasions and showed him his identity card, along with photograph and designation, as well as work sites, to win over his confidence and lure him into the tender processes. The accused allegedly forged the NSG seals to issue allotment letters to the complainant for building an internal road, a sewerage treatment plant (STP), a warehouse and a residential complex. He claimed money from the company for every work allotted as per the tender clause. On some occasions, the accused refunded money to the company, too. The accused had also opened a bank account in the name of the "Office of GC (Garrison) Station HQ, NSG, Manesar” and did all the transactions through this account. Complainant Davinder Yadav (55), a government contractor in the construction business, first met the accused, Praveen Yadav, in June 2021 inside the NSG campus. “During one of the meetings, he also showed an NSG identity card with his photograph and designation as group commander,” said Yadav. “After that, I was left with no doubt as it was not even possible to enter the NSG campus without the permission of a senior officer." The first quotation was sent on June 12, 2021, for building a 16.56km-long peripheral road inside the NSG campus. The complainant received another letter for building an STP on July 23. On September 2, he received a letter for building a warehouse inside the NSG campus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/man-poses-as-ips-officer-cheats-firm-of-37-crore/articleshow/88820451.cms||Bagish Jha

The health department had readied 13,000 doses for Monday — 8,000 for CoWin-registered recipients and 5,000 for walk-ins — but by the end of the day, only 2,489 people had turned up for the jabs at 108 session sites.Officials said while the elderly were reluctant to step out of home because of the surge in cases, the health care and frontline workers were busy with Covid duty. Across the district, around 38,000 recipients are eligible for the booster shot as of now — 800 Covaxin and 37,200 Covishield. Chief medical officer Virender Yadav said, “Those above 60 and have comorbidities are not stepping out of home because of the rise in cases. On the other hand, health care and frontline workers across the city are engaged in Covid duties.”At most of the session sites that carried out vaccinations of teenagers in the age group of 15-17 as well as booster shots, there were separate counters for the different categories. “We have made counters both age-wise and dose-wise so that there is no confusion. Yes, the response is slow for the booster dose at present as health care workers are busy managing Covid patients. For instance, our staff are handling cases, calling home isolation patients as well as carrying out vaccinations across the district,” said Dr Anshul Dalal of Wazirabad primary health care centre.Health care workers who took the third jab said they had made a roster for themselves so that their Covid duties aren’t hampered. “Health care and frontline workers involved in managing Covid cases are taking the jabs in a phased manner. We have decided on our own. Today, I am taking the jab and a colleague is filling in for me. I will do the same for someone tomorrow,” said Poonam, an Asha worker in Sector 31.Radha Chaudhary (47), a sanitation worker who had received her first jab on January 16, got her booster shot on Monday. “I did not face any issue with any of the three shots. But everyone should follow the safety protocols even after taking the booster dose,” she said.The elderly were reluctant to step out of their homes. Anup Mishra (65), however, was not among them. “I stepped out of home after almost a month, only to get the booster shot. Fortunately, I have not had Covid so far and I am trying to ensure that I continue to stay away from the virus,” he said after taking the jab.Many of the senior citizens who took the third jab urged others to get it too. “Everyone should get the doses as soon as possible. The rate of hospitalisation is low because of mass scale vaccinations across the country,” said Sunil Mathur (65), who was at Medanta-The Medicity.Various government departments had set up camps for frontline workers on their premises. “All departments have been told to ensure that frontline workers who are eligible for a booster should get it at the earliest,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.Doctors at private hospitals said the rate of vaccinations was likely to increase in the coming days.Dr. Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of the emergency department at Narayana Hospitals, said, “At our booster dose centre, a total of 187 recipients received the booster shot. None of them experienced any type of reaction.”Some private hospitals said they would increase the doses with time. “The precautionary dose of the Covid vaccine is an encouraging step. Like other centres, we have started the precautionary doses for health care workers and senior citizens with comorbidities. This will definitely help the entire community to contain the severity and the spread of the virus,” said Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director of Fortis Hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/booster-jab-day-1-starts-on-slow-note/articleshow/88820453.cms||Ipsita Pati

The doctors threatened an indefinite strike from January 14 if the government did not meet their demand. The doctors also demanded a pay structure at par with other states, according to the central government rules. Moreover, the Haryana Civil Medical Services doctors' association demanded that the government stop direct recruitments to the Senior Medical Officer (SMO) post and appoint SMOs through promotions. It noted that in the absence of a 'specialist cadre', 95% of the HCMS doctors have only this one promotion avenue during their service years. “We will be protesting against the direct recruitment of SMOs and seeking an amendment to the post-graduation policy,” said HCMS vice-president Dr MP Singh. The doctors demanded 40% reservation in the post-graduation seats for rural and practising doctors. Singh added that they would suspend OPD services on Tuesday and declare a strike from January 14, affecting emergency services, if the state government did not give them a response. Previously in December, over 1,000 doctors had held a meeting in Karnal and submitted their demands to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/3k-state-docs-to-strike-today-seek-specialist-cadre/articleshow/88820458.cms||Ipsita Pati

The man, according to the police, was posted as a security guard at a private hospital in Faridabad. He has been identified as Singhraj, a resident of Wazirpur in Faridabad. DCP (crime) Narendra Kadyan said Singhraj had taken the 22-year-old woman to an isolated area in the city on December 31 and attempted to rape her. When the woman tried to raise an alarm, he allegedly strangled her to death. The woman’s father filed a missing person’s complaint with police after she failed to return home. After days of investigation, the crime branch of Faridabad police zeroed in on Singhraj and arrested him from his home. Police said he had known the girl for the past two years. On December 31, she was walking home from Old Sabji Mandi in the city when he asked her to meet him at the Sector 17-18 Chowk. “From there, he took her to an area near Sector 17 bridge and tried to rape her. He killed her when she resisted and took her mobile phone. Singhraj then dumped her body in the nearby bushes,” the DCP said. Police managed to track him through the woman’s mobile phone, which was recovered from his possession. Singhraj had earlier been arrested for murdering his uncle and cousin in 1986. After his release from prison, he started working as a guard. Police claimed to have learnt during Singhraj’s interrogation that in December 2019, he tried to rape a 15-year-old girl who was working at a tea stall and killed her when she resisted. He allegedly disposed of the body in a canal. Singhraj allegedly killed two more minors after that and disposed of their bodies in a similar manner. The police said that he will be produced in court on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/guard-held-for-womans-murder-in-fbd-behind-3-more-killings/articleshow/88820460.cms||Bagish Jha

In its letter, the developer has stated that it has been maintaining the colonies according to norms and charging residents for maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure, but several residents have not paid their dues. “In order to carry out the obligations and responsibilities towards the colony, its upkeep and maintenance, these charges need to be recovered. We request MCG and other authorities also to take note of the same and facilitate us to recover the said maintenance charges,” the letter stated. The developer said it would also explore legal and other options to recover the dues. According to the developer, the dues have accumulated over the past two decades, and while some residents have not paid since the beginning, others have stopped paying due to various reasons. The MCG wants pending infrastructure in the colonies completed before the handover. At a meeting of the district grievance committee, DLF representatives had said mainly resurfacing of roads was pending due to restrictions on construction due to pollution. A company representative said DLF has already applied for completion certificates and was committed to handing over the maintenance of the colonies to the MCG once it gets the approval. Baljeet Singh Rathee, president of DLF Qutub Enclave Residents Welfare Association (QERWA), told TOI the maintenance charges’ arrears DLF was claiming was inclusive of a compound interest component. “In any case, most of the residents are already paying maintenance charges. There is no relation between maintenance charges’ arrears and handing over the colony to the MCG,” Rathee said. Rama Rani Rathee, the councillor of ward number 34 said when colonies, like Sushant Lok, South City 1 and 2, were handed over to MCG there was no condition regarding completion certificates. “The MCG has stopped all work apart from those in the detailed project report (DPR) which were provided earlier. Till the colonies (phases 1, 2 and 3) are not handed over to MCG, it will not resume its work.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/before-transfer-to-mcg-dlf-tells-cm-yet-to-recover-77-crore-from-ph-1-3/articleshow/88820461.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Gurugram now has 10,160 active cases. The last time so many people had tested positive in a single day was during the middle of the second wave on May 12 last year, when 2,747 cases were recorded in the city. Meanwhile, Gurugram last had more than 10,000 active cases on May 11 (11,054). The city had the most active cases on May 6, when the figure stood at 39,681. The city also reported its first Covid death this month on Monday — a 67-year-old fully vaccinated man admitted to a private hospital. Doctors said the man, who was from Sector 43, had comorbidities such as hypertension, brain hemorrhage, heart disease, chronic liver disease and diabetes. He was hospitalised on January 7 with dizziness, as the patient had earlier suffered a brain hemorrhage. He was being given IV fluids, antibiotics and other supportive measures and was later intubated. Doctors said he suddenly had a cardiac arrest on Monday. CPR was done, but he could not be revived. The last time Gurugram had reported a Covid death was on December 15, when a 69-year-old woman with comorbidities died in hospital. A total of 928 people have died after testing positive for the virus so far, of whom 611 had comorbidities — 268 had diabetes, 146 had hypertension, 86 had kidney ailments and 112 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. According to the health bulletin, a total of 10,092 patients are in home isolation in Gurugram at present, while 68 are in hospitals. The health department said 933 patients recuperated on Monday.

In the wake of the surge, testing has been ramped up. On Monday, 11,865 samples were collected for tests. Doctors said the number of Covid patients in hospital remains low so far, with very few in critical condition. “Hospitalisation is rising gradually, but we have not seen any critical patient so far. The virus is not affecting the lungs as it used to in the previous wave,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, an intensive care expert at Medanta — The Medicity. The health department said people should follow all Covid norms to curb the spread of the virus. “Around 80% of new cases are breakthrough infections at present. This means that even after vaccination, people can get infected with the virus. It is very important to continue following all Covid protocols,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. Haryana, meanwhile, reported 5,736 new cases on Monday. While Gurugram registered the highest new cases in the state, Faridabad was second with 1,071 cases, followed by Panchkula (344), Sonipat (322) and Ambala (303).

Residents, meanwhile, have expressed concerns, saying the basic repair work was required urgently if upgrade work was going to take time. Road safety experts TOI spoke to also reiterated this, stating that “negligence because of anticipated development” was not correct.Four plans in 1 yearThe GMDA has, for several years now, been working on plans to upgrade the stretch. Over the last year alone, the authority has tabled four different plans for revamping the stretch, each of which has been sent back to the drawing board for further work.In January last year, officials had proposed improving the 12-km stretch by constructing four flyovers and one underpass between Ghata village and Vatika Chowk, and flyovers between Vatika Chowk and NH48 at a cost of Rs 600 crore.In July, the GMDA had altered this plan and instead proposed to revamp the stretch between Ghata village and Vatika Chowk, also known as Golf Course Road Extension, by constructing five flyovers, undertaking improvement at junctions, developing greens and creating a cycle track and footpath. Just two months later, the GMDA was seeking feedback for the construction of either six-lane flyovers at a cost of Rs 420 crore or six-lane underpasses at a cost of Rs 470 crore, along with service roads at five critical points on the six-km Golf Course Road Extension. Keeping in mind that SPR slopes downwards from Ghata hills towards NH48, making underpasses more susceptible to waterlogging during the monsoons and that the stretch caters to a large number of heavy vehicles, which may find it difficult to use the underpass, by December the GMDA closed in on the plan to construct five flyovers on the Golf Course Extension Road stretch.This Rs 541.91-crore project was finally tabled at the Authority’s ninth meet in December, only for GMDA chairman chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to direct officials to extend the project further from Vatika Chowk to NH48 and include the provision for the planning of Metro while finalising the structures. “This is a fairly big project. Earlier, it was till Vatika Chowk, but now the chief minister has said it has to be extended up to the highway. So, the estimate will have to be prepared again since the expenditure will also increase,” a senior GMDA official said.Officials said once the modified proposal is prepared, it will be tabled in the GMDA meeting, and subsequently, finances, tendering and allotment will follow — a process that in itself is likely to take several months. Even when the work begins, officials said, it will take “at least two or three years” for the project to be completed.“Till then, there is no point undertaking special repairs along the stretch as of now since we anyway have a plan for its upgrade in the pipeline, which will be a one-time solution to all the problems. However, we will continue to undertake routine repairs, such as patchwork or filling of potholes, until then,” the official added.Potholes, a daily hassleTravelling on the pothole-riddled SPR, Sector 69-resident Ananya Sinha said, is not only a hassle because of the uneven patches but also for the poor condition of the streetlights. The stretch sees the movement of a high volume of heavy vehicles, many of which travel at high speed, so the scope for mishaps only increases when the road is not smooth,” she said.According to Sinha, it could be several years before the GMDA actually completes upgrading the entire stretch. “Commuters cannot be expected to just continue to travel like this. Filling potholes isn’t helping anything, they just re-emerge within weeks. Some kind of long-term solution needs to be found,” she added.Road safety expert Sarika Panda Bhatt told TOI that the SPR was susceptible to potholes because of the high volume of heavy vehicle traffic as well as its poor quality of construction. “The authorities know that heavy vehicles use the stretch, so the construction should be of that standard. NH48, for example, also sees the movement of a high volume of heavy vehicles, but that does not have so many potholes. The SPR right now is of very poor quality and cannot take such a high load of heavy vehicle traffic. The potholes have also been filled in an irregular manner, in some places, they are filled at a level higher than the road, so it becomes a completely bumpy ride and increases chances of accidents,” Bhatt said. Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban road designs expert, School of Planning and Architecture, said, “This is simply negligence because of the anticipated development, which is not correct. The GMDA should identify the particular areas which would be required for construction of underpasses or flyovers, and the other parts should be developed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/brave-craters-on-spr-now-revamp-plan-still-on-gmda-drawing-board/articleshow/88820466.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority likely to seek funds from builders for SPR work||GURUGRAM: In its plan to upgrade the Southern Peripheral Road – between the Golf Course Road T point and NH48 – the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is looking to involve developers who have their projects along the 12km stretch. The revamp plan, in the form most recently tabled before the authority, involves construction of flyovers at five critical points along the Golf Course Road Extension portion of the stretch, between the Ghata T point and Vatika Chowk, along with service roads, pavements, drains, disabled-friendly footpaths, cycle tracks and green areas. A GMDA officials said the entire project to cost Rs 541.9 crore. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is also the chairman of the GMDA,has directed officials to now tweak the project to include all of SPR — it was earlier planned for only Golf Course Extension road. The length of the stretch to be upgraded has now doubled, and the cost will also, hence, only increase, the official said. At the meeting, officials said, Khattar directed them to explore the possibility of getting contributions from developers who their projects along SPR for the upgrade work. They said the revamp work will benefit them in abig way. He had further directed authority officials to explore the possibility of imposing "reasonable charges" on developers for generating funds for the project. "The department of town and country planning will be holding a meeting to further discuss this matter with developers and builders, and take a commitment from them regarding their contributions," said a senior GMDA official who did not want to be named. The SPR houses several big residential societies, offices, and commercial complexes, belonging to major builders and developers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gmda-likely-to-seek-funds-from-builders-for-spr-work/articleshow/88820468.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Currently, the lab has 15 staffers — five lab technicians, two data entry operators and one lab supervisor working at the lab besides other supporting staff — and is testing more than 6,000 samples per day. With the recent upsurge in cases, along with people seeking the more accurate PCR laboratory tests to travel or return to work among others, MDRL expects the volume of tests to go up significantly.“We are testing about 6,000-7,000 samples per day at present, but our plan is to operate at our maximum capacity of conducting 12,000 tests per day. The present strength of staff cannot handle such a volume of samples,” Dr Vivek Gupta, associate professor at the department of pathology and in charge of MDRL, told TOI. MDRL has sought eight lab technicians, two each data entry operators and lab supervisors to meet the target. During the second wave of the pandemic last year, more than 30 staffers were working round the clock at the lab to ensure on-time delivery of test reports. From just 50 samples a day since its inception in April last year, officials said, the lab’s capacity was bolstered to conduct 12,000 tests per day during the second wave. However, as the number of cases subsided and samples sent for tests came down to 4,000 per day, the additional staffers were deputed elsewhere.Currently, the lab is handling samples from Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and those from its own institutes. Dr Gupta added that it could cater to neighbouring districts once additional staff joined duty.The Ghaziabad health department, which has been sending Covid samples to GIMS and MMG District Hospital labs, has also written to the state government seeking permission to attach the district with an additional lab so that it can reduce the pendency of test results. At present, there is a three to four days delay in receiving RT-PCR test reports.“We are collecting over 5,000 samples for testing through the RT-PCR method daily for the past week, while the state’s target is 3,500. It has led to pendency and to deal with it, we have requested the government to attach us to one more department,” district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said.Surbhi Dixit, microbiologist posted at and MMG District Hospital lab, said, “We are handling about 1,800-2,000 samples per day, so the remaining samples are being sent to GIMS. With daily sample positivity rate hovering around 20-30%, the sample verification takes more time.” The Covid lab at the Postgraduate Institute of Child Health, which has a testing capacity of 8,000 samples per day, is currently getting about 5,000-6,000 samples daily, Dr Sumi Nandwani, head of the microbiology department, said, adding that it was processing samples from GB Nagar, Rampur, Bulandshahr and Baghpat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/samples-soaring-gims-asks-for-more-lab-staff/articleshow/88820470.cms||Aditya Dev

The sample positivity rate in the district also zoomed to 34% from 23% in the last 24 hours, health officials said. Ghaziabad, meanwhile, added 1,344 new cases on the day, taking its active cases tally to 4,542 and sample positivity rate to 15%. The district, official data showed, is on the brink of crossing the peak of daily cases reported during the second wave of the pandemic in April-May last year. According to the state report, the district had reported 1,375 cases on April 30 and 1,373 cases on May 5. Likewise, the highest single-day tally for GB Nagar was 1,822 on May 5, during the second wave last year. The state health department bulletin indicated that UP has 33,946 active cases now, up from 1,211 such cases on January 1. In terms of new cases, GB Nagar, Lucknow (1,114), Ghaziabad and Meerut (1,071) continued to remain the biggest contributors. The four districts also account for the highest burden of active cases. With a sharp rise in cases across the state — UP recorded 8,334 new cases on Monday — chief minister Yogi Adityanath said not more than 50% of the staff in government and private offices should be called to the workplace. Advising extreme caution, the CM also said the 50% attendance rule did not apply to those who were involved in providing essential services. Meanwhile, the vaccination activity to administer the booster doses began across all the centres on Monday. Health officials said that more than 59,000 persons across the state took the booster dose. A total of 2,763 people took booster doses in Ghaziabad, while 1,902 recipients were administered the third dose in GB Nagar. The first dose of vaccine was also administered to 10,068 beneficiaries in the 15 to 17 years’ category in Ghaziabad and 5,151 others in GB Nagar. On Monday, the enthusiasm for the third dose was palpable among the people with several frontline and health workers queuing up across centres since morning. Sixty-three-year-old Sunil Kumar Sharma, a retired policeman and resident of Sanjay Nagar, said, people with comorbidities should take the booster dose. “I took the third dose today and did not feel any discomfort. I will encourage all others to take the shot,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/at-1344-gzb-cases-near-2nd-wave-peak/articleshow/88820471.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Ghaziabad||Uttar Pradesh govt asks schools not to raise fee this year||NOIDA: The UP government has directed schools not to hike their fees for the next academic session, but parents in Noida and Ghaziabad have said the order hardly serves their purpose. Many of the parents said the schools should be told to charge only tuition fee and not composite fee, which is a combination of money being charged under different heads. Parents in Ghaziabad said the schools should be told to charge only 50% of the tuition fee. In an order dated January 7, additional chief secretary Aradhna Shukla said that the schools of all education boards in the state must not resort to any fee hike for the 2022-23 session and the fee be charged on the basis of the structure in 2019-2020. In the pandemic, the schools have been charging composite fee — which includes annual charges, tuition fee, etc — on a monthly or quarterly basis along with examination fee. Yatendra Kasana, president of the All Noida Schools Parents Association (ANSPA), said, “When the Rajasthan government ordered private schools to forego 30% of the tuition fee, the schools there approached the Supreme Court against that order.

That order should have been implemented here too.” Manoj Kataria, founder of the GB Nagar Parents Welfare Society, said, “The annual charges and other payment being taken under the composite fee should be removed. Schools should only charge tuition fees as they are getting sufficient funds from it. The schools keep saying they are paying for their teachers’ salary. But how schools have started paying their teachers on a per-day basis?” Dharamvir Singh, the district inspector of schools in Noida, said, “It is true that some people have expressed inability to pay the fees. There was a complaint against one school also. In the law, we do not have a provision to monitor the fee being charged. But we can definitely check the increase in the fee.” A senior education department official, however, said the problem was that the term “composite fee” was not defined under the UP Fee Regulatory Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/up-asks-schools-not-to-raise-fee-this-year/articleshow/88821702.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Uttar Pradesh govt asks schools not to raise fee this year||NOIDA: The UP government has directed schools not to hike their fees for the next academic session, but parents in Noida and Ghaziabad have said the order hardly serves their purpose. Many of the parents said the schools should be told to charge only tuition fee and not composite fee, which is a combination of money being charged under different heads. Parents in Ghaziabad said the schools should be told to charge only 50% of the tuition fee. In an order dated January 7, additional chief secretary Aradhna Shukla said that the schools of all education boards in the state must not resort to any fee hike for the 2022-23 session and the fee be charged on the basis of the structure in 2019-2020. In the pandemic, the schools have been charging composite fee — which includes annual charges, tuition fee, etc — on a monthly or quarterly basis along with examination fee. Yatendra Kasana, president of the All Noida Schools Parents Association (ANSPA), said, “When the Rajasthan government ordered private schools to forego 30% of the tuition fee, the schools there approached the Supreme Court against that order. The SC, in May 2021, ordered that the schools have to ensure that they give a cut of 15% in the tuition fee to help the parents hit by the pandemic and settled the issue. That order should have been implemented here too.” Manoj Kataria, founder of the GB Nagar Parents Welfare Society, said, “The annual charges and other payment being taken under the composite fee should be removed.

---||Noida||In Greater Noida, allottees can now get ‘no dues’ certificates online||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) became the first in the state to implement enterprise resource planning (ERP), software provided by IT firm Tech Mahindra, to allow plot allottees to obtain no dues certificates online. The facility, which was rolled out over the weekend for three industrial sectors — Ecotech 7, 10 and 11, is likely to be extended to include overall 143 services, like building plan approval, water and sewer connection, functional certificate, mortgage certificate, mortgage permit, map surrender certificate, address change among others, officials said. The authority also plans to provide the online service to all industrial, residential, commercial and institutional allotments, with exception of builder allotments. “We are working on handing over the rights to allottees to get about 143 services very soon. We are the first authority in the state to introduce ERP. On January 7, we launched the beta version of the multi-pronged project Enterprise Resource Planning system. The link for ERP is available on Greater Noida Authority website,” GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan said. To avail the service, allottees will have to complete the formalities of submitting necessary documents under the ‘Know Your Allottee’ (KYA) option and follow a three-stage verification process using a one-time password sent to the allottee's registered mobile number and Aadhaar number. “Till now, the authority was carrying out these works physically. Now, this right has been given to the allottees,” Deep Chandra, the ACEO of GNIDA, said. With this, Bhooshan said, GNIDA was moving towards becoming a complete e-office. “The authority has become paperless now. With ERP, we have gone several steps ahead of other government departments to bring people’s interaction on the digital platform. It’s also the need of the hour given the spread of Covid pandemic,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/in-gr-noida-allottees-can-now-get-no-dues-certificates-online/articleshow/88820473.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Noida||Noida: ‘Long road’ ahead for Dhanauri to get bird sanctuary, Ramsar site tags||GREATER NOIDA: The Dhanauri wetland, a natural habitat of the state bird, sarus crane, is yet to have a defined boundary as the government sits on a proposal to recognise it as a Sarus sanctuary and a Ramsar site. So far, it also does not have a protective fence or infrastructure and personnel for maintaining its water flow and clearing the hyacinth obstructing that flow. Despite giving it a place in the list of 69 wetlands in the district, the state wetland authority is yet to extend protection to Dhanauri under the Wetland Conservation and Management Rules, 2017. The notification under these rules will define a list of activities to be allowed, regulated or prohibited at the site. It will also help prepare conservation strategies and implement the same. Birder Anand Arya, credited with identifying the birding site in 2014, has been demanding a Ramsar tag for the wetland for years now. He claimed to have recorded 217 bird species in Dhanauri between June 2014 and March 2020. “During peak season, the number of birds arriving here can be over 30,000,” he said. According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), the wetland saw more waterbirds this year than in 2021. The 2022 Census spotted 2,459 waterbirds of 45 species, including five that fall in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. In 2020, the Census had recorded 1,344 waterbirds of 48 species. However, the number was much higher in 2021, when the Census had spotted 6,227 waterbirds of 59 species. A spot visit by TOI showed that the marshy bird habitat is surrounded by burnt stubble and frequented by locals. In the name of protection, locals said, a constable usually takes rounds of the wetland. Three sarus cranes, including two chicks and a mother, have died in the wetland over the past month, with officials attributing the deaths to "bacterial infection". While a five-month-old was found dead in a nearby field on December 25, another sarus chick, found struggling in shallow water, later died during treatment. Then on December 29, an adult sarus was found dead in shallow water. Commenting on the first death, birders have raised the suspicion that it could have been due to pesticides used by farmers in the fields near the wetland. “The post-mortem report states that the bird may have died of salmonella infection, but it is common knowledge that this belt sees pesticide use. I think it is a cover-up,” said birder Jaswinder Waraich, who regularly visits Dhanauri. Recently, birder Shyam Bhagra captured photos of dogs attacking the sarus cranes, again emphasising the need for fencing around the wetland. TK Roy, Asian Waterbird Census, Delhi state coordinator, Wetlands International, said that birders have been complaining about the “threat” of feral dogs for a month now. He also stressed the need for fencing, the conservation of the sarus habitat and the removal of excess water hyacinth from the site. ‘Bureaucratic apathy’ delays conservation planThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in May 2019 had asked the forest department to submit a proposal for declaring the Dhanauri wetland as a Sarus bird sanctuary and a Ramsar site. However, environmentalists alleged that the forest department has been sitting on it for three years. Anand Arya, who has shared a draft proposal with the forest department, including details such as bird count, number of species, etc., said that he was shocked at the bureaucratic apathy. “If the forest department and the UP government desired, they could have submitted a brief document for notifying the wetland, along with details such as the mapping of the land use and landcover, the boundary of the zone of influence, etc., already provided by the WWF-India. As far as the proposal for a Sarus sanctuary is concerned, I have provided a draft to the forest department,” he added. Meanwhile, the divisional forest officer, PK Srivastava, said that the department would send a brief document on recognising Dhanauri as a wetland to the state wetland authority within the next ten days. On the other hand, a forest official said, “A conservation plan had been prepared for Dhanauri and sent to the Yamuna Authority, along with budget allocation, but there has been no movement on it.” However, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) CEO Arunvir Singh said that the authority would extend financial assistance for conservation purposes once the forest department notified Dhanauri under the 2017 wetland rules. An official source also said that the recognition of Dhanauri as a bird sanctuary would involve land acquisition by the government and the dispersal of compensation to the farmers, who currently own parts of the land. “The wetland is surrounded by proposed residential sectors, according to the Yamuna Authority master plan. First, the wetland demarcation has to take place. Then, the land will get acquired and compensation distributed. It is a long road,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/long-road-ahead-for-dhanauri-to-get-bird-sanctuary-ramsar-site-tags/articleshow/88820474.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||12-year-old from Greater Noida ‘sold’ to man (52), rescued||NOIDA: A gang that allegedly abducted minor girls from rural areas of NCR and sold them to older men was busted on Sunday with the arrest of six persons, including a 52-year-old man who was supposed to have got married to a 12-year-old girl he “bought” for Rs 70,000. The arrests were made by a police team probing the abduction of the 12-year-old girl from a Greater Noida village on December 26 last year. The gang, police said, had many women members from Rohtak who fanned out in the rural areas of NCR to look for girls they could lure. Once they befriended the girls, they would make promises of a better life in the city and persuade the minors to leave their village. Once out of the village, they would be abducted by the men in the gang. Among the six persons arrested on Sunday, there were three women. The police said they were looking for the other members of the gang, who are still at large. On December 26, the 12-year-old girl’s parents from Chhapraula village lodged a complaint at Badalpur police station when their daughter, who was playing outside the house, could not be found for hours. “A case was lodged under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the IPC. Investigations revealed the involvement of a gang with many women members in it,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety). According to the Shukla, the girl had been sold to Jasveer Singh of Sonipat for Rs 70,000. “He was supposed to have married her. On Sunday, Jasveer Singh was arrested from Girdharpur village near Dankaur. Five more persons were arrested later, including three women from the gang of traffickers,” Shukla said. The gang would mostly lure young girls from villages of UP and Haryana. “The gang was operating out of Rohtak. They almost always chose remote villages to lure girls so they could escape the police radar. They mostly had ready customers,” said an officer of Badalpur police station. Active for several years, the gang is believed to have trafficked many women. The police are trying to zero in on a number. “We have identified five more members of the gang. Teams have been formed to nab them,” Shukla said. The six arrested persons have been booked under sections 366A (procuration of minor girl) 368 (concealing or keeping in confinement a kidnapped person), 370A (human trafficking), 376A (causing death or resulting in persistent vegetative state of victim) of the IPC and Section 3/4 of the Pocso Act. The minor girl has now been reunited with her parents. Her mother called for the strictest punishment for the accused. “I spent sleepless nights and would pray the whole day, just hoping that my daughter would come back safe. I am happy and can sleep peacefully now. On a daily basis, we come across so many reports on rapes and murders. The police should bring such accused to book and they should be hanged till death,” the woman said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/12-yr-old-sold-to-man-52-rescued/articleshow/88820475.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Man tries to defer flight ticket online, cheated of Rs 9.9 lakh||GREATER NOIDA: A man was allegedly defrauded of Rs. 9.9 lakh while trying to get his flight ticket rescheduled, the police informed on Monday. The victim, Sushil Kumar Nagar, had booked a flight ticket for Andaman from a government airline. He had to postpone the plan and therefore, searched for the customer care number of the airline on Google. On calling the number, the receiver told him that the rescheduling charges will be Rs 225. "There was a change of plan and I had to push my return ticket by two days. So, I googled the customer care number and contacted them," the man said in his complaint. A senior police official informed, "In order to make the payment, the receiver sent a link to Nagar and asked for the OTP. Being unaware, Nagar shared the OTP with the accused." A total of 12 transactions were done in which an amount of Rs 9.9 lakh was transferred. "Nagar then got his account blocked and filed a complaint with the police. A case under relevant sections have been registered and investigation is underway," the officer added. The Gautam Budh Nagar police has been taking several measures to curb the online fraud menace. However, a police officer informed that cybercrime continued to be widely reported. Ranvijay Singh, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida) said, “It is very crucial for people or citizens to understand the potential risks involved in online banking. Every year, thousands of Indians, especially the elderly fall victim to online financial fraud."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/man-tries-to-defer-flight-ticket-online-cheated-of-9-9l/articleshow/88820476.cms||---
---||Noida||Greater Noida: Pipe damaged, 2,500 residents of Sector Pi 3 without water for three days||GREATER NOIDA: More than 2,000 residents of Sector Pi 3 in Greater Noida complained that their area has received no water supply for three consecutive days now. Their water pipeline was damaged inadvertently by the IGL when they were laying the gas pipeline around it. “The residents of Sector Pi 3 have been facing a major problem as no water supply has come in the last couple of days. Today was the third day of no water supply in the sector. This negligence on part of the authority has brought the people on the roads. Till yesterday, people were managing somehow by water from the tankers. “Many residents were unable to go to work, while household work suffered largely across all homes in the sector. Everyone’s tanks are empty," said Aditya Bhati, RWA president Sector Pi 3. The authority officials said that they have been sending water tankers to the area, but residents claim that it wasn’t sufficient for the entire sector which has 1,500 plots and about 2,500 residents. Another resident from the sector lamented that while the authority is quick to levy water tax, it is not proactive in providing services to the residents. Kapil Dev Singh, senior manager (urban services), GNIDA, said an IGL pipeline work carried last week had damaged the main water pipeline which fills the tank of the sector. “An IGL pipeline was laid under the water pipeline and in the process damaged it. About 7-8 metres of the water pipeline was damaged, including at different intervals. To carry out the repair work, we had to clear the remaining water from the pipeline which itself took about 8-10 hours. This led to supply being shut in neighbouring areas, also including Pi 7.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/pipe-damaged-2-5k-residents-without-water-for-three-days/articleshow/88820477.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The tally was 30% lower on Monday from the previous day. The state’s tally dropped almost 25% in a 24-hour period, again due to fewer tests done on Sunday (diagnostic results are collated a day later). On Monday, Maharashtra registered 33,470 cases as against 44,388 the previous day. ‘Real cases may be 2 or 3 times reported numbers’ In Mumbai, while 71,619 tests were done on Friday, the number dropped to 68,249 on Saturday and 59,242 on Sunday. In Maharashtra, the daily number of tests fell from 2.02 lakh on Saturday to 1.73 lakh on Sunday. “The drop in cases (on Monday) is clearly due to fewer tests done,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s task force on Covid-19. The state’s cumulative numbers inched closer to 70 lakh (69,53,514), while Mumbai’s touched 9,26,170. After five days of recording more than 1,000 hospitalisations, daily admissions dropped to 798 on Monday. Civic officials said that 21% of Covid beds were occupied. Experts said the undercounting of cases due to wide use of home-testing kits is also responsible for the daily numbers not reflecting the city’s actual situation. “The real numbers could be twice or thrice the reported numbers,” a civic official admitted. Mumbai’s positivity rate of 23%, although a decline from 30% reported four days ago, is indicative of fewer tests being done. The daily Covid tally on Monday, though lower than on many other days in this third Omicron wave, is still higher than the highest tally during the Delta wave (11,206) in April 2021. “We have to wait for the tally on Tuesday before drawing any conclusion,” said Dr Pandit. “We are seeing more hospitalisations, and while ICU admissions too have increased, the number of patients on ventilators is still low. This week is crucial in Mumbai,” he added. On Monday, 31 new cases of Omicron were reported from the state, taking the count of confirmed cases due to the variant to 1,247. Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya had a review meeting with five states, including Maharashtra, that are reporting the highest cases. The state government informed the Centre that despite the large number of cases, health infrastructure is not under stress. “Of total patients in the state, only 3% require an ICU bed or oxygen supply. The state has adequate infrastructure and occupancy is low,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. There are nearly 38,000 ICU beds in the state, and as on Monday, only 1,711 were occupied. Similarly, of the 1.34 lakh oxygen beds, only 5,400 were occupied. Tope also said that the peak of the third wave may be recorded by the end of the month. The Centre has asked the states to increase testing and improve vaccination coverage. “We have directed the district collectors to take an aggressive stand from henceforth against unvaccinated people,” Tope said. He also said daily positivity of the state had crossed 25-30% and that is why there was a need to impose restrictions to slow down spread of the virus. With the Centre’s new discharge policy kicking in on Monday, the number of people who were discharged from hospitals saw a steep increase, pushing up recovery rates. 29,671 people was discharged, including 27,214 from Mumbai.

As compared to December 2020, it was growth of over 50%.Passenger traffic touched 111 lakh in December— up from about 105 lakh registered in November 2021, said credit rating agency, ICRA, in a press statement. When compared to December 2020 though, it was a year-on-year growth of about 52% as passenger traffic stood at about 73 lakh back then. Airlines’ capacity deployment for December 2021 was around 35% higher than December 2020 (86,465 departures in December 2021 against 64,002 departures in December 2020), it said.Suprio Banerjee, vice president and sector head, ICRA, said that sequential recovery continued in December 2021, largely driven by leisure travel, boosted by calendar year-end festive and holiday travel. “With the emergence of the new Covid variant and the recent trend of rising infections, few states have already started announcing certain curbs on domestic air travel, posing a serious threat to domestic passenger traffic recovery in the near term.”One concern that continues to be a drag the aviation sector is the aviation fuel prices which have seen a increase of 49% on a year-on-year basis till January 2022, said ICRA. “This, coupled with relatively low capacity utilisation of aircraft fleet, will continue to weigh on their financial performancein FY2022,” it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/air-domestic-passenger-traffic-up-6-in-dec-compared-to-nov/articleshow/88820480.cms||---

Feel of hill station in city, vicinity as temperature dipsThe minimum temperature recorded at the Santacruz observatory on Monday was lower than that in the interiors of the state like Dahanu, which recorded15 degrees, and Ratnagiri 19 degrees. Temperatures in the city and its vicinity were very close to hill station-like weather as Mahabaleshwar was seen recording minimum temperatures of 10 degrees on Sunday night. The India Meteorological Department’s Colaba observatory also recorded below-normal minimum temperatures of 15. 2 degrees which was over four degrees below normal. Weather bureau officials said that the city’s first strong spell of chilly weather was on account of a combination of factors. “The associated cyclonic circulation of western disturbance over northwest India pulling the moisture from the Arabian Sea and the prevalence of northerly cold winds over the region are leading to this chill,” said an official from the Met department. Previously, the lowest minimum temperature recorded in a decade was 10. 4 degrees on January 29, 2012. The lowest maximum temperature recorded previously was 25. 3 degrees on January 17, 2020.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Few foreign pupils at IIT? Campus magazine blames it on food||MUMBAI: Why is the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay not a global melting pot? A major reason could be gastronomy. An article in Insight, the students’ magazine, titled, ‘Where are the Firangis 2.0?’ looks at why the Powai campus has failed to attract the best brains from around the world. IITB’s QS ranking parameter for international faculty and students is a single-digit score that pulls down their overall ranking. So, students from the premier institute conducted several interviews with the few of their international counterparts and they found some things that need to be ironed out. “Almost every student complained about lack of options for food. It is not surprising that they find it difficult to adapt to the mess food. In fact, one mentioned that he ends up spending more than half his stipend on ordering food online. A solution that can be found in other universities is a common kitchen for every dormitory,” said the article, authored by Mithilesh Vaidya, Navjit Debnath and Ark Modi. Currently, international students are put up in separate hostels from their Indian counterparts. “Since many international students are here for a short stay, bonding with Indian students is also essential.” Again, when it came to academics, many found it difficult to cope up with the system in the first semester. This was attributed to a “lack of open communication” between professors and students, differences in teaching style, problems in understanding the accent and lack of a supportive peer group. “One PhD student was unhappy with the way some courses were conducted; he believed that professors taught mainly for the sake of it and gave away credits for free without proper evaluation.” The article recommended jazzing up the institute website, pushing strong messages via marketing, disseminating research breakthroughs. “From an exotic “land of snake charmers” portrayed in the Bond film Octopussy(1983), we have become a synonym for poverty and our major cultural exports - yoga and spicy “Indian” food - have become decoupled from the national identity of India. For a lot of students from other countries, especially from Europe and North America, the perceived hardship in living conditions discourage them from considering any academic engagement in India,” said the authors, who felt that conducting campus tours would help promote the vibrant student life on campus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/few-foreign-pupils-at-iit-campus-mag-blames-it-on-food/articleshow/88820482.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Class 10 and 12 students are attending schools in the hybrid mode.Many schools have stretched each class from 40 minutes to an hour. Schools have asked students to login early and are taking classes on Saturdays too. “Our secondary students log in an hour earlier at 7.30am. They wind up at 1pm instead of 12.30pm. Portions are remaining and we need time to complete them before final exams in April,” said the principal of a Kandivli school.When schools went offline in October and December, daily classes did not exceed three to four hours. “For maths and science, we have increased the period to an hour. For other subjects, it is a 40-minute class,” said the principal of a school in Ghatkopar. Schools are using physical training classes to teach languages and even reduced snack breaks.For classes 1 to 9, schools are likely to stick to online final exams.

The BMC called it the project’s first daylighting as the TBM came out of the tunnel at Girgaum Chowpatty. “The Mumbai Coastal Road Project is the dream of all Mumbaikars. Construction of this project, which will fasten the pace of Mumbaikars’ lives, is being done diligently and persistently. I am confident the project will be completed within the stipulated time and the speedy completion of the first tunnel is an acknowledgment of that,” said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who joined the event virtually. “Mavala TBM is working as per its name, and the BMC is also constructing the project with the same discipline. Construction is in full swing in the face of natural calamities and the Covid crisis. Scenic places will be also be developed around it. There are challenges, but the BMC has continued its vigorous journey towards fulfilling the dreams of Mumbaikars,” Thackeray said. “The tunneling work on the Priyadarshini Park to Marine Drive stretch was inaugurated in January 2021, by the CM. It is now completed. The TBM will be dismantled and used again to bore the tunnel back from Marine Drive to Priyadarshini Park; the northbound tunnel will be completed by November or December 2022,” said a senior civic official. The project consists of a tunnel, a road, and an interchange. The road will connect South Mumbai to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link’s (BWSL) Worli end. The Rs 12,721-crore project was originally to be completed in four years since commencement of work in October 2018.  “A total of 11 cross tunnels connecting the two tunnels will also be constructed as a precautionary measure. There is an emergency control room for the tunnels and an automated system will also be activated. The tunnels will be fitted with a ventilation system, which will be used for the first time in India for road tunnels,” said the BMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mavala-gives-coastal-road-project-its-first-light-of-day/articleshow/88820491.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Justice Revati Mohite Dere on January 6 issued notice to the I-T department and stayed the warrants till January 20, when the matter will be heard again.Singh and the companies, in their plea through lawyers Sujay Kantawala and Ashish Chavan, contended they had deposited the entire TDS amount with penal interest before showcause notice.They also said the sanction to prosecute them was granted without any application of mind by the I-T commissioner when their plea to settle the dues was pending. They had paid the TDS with interest voluntarily later and the default was unintentional, due to financial difficulties. Ichibaan had deducted Rs 7.5 lakh in March 2010 and GMS Rs 42 lakh, but did not credit it within the legal deadline.I-T had said before the sessions court through special public prosecutor Amit Munde that since the IT Act requires TDS to be deposited by the 7th of every month, the accused cannot plead ignorance of law. Also, filing of an application to settle the dues does not absolve them of any liability.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-stays-nbws-against-co-directors-in-70s-in-tds-case/articleshow/88820492.cms||Swati Deshpande

However, he was upset after he got the delivery of the product since it appeared smaller than what was shown online.Police said that the businessman looked for the number of the company online and found one.

---||Mumbai||Bulli Bai: Bengaluru accused gets Covid, sent to judicial custody||MUMBAI: Vishal Kumar Jha (21), the engineering student from Bengaluru arrested in the Bulli Bai case on January 3, has been sent to judicial custody till January 24 after he tested positive for Covid. The police custody of the two others arrested with him — Shweta Singh (18) and Mayank Rawat (21) — has been extended till January 14. Police have found the three operated six to eight Twitter handles under different names which were created to propagate the Bulli Bai app. The trio used the end-to-end encrypted email service ProtonMail to hide their identities while posting content on the Twitter handles. “ProtonMail helps one to hide one’s internet protocol (IP) address. Criminals may use it so that an investigation agency fails to track them,” said a cyber police officer. Police said Jha has confessed that he was using the Twitter handle @hmmachaniceoki, a Khalsa supremacist handle he created, and also that he was following the Bulli Bai app hosted on GitHub by its creator, BTech student Neeraj Bishnoi (21), who is in Delhi Police’s custody till January 12. He used ProtonMail to hide his identity. His location was shown in Canada. He posted over 15 objectionable Tweets. Mumbai cyber police objected to Jha's bail application, moved by his lawyers Shivam Deshmukh and Arti Deshmukh, which will be heard on January 13. The police have sought his custody once he recovers from Covid. The magistrate said that he should be provided with proper medical aid and food. Rawat’s lawyer Sandeep Sherkhane stated that he was a young boy, a topper in his college, and had just followed a link that was forwarded to him on social media. He said his client has been falsely implicated. The lawyers claimed their clients were innocent and had been brainwashed, making them follow instructions given by Bishnoi. No lawyer was present to represent Singh. Her sister Manisha, a BCom student, told TOI, “My sister is innocent and is undergoing eye treatment. She has been depressed since we lost our father to Covid last May. We don’t have money to hire a lawyer. Nor can I travel to Mumbai to get my sister out on bail. Our monthly income is Rs 3,000, which is credited to our account since we are a Covid-affected family. My father’s company pays some amount too.” Police said Singh, too, used ProtonMail. As per the case’s FIR, a 34-year-old Andheri woman, who is a social worker with an NGO, was the victim from Mumbai whose photo was used on the app. She learned about it when she received a call from her friend on January 1. The photos of over 100 women were uploaded on the auction app with offensive captions. One, in atrocious English, read: “She is multi-purpose bulli, a law student, ma sikh brothers can learn law from her, she can teach law and also can serve as an escort maid, a perfect bulli."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-blore-accused-gets-covid-sent-to-judicial-custody/articleshow/88820496.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With just one bid in for Worli fort revamp, BMC re-invites tenders||MUMBAI: In case you have seen a lit-up Worli fort over the past weekends, then that's only a trailer as plans are afoot to permanently light up the heritage structure. The BMC recently re-invited tenders for the Rs. 3 crore Worli fort restoration and landscaping project after receiving only a single bidder to the tender floated in November last year. Officials said that work on the project is expected to begin in a month and the same should take around six months for completion. The scope of work, apart from restoration of the fort, will include landscaping of surrounding area, illumination to the fort and also surrounding premises , basalt walkways, installing informative sculptures and directional signage boards. The Worli fort, situated at the tip of Worli Koliwada, was built by the British around 1675, on the Worli hill, when the city was made up of seven islands. Assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G South ward Sharad Ughade said that since the year 2020 they have been working on restoration of Worli fort and several meetings with the state cabinet minister and local MLA Aaditya Thackeray have also been held regarding the same to ensure that all permissions to commence work were in place. Ughade also said that there has been full cooperation from the state archaeological department. “We have already received an NOC from the state archaeology department and are keen on starting work as soon as possible. We decided to re-invite the tender as we received only a single bidder. For the first time we had lit the fort during Diwali last year and now we are looking at any additional changes that may be required as a part of the project,” said Ughade. The fort was used as a lookout for enemy ships and pirates and has a built-in well, a temple, and offers a view of Mahim and Bandra. The ramparts are platforms for cannons, a reminder of its military significance in the past. This fort is among the three that overlook the Mahim Bay on Mumbai’s western coast, with the Mahim Fort and Bandra Fort to its north.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/with-just-one-bid-in-for-worli-fort-revamp-bmc-re-invites-tenders/articleshow/88820497.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||Only 5% of those eligible in Mumbai, Maharashtra take booster shot on Day 1||MUMBAI: The booster dose rollout saw a tepid response in the state and the city on Monday as barely 5% of the eligible beneficiaries came out to take the third shot. Contrary to expectations of higher footfall in the wake of the Omicron surge, the usual long queues and jam-packed registration halls were missing this time, and empty chairs greeted many senior citizens across vaccination centres.  In Maharashtra, 49,307 people, including frontliners and senior citizens, took the third shot on the first day, out of the eligible 9.35 lakh. Mumbai administered 10,698 precautionary doses, covering 5.8% of its 1.8 lakh beneficiaries. 30% of the 12,139 eligible senior citizens took the third shot. In comparison, 5,249 of 88,892 healthcare workers, or 6%, showed up. Of the nearly 81,000 eligible frontline workers, merely 2.2% (1,823) came for the booster shot.  Within the state, Mumbai administered the highest number of precautionary doses. Pune delivered the second highest (6,638), followed by Thane (4,692) and Nashik (4,015). A comparison of states shows that Gujarat managed to give the third dose to 1.55 lakh on Monday, while Rajasthan and Karnataka gave it to 95,540 and 81,728 people respectively. Nationally, 9.79 lakh precautionary doses were administered.  John and Judy Gracias from Marol were surprised to see no wait time for their third shot at SevenHills Hospital on Monday. “The first two doses of the vaccine protected us well as we didn’t get Covid in the massive second wave,” said 70-year-old John. A Covid hospital head said that many health workers have already taken their dose “quietly” and hence there was no heavy rush on Monday. Dean of Nesco Dr Neelam Andrade said that the response was better from senior citizens compared to other groups, but footfalls of frontliners should increase gradually. Most seniors had received messages from CoWin and booked appointments, while several had walked in with Aadhar cards. In KEM Hospital, Parel, the turnout seemed a bit higher than the last few months as staff and some senior citizens joined the queue. “There wasn’t a queue like one used to see at the start of vaccination in January last year. It was a steady stream of people,” said KEM Hospital dean Dr Sangeeta Rawat. In nearby Global Hospital, the booster drive will start in a few days as stocks come in, said an official.  Bandra-based Dr Kirit Trivedi, a 72-year-old anaesthetist, took his shot at 11 am. “I took the first shot on January 16, 2021, the day the vaccination drive began in India. This time as well, I took it on the first day at Holy Family Hospital in Bandra,” he said, adding there were no long queues.  Elsewhere in the state, teething problems emerged. Orthopedic surgeon Dr Y Gade from Aurangabad said the civic corporation had initially announced booster shots at only 5 of 51 vaccine centres. “There were no takers initially, but the Indian Medical Association here took up the matter with civic authorities who soon announced booster shots could be taken at any centre,” said 54-year-old Gade, who too took his third shot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/only-5-of-those-eligible-in-city-state-take-booster-shot-on-day-1/articleshow/88820499.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Oxygen use creeps up, nowhere near alarming||MUMBAI: Over the last one week, the state’s average oxygen requirement has gone up to 300-350MT from the average 200MT. With active Covid cases jumping nearly 1,900% in the last two weeks, the increase is not yet alarming. Use of 700MT of oxygen is one of the baseline parameters the state has set for imposing a lockdown. The peak demand during the second wave was around 1,800MT. The oxygen supply accounts for both Covid and non-Covid medical use. Senior officials said not all the additional oxygen requirement is going towards treating patients, nearly 50-60MT is being used to fill the storage tanks kept ready for a surge. Officials said at the moment, 3% of the total active cases in the state are on oxygen support. “With cases rising, the demand for oxygen has gone up in the last few days, but it is not alarming,” said a senior official. “So far, the cases are mild, but the exact picture will be clear once smaller and lower vaccinated regions start reporting cases,” said another official. Mumbai has not seen any significant surge in demand for oxygen though active cases have jumped from 4,295 to 1,17,437—a rise of 2600% in just 15 days, said civic officials. Currently, 3,129 of 11,312 oxygen beds are occupied. Civic officials said the city is nowhere near the peak requirement of 260MT seen during the second wave. “We have not even gone anywhere close to 200MT,” said P Velrasu, BMC's additional municipal (projects). Last week, a civic official had said the city was using 20-30MT. After the 2021 crisis, the corporation has created a combined storage and generation capacity of 900MT. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the jumbo centre in Goregaon, said only eight ward patients out of over 800 were on oxygen. “Since lung involvement is limited, we haven’t seen a massive jump in requirement for oxygen yet,” she said. ICU patients require higher oxygen flow, she said. “We still see patients coming with bad lungs. They are mainly unvaccinated and with several comorbidities. That number also hasn’t been out of control yet,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/oxy-use-creeps-up-nowhere-near-alarming/articleshow/88820500.cms||Bhavika Jain

The HC bench of chief justices Dipankar Datta and M S Karnik said those opposed to the state’s restrictions believe that the curbs are totally arbitrary and unreasonable. The HC was hearing two petitions by activist Feroze Mithiborewala and Yohan Tengra, who said that prohibiting non-vaccinated people from travelling by train was violative of their fundamental rights and an unreasonable restriction.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many healthcare staff took 3rd jab ‘unofficially’ in November-December||MUMBAI: The demand for booster shots has been loudest from healthcare workers, yet when the third shot was rolled out on Monday, there were no long queues. The reason: many had unofficially taken their third shots through November and December as the Centre dragged its feet on coming out with a policy. Doctors, nurses and many ancillary workers, who were fully vaccinated by February and March, had found their antibody levels waning by October. By November, many private hospitals also had surplus vaccine stocks as demand for paid vaccination had reduced.  The head of a Covid hospital told TOI all staffers had taken the third shot by early December. “We used the spillage doses. They are in contact with Covid patients. It was our duty to protect them,” the head said. As a result, few healthcare staffers fell sick in the ongoing wave, compared to dozens in municipal medical colleges, the in-charge said. But those already vaccinated with the booster are worried about the certificate. People who took the third jab on Monday got certificates specifying all three dates when the first, second and precautionary shots were taken. Another hospital head said, “We are trying to figure that out. As it is, the mandate everywhere is full vaccination, which still is two doses. So it’s not going to be hindrance for them,” he said. —Sumitra DebRoy||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/many-healthcare-staff-took-3rd-jab-unofficially-in-nov-dec/articleshow/88820504.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In Maharashtra, the daily number of tests fell from 2.02 lakh on Saturday to 1.73 lakh on Sunday. “The drop in cases (on Monday) is clearly due to fewer tests done,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s task force on Covid-19. The state’s cumulative numbers inched closer to 70 lakh (69,53,514), while Mumbai’s touched 9,26,170. After five days of recording more than 1,000 hospitalisations, daily admissions dropped to 798 on Monday. Civic officials said that 21% of Covid beds were occupied. Experts said the undercounting of cases due to wide use of home-testing kits is also responsible for the daily numbers not reflecting the city’s actual situation. “The real numbers could be twice or thrice the reported numbers,” a civic official admitted. Mumbai’s positivity rate of 23%, although a decline from 30% reported four days ago, is indicative of fewer tests being done. The daily Covid tally on Monday, though lower than on many other days in this third Omicron wave, is still higher than the highest tally during the Delta wave (11,206) in April 2021. “We have to wait for the tally on Tuesday before drawing any conclusion,” said Dr Pandit. “We are seeing more hospitalisations, and while ICU admissions too have increased, the number of patients on ventilators is still low. This week is crucial in Mumbai,” he added. On Monday, 31 new cases of Omicron were reported from the state, taking the count of confirmed cases due to the variant to 1,247. Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya had a review meeting with five states, including Maharashtra, that are reporting the highest cases. The state government informed the Centre that despite the large number of cases, health infrastructure is not under stress. “Of total patients in the state, only 3% require an ICU bed or oxygen supply. The state has adequate infrastructure and occupancy is low,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. There are nearly 38,000 ICU beds in the state, and as on Monday, only 1,711 were occupied. Similarly, of the 1.34 lakh oxygen beds, only 5,400 were occupied. Tope also said that the peak of the third wave may be recorded by the end of the month. The Centre has asked the states to increase testing and improve vaccination coverage. “We have directed the district collectors to take an aggressive stand from henceforth against unvaccinated people,” Tope said. He also said daily positivity of the state had crossed 25-30% and that is why there was a need to impose restrictions to slow down spread of the virus. With the Centre’s new discharge policy kicking in on Monday, the number of people who were discharged from hospitals saw a steep increase, pushing up recovery rates. 29,671 people was discharged, including 27,214 from Mumbai.

The HC bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar gave her time on Monday to file a rejoinder to the SFIO affidavit, which alleged that its probe “revealed about movement of huge funds since year 2010, to (her) personal bank account from related companies of BCL”.Senior counsel Harish Salve and Janak Dwarkadas submitted that the affidavit was making “brazenly false” statements. “Someone has to take responsibility for making such statements…the reply makes sweeping allegations,” said Salve. He added that the government has “formed opinion made on an opinion which did not relate when the young lady was associated with the company”. He said “something would have to be done about this kind of tactic (of the government)”.Salve said that he wanted an order from the HC to direct SFIO to produce details to back its claim. The HC bench, not inclined to pass any such order, said she would know what goes in and out from her account. Salve then said, “This is something very, very serious. I would like to file a one-page rejoinder.” This the HC permitted and posted the matter for further hearing to January 31.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the SFIO said, “Let him file a rejoinder. What details of investigations are, cannot be shared with her at this juncture.”Shradha was non-executive director for two years between April 2012 and April 2014 at the company. In 2017, there was a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) against BCL. In 2018, all creditors were paid off and the company exited the process.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/binani-scion-moves-hc-over-sfios-summons/articleshow/88820512.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Insurers can’t reject cocktail Covid therapy||Mumbai: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has asked companies not to reject Covid claims for antibody cocktail therapy by terming it as an ‘experimental’ treatment. The regulator has also asked insurers to review claims denied or deductions made in all such situations and take appropriate action to settle them according to the terms of policy.The circular to the chiefs of all non-life and health insurance companies has come following complaints that many insurers are rejecting claims for treatment in the third wave where the hospitals have used expensive new antiviral drugs. “Authority has come across instances of denial of claims and/or deduction of expenses incurred towards ‘antibody cocktail therapy’ treatment for Covid, under the pretext that the said therapy is an experimental treatment,” the Irdai said.The regulator pointed out that the antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) has been given emergency use authorisation in May 2021 by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation in India. All health insurance policies have a clause that excludes experimental treatments. The objective is to ensure that money is spent on proven or established techniques. This clause has been used by insurers in the past to exclude robotic surgeries and new treatments like stem cell.Drugmakers in India had launched the antibody cocktail in May 2021 at Rs 59,750 for each patient dose of 1,200mg (600mg of Casirivimab and 600mg of Imdevimab).Last week, Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told The Economic Times that most patients admitted to private hospitals have mild Covid symptoms and are taking Molnupiravir treatments. “They are getting admitted for a day or two and getting discharged. The private hospitals have told us that the health insurance companies have a rule that only patients admitted for at least a day can be considered for releasing insurance payments,” Chahal said. He added that BMC would be taking this up with insurance companies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/insurers-cant-reject-cocktail-covid-therapy/articleshow/88820514.cms||Mayur Shetty

This resulted in the year 2021 recording a higher inflow in every successive month. Monthly SIP contribution for December 2021 hit a historic high of Rs 11,305 crore with net assets under management (AUM) of MFs ending the year at Rs 37,72,696 crore — a notch above Rs 37,33,702 crore as of November. According to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), the number of SIP accounts for December was 4.9 crore, up from 4.78 crore in November. This shows a month-on-month change of 12.5 lakh. SIP AUM as of the end of December was Rs 5.65 lakh crore, higher than Rs 5.46 lakh crore in November. According to Amfi’s December data released on Monday, the net flow for all the four categories of open-ended schemes — growth/equity, hybrid, solution-oriented and others (index schemes, ETFs, fund of funds) — reported positive flows during the month. The exceptions were income/debt oriented schemes, which saw some outflow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-37-7l-cr-mfs-end-2021-at-record-high/articleshow/88820515.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bond yields at pre-Covid high, beat home loan rates||Mumbai: Bonds fell to a pre-pandemic low on Monday even as the sensex surged over 1% to close 651 points higher and the rupee gained 27 paise. The cost of borrowing for the government, as reflected in the yield on 10-year bonds, rose to more than the home loan rates offered by most banks to a two-year high of 6.59%. While Union Bank of India’s loans start at 6.4%, Bank of Baroda is offering them at 6.5%.Bond prices have an inverse relationship with yields, so one falls even as the other rises. In equities, the markets opened strong, tracking Asian stocks and closed higher on expectations that there would be a pro-growth Budget. The Nifty, too, scaled 18,000 to close 1.1% higher at 18,003. However, analysts forecast volatility as the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly. The rupee rallied to a two-month high bolstered by inflows. The domestic currency closed stronger at 74.04, up from Friday’s close of 74.31 against the dollar — the highest since November 9. A record fund-raise by Reliance Industries and other capital inflows are expected to keep the dollar under check.Bond markets, however, saw a selloff. The 6.59% yield on the 10-year bond is the highest since January 31, 2020. The benchmark 10-year bond had closed at 6.54% on Friday. Sentiment in the bond market has changed after the RBI became a net seller of bonds — a move seen aimed at supporting measures to normalise the excess liquidity pumped in to help markets during the pandemic. Bond yields rose ahead of December inflation numbers, which are expected on Wednesday. Dealers also have a negative outlook on inflation with global oil prices firming up over concerns of supply constraints because of geopolitical tension in Libya and Kazakhstan. Additionally, bond yields rose because of a surge in US yields. A drop in unemployment in the US is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates earlier than expected.In domestic market, the sensex opened stronger. Bank stocks were among key gainers. During the day, there were rumours that the government might hike foreign investment limit in public sector banks to 74%. SBI gained the most (2.5%) on anticipation of better Q3 results. HDFC (2.4%), Kotak Bank (2.3%), ICICI Bank (2.2%) and Axis Bank (1.7%) were other significant gainers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bond-yields-at-pre-covid-high-beat-home-loan-rates/articleshow/88820516.cms||---

Apparently, the Board was forced to take the decision after as many as 56 players tested positive across the eight teams left in the tournament.In an email to all the state associations on Monday, BCCI secretary Jay Shah wrote: “Dear colleagues, I hope you and your family members are healthy and safe. I thank you for your understanding and for supporting us in our decision to postpone the domestic tournaments in view of the rising COVID-19 cases across India. As estimated, the caseload shot up immediately. I believe a timely call was taken and it will help us curb the spread of the new variant, which is far more infectious.”He then explained why the BCCI was forced to postpone the knockouts of the Cooch Behar Trophy, when it had been initially decided that it would be the only tournament to be continued. “At the time, it was decided that the Cooch Behar Trophy, which had already started, could continue as we had successfully completed the league stage involving 93 matches across 20 venues. We were set for the knockout stage in Pune with quarterfinals from tomorrow but with just 7 matches left in the tournament, the virus has raised its head again. Unfortunately, there have been COVID-19 cases within the team environment, and we are now forced to postpone the knockout stage, keeping the health and safety of everyone concerned,” wrote Shah.The BCCI is hopeful of completing the knockouts of the tournament, once the covid situation improves in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bcci-postpones-cooch-behar-trophy-knockouts/articleshow/88820517.cms||---

According to his father, Syed Saheel had fallen into bad company and was not regular at work. On Sunday, he did not go to work and was at home watching TV. His father Abbas, an autorickshaw driver, scolded him and left for work around 11am. Saheel rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and stabbed himself in the stomach. His mother Reshma administered first aid. Saheel complained of pain in the stomach around 1pm and was rushed to a private hospital, where he passed away by 3am on Monday. In her complaint, Reshma said Saheel had gone into the kitchen and shouted at her and his father and, out of anger, stabbed himself. He threw the knife on the floor and sat on the sofa in the hall. Reshma assumed he was merely staging a drama to threaten them. Later, she noticed an injury on his stomach. Saheel didn’t complain of pain and Reshma thought it was a minor cut. She realised it was a serious injury only when Saheel began crying in pain. JJ Nagar police have taken up a case of unnatural death and are investigating.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/chided-by-dad-youth-stabs-himself-to-death/articleshow/88820519.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BMTC’s plan to operate AC buses to Doddaballapur Cross irks KSRTC||BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has raised objections to the move of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) to operate its Vajra AC buses on the city outskirts. Sources said BMTC had planned to operate 11 AC buses on Yelahanka-Doddaballapur (V-285) route and five buses on V-285MB Cauvery Bhavan - D Cross (Doddaballapur Cross). BMTC has now written to transport minister B Sriramulu complaining that KSRTC isn’t allowing it to operate these buses. “The transport minister on January 6 instructed us to increase the number of AC buses on the outskirts. AC buses are being operated at the convenience of the public, but KSRTC has raised objections to the services,” said a senior official. BMTC officials said they have been operating AC Vajra buses to places like Harohalli, Anekal and Magadi from the city based on demand. BMTC is allowed to run buses within the city limits and 25km radius from BBMP boundaries in all directions. However, a KSRTC official said: “BMTC was operating from D Cross instead of Doddaballapur bus station. We don’t have any opposition to BMTC AC buses. Our buses have limited stops and BMTC halt at almost all stops. We are also not operating any direct AC buses between Doddaballapur and Bengaluru. In fact, fare structures of KSRTC and BMTC buses are also different". BMTC officials said D Cross is within 25km radius from BBMP limits. “They have raised an objection since our fares are cheaper,” they added. With Namma Metro and suburban rail expanding, many passengers said BMTC should be allowed to operate to nearby districts. Many passengers opt for BMTC as there are more stops and fares are cheaper. Tejaswi K, a passenger, said: “BMTC should increase frequency to places like Bidadi, Harohalli, Maralawadi, Manchanabele, Dabbaguli and Magadi. It should also operate buses to Ramanagara town. Back in 2004-05, even Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Bidadi and Anekal had only KSRTC buses from Majestic.” He said BMTC already serves Malur taluk of Kolar (Chikka Tirupati) and should extend to places like Nandi Hills, Muddenahalli, Chikkaballapur town and Bhoganandiswara Temple. However, a BMTC official said: “Our focus is to provide better frequency services within BBMP limits,” said an official. Srinivas K, a regular passenger from Doddaballapur, said: “BMTC should be allowed to run AC buses from Bengaluru to places like Tumakuru, Kolar and Ramanagara as many people travel daily to and from the city. This will also help passengers travelling to places en-route. Instead of competing, KSRTC and BMTC should complement each other.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bmtcs-plan-to-enter-city-outskirts-irks-ksrtc/articleshow/88820522.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karanth layout: HC says it can’t allow re-litigation||Bengaluru: A division bench of the high court has dismissed writ appeals challenging the final notification issued for acquisition of land for Dr Shivaram Karanth Layout to be developed by Bangalore Development Authority (BDA).Panchakshari R and others had challenged the November 29, 2021 decision of the single judge, wherein a batch of petitions challenging the final notification came to be dismissed.“The impugned final notification dated October 30, 2018, which was challenged in a batch of writ petitions, as rightly held by the learned single judge, cannot be gone into and if done, would virtually amount to permitting the present appellants to re-litigate on the same cause of action. It would also be tantamount to overstepping the jurisdiction of the apex court and overreaching its orders,” a division bench comprising chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum observed.“If the final notification is issued pursuant to a positive direction issued by the apex court, the question of validity of the final notification cannot be looked into and the single judge has rightly declined to entertain the writ petition. We do not find any valid grounds to arrive at a contrary view in the present case on hand,” the bench said.It may be recalled that on August 3, 2018, the Supreme Court had restored the preliminary notification issued on December 30, 2008 by reversing the orders passed by both the single and division bench of the Karnataka high court and directed the authorities to issue final notification within three months, without excluding any acquired land.Thereafter, the BDA issued final notification on October 30, 2018. Basappa and others had challenged both these notifications.The single judge had refused to entertain the writ petitions, holding that the apex court has not only restored, revived and upheld the entire scheme and preliminary notification, but had also directed the state government and the BDA to implement the entire scheme and issue final notification within three months, in terms of the order of the top court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karanth-layout-hc-says-it-cant-allow-re-litigation/articleshow/88820523.cms||---

The memo also stated in view of this development, the interim application filed by the complainant should be treated as closed, reserving liberty to file interim applications, if need arises.Taking the memo on record and also hearing the brief submission made by senior advocate Sajan Poovayya for the petitioner, justice Krishna S Dixit disposed of the petition. The tech giant had challenged the December 14, 2021 order passed by Competition Commission of India (CCI), seeking its response by December 31, 2021 vis-a-vis a complaint regarding the policy. During the earlier proceedings, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman, appearing on behalf of CCI, had assured the court that no action would be taken in the interregnum and later indicated the probe would be concluded in 60 days. Google had claimed that the CCI had not disclosed the identity of the app developers/startups who have provided certain evidence and information in the complaint filed before it.The petitioner had claimed the deadline for impacted Indian developers to comply with the Google Play Store Billing Clarifications has been extended until October 31, and the same was informed to the CCI as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wont-implement-play-store-policy-until-oct-31-google/articleshow/88820524.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Cases of thefts by househelps in Bengaluru rose 33% in 2021||BENGALURU: In the first week of December, a maid working at the house of a senior IPS officer in the city went missing with some gold ornaments belonging to the cop’s wife. The FIR copy read that she fled with cash worth Rs 32,000 and three gold earrings. Later, gold articles and some of the cash were recovered from her. This was among the 179 cases of servant theft reported in the city during 2021, of which 95 were cracked. Last year saw a 33% increase in servant thefts as compared to 2020 when 134 cases were reported. Under 50% or 64 cases were solved in 2020. Police commissioner Kamal Pant said the upward trend in servant theft cases last year showed the accused servants faced financial issues. “During the lockdowns in 2020, a majority of these house helps lost their jobs. Similarly in early 2021, when the second wave of the pandemic hit the city, more jobs of house maids were cut. This could have resulted in maids landing in financial crisis and resorting to crime,” he said. On detection, Pant said: “Cases where suspects from in and around Bengaluru or other parts of the state are involved are solved quickly compared to those where the suspects would have returned to their villages in other distant states. Also, our staff could not travel to other states during lockdowns.” He added that efforts are on to nab the accused in all the cases. Section 381 of IPC defines servant theft as theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of his or her master. If convicted by court, the accused could face punishment up to seven years imprisonment with fine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cases-of-thefts-by-househelps-in-bengaluru-rose-33-in-2021/articleshow/88820525.cms||---

A proposal in this regard is under consideration and a final decision is likely soon, a senior official said. The move is also for administrative convenience, the official added. Currently, the university has 140 constituent women colleges spread across 13 districts in North Karnataka, including Chitradurga. "A staffer from a women’s college in Hubballi will have to travel all the way to Vijayapura for official work. If the college becomes co-educational, then they can be affiliated to nearby universities. A vast jurisdiction also poses other challenges like conducting exams. This is why we are mulling this proposal," said an MLC who is in the know of the development. However, educationists say it is part of the government’s long term plan to have a multidisciplinary university in every district as prescribed in the National Education Policy. Other universities like the folklore university near Haveri and music university in Mysuru are also likely to be restructured, a source said. The plan to open the varsity to men has not gone down well with its staff. “It was established after decades of struggle. Barring four to five departments, the other 32 have full student strength. The varsity has the highest number of women PhD students. Such being the case, restructuring is uncalled for,” said a lecturer who did not want to be named. BK Tulasimala, vice-chancellor of Akkamahadevi university, said she was not aware of the government's plan to go co-educational. “We have not heard anything about it from the government so far,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/states-only-womens-varsity-may-go-co-ed/articleshow/88820528.cms||---

Karnataka advocate general Prabhuling K Navadagi said while the apex court has posted the main petition on Mekedatu for January 24, the petition questioning the NGT order is listed for Tuesday. NGT’s southern bench in May last year had taken up a suo motu case based on a media report that the Karnataka government had started work on constructing a reservoir at Mekedatu without obtaining environment clearance and appointed a joint committee to examine the allegation. The principal bench of NGT in June last year had closed the suo motu proceedings on forming the committee for spot inspection to find out whether Karnataka has prepared to build the reservoir. It closed the proceedings since a petition filed by TN against the project was already pending in the SC. The Tamil Nadu government had moved the SC against the central NGT order. It had also filed a petition questioning the basic proposal of Mekedatu project, which is posted for January 24.

This includes KPCC president DK Shivakumar, senior Congress leaders Siddaramaiah and M Mallikarjun Kharge, and actors Duniya Vijay and Sadhu Kokila.Based on a complaint filed by Kanakapura tahsildar Venkatesh, Sathanur police registered an FIR under IPC sections 143 (unlawful assembly) and 336 (endangering human life or personal safety of others through acts of negligence) and the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act. “Filing the case is the first step. The other steps will follow as per the law. We will not spare anyone,” said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. The government had come under severe criticism for not preventing the padayatra on the first day (Sunday). Many people questioned as to why the rules were different for the common man and politicians. “Whether it is a common man or a big leader, no distinction will be made between those found violating Covid-19 norms in the state,” Bommai asserted. He also advocated the need for greater vigil against the spread of Covid-19. Home minister Araga Jnanendra said the government will be forced to think of a lockdown if Covid cases keep increasing and the Congress will be held responsible for such a situation. “There is fear that the padayatra will turn out to be a super-spreader event. Congress leaders are playing with the lives of people by taking up this padayatra now. The people of the state are also unhappy with them,” he said. Shivakumar unfazedUnperturbed, Shivakumar said: “We will not be deterred by these cases and will continue with our padayatra. The government is trying hard to sabotage our yatra. They have only filed 31 cases when they should have filed over 1,000,” he told reporters while walking towards Kanakapura on the second day of the padayatra. He also trained his guns on the government for its “selective approach” in filing cases. “Several BJP leaders have attended programmes violating Covid norms. Renukacharya (CM’s political secretary) attended a bull race in Honnali yesterday (Sunday). BJP leader Guttedar held a programme where hundreds of people participated. Why have no cases been booked against them?” he asked. “I have details from 137 taluks where Covid guidelines have been violated. I have asked the party’s legal team to take up the matter. We will also file cases against them. It is a political fight and we will fight it out.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/padayatra-31-congress-leaders-actors-booked-for-violating-curbs/articleshow/88820530.cms||---

Made at the end of the 19th century, it is one of the first estampages in the country. Estampage is the process of obtaining impressions of inscriptions on copper and stone onto inked paper. The process began after the epigraphy branch of the ASI was established in 1887. The records will be preserved at the Clive's House at Fort St George in Chennai. For this purpose, the office of the deputy superintending epigraphist, South Zone in Chennai, will be renamed the office of the deputy superintending epigraphist (Tamil Inscriptions). Former ASI epigraphist S Rajavelu said estampages were initially taken from Brihadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur, Pallava monuments in Mamallapuram, and temples in Vellore district in the late 1880s. "It’s being done to preserve the inscriptions as there its possible these inscriptions on monuments might disappear with time. The inscriptions are transcribed by epigraphists and maintained as records by the ASI,” he said, adding the estampages must be maintained at temperatures less than 21 degree Celsius. ASI director (administration) Ajay Yadav said, “We will be working on the modalities on how to transport the records to Chennai.” It may be recalled that a Madras high court division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice M Duraiswamy in August last had directed the ASI to transfer all the Tamil estampages and documents from the epigraphy circle in Mysuru to the epigraphy branch in Chennai within six months and rename the epigraphy branch in Chennai as epigraphy branch (Tamil).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/asi-to-transfer-28000-tamil-estampages-to-chennai/articleshow/88820538.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

While India has hardly netted anything so far, much of it has gone to Vietnam and Bangladesh. “Tamil Nadu should focus on tapping into this growth opportunity. Much of this is labour-intensive growth opportunity, especially in clothing, footwear and automobiles, where Tamil Nadu has a base. But it needs to do more,” Arvind Subramanian, former chief economic advisor to Government of India and now a member of the chief minister’s Economic Advisory Council in Tamil Nadu said here on Monday. “Until a few years ago, TN was the most attractive hub for automobiles. But (it) has given up that position to some extent over the last few years. It should focus to get back to that position,” Subramanian said, while addressing the members of the Chennai International Centre through a virtual conference. He also wondered why the state, which has abundance supply of finance, talent and technology could not produce more unicorns. If India has close to 80 unicorns, only three are from Tamil Nadu. Noting that the situation needs to improve, he said the state government was working on it. However, Arvind Subramanian said“Despite being the most urbanized state, the revenue of Rs 2,500 crore or so from property tax is far less compared to less urbanized states. The huge debt burden of the power utility is a big drain on the state’s resources and worsening financial woes. These are the two handles that the government needs to work on.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-should-focus-on-tapping-opportunities-given-up-by-china/articleshow/88820539.cms||D Govardan
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Shortage mars Pongal gift hamper distribution||CHENNAI: Complaints of missing items, inferior quality and delayed distribution has surrounded the distribution of Pongal gift hampers to ration card holders. The hamper contains 21 essential items. While initially there were complaints of missing items, now the standard of the items has come into question. For instance, some of the packets distributed at the Public Distribution System (PDS) outlet in Besant Nagar were damaged by rats. “Thankfully, we spotted it,” said Vijay Bobby, a ration cardholder who raised the red flag. On the other hand, the card holders in Chennai's neighbouring districts noticed a stark contrast between the quantity of the items promised. K Bethraj, a consumer rights activist from Kancheepuram said the packets distributed at the shops located near the collectorate at Pillayarpalayam contained only 10g-14g of cashew and 3g of cardamom instead of the 50g and 10g that were promised by the state government. Besides, in Chennai, there was a shortage of the gift hampers resulting in serpentine queues outside the PDS outlets in Madipakkam and Kodambakkam on Monday. F Syed, a cardholder from Madipakkam, said they were sent back home after waiting for hours. The employee at the shop attributed the delay to inadequate sugarcane supply. “Contrary to the government’s announcement, tokens for the gift hampers were not distributed. We waited the whole day at the ration shop to get the tokens. It makes no sense as those without the tokens are allowed in the queues,” he said. A senior government official said the delay was due to the complete lockdown on Sunday, and they were taking steps to complete distribution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/shortage-mars-pongal-gift-hamper-distribution/articleshow/88820540.cms||Ram Sundaram

Asserting that those extracting water illegally must be prosecuted for ‘theft’ under the IPC, the court said: “In the present case, water released from dams or otherwise through canal belongs to the government.”“Equal distribution of water to all eligible Ayacutdars (beneficiaries of the canal) is of paramount importance. Water is life. Any irregularities and illegalities in this regard must be viewed seriously,” he court observed and added that the distribution of water cannot be done at whims and fancies.The mind-set among farmers and others that water is common for all and that they can tap water as they like and use as they wish is a wrong, the court said. Disposing of the petition, the court posted the matter to January 25 for the authorities to report compliance. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cut-subsidy-to-farmers-stealing-water-hc/articleshow/88820546.cms||---

In a statement, Vasan alleged that Karnataka Congress had been showing huge interest in building a dam at Mekedatu, while the farmers of Tamil Nadu, especially the delta farmers had been highly dependent on Cauvery for generations for prosperity. “Holding a padayatra to urge the Karnataka government to build a dam and encourage the problematic dam construction is betraying the interests of Tamils,” the former Union minister said, adding that Cauvery water dispute was not about crops but lifeline.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mekedatu-vasan-against-ktaka-yatra/articleshow/88820550.cms||---

The development comes in the wake of the political parties strongly condemning the Union minister for not meeting the MPs from the state on multiple occasions. The issue took a political turn with chief minister M K Stalin strongly condemning the home minister on the floor of the state assembly last week for refusing an audience for the representatives of people and dubbed his act “anti-democratic”. The MPs, who are part of the delegation, confirmed to TOI that they received a communication that Shah would meet them on January 17. “We received a communication (from DMK MP T R Baalu) regarding the appointment with home minister Shah coming Monday. The time of the meeting was tentative (between 4 pm and4.30 pm),” said a member of the seven-member MP delegation that would be led by DMK Parliamentary party leader T R Baalu. A few other members of the team too confirmed the schedule of the meeting with Shah. “We learned that the PM (Narendra Modi) directed Shah to meet the TN MPs,” said a senior DMK leader. A Navaneethakrishnan of AIADMK, Navas Kani of IUML, Su Venkatesan of CPM, K Jeyakumar of Congress, Thol Thirumavalavan of VCK, Vaiko of MDMK would be part of the all-party delegation, sources confirmed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/shah-to-meet-tn-all-party-delegation-on-neet-on-jan-17/articleshow/88820551.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

According to data collated by the corporation through contact tracing, 1,502 of the 5,040 people who tested positive on January 8, are family contacts or those who shared the household with quarantined patients.  Such cases made up half the new infections in north Chennai, where many neighbourhoods have small houses. In Madhavaram zone, 60% of cases were household contacts, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar reported 49% of them, and Tondiarpet 43%.  Such cases were fewer in Anna Nagar, Teynampet and Adyar, where houses are generally bigger. Only 12% cases are family contacts in Anna Nagar zone, 25% in Teynampet and 15% in Adyar.  With this learning, the city corporation has suggested people sharing houses with patients wear masks all the time.  Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body could do little to contain spread in homes. “We are efficiently containing it in public places, but most cases are coming from inside homes. Only wearing masks at home can reduce the spread,” the commissioner said.  Medical experts also suggested the same thing. Dr C Jagadeesh, senior consultant, internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals, said people with comorbid conditions sharing houses with quarantined patients should wear mask and try to maintain social distance as much as possible. “The spread inside the houses was observed even during the previous Covid waves, but this time it is faster. Other than this, hygienic practices such as frequent washing of hands should be followed,” said Dr Jagadeesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/30-of-all-positive-cases-in-city-are-household-contacts/articleshow/88820553.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Chennai: On Day 1 of booster dose, many hopefuls sent back||CHENNAI: On the first day of vaccine booster programme in the city, officials of Primary Health Centres (PHCs) said they were unaware of the campaign. Several people who had queued up were sent back home. Greater Chennai Corporation on Sunday had announced that booster doses will be available at 140 PHCs in the city. However, soon after chief minister MK Stalin launched the campaign at MRC Nagar on Monday, complaints began to pour in. S Ganesh, a resident of Thiruvanmiyur, said he visited three PHCs in his area to get the booster shot for his 73-year-old mother, but could not get it. He said he had received a text message from the government on Sunday requesting her to get her third dose. “Workers deployed at helpdesks in Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam and Palavakkam PHCs had no information regarding the booster shot. The situation was no different at Virugambakkam PHC. Overall, it was a mess,” he said, hoping that the government will rectify the matter in the next one or two days. People residing within Tambaram and Avadi corporation limits faced a different set of problems. “Government hospitals here do not have adequate Covaxin stock. So only those who had received two doses of Covishield were able to get inoculated,” said SM Govindarajan from Federation of Residents' Welfare Associations in Tambaram. In Avadi, even though booster doses were available, not many were aware about the campaign, eligibility and documents required. “Some eligible people arrived at PHCs here without Aadhar card, printed copies of comorbidity or vaccine certificates. So they were sent back,” said T Sadagopan, a resident-activist from Pattabiram. None of the private hospitals administered the third dose. Their names were not even listed on the official Cowin website. “It would be better if the government starts vaccinating people at their doorsteps,” Sadagopan said. GCC Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said door-to-door vaccine campaigns for booster shots will begin soon. People who are 60 or above can contact 1913, 044-25384520 or 044-46122300 to register.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/on-day-1-of-booster-dose-many-hopefuls-sent-back/articleshow/88820556.cms||Ram Sundaram

All AC coaches have now been modified to increase the cycle of fresh air to 12 times per hour in a coach. Earlier, air in a coach was changed only six times in an hour.A railway official said that filters are being checked and serviced when AC coaches return from each trip as per pandemic protocols. “This is to ensure that air quality is good in coaches to prevent infection,” he added. He said that the steps being followed from the beginning of the pandemic are being continued and instructions have been given to step up inspections to keep coaches safe for passengers as there is a demand for train travel inspite of an increase in infection. The railways maintains around 250 to 300 coaches that are used on trains that depart from the city.In addition to maintenance, special instructions issued by RDSO for temperature setting of AC coaches is also being followed. The temperature of the LHB AC coaches has been increased from the usual 23 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius, so that passengers are comfortable. In non-LHB AC coaches, electronic thermostats have been modified with a setting of 24 to 26 deg Celsius.  The rakes that arrive after a trip are also disinfected using staff at the yards. . "Ticket examiners have been telling passengers to wear mask while in train and a fine is being imposed on violators at stations," he added..||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/railways-steps-up-checks-in-ac-coaches/articleshow/88820557.cms||---

He was addressing a special media workshop organised by the Press Information Bureau in association with the state health department and Unicef. "This worshop will help journalists understand that information during a crisis should not be treated as a commodity. In a pandemic, it is the responsibility of the media to play an important role in sensitising people, to take the facts to them,” he said. He said a fact-check should be done before presenting any information to the public. Professor Dr C Ravichandran, professor, Madras Medical College, said that in Omicron cases, only 1.6% patients need hospitalisation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/omicron-behind-case-surge-in-tn/articleshow/88820559.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: ‘Allow train travel even if Covid cases rise’||cCHENNAI: Suburban commuters are a worried lot as they fear the railways may bring in further restrictions and convert trains into workmen specials if cases continue to spike. A forum of suburban commuters has appealed to the railway authorities to allow employees of private firms to travel in trains if they show a letter from their employers. More than four lakh commuters use the suburban trains in the city. Railways have tightened rules to ensure that people use masks at stations and on trains all the time. After vaccine certificates were made compulsory, commuters had appealed to the DRM not to bring in further restrictions. They said that barring commuters from using suburban trains had led to job losses when the pandemic began in 2020. K Baskar, a frequent commuter, said, “We have appealed to the railways to not bring back the workmen special because suburban services are the mainstay for several people who commute for work to the city.” The forum of suburban commuters has also requested the railways to not bar people from using trains even if Covid-19 cases are high, he added. Suburban trains are the mainstay for people who travel for work in industrial estates at Guindy, Ambattur, Kakkalur and others. Most firms in these estates get their employees from Arakkonam, Tiruvalangadu, Tiruvallur and other areas. “Many people were forced to travel by motorcycles all the way to the city during the first wave to save their jobs. That should not be the case this time if the government is going to declare a shutdown,”Jayapaul, a frequent commuter said. A railway official said that the restrictions are being imposed on suburban services to ensure people can travel safely. Further decisions will be taken based on instructions from the railway board.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/allow-train-travel-even-if-cases-rise/articleshow/88820560.cms||V Ayyappan

About 100 healthcare staff have tested positive in just four tertiary hospitals in the city. The service doctors and postgraduates association have written to the state health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan, to suspend elective surgeries and procedures, special clinics, healthcamps, classes and other official meetings. In their letter, the association has requested that one-third of healthcare staff be allowed to avail compulsory leave on rotation basis, and to exempt pregnant and immuno-compromised healthcare professionals from duties, apart from a provision for special casual leave. “Exempt healthcare staff with comorbidities from Covid related work and allow them to avail all leaves without any restrictions,” the statement said. The doctors have also asked to provide quarantine leave after Covid-19 duties and accommodation during Covid duty. A Ramalingam, State General Secretary of SDPGA, said the government must ensure that there is no shortage of manpower.  Dr GR Ravindranath, general secretary of Doctors' Association for Social Equality (DASE), said nurses are asked to come to duty just three days after quarantine time. “They must be given leave. Their duty times are erratic and it must be only for fixed hours,” he said. The government must release the salaries which are due for house surgeons and mini-clinic doctors, added Dr GR Ravindranath.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/doctors-request-staff-friendly-rules-as-third-peak-nears/articleshow/88820562.cms||---

Based on an alert, police rushed to the spot and sent his body to the government Kilpauk medical college and hospital. The Poonamallee traffic investigation wing are probing the accident. “These smaller vehicles are prone to accidents compared to bikes, especially while speeding.

The fear of infection has led to some regular commuters switching to other modes of transport, while the demand to bring back executive class coaches has gotten louder. Earlier this month, CMRL reported daily average footfall of 1.4 lakh, higher than its pre-Covid ridership of 1.16 lakh.Regular commuters said the trains are particularly crowded during peak hours. R Geetha, a government employee who travels from Thirumangalam to LIC daily, said she stopped taking the train in the mornings after cases began increasing and then stopped using the trains altogether after the cap on train capacity was announced. She said trains arriving at Central metro from the north Chennai extension line are crowded in the morning, while trains proceeding towards Central metro from Anna Salai are packed in the evening peak hours. Stations too are crowded.“I have been travelling in an autorickshaw every day since last week. Despite the signs on the seats for social distancing, all seats in the trains are full. There are also more commuters standing, especially in the women’s coach,” she said.Vetriselvan, a government employee from Korattur who travels to Thirumangalam metro station on his bike and boards a train to his office on Anna Salai, has begun been riding his bike to work since last Friday. “Till the executive coach was there, there were a few of us regulars who used it. There was no crowd and no fear. If CMRL brings it back, there are many of us who are willing to pay double the ticket price and travel regularly,” he said. “Nowadays, at hubs like Central, two trains in either direction arrive at the same time. Platforms, lifts and escalators are all packed at times like these during peak hours. This is causing a lot of stress and fear of infection among many regulars.” Due to the night curfew, the trains run only till 9pm as opposed ot the earlier deadline of 11pm. CMRL also recently extended peak hour frequency of five minutes between 8am and 11am and between 5pm and 8pm to enable social distancing.A CMRL official said they operate 40 trains during peak hours instead of the regular 20 trains to cater to the present footfall. “Our daily footfall have also dropped since the restrictions were announced from nearly 1.42 lakh to one lakh. But we continue to operate 40 trains. There are barely 200 people in a train, which has a total capacity of 1,270 passengers,” the official said. “We have also given special instruction to the station staff to hold passengers at the AFC gate if the next train arriving is already crowded, which we monitor through cameras on trains. We refuse entry to passengers if they have high body temperatures and ensure mask compliance in stations and trains, but we cannot refuse service because our trains are crowded.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/crowded-trains-cost-cmrl-its-regulars/articleshow/88820565.cms||---

The western disturbance or a low pressure area, moving from the west over India, and causing snowfall and rain in northern parts of the country, may trigger some spells over the city around Pongal when it converges with incoming easterly winds. IMD has forecast light to moderate rain at isolated places over coastal Tamil Nadu between January 12 and 14. Bloggers said the chances of light spells over the city may last for at least six days. For the next 48 hours, IMD has forecast partly cloudy skies in the city and suburbs and the maximum and minimum temperature likely to be around 31C and 22C. Earlier, IMD area cyclone warning centre director N Puviarasan said models show that the western disturbance could come as low as over some parts of south India. “When this westerly trough meets easterly winds, it could lead to some convective activity. But it may not be heavy rainfall,” an official said. In its five-day forecast, IMD has said thunderstorms with light to moderate rain are likely at isolated places over coastal Tamil Nadu and adjoining interior districts between January 12 and 14. “We have chances of rain till January 18.

Police said the 16-year-old boy was upset as his parents hid his mobile phone to prevent him from playing games on it at all hours. The deceased was identified as S Vimal Kumar, a student at a school in Kondithope. Kumar’s father Siva and other family members were attending the funeral of a relative in the city on Sunday, leaving Kumar home alone. Police said the boy seemed addicted to gaming on his mobile and this led to Siva hiding the device. An officer said Kumar searched all over the house, but couldn’t find it and grew more upset. When his parents returned home on Sunday, they found the door locked and no response from Kumar. Worried, they broke open the door only to find their son dead.

S Ganesan of Rayanur said in his petition that his 18-year-old son, who had learning difficulties, was admitted in the emergency ward of the hospital on November 30, 2017, after he came down with severe fever. After treatment, he was transferred to a regular ward the next day. On December 2, the duty doctor advised that a CT scan be taken and since equipment at the hospital was dysfunctional, the family was asked to shift the patient to Trichy government hospital. That night, the patient developed fever again and when Ganesan’s wife approached the duty nurse to report it to the medical officer, the nurse ignored the plea and was on his mobile. Ganesan’s son died the next morning. No action was taken on his complaint against the hospital authorities, so he moved the commission. Hospital authorities denied the allegations and said that despite their best efforts, the patient’s condition did not improve. The commission observed that the inquiry conducted by the inquiry officer is not satisfactory. The commission also recommended that the nurse be transferred and disciplinary proceedings be initiated against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tn-told-to-pay-3l-to-kin-of-teen-who-died-in-karur-hosp/articleshow/88820569.cms||---

Abirami, 36, a grade one constable at the Chromepet police station, was surprised when Sathish of East Tambaram’s Nethaji Nagar came running to the station in the early hours of Sunday, while the night curfew was in force, with his six-month-old grandson, Saiputhran, in his arms. Earlier that night, the infant suddenly developed breathing difficulties putting his grandparents and mother in a state of panic. They first rushed him to a nearby private hospital from where they were redirected to the Chromepet government hospital. The child was given first aid, but since there was no pediatrician available at the time, Sathish was asked to take the child elsewhere as his health condition grew critical, the construction worker said. He alleged that one of the nurses refused to help them get ‘108’ ambulances. Helpless and worried, Sathish turned to the nearest police station, hoping for help from the people in khaki. There were no autorickshaws around due to the curfew so he walked to the station carrying his grandson. Abirami, who was on night duty, thought Sathish and his family ran over to the station to report some crime, until she saw the child in his arms. “I realised that the child needed immediate medical help. (It was obvious) he was finding it difficult to breathe. The elderly couple too were unable to express what happened to the child. All they wanted was my help to get an ambulance,” Abirami told TOI. “We had to act immediately. I got an ambulance and convinced the driver to reach the spot as soon as he could and explained the emergency. He too cooperated. I am happy I could help a member of the public and reinstill faith in the force.” The child was rushed to the Institute of Child Health in Egmore and is being treated by doctors in the ICU.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/amid-lockdown-constable-helps-hospitalise-sick-six-month-old/articleshow/88820571.cms||Sindhu Kannan

The committee was appointed to look into the allegations of corruption and financial irregularities against the former VC. “Providing a copy of the inquiry report is a constitutional requirement and part of the requirement under the principles of natural justice,” Justice V Parthiban said. Responding to the observations, advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram said: “Our hands are tied, because as per the provisions of the Anna University Act, the report has to be forwarded to the governor who is the chancellor of the university and he is to take further action.” “You (the state) may say no, but the court will say no to your no. I will give a direction because you cannot take a decision without furnishing a copy of the report to him (Surappa),” the court said. The court further pointed out that as per the provisions of the act, the chancellor has to act as per the recommendation of the state. If the court passes a direction to furnish a copy of the report, then it will set a bad precedent, the AG said.  “No, it will be a correct precedent. You should not play with the rights of persons and this is a rudimentary right a person should enjoy,” Justice Parthiban responded and reserved his orders. The issue pertains to a plea moved by Surappa challenging the constitution of the committee by the state government. On January 3, he informed the court that he is willing to give up the litigation if the state is ready to provide a copy of the report and give him an opportunity to make a representation. Recording the same, the judge directed the AG to ascertain the stand of the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-is-govt-denying-probe-report-to-anna-univ-ex-vc-surappa-asks-hc/articleshow/88820573.cms||---

On Tuesday, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis will pay a visit to Mahbubnagar. Since BJP state chief Sanjay was arrested on January 2 while protesting against GO 317 in Karimnagar, several national leaders, including party national president JP Nadda visited state and slammed the TRS government. Apart from Nadda, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, his Assam counterpart Hemantha Biswa Sarma, Union MoS for chemicals and fertilisers Bhagwanth Khuba and Chhattisgarh former CM Raman Singh have visited the state and condemned Sanjay’s arrest. Saffron party’s original plan was to send national leaders to each district, but in the wake of surge in Covid cases, the party has changed its plans and asked Union ministers, MPs and national executive members to tour Telangana and motivate party workers. Following Fadnavis’ visit, there will be a brief pause in national leaders’ visits till January 18. “We will get a clear picture on national level leaders’ visits soon,” a top leader told TOI.

While five of the studies in the review used finger millets, one used sorghum and two used a mixture of millets including finger, pearl, foxtail, little and kodo millets.As per the study, among the children that were fed millet-based meals, a relative increase of 28.2% in mean height, 26% in weight, 39% in the mid upper arm circumference and 37% in chest circumference was observed as compared to children on regular rice-based diets. “These results are attributable to naturally high nutrient content of millets that exhibit high amounts of growth promoting nutrients, especially total protein, sulphur containing amino acids, and calcium in case of finger millets,” said S Anitha, senior scientist-nutrition, Icrisat. Dr Hemalatha, director, India’s National Institute of Nutrition , said implementing millets-based meals required menus to be designed for different age groups utilising local recipes of different regions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/millets-can-help-kids-fight-malnutrition-icrisat-study/articleshow/88820586.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana universities, cops join hands to weed out fake certificates||HYDERABAD: Telangana state universities will now closely work with the police to eliminate rampant fake certificate racket and make verification faster. The decision was taken during a meeting convened by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) on ‘student academic record verification service’ along with all the state university vice-chancellors on Monday. The meeting was attended by director general of police (DGP) Mahender Reddy where discussions took place on measures to make the system foolproof. “Universities have to introspect on whether the current system of verification is foolproof or not. Universities may verify certificates that come before them. But there are many others who continue to work with a fake certificate. Universities must establish a system where no person who duplicates a certificate goes scot-free,” said Reddy, asking university VCs to approach the police whenever a fake certificate is detected. Citing best practices being followed by various foreign universities, the DGP asked the VCs to upgrade their existing verification processes. “Online verification does not mean that universities have to put up their certificates only. There are many other universities where they have online and back-end verification system that flags a fake certificate,” said Reddy. Following this, a parallel system of machine-to-machine exchange of data between state-level TSCHE server and university server will be established to achieve automatic data capture. Universities will be working with National Academic Depository via DigiLocker and upload data as much as and as early as possible. “The TSCHE has asked us to submit data pertaining to certificates that have been issued in the past few years. We are also in the process of setting up security features for our certificates as we have identified several fake certificates that came for verification recently,” said D Ravinder, vice-chancellor of Telangana University, Nizamabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-varsities-cops-join-hands-to-weed-out-fake-certificates/articleshow/88820588.cms||---

Following the brutal murder of Hemanth, police booked criminal cases against Avanthi’s mother Archana and others. They were arrested and sent to jail.Earlier, the courts had rejected bail to her. Releasing her on bail at that stage may prove to be inimical to the case of the prosecution.

They said that five of them were government teachers, while the rest worked in other departments. “The government employees are in severe distress as they are transferred to faraway places without considering their local cadre. While some of them died by suicide, others have died because of heart attack as they couldn’t come to terms with going to faraway places leaving everything behind,” TPTF vice-president M Ravinder said. He alleged that the state made several irregularities while transferring government employees and added that the root cause for all the problems was dividing erstwhile 10 districts into seven zones instead of 10. “Had the state divided each district into a zone, there would have been no issue, but they divided zones by combing districts because of which employees, including teachers, are transferred to faraway places,” he added. The teachers demanded amendments to GO 317 and alleged that the state failed to follow due procedure while transferring employees as separate GOs were not issued by the departments concerned instead transfers were made by following the GO issued by the general administration department. They further said that the state also failed to take the opinion of all associations before implementing the GO. “Teachers and other government employees have been running around various offices to get their transfers stopped. Many are depressed and are getting heart attacks as they are under tremendous pressure. Even teachers who are at the fag end of their career are transferred to faraway places by considering their present post seniority instead of their overall seniority,” United Teachers Federation general secretary Chava Ravi said, adding that on Monday a constable committed suicide as he was transferred from Khammam to Mulugu district. They said the state should react and make amendments to the GO before more lives were lost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govts-faulty-zone-rejig-cause-of-stress-says-teachers-body/articleshow/88820596.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Gang of four arrested with 294kg ganja sourced from Andhra Pradesh for sale in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A gang of ganja peddlers was arrested on Monday with 294 kg of the contraband sourced from Andhra Pradesh which they were planning to sell in the city. The Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths of Rachakonda arrested four men near Choutuppal toll plaza when they tried to escape after noticing a police checkpost. The men were in a car and following the contraband loaded in a goods carrier. The arrested accused are V Tirupathi (27), a painter from Ibrahimpatnam; V Kalyan (19), a student from Nagarkurnool; P Mankhta (25), an auto driver from Nalgonda; and P Ravinder (24), a cab driver from LB Nagar. Two others, Butchi Babu and K Surendra Dora, who supplied the ganja, are absconding. Apart from the contraband, cops seized Rs 8,500, the goods carrier and car, and two cell phones from their possession, all worth about Rs 44 lakh. Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh M Bhagwat said that Tirupathi, Kalyan and Manktha are related, while Ravinder is their friend. Tirupathi, who was earlier involved in an Excise Act case at Kalwakurthi in 2020, had shifted to driving a cab at Shamshabad airport. He had purchased a car a year ago, but as business was slow due to the pandemic, he recently shifted to ganja smuggling to make up for lost earnings, the commissioner said. Tirupathi got the first taste of the trade about a month ago after a man from Maharashtra hired him for a trip to Rampachodavaram where he saw the passenger buying ganja from Butchi Babu. “Babu advised Tirupathi to peddle ganja. He was buying 2 kg for Rs 2,000 from Agency area and selling in Hyderabad for Rs 10,000,” a cop said. The stash seized on Monday was part of Tirupathi’s big plan to make a substantial profit, police said. The four accused had pooled in Rs 1.2 lakh and procured 294kg ganja from Buchi Babu and Surendra Dara, promising to pay the rest after selling it in Hyderabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/gang-of-four-arrested-with-294kg-ganja-sourced-from-ap-for-sale-in-hyderabad/articleshow/88820597.cms||---

Majority of the children getting infected have mild symptoms, including fever for a day or two with doctors saying that they possibly could have picked up the infection from family members. “When we are testing kids, who have another family member unwell, nearly 50 per cent of them are testing positive. While usually such symptoms would not be checked, but now that the third wave has started, this is a cue for testing,” said Dr Preetam Kumar Reddy, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist, Rainbow Hospitals, Secunderabad. The most common reason for diagnosis across the city has been a family member suffering from Covid-19, doctors said. Family members who have symptoms should get tested and isolate themselves to break the chain of transmission," Reddy added. The spike in children with cold, cough and fever is sudden, said doctors in state-run Niloufer hospital, where children admissions and out-patient cases have increased over the last few days. "It is tough to differentiate between flu and Covid-19. In recent cases, most parents are vaccinated and infected with Covid-19 showing less symptoms. As a result, many kids are catching infection due to contact with other people at home showing similar symptoms," said a doctor at the hospital. With most school-going children showing symptoms for Covid-19, parents are being advised not to self-diagnose and treat. "Take opinion from a paediatrician and unless tested, every cold, cough and fever should be taken as Covid-19 symptom. Early diagnosis is the key to great outcome," said Dr BVL Narasimha Rao, consultant neonatology and paediatrics, Apollo Children's Hospital. While cases are being seen in infants as young as three-month old, the ones getting admitted are largely due to requirement of respiratory support. "We have seen a marked upswing in cases in last few days, majority are outpatient cases or online consultations, although four-five admissions have also been there in last three-four days. These are for non-invasive oxygen support due to respiratory distress," said Dr Satish Ghanta, Little Stars Children's Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-hosps-see-rise-in-kids-admission/articleshow/88820604.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Telangana power bill shoots up as demand on the rise||HYDERABAD: With the increase in power demand, especially in the agriculture sector, power purchase has become a costly affair for utilities in Telangana. While the purchase cost to procure power from private power generating companies has been pegged at 23,000 crore for the current year, it is likely to go up to 26,000 crore in the next financial year i.e 2022-2023. Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company (TSSPDCL) in its report to TS Electric Regulatory Commission (TSERC) said discoms need to procure power from private generators. This despite, government-owned thermal power plants reaching 70% to 76% of their plant load factor , using about 4,000 million units of power from Hydro-electric power stations. New stations will also be commissioned in the next year such as Bhadradri thermal power station. Since state formation, power demand has gone up mainly due to uninterrupted power supply being given to all categories of consumers, free 24x7 power being given to agriculture sector from 2018 and for lift irrigation schemes. Power demand has risen to 14,000MW peak maximum from 7,000MW. “When the state was formed, Telangana’s power generation capacity through own power plants and also central generating stations was just 5,000MW to 6,000MW. This has not grown substantially in the past few years. The government is compelled to purchase power from other states and stations,” a senior official from Telangana Transco said. Sources said power purchasing cost has also increased in two years. “The power cost is 4.65 per kilo watt hour. It is expected to touch Rs 4.68 per kilo watt hour,” a chief general manager of TSSPDCL said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-power-bill-shoots-upas-demand-on-the-rise/articleshow/88820607.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Self-medication not the panacea, say Hyderabad doctors||HYDERABAD: Amid the third wave of the pandemic, many are once again resorting to self-medication. People are turning up at the doctor’s desk, after having taken all the known drugs such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), molnupiravir among others. On one hand, this self-medication suppresses the symptoms, on the other it leaves very little option for the doctor to treat the patient, health experts said. “A few days ago, I came across a patient who had taken every antibiotic he knew for fever and sore throat and came to me after five days saying he was not feeling any better. Since he had taken everything, I told him I am prescribing him paracetamol which is the only medicine he has not taken,” said Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant physician at Care Hospitals. Dr Agarwal said such patients have been turning up at hospitals almost every other day in recent times. There are only a few who understand that these drugs can be dangerous chemical formulations which were unnecessarily introduced into their bodies. The other problem with self-medication is that it often leads to overmedication when there is no indication and in the long term, leads to resistance. The fact that doctors have very few medicines to prescribe to treat the virus makes matters worse. “Over the last 50 years, no new class of antibiotics has been introduced. Whatever had been there, has only been upgraded. Therefore, with prolonged and wrong usage, the entire population can develop antibiotic resistance slowly,” said a doctor. These self-medications can also be life-threatening for elderly, pregnant women and children. “Most Covid-19 patients need only symptomatic treatment. It’s a mild illness for most patients this time. Do not self-medicate with doxycycline, ivermectin, azithromycin, steroids and molnupiravir,” Dr Sivaranjani Santosh, chief paediatrician, Magna Centre, said. The doctor said monoclonal antibodies (cocktail) may not even work against the Omicron variant. “It is especially important to consult or review with the physician/pediatrician often if symptoms are severe or if you are aged or having co-morbidities or conditions with poor immunity or if you have an infant/toddler at home,” Dr Santosh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/self-medication-not-the-panacea-docs/articleshow/88820610.cms||Amrita Didyala

Even though the state has achieved overall vaccine coverage of 80% for those who are 18 years and above (including first and second doses), the push for complete coverage has hit roadblock.A month ago, the health department estimated that over 23 lakh people have missed their cutoff date for the second dose and till two days ago this figure did not change much. Hyderabad has 4.6 lakh people who missing second dose cut off, followed by Ranga Reddy at 4.2 lakh and Medchal at 4.02 lakh.Officials are now making efforts to directly find out from people why they have missed their vaccine dose and if there are any concerns. Smaller districts like Jangaon (1,651), Wanaparthy ( 3,051), Narayanpet ( 3,141), Yadaddri Bhongir (3,251) have very few people who have missing deadline for taking the second dose. Officials say in some cases people have claimed that they have taken the dose, but the CoWin portal shows otherwise. In the state, nearly 73% of the people in the age group above 18 years have taken their second doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-change-in-no-of-people-to-get-dose-2/articleshow/88820612.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Seating arrangements were also in place for the elderly at the centres.The numbers could have been higher but many were not aware of the requirements for eligibility, officials said. “Lack of awareness on who can get the vaccine, procedure to be followed and not knowing the required interval between the second and third dose probably led to many not turning up,” said a health department official. A common refrain among the elderly was a demand for precaution dose camps near their homes. “It is better to organise booster drives in residential colonies,” said Padma Reddy, a resident of BT Colony, who returned home without taking the vaccine seeing the crowd at a health centre in PicketDr H Raj Kumar, DyDMHO in SCB, acknowledged the difficulties faced by the elderly due to frail health or having no family to take them to vaccination centres. “It is often hard for senior citizens to visit health centres. Keeping this in mind, a plan to administer the booster dose at their doorsteps is under active consideration. It will be implemented once it is approved by authorities,” Dr Kumar told TOI.The booster shots for government health staff is being given in urban health centres, while private health workers would be given the third dose at their hospitals, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/60-queue-up-for-booster-butbat-for-drive-near-their-homes/articleshow/88820614.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Precaution dose for Covid-19: 83,000 in Hyderabad meet 60+ comorbidity criteria||HYDERABAD: Precaution dose for Covid-19 began in the state but because of central guidelines, only a small number of people with comorbidities over the age of 60 are preferred for the dose. Data obtained by TOI reveals that in this age group with a total population of 41.60 lakh across the state, only 83,426 people in Hyderabad are currently eligible. Across the state, 8.32 lakh people are eligible for the dose. According to the Centre, only 20% of those aged 60 and above and with comorbities are eligible for the dose. Because of Omicron concerns, the state government has written to the Centre requesting that all the elderly in this age group receive the precaution dose instead of just 20% of them. Experts also called for a similar shift in norms. The central government previously issued guidelines recognising 20 types of serious comorbidities, including diabetic conditions for more than 10 years as comorbidity. “We want the Centre to consider giving a precaution dose to everyone over the age of 60 regardless of comorbidity status,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health. Because of the long gap between Covishield between both the doses, many have delayed dates for precaution dose. In addition, the central guidelines make only a few eligible for precaution dose now, say the authorities. The elderly will be required to show authorities their health records and obtain a doctor’s recommendation letter for taking the precautionary dose. According to health officials, a majority of people in this age group are long-term diabetics as the number of diabetics in the state is the highest in the country. Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research-certified researcher, said advanced countries have given precaution dose to all aged above 60 years. “The centre may relax norms later, but it is better to consider all for precaution dose in view of the rapid spread of Omicron,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/precaution-dose-83000-in-citymeet-60-comorbidity-criteria/articleshow/88820615.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The affidavit also reiterated that actions would be taken under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in the event of protocol violations. The affidavit was in compliance with a high court directive to file the same, stating the SEC’s position on holding elections to the four civic bodies on January 22 after Bimal Bhattacharya filed a public interest litigation to postpone the polls. Mukhopadhyay stated: “I say that the present pandemic situation is very different from the situation in March 2020. In 2020, Covid-19 was a new disease whose impact on health and economy of the people, and the state was a matter of speculation. Now, there are several vaccines available and a large percentage of the urban population has already been vaccinated.

He had urged the video to be made viral as a means of getting justice for his sister.The five women had accused Punam of embezzling Rs 9.7 lakh funds of the SHG, and allegedly assaulted and paraded her and her husband, tied with a rope, along the 1.5km stretch from her Sultanpur home in Diamond Harbour to her parents’ Hara home in Kulpi. All five were booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 448 (house trespass) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons). “Suparna and Purabi were remanded in police custody and the rest were sent to judicial custody for three days when they were produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate, Diamond Harbour,” said Sudip Chakraborty, a lawyer for the accused.Punam claimed that she had deposited the entire amount in the bank, which gave her a receipt against the deposit as there was a link failure.

---||Kolkata||‘AC users shouldn’t get power subsidy’||Kolkata: The subsidies in the power sector need to be targeted more, feels Union power secretary Aloke Kumar. Addressing 15th India Energy Summit, organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), he pointed out that mostly the subsidies are given to domestic consumers but those with air-conditioners (AC) and other appliances should not get that. Kumar also stressed the need for bringing down transmission and distribution losses from 20% to 15% highlighting both demand as well as supply side of energy. In order to become a developed country from a developing country, he believes, per capita energy consumption should be increased. “Every household needs to have access to clean, affordable and sustainable energy.” The Union power secretary highlighted three areas where phenomenal demand growth were to be expected: the first one being transportation. He spoke of the construction sector next as India is likely to urbanise very rapidly in the next two decades and will see large-scale construction. “Huge demand growth for building materials like steel, cement, and lighting is expected. The third area in energy growth is the possible shift from traditional biomass cooking to clean cooking. It is important to see that this growth in energy demand is managed well, and here comes the importance of energy efficiency,” he added. According to Kumar, a successful supply roadmap will depend on tech aid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ac-users-shouldnt-get-power-subsidy/articleshow/88820620.cms||---

Gariahat police station in the south, Parnasree in southern suburbs, Taltala and Burrabazar police stations in central Kolkata and Chitpur in the north have each confirmed receiving petty cases on the service. Bhowanipore and Gariahat police stations, where the upwardly mobile reside, received 14 and 11 complaints, respectively, most of them pertaining to loss of documents and mobile phones. Some were even ‘test’ messages with complainants trying to find out if it was safe to file their complaint in this manner. At Parnasree police station, the complaints were more serious. One was on a violation of a court order, another about a missing two-wheeler. They were directed to visit the police station and allocated time slot to draw up FIRs. Burrabazar Police, which is assigning a GD number immediately for future reference, said that in certain cases where signatures were required, the complainant was asked to visit the police station at the appointed hour. Taltala police station kept publicizing the facilities introduced in the police station area. “Any complaint, which is worth a general diary entry, is being recorded and the GD number is being sent to the WhatsApp user. This has substantially decreased the need to visit the police station,” said an officer. An officer at New Market police station said that while complainants needed to visit the police station to file the FIR, in case the complainant was unable to visit, cops can be sent to the complainant for verification. Lalbazar has provided each police station with a smartphone and a dedicated phone number to set up WhatsApp-enabled complaint facility. From Saturday, citizens are able to lodge complaints and GDs on WhatsApp account of the respective police station. They can also send audio messages as evidence or to lodge a GD. In addition, any photographs which will be used as evidence can also be forwarded on this number.

---||Kolkata||Realty registration clocks 3-fold increase in December after November lull||KOLKATA: Registration of apartment sale documents that had dipped in November 2021 bounced back in December, clocking a three-fold rise. In the January-December 2021 period, registration of residential sale deeds stood at 44,940, 64% more than the previous year when the figure was 27,328. While the 2020 figures were impacted by the pandemic-induced lockdown that saw no registration in April and just 176 deeds being registered in May, the real growth in 2021 happened in the second half of the year when sops announced by the state government came into play. Riding on the twin incentives: 2% reduction in stamp duty and 10% cut in circle rates, registration of sale deeds in July-December 2021 — at 24,941 — was 48% higher than 16,803 deeds registered in the corresponding period of 2020. Buoyed by the positive impact of the incentives on sales and registration, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) has called for extension of the revised inventive period citing the third wave. “The third wave and the tradition of Bengalis not making any big-ticket purchase during the month of Poush will impact registrations. We seek an extension of the relaxation till March 31, 2022,” Credai Bengal president Sushil Mohta said. In the 12-month period, there were only three months when registration figures in 2021 were lower than the corresponding month in 2020. In June 2021, it had dipped by 5%, in November by 62% and December by 10%. While the exaggerated November dip was owing to rush to get as many deeds registered by October 30, 2021. The state extended the incentive to January 31, 2022, “Around 56% of the registrations happened in July-December 2021 after the sops were declared. The registration had dipped dramatically in November 2021 because some people had thought the incentives were over. That recovered sharply in December 2021 with month-on-month growth at 248%,” said an analyst of real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank India. The home sale deed registration figures also clearly indicated a significant growth in larger homes and a sharp dip in purchase of smaller homes. Thus, sale of apartments in the 500-1,000 sqft category increased by 209% while apartments above 1,000 sqft recorded a 230% increase. A third of the sale deeds registered during the year was for properties in south Kolkata, followed by north Kolkata that comprised 31%. Rajarhat surprisingly recorded only 4% of the registration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/realty-registration-clocks-3-fold-increase-in-dec-after-nov-lull/articleshow/88820623.cms||Subhro Niyogi

They also warned market authorities, traders and their workers who were found not following the Covid safety guidelines, despite being instructed repeatedly by the administration. This is for the first time during the third wave of the pandemic that such a campaign was organised to enforce the Covid protocols like wearing masks and following other safety guidelines. The government has been asking traders and customers in markets to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to stem the spread of the virus. Several cops from Muchipara police station, along with the officer-in-charge reached Koley Market around 9am on Monday. They set up a wide enclosure and detained those who were without masks. “We had to penalise several people for flouting the Covid norms. Many shop owners, vendors and labourers were not wearing masks. People were found crowding unnecessarily,” said an officer. Cops also penalised people without masks in Posta, Burrabazar and Canning Street. The apex bodies of trade associations have been sending reminders to market authorities to implement all safety measures and prevent crowding in the markets. During the first and the second waves strict restrictions had meant losses worth several crores to the traders when markets were shut for several weeks. “We do not want those mistakes to repeated. Traders must ensure that they and their workers are fully vaccinated and take booster dose when eligible. This is for our own safety,” said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations, an apex body of trading bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-use-a-mix-of-gandhigiri-and-baton-to-enforce-cov-compliance/articleshow/88820625.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Around 50 students in Kolkata missed either the ICSE or ISC examination. Nearly nine centres like Dolna Day School and Saifee Golden Jubilee English Public School were identified for the reassessment test. The number of examinees at these venues was barely five to six. Board students from many schools like St Xavier’s Collegiate School, La Martiniere For Boys, Calcutta Boys, DPS Newtown and The Heritage School had missed the first semester exams. St Xavier’s Collegiate School principal M Thamacin Arulappan said a Class-X student of the school had taken the reassessment, which started from Monday. The Heritage School principal Seema Sapru, too, said that one student had appeared for the reassessment exam on Monday. DPS New Town had three Class-XII students at Monday's exam. None had missed the earlier exam due to Covid. One student had dengue, another had a surgery and the third one had missed the exam due to Chicken Pox. All of them were allowed for reassessment. There had been some uncertainty whether these examinations would be held in offline mode after the state decided to close schools, colleges and universities due to the third wave. But the CISCE decided to go ahead with the offline exams anyway.  A DPS Newtown Class-XII student Akshath Joshi said he was glad for not only getting the opportunity to sit at the exam but also meeting his classmates after a long time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/50-icse-isc-students-sit-for-offline-reassessment/articleshow/88820627.cms||---

The latest affidavit by Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) submitted before the NGT bench revealed of the six districts through which 320-km-long pipeline is to traverse to reach Kolkata from Haldia, the company has received permission to lay less than 1/10th of the pipeline. “Right of Usage has been obtained for only 31.5km of the 82.8km alignment through East Burdwan. The remaining districts — Hooghly (83.5 km), Howrah (58 km), East Midnapore (55.5 km), Nadia (17.6 km) and North 24 Parganas (22.5 km) — are yet to give any clearance,” the affidavit stated. The state government has sought re-routing of the pipeline because of land issues in the thickly populated North 24 Parganas district. The pipeline in this district is crucial for supplying gas to Kolkata by Bengal Gas Co Ltd (BGCL), a JV of GAIL and Greater Calcutta Gas Corporation. BGCL is currently supplying CNG in caskets but it is only a stop-gap arrangement. The pipeline is needed for uninterrupted supply. Meanwhile, WBTC has undertaken retrofitment of 300 buses with CNG kits. Subhas Datta, who had moved the NGT, expressed dismay at the status of CNG and wondered if he would at all be able to see the city’s ambient air cleaned up in his lifetime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/land-acquisition-roadblock-hits-cng-roll-out-in-state/articleshow/88820631.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||‘Leaky vax may have affected immunity’||Kolkata: A leading researcher on genetics and immunobiology fears India may have compromised the inherent strength of innate immunity in its population by administering ‘leaky’ vaccines that do not offer protection against all emerging variants of the novel coronavirus.“The vaccines would have been perfect had they provided sterilizing immunity by combating all variants of Covid-19, as in the case of measles. By adopting leaky vaccines, the vaccinated population’s ability to fight the virus with the innate immunity has been compromised and made it dependent on antibodies to do so. We have to now keep injecting antigen to maintain sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the constantly evolving virus,” said Sreedhar Chinnaswamy, associate professor at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. In a paper in American Journal of Human Biology, he commented on how the Delta variant emerged in India.In it, he said, the devastating Delta variant came from within the population in India due to the incomplete vaccination with an imperfect vaccine. The problem with leaky vaccines, he explained, was that one should vaccinate all or none. The vaccines offer protection against severe Covid disease. At the same time, due to their imperfections, they may facilitate evolution of new mutants that can put the unprotected hosts at risk. “In the race to develop the vaccine, we did not check one vital point: does the vaccine interfere with the virus evolution? I am convinced that it does,” he said. To buttress his argument, he cited three experts. Pennsylvania State University professor of biology and entomology Andrew Read, while working on chicken viruses, had warned in the early 2000s that non-sterilizing vaccines would lead to a more virulent disease. Read is the director of Huck Institute of the Life Sciences. Mathematical biologist Angela McLean found vaccinal immunity was inferior to natural immunity in terms of mediating variant escape. Kate Bingham of the UK vaccine task force knew even before vaccines came they might be imperfect.Chinnaswamy argued the rush to develop vaccines in India was due to a misplaced fear about the virus, driven by the emerging situation in the West. “The initial Wuhan strain of the virus had a nature to hide from host immunity. But Indians seemed to possess a stronger innate immunity that was capable of detecting the Wuhan strain better than that among Western hosts. The milder first wave in India is proof that innate immunity generated due to a constant exposure to pathogens, along with a heterogeneous mix of hosts that we find in India, protected its population. Since Westerners living in relatively sterile environments do not possess that innate immunity, there were so many deaths in their population during the first wave,” said Chinnaswamy, who researches on genetics of infectious diseases, told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/leaky-vax-may-have-affected-immunity/articleshow/88820632.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Over 5,000 booked in one week of night curb return||KOLKATA: More than 5,500 motorists and bikers have been prosecuted for flouting the deadline for commute, a week into night restrictions coming back and starting early at 10pm. Another 6,000-plus people were prosecuted during the day for various rule violations, including not wearing masks properly, spitting on the road and not following instructions from cops. Police said while the average night violation figure remained between 700 and 750 on weekdays and 750 and 800 on weekends, the daily mask violation number was around 500-550. Daily arrests and prosecutions stayed at 500. Around 140 people are being pulled up for spitting on the road every day. Cops said they created a zone-wise strategy. “At Burrabazar, we are creating separate zones, where we are holding back violators before taking them to police stations to pay fine. This is serving two purposes: one, they realize they are being singled out and secondly, they can’t mix with those following all norms,” said a Burrabazar officer. For night curb violations, the East traffic guard, comprising a part of Park Street and Park Circus, has been logging the highest prosecutions, sometimes penalizing over 200. East and Ultadanga traffic guards reported the most violations, together accounting for over half the cases. The South guard and headquarters guard, which serve the city centre, do throw up good numbers, but border area guards, especially Ultadanga, Tiljala, Garia and DH Road, log higher cases. . But many motorists said around Park Street, they were stopped by cops despite showing their office IDs and air tickets, proving the need to be on the road late. “I showed my ID card, saying I was an engineer with a discom. Yet, they noted down my mobile and car numbers. A woman showed her air ticket but was asked to give her number, too,” said Sayan Das from Selimpur. But a Lalbazar officer said, . “We are prosecuting only those from whom we are asking for driving licence or Aadhaar or voter ID cards. Merely noting down of numbers will not count.” Cops said they were given all sorts of excuses. “Many claim they are out on important errands but can’t give any evidence,” a cop said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/over-5k-booked-in-one-week-of-night-curb-return/articleshow/88820633.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Home-test under-reporting a worry, actual cases may be more: Doctors||KOLKATA: The surging Covid numbers being reported is just the tip of the iceberg, said doctors. With an increasing number of people — both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients — using the home-test kits and not sharing the data, doctors have expressed concerns regarding under reporting. “The number that we are currently seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. If we scale up testing using proper kits, we would see a much higher number. Though we have a fair idea about the magnitude of this wave, we do not have the clear numbers due to low reporting,” said Institute of Child Health associate professor Sumon Poddar. Times ViewIncomplete data can prove to be a setback for programmes to contain the virus's spread. Formulation of the right policy to fight a pandemic is heavily dependent on correct data. Covid patients are doing a disservice to themselves by not reporting home-test results.Doctors said the RATs (rapid antigen test), especially the ones used for home testing, are a major concern as most users are not uploading the data. Sources said that some private hospitals are also using RAT in emergency cases, but the data is not being uploaded.“While RAT can be a good strategy to ease the pressure off RT-PCR labs, it can be no substitute for the latter. But under-reporting of cases is not a good sign as far as making public health policy is concerned. However, given the current nature of the surge, it will be no wonder if policy-makers start making health strategies considering everyone to be positive,” said IPGMER hepatology head and public health activist Abhijit Chowdhury. TOI on January 7 reported how home testing kits are flying off the shelves at medical stores across the city. Currently, many are conducting the test using these kits as they want to avoid going to the lab or have samples collected from home. “Most home-testing kits have a QR code. Once the user scans it, the test gets registered. But since many are not following this, it is leading to under-reporting,” said Institute of Child Health associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri. The government, however, has scaled up the number of tests to over 70,000 a day. The portion of RT-PCR tests has also been increased significantly over the past few weeks. “A few weeks ago, RT-PCR tests and RAT were in the same ratio. With the number of testing labs going up, we are currently testing RT-PCR and RAT in the 7:3 ratio. We are also getting reports on a large number of home testing. But since we have no control over that, it is not possible to us to regulate,” said a senior health department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-home-test-under-reporting-a-worry-actual-cases-may-be-more/articleshow/88820634.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: OPD footfall dips sharply as Covid cases rise, hospitals plan to revive e-consultations||KOLKATA: With a massive surge in Covid cases, the OPD footfall in hospitals has dropped drastically. The decline in non-Covid patient numbers started about a week ago. By Monday, most hospitals saw a decline of 20% to 60% in OPD patient count. They apprehend the number to plunge further as the pandemic surge continues. “As far OPD is concerned, Monday is supposed to be the busiest day with the patient count usually higher. But this Monday, we had just 352 patients coming to our OPD. The gradual decline began around the last week of December and we started noticing a drastic downswing from January 3 onwards,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The hospital otherwise would have a footfall of about 600 patients a day. On an average, each unit of AMRI would get a daily footfall of 500 patients before the pandemic surge. Since the beginning of January, the three units are getting only about 100 OPD patients each per day. “There is a fall of about 30% in OPD patient count. It seems patients are wary about visiting hospitals due to the current Covid surge. In fact, in CMRI, we currently have 110 Covid patients, including 37 in the ICU, against 150 non-Covid patients,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO, CK Birla Hospitals. Like CMRI, many hospitals are planning to expand their digital consultant services so that patients who do not want to visit hospitals can get doctors online. “OPD attendance has dipped by 17%-20% over the last 10 days. We would normally get about 1,300 patients daily, on an average. But now, the footfall is on the downswing and could dip further,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east), Narayana Health. Hospitals said the Omicron surge has kept patients away from hospitals due to cluster infection in the healthcare worker community. Also, many consultants are currently in home isolation or hospital care after testing positive. These doctors cannot see patients physically till they complete their mandatory quarantine period. “We had started running our online consultation services during the second wave. But as the situation got better, patients started visiting hospitals. Now, we will scale up online consultations again to ensure the patient service continues,” said Mitra. Government hospitals have also witnessed about 30% dip in OPD attendance. Due to a number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers getting infected, some teaching medical colleges have restricted their patient-care services, including planned surgeries. “We have restricted our OPD services and the majority of those coming in are old patients,” said a source at Medical College Hospital, where over 200 healthcare workers have been infected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/opd-footfall-dips-sharply-as-cases-rise-hosps-plan-to-revive-e-consultations/articleshow/88820635.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||For hospitals, a day of positives: Some doctors recover, others get jabbed in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The first day first show of the booster dose rollout saw many healthcare workers (HCWs) taking the precaution jab on Monday. Senior doctors, nurses and other support staff led the lot of those who took the third dose mostly in hospitals where they are attached with. Health officials said that the response on Day One, however, was only lukewarm against the kind of clamour from the healthcare community for the booster jab. “The precautionary dose was rolled out on Monday and 35,081 persons took this dose,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director health services. “Despite many in the healthcare community getting the infection more than once I have managed to remain negative during the second wave as well this current wave. I am relieved that I took my third dose today. These doses should also work as a morale booster for HCWs on the face of the current infection,” said IPGMER ENT head Arunabha Sengupta. The professor of surgery had got severe infection during the first wave which had landed him in the ICU. Sengupta was among the senior doctors who took the booster jab at IPGMER on Monday. “The infection has never caught me even once during the entire pandemic. I hope this booster dose will help me in keeping the infection away in future too along with my sticking to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said Belle Vue CEO Pradip Tondon. While hospitals like Belle Vue where the jab for its HCWs is being sponsored by the hospital — 398 of them taking the booster shot on Monday — private hospitals that do not have policy for sponsoring the third jab saw an abysmally low HCWs taking the shot. “340 of our HCWs got the booster shot on the first day. We will be offering this precaution dose free of cost to all our healthcare workforce,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east) Narayana Health. In some private hospitals, the number of HCWs taking the booster dose ranged between 10 and 60 only. Despite a large number of HCWs on home isolation medical colleges saw a decent turnout on Monday. “About 352 of our HCWs that included very senior doctors took the third dose in our hospital CVC today. Hopefully the count will go up further,” said a doctor involved in the vaccination drive at IPGMER, the CVC at IPGMER is among the government sites that administered a high number of doses. Health officials said of the 35,000-plus booster doses administered on Monday, more than 70% would be on HCWs while the rest are on frontliners and the senior citizens. Officials said that they had opened limited slots on Monday to see how the Co-Win portal functions and hopes to increase the number of slots in the coming days. “We should be getting more people coming for the booster dose in about two to three days. We expect to dispense between 4 and 4.5 lakh booster doses by January-end,” said state family welfare officer Ashim das Malakar who was among the senior health officials who took the third dose on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/for-hosps-a-day-of-ves-some-docs-recover-others-get-jabbed/articleshow/88820636.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Mixed luck for seniors: Covid fear, lack of documents hit rollout in Kolkata||KOLKATA: At the end of Day 1 of the booster dose drive, 4,532 people received the jab in Kolkata. Statewide, the figure was 35,081 and an overwhelming majority of them were healthcare and frontline workers. The KMC-run CVCs across the city witnessed thin attendance of senior citizens on Monday due to various reasons. For instance, Raja Chatterjee, a retired government officer from Ballygunge Circular Road, queued up in front of a KMC Covid vaccination clinic (CVC) for the booster dose. Since Chatterjee suffers from diabetes and hypertension, he was asked to produce a doctor’s certificate in support of his claim. Having read in newspapers that no such evidence was required for senior citizens to get the booster dose, he made an attempt to argue his case, but had to return disappointed. While some had similar issues like Chatterjee, others did not step out of their homes fearing infection at a time when the virus is spreading like wildfire. Also, not many would have actually qualified for the dose on Monday. Last January-Febraury, when administering the first dose to healthcare workers and those with co-morbidities had started, there had been reluctance. Consequently, the second jab was delayed, and the nine-month gap required to qualify for the booster dose is not yet over for most. By 2pm, most vaccination clinics in south Kolkata had fewer than 10 senior citizens willing to take the booster dose. At a Bhowanipore clinic, the medical officer recorded the name of a solitary senior citizen who took the booster dose. This centre is known as one of the busiest clinics in the entire south. “The clinic in Bhowanipore had asked for prescriptions as proof of the senior citizens’ ailments. Since the seniors were not prepared with such documents, they had to go back without the jab,” said a KMC health department official. As the day progressed, a section of medical officers in charge of several KMC-run CVCs stopped demanding medical certificates from senior citizens who had assembled to get the shots. A medical officer in charge of a CVC in Tollygunge said at the end of the day, only seven senior citizens had been given the booster dose there. Similar scenes were witnessed at the KMC-run CVCs in large parts of north and central Kolkata. According to a KMC health department source, most senior citizens eligible for the booster dose didn’t step out of their houses fearing infection. “Our clinics located in the Kankurgachhi-Ultadanga belt, Beliaghata, Posta, College Street, Taltala and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road recorded low attendance. The case was similar in neighbourhoods of Bhowanipore, Alipore, Behala, Tollygunge, Lake Gardens, Jodhpur Park and Jadavpur in the southern parts of the city,” said a KMC health department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mixed-luck-for-seniors-cov-fear-lack-of-docus-hit-rollout/articleshow/88820637.cms||Saikat Ray

The KMC health department Covid combat team is particularly worried about some specific neighbourhoods in the north and central Kolkata where the spread of the virus couldn’t be contained despite imposing several restrictions. At least four of these wards have three to four existing containment zones but are yet to at least halt the spread, said an officer from the KMC health department. Sources said the present containment zones have been set up on figures accessed between December 30 and January 5. with several of these zones crossing the one-week threshold, “a reassessment is always on the cards”. KMC and police say Kankurgachi-Maniktala belt (Ward 31) is one such zone where the KMC-KP joint team is assigned to take care of the high-rises, apartment buildings and slums at the same time. There are six micro containment zones here and it is highly likely that these numbers might not see too big a reduction. The rapid spread of the virus from the high-rises of Park Street, Loudon Street and Shakespeare Sarani areas to residential buildings and housing complexes in Elgin Road, Sarat Bose Road, Ballygunge Circus Road and Palm Avenue has made the civic body’s Covid team jittery. “Ward 63 in Borough 7 and wards 69 and 87 in Borough 8 presently have four containment zones each. Each morning, we are preparing a list of houses that need sanitization,” said a police officer. Similarly, several areas under Borough 10 are considered to be traditional pockets of Covid. These areas include Deshapran Sashmal Road, Tollygunge Circular Road, New Alipore, Charuchandra Place, Anwar Shah Road, Lake Gardens, Golf Green and Bijoygarh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-lens-on-4-wards-new-c-zone-plan-for-kankurgachhi-park-street/articleshow/88820638.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The pharmacies in the city are worried now about a possible hoarding by people fearing a shortage in supply. “At the given pace, the demand for paracetamol may even cross what we had seen during the second wave. The next in the queue is azithromycin which is also much in demand,” said Sajal Ganguly, secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association (BCDA). Apart from medicines that are prescribed by doctors, over the counter products are flying off the shelves very fast. Paracetamol, providone-iodine-based oral gargle solution, multivitamins and vitamin-mineral supplements are witnessing huge sale. With the surge in Covid cases, the gargle solution has come to use during pandemic. While there is less evidence of antimicrobial benefits of gargling solutions, people have started using the gargling solutions on a regular basis. According to Arun Malas, secretary of East Kolkata District Committee of BCDA who runs Medicos Pharmacy in Salt Lake, the antiseptic and disinfectants used for gargling is also much in demand. “It may not be as much as the second wave, but people are asking for it. We have also seen a spike in demand for multivitamin-multi mineral and zinc supplements,” he said. A few days ago, Union Health Ministry had reached out to the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AICOD) and asked them to ensure availability of medicines that are needed for management of Covid-19. The list of drugs includes paracetamol tablets, azithromycin, vitamin C and zinc tablets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/paracetamol-multivitamins-and-anti-allergic-meds-fly-off-shelves/articleshow/88820639.cms||Rohit Khanna

The order regarding his reinstatement, issued by police headquarters, says his suspension order of January 7 ‘wasn’t issued by competent officials’, hence it stands cancelled. He has been told to join his department immediately. Rana was suspended on the orders of the AIG, co-operative fraud and public service guarantee. He is posted as a driver at police headquarters. The suspension order had mentioned that his hair was too long and his moustaches were in a ‘weird fashion over his neck’. “He was instructed to trim his hair and moustaches in the proper way to improve his turnout. The constable did not adhere to the instructions and was adamant on keeping his hair and moustaches the same way, which is indiscipline,” it said. On Sunday, constable Rana told mediapersons that he wouldn’t cut his moustache. “Senior officials said that I should get my moustache trimmed, but I cannot. I hail from a Rajput family, and moustaches are related to our self-respect. I will accept suspension but not remove my moustache,” he had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-cop-gets-to-keep-his-job-and-moustache/articleshow/88820671.cms||---

Forest officials say she was 40 years old. Gulabo was one of the star attractions at Van Vihar and seemed to enjoy the company of children. Mostly seen basking on a wooden plank in its open enclosure, Gulabo would shake itself awake on hearing kids squeal and saunter to the edge of the enclosure to give them a good view or fool around with twigs and sticks. According to foresters, Gulabo was rescued in May 2006 from a street performer who would whip her into walking a tight rope or ‘dance’ to drums. “It had injuries and scars, physical and mental, and carried the trauma for a long time. We put her through a gentle rehabilitation process,” said Van Vihar assistant director Ashok Kumar Jain. Van Vihar mourns Gulabo’s deathVets nursed Gulabo back to health and she became a crowd favourite at Van Vihar. Seeing her tackle a watermelon in the heat of summer was a laugh riot. She wasn’t keeping well for the past few months and was shifted to a care centre at the national park. Gulabo's death has left the entire Van Vihar staff in mourning, Jain said. “Gulabo was 40 years old, the oldest in the country. It died a natural death on Sunday night,” he added. An autopsy determined the cause of death as failure of internal organs due to old age. It was cremated after post-mortem.

In view of the increasing number of daily caseloads, the state government too is likely to take a decision to stop offline classes soon. Teachers said that the rise in new cases has left both parents and children scared. “Parents have refused to send their children to school, citing the regular rise in the cases. We are also unable to convince them as the situation is turning bad for everyone,” said a schoolteacher who prefers to remain anonymous. Another teacher said that the children are now familiarised with the online classes after two years of classes. “Online classes are the best available option for them in such a situation. They have been getting their academics for the past almost two years in the same format. In such a situation, it was expected that the children would go again for the online classes,” said another teacher without quoting her name. Parents have made it clear that even after the vaccination, the children will not be sent to the school. “My daughter is in class 11. She has been vaccinated but I am not going to send her at any cost. I can’t take any risk as the cases are rising and I think precaution is the only cure in such a situation,” said a parent, Nikhil Ahuja. Meanwhile, despite the rise in Covid cases in Madhya Pradesh the school education department is yet to decide about cancellation of offline classes. Sources said that the school education department wants to close the offline classes completely till class 8. However, a final decision is yet to be taken at the government level and the department has adopted the wait and watch policy. About the exams, the school education department is yet to decide on it. “As of now, the exams will be as per the schedule. However, it may change if the situation worsens,” said a senior official of the school education department without quoting his name.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/as-covid-cases-rise-students-switch-back-to-online-classes-govt-decision-likely-this-week/articleshow/88820674.cms||Ramendra Singh

Only with the permission of coaches, players below 18 years can participate in the training session. A senior official of the sports department said that the decision was a must in the wake of rising Covid cases. “The situation has suddenly changed after January 1. The number of cases has been increasing exponentially and, in this situation, there was no reason to keep the stadium open for unvaccinated people,” said the official without quoting his name. About the below 18 years of age players, the official said that it is also a part of the precaution. “We have given the option that players below 18 years can participate in the training if their coach allows. We do not want to disturb the training session of the players. However, their safety is also our priority and we will take every possible step in that direction,” added the official. The stadium has been completely closed for the general masses. In view of the Coronavirus scare, all sports activities at the stadium were also suspended last year also.

Though at most of the places, houses of infected persons are not being barricaded, SDM of Kolar area, which, perhaps, has the largest chunk of active Covid cases in the city said that he is barricading the houses, where more than one person is infected and 20 to 22 houses in his area have been barricaded. There are about 150 active Covid cases in the area. SDM, Kolar, Kshitiz Sharma, said that barricading of houses has practical problems but in houses where there are 2-3 active cases or all the family members are infected, barricading is being done. “If a person in the family is infected, he is taken care of by the rest of the family. They also make sure that he remains isolated but if all the members of the family are infected, it becomes difficult. So, we are barricading the houses where 2-3 or more persons are infected. We have 20 to 22 such houses in the area, which have been barricaded to restrict movement of the infected persons and not allow anyone from outside to go into the house", he said. He said earlier the containment zones used to be big. If infected persons are found in a house, the whole colony used to be barricaded and movement of all the people from the colony used to be restricted but now, the norms have changed and only the house of the affected persons is being barricaded. He said that the barricading would be there for 7 days and following that, if the person or persons infected in the family are found Corona negative, they would come out of isolation. SDM, Govindpura, Manoj Shrivastava, on the other hand, said that they are not barricading the houses of infected persons and the BMC is only putting a notice in the houses to warn the outsiders that a person or more in the house is infected. “We would have barricaded the house if there were 2-3 or more houses adjacent to each other that had infected persons but it's not the case till now. In an area of 20 Km, there are 10 infected persons. So, barricading is not required now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mini-containment-zones-are-back-most-are-in-covid-hotspot-kolar/articleshow/88820682.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Bhopal||A for anonymous: Kerwa Rd murder probe in search of a name||Bhopal: It’s ‘A’ for anonymous so far in Bhopal’s first murder of 2022. A middle-aged man found with his throat slit in a morning walkers’ paradise is still unidentified, three days into the investigation. The only clue to his identity is an ‘A’ tattooed on his right arm. The search radius has widened from a few kilometres from the crime scene near a culvert on Kerwa Dam Road in Ratibad to the city limits and then to neighbouring districts. But investigators are no closer to identifying him. Police teams are visiting bus stands, railway stations, hotels and lodges with photographs of the victim but to no avail. Patrol vehicles have made announcements in localities but no one has yet come forward to identify him. Police have even shared photos of the man on social media, but are yet to get a hit. “Once police identify him, the reason behind his murder will be known and the accused will be caught in no time,” an officer said. After 60 hours, neither is the victim known, nor the motive. Here’s what we know so far. The victim seems to be 40-45 years old. Robbery was perhaps not the motive as a Rs 50 note lay near his body. His trouser pockets had been turned inside out, indicating that whoever killed him took away everything that could identify the victim but wasn’t interested in the money. The victim wore a red-and-black checked woollen shirt under which he had a blue sweater. He wore two-tone trousers and sandals, a ‘Kalawa’ on his right wrist and another around his waist. Capital 'A' was tattooed on his right arm. A black face mask (for Covid) lay near his body, next to which fluttered a 50-rupee note in the winter breeze. Empty liquor bottles, water pouches and snacks were scattered around, suggesting a few drinks and a skirmish. There were clear signs of a violent struggle. The victim’s sandals lay some distance away. His throat had been slit almost ear to ear. The cut was so deep that police suspect a heavy weapon was used. Going by the way he was killed and signs of a struggle, police are sure there were multiple attackers. All that’s missing in tying up these pieces of evidence is a name. “Police teams are working around the clock to identify him. We have received many leads but they all ended at dead ends. There is nothing that could help in ascertaining his identity except for the ‘A’ tattooed on his arm,” said additional DCP Ankit Jaiswal. Police teams are visiting rain baseras, bus stands, platforms, lodges and other places and showing photographs of the victim to people in the hope that someone would recognise him, Jaiswal said. Separate teams of Ratibad police and crime branch are working the case. They are checking with missing person cases registered in neighbouring Raisen, Vidisha and Sehore districts. Police have now published posters of the victim and pasted them at railway stations, bus stands and autorickshaw stands. “It seems he was not a resident of Bhopal. He may have come here to visit a relative. Police are screening missing person complaints filed in Bhopal and surrounding districts,” Jaiswal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/a-for-anonymous-kerwa-rd-murder-probe-in-search-of-a-name/articleshow/88820683.cms||Sudeept Mishra

After the bench comprising chief justice Ravi Vijay Malimath and Justice Anjuli Palo said that the report amounts to contempt of court, counsel for the state government sought permission of the court to withdraw the report, which the court allowed while deferring hearing in the case to January 24. The high court had ordered for implementation of the Shetty Commission recommendations on the salary of court staff.In a petition filed by a group of MP high court employees in 2017, the court had ordered the state government to implement the Shetty Commission recommendation on the pay scales of judicial staff. The state government went to the Supreme Court against the order but its petition was dismissed by the apex court. When the report was not implemented even then, the petitioners moved a contempt petition in the high court against the state government.Despite being given time on several occasions, the Shetty Commission recommendations were not implemented for the court staff.In the previous hearing, the court had asked the chief secretary to present a compliance report in the case. In the compliance report presented in the court on Monday, the court was told that a proposal to give Shetty Commission pay scales to high court staff was presented before the state cabinet but the cabinet didn't accept the proposal on the ground that if they were given higher pay scales, it would be unjust for staff of other departments. They would also start demanding higher pay scales.After going through the compliance report, the court found that what it implies amounts to contempt of court. If a court has passed an order, it must be complied with, said the court. Following this, the advocate general requested the court to allow him withdraw the compliance report. Senior counsel Naman Nagrath appeared in the case for the petitioners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/govt-withdraws-compliance-report-on-court-staff-pay/articleshow/88820685.cms||---

Former chief minister and LOP Kamal Nath on Monday demanded that panchayat elections be held in the state with rotation, delimitation and 27% reservation for OBCs within two months. Failing this, the state Congress will protest in the villages, districts and blocks.“Panchayat elections are not their (BJP’s) hobby. It is our Constitutional right, the law was passed during the tenure of former PM Rajiv Gandhi,”Nath said. Speaking to reporters, here on Monday, Kamal Nath replied to the BJP’s allegation that panchayat polls in the state have been jeopardised by Congress and its petition filed in the high court and Supreme Court. “It is very easy to level allegations,” he defended and said, “It was the government that did not want to conduct panchayat elections. The Ordinance brought by them was totally unconstitutional. How can you have elections without reservations, without rotation and delimitation?” In November, the state cabinet approved an Ordinance that revoked the erstwhile Kamal Nath government’s delimitation and rotation status of 2019. The panchayat elections were to be conducted under the reservation rotation and delimitation of 2014 which the Congress argued was unconstitutional. The provisions are that rotation of reservation and delimitation is to be conducted every five years, Congress said. “When the matter of reservations came up in court, then the government and the Election Commission’s lawyers were present. But they remained silent,” Kamal Nath alleged that neither the government’s lawyer not the EC lawyer argued against the Supreme Court’s stay on OBC reservations. “This was a black Ordinance and a Black Bill. I demand that panchayat elections be held in the state with rotation, delimitation and reservations. If panchayat elections are not held, we will protest in the villages, in the districts and the blocks. Because panchayat elections are not for their hobby. It is our Constitutional right; law was passed during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure,” he argued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-to-protest-if-panchayat-polls-not-held-in-2-months/articleshow/88820692.cms||Suchandana Gupta

As Kamal Nath on Monday threatened protest throughout the state if the government failed to conduct panchayat elections within two months, chief minister Chouhan addressed the BJP OBC Morcha at his official residence in Shyamla Hills, a stone’s throw away from Kamal Nath’s residence. The BJP OBC Morcha on Monday felicitated the chief minister and state party president VD Sharma. All BJP ministers, MLAs, MPs belonging to the OBC category were present during the function. Addressing the gathering, chief minister said that his government’s intention is the welfare of all sections of people in the state including the OBCs. “The government will tackle all hindrances and work for the development of the people. While giving representation to the OBCs, the government will work for their benefit and their rights,” he said. He specified that after taking necessary legal provisions, reservations will be given in the local bodies and implemented in the other welfare programmes also. VD Sharma claimed that the state government led by Chouhan is giving adequate representation to OBCs while also benefiting the community through various welfare schemes. Even for the welfare of tribals, the Madhya Pradesh government’s contribution has been acknowledged nationally. Sharma alleged that Congress pretends to be patrons of OBCs but when reservation issue was discussed in the HC and SC, the party’s erstwhile Kamal Nath government did not even send a lawyer to argue the case. “Congress has done injustice to OBCs in the panchayat elections. It hahas vitiated the atmosphere in Madhya Pradesh. Panchayat elections are important for strengthening of democracy. But Congress has calculatedly disrupted the panchayat polls in the state,” Sharma said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-doing-injustice-to-obcs-says-chouhan/articleshow/88820693.cms||---

A Covid-19 review meeting here on Monday, chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, instead limited the number of people attending all functions to 50. Education minister V Sivankutty was also invited to the meeting, raising speculations that the government would decide going back to online classes. However, the meeting concluded that the situation has not come to shut schools and decided to continue with offline classes. The next review meeting will analyse the situation and decide on functioning of schools. Offices should consider operating with work-from-home option wherever possible, the meeting observed. The government had, last week, directed restricting the number of people at marriages, funerals, political, social and cultural events in closed rooms to 75 and in open spaces to 150. In the latest decision, it has been further reduced to 50 for both closed rooms and open spaces. The meeting also noted that reunions, ceremonies and general social, political, cultural and community events should be conducted online as far as possible. Experts had pointed out that the latest surge in Covid cases is signalling a third wave and demanded restrictions in mass gatherings. They also raised concerns that the new variant Omicron might lead to a community spread as those coming from badly affected states are not being screened here.

The CII stated that industries have been witnessing a momentum in the markets with a surge in demands across different sectors. The proactive measures taken up by the government has helped industries to bounce back and contribute to the state’s economic growth. “With the Covid caseload rising across the state and with the emergence of Omicron variant, CII has requested the government to apply learnings from the first and second phases of the pandemic and maintaining a fair balance between lives and livelihoods,’’ said Sreenath Vishnu, chairman, CII Kerala. Instead of resorting to lockdowns which will hamper the revival of the economy, steps should be taken to provide booster doses in a formalised way as fast as possible. Restriction on gatherings should be continued and Covid protocol measures and behaviours should be monitored and made compulsory, he added. Due to job losses and fall in business volumes, and rising medical costs, most people’s incomes have been squeezed. Though business activities have shown steady a revival for the last few months, any extreme measures at this juncture will have a serious impact on their livelihood and survival, said Thomas John Muthoot, former chairman of CII Kerala. A majority of small businesses have availed of finances to tide over the challenges posed by lockdown restrictions and they cannot afford another shutdown. Any such measure without proper planning, will impair their business prospects and their ability to repay their loans, which all will put them in a huge debt trap, which in turn will be detrimental to the economy, he added. “The point is not to panic but to make considered, evidence-based decisions. We need prompt testing and isolation, quick contact tracing, and prevention of large gatherings, along with strict imposition of wearing masks,’’ he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/lockdown-will-hamper-revival-cii-to-cm/articleshow/88820695.cms||---

Regulators across the globe have come up with various definitions of cryptocurrencies. But there is no consensus, even among major economies, on how to treat decentralised virtual currencies, which are seen posing a risk to financial stability and impacting cross-border transactions. Policy advisers and legal experts say most countries are unable to formulate a policy on virtual currencies as there are no precedents apart from bans, which have been largely ineffective. Crypto’s growing popularity has caught lawmakers’ attention as it could undermine state oversight over monetary policy, capital flows, and illicit activity if left unchecked. While only one country — El Salvador — has recognised bitcoin as legal tender, nine others, including China, have completely banned crypto. Forty-two countries like Bangladesh have banned it ‘implicitly’, which means banks are prohibited from dealing in crypto directly or indirectly and crypto exchanges are barred too, according to a Law Library of (US) Congress report published in November last year. “Lack of consensus on crypto regulation is mainly due to the ambiguity on whether to treat crypto as a ‘currency’ or an ‘asset’. Most people are using it as a speculative investment,” said Probal Bhaduri, managing partner at Lumiere Law Partners. He added that lawmakers globally are also having difficulties in understanding the technical aspects of crypto. “Classifying crypto as a commodity can tackle market and compliance risks, but not illicit activities, financial stability, systemic and capital flight risks,” said a report by Policy 4.0, a think tank founded by blockchain expert Tanvi Ratna. In the US, some states view crypto favourably, but there is no federal regulation. For taxation, crypto has been classified as ‘property’ since 2014. Derivatives regulator CFTC has said crypto is a ‘commodity’, while markets watchdog SEC has not made any definitive statements on treatment of crypto. The Indian government is yet to firm up its view, given that all wings are not in sync on the issue — something that led to the introduction of the proposed legislation being postponed until at least the next Parliament session. The RBI has called for a complete ban on crypto as it said partial restrictions won’t work. Sebi chief Ajay Tyagi has asked mutual fund companies not to invest in crypto-related assets until the government comes out with a policy. The Policy 4.0 report said that “making laws on paper and expecting full compliance is infeasible for a technology that makes it easy to bypass controls”. The report cited examples of South Korea and China, where tough regulation and ban, respectively, have not been fully effective. “As enforcement of bans is both difficult and impractical, countries should look to establish robust regulatory frameworks on cryptocurrency and educate investors on the risk,” said Nitin Sharma, principal associate at Lumiere Law Partners. According to him, low investor maturity & susceptibility to fraud and concerns related to terror financing & money laundering will be among key factors while dealing with crypto. International Organisations like IMF and WEF have noted that though crypto can help make cross-border payments efficient and improve financial inclusion, — also a reason for its popularity in emerging economies — its operational and systemic risks means that regulation needs to be on the global agenda. An IMF report in October had said that even bank deposits and lending face a threat from crypto. A WEF report in September listed four ways in which countries can deal with crypto: ‘Wait & see’ like Brazil, a balanced approach like Singapore and the EU, comprehensive regulation like Switzerland and Japan, and restrictive methods like Turkey and Nigeria.

The regulator has also asked insurers to review the claims denied or deductions made in all such situations and take appropriate action to settle them according to the terms of the policy. The circular to the chiefs of all non-life and health insurance companies has come following complaints that many insurers are rejecting claims for treatment in the third wave where the hospitals have used expensive new antiviral drugs. “Authority has come across instances of denial of claims and/or deduction of expenses incurred towards ‘antibody cocktail therapy’ treatment for Covid, under the pretext that the said therapy is an experimental treatment,” the Irdai said in its communication. The regulator pointed out that the antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) has been given emergency use authorisation in May 2021 by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation in India. All health insurance policies have a clause that excludes experimental treatments. The objective is to ensure that money is spent on proven or established techniques. This clause has been used by insurers in the past to exclude robotic surgeries and new treatments like stem cell. Drugmakers in India had launched the antibody cocktail in May 2021 at Rs 59,750 for each patient dose of 1,200mg (600mg of Casirivimab and 600mg of Imdevimab). Last week, Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told The Economic Times that most of the patients admitted to private hospitals have mild Covid symptoms and are taking Molnupiravir drug treatments. “They are getting admitted to hospitals for a day or two and getting discharged. We asked hospitals to get these people treated at outpatient departments. The private hospitals have told us that the health insurance companies have a rule that only patients admitted for at least a day can be considered for releasing insurance payments,” Chahal said. He added that BMC would be taking this up with insurance companies. Speaking to TOI, an insurance official said that according to their in-house medical team, there has been an abuse of insurance by some healthcare providers who have prescribed the antibody cocktail for non-severe cases. According to them, an increase in the claims’ payout would eventually add to the cost of health insurance. According to insurers, health insurance policies do not cover domiciliary treatment as they cannot ascertain the actual cost of treatment as pharmacies are liberal in issuing medical bills for general provisions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insurers-cant-reject-cocktail-covid-therapy/articleshow/88818703.cms||Mayur Shetty

The cost of borrowing for the government, as reflected in the yield on 10-year bonds, rose to more than the home loan rates offered by most banks to a two-year high of 6.59%. While Union Bank of India’s loans start at 6.4%, Bank of Baroda is offering them at 6.5%. Bond prices have an inverse relationship with yields, so one falls even as the other rises. In equities, the markets opened strong, tracking Asian stocks and closed higher on expectations that there would be a pro-growth Budget. The Nifty, too, scaled 18,000 to close 1.1% higher at 18,003. However, analysts forecast volatility as the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly. The rupee rallied to a two-month high bolstered by inflows. The domestic currency closed stronger at 74.04, up from Friday’s close of 74.31 against the dollar — the highest since November 9. A record fund-raise by Reliance Industries and other capital inflows are expected to keep the dollar under check. Bond markets, however, saw a selloff. The 6.59% yield on the 10-year bond is the highest since January 31, 2020. The benchmark 10-year bond had closed at 6.54% on Friday. Sentiment in the bond market has changed after the RBI became a net seller of bonds — a move seen aimed at supporting measures to normalise the excess liquidity pumped in to help markets during the pandemic. Bond yields rose ahead of December inflation numbers, which are expected on Wednesday. Dealers also have a negative outlook on inflation with global oil prices firming up over concerns of supply constraints because of geopolitical tension in Libya and Kazakhstan. Additionally, bond yields rose because of a surge in US yields. A drop in unemployment in the US is expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates earlier than expected. In the domestic market, the sensex opened sharply stronger at 60,070 and surged to a high of 60,427 in intra-day trade. Bank stocks were among the key gainers. During the day, there were rumours that the government might hike foreign investment limit in public sector banks to 74%. Among lenders, SBI gained the most (2.5%) on anticipation of better Q3 results. HDFC (2.4%), Kotak Bank (2.3%), ICICI Bank (2.2%) and Axis Bank (1.7%) were the other significant gainers. However, the gaining rupee also took its toll on some stocks. Wipro slumped 2.5% and was the biggest loser among the sensex stocks. Other losers in the index were Nestle India (-1.1%) and Asian Paints (0.6%). Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s and IndusInd Bank also closed in the red.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bond-yields-at-pre-covid-high-beat-home-loan-rates/articleshow/88818781.cms||---

Gross merchandise value for the company more than doubled to Rs 2.5 lakh crore in the quarter under review from Rs 1.1 lakh a year ago. The figures were announced on Monday evening, after the company’s shares hit a new low of Rs 1,151 before closing at Rs 1,158. At the current price, the company’s market capitalisation is Rs 75,064 crore (about $10 billion) compared to the IPO valuation of nearly Rs 1.4 lakh crore. The shares fell after Macquarie cut its target price for the company to Rs 900, citing challenges for revenue. “RBI’s proposed digital payments regulations could cap e-wallet charges. Payments business still forms 70% of overall gross revenues for Paytm and hence any regulations capping charges could impact revenues significantly,” Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie said in a note. In a stock exchange filing, the payment company said that it disbursed 44 lakh loans worth Rs 2,180 crore in the October-December 2021 quarter. As against this, the company had disbursed 8.8 lakh loans for Rs 470 crore in Q3FY21. In the preceding quarter ended September 2021, the company had disbursed 28.4 lakh loans for Rs 1,260 crore. “Our monthly transacting users (MTUs) showed consistent growth in FY21 and in the first two quarters of FY22. The trajectory has continued in the third quarter of FY22 with 64.4 million average MTUs — growth of 37% Y-o-Y over the 47.1 million average MTUs in Q3FY21,” the company said in an exchange filing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-grows-in-dec-qtr-but-stock-tumbles/articleshow/88818656.cms||---
---||Business||Binani scion moves HC over SFIO’s summons relating to ‘movement of funds’||MUMBAI: Shradha Binani, daughter of Brij Binani of Binani Cements (BCL), has moved the Bombay high court to challenge summons issued to her by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). The HC bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar gave her time on Monday to file a rejoinder to the SFIO affidavit, which alleged that its probe “revealed about movement of huge funds since year 2010, to (her) personal bank account from related companies of BCL”. Senior counsel Harish Salve and Janak Dwarkadas submitted that the affidavit was making “brazenly false” statements. “Someone has to take responsibility for making such statements…the reply makes sweeping allegations,” said Salve. He added that the government has “formed opinion made on an opinion which did not relate when the young lady was associated with the company”. He said “something would have to be done about this kind of tactic (of the government)”. Salve said that he wanted an order from the HC to direct SFIO to produce details to back its claim. The HC bench, not inclined to pass any such order, said she would know what goes in and out from her account. Salve then said, “This is something very, very serious. I would like to file a one-page rejoinder.” This the HC permitted and posted the matter for further hearing to January 31. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the SFIO said, “Let him file a rejoinder. What details of investigations are, cannot be shared with her at this juncture.” Shradha was non-executive director for two years between April 2012 and April 2014 at the company. In 2017, there was a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) against BCL. In 2018, all creditors were paid off and the company exited the process. A resolution professional — or RP, who is a person appointed to ensure the company gets solvent again — had obtained an expert opinion, based on which he filed an ‘avoidance application’ under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for the period of 2015-2017. The opinion, said Shradha’s lawyers, contained no mention of her or that any money was diverted to her. Her case is that, suddenly in May and June 2020, much after the CIRP was complete and the RP had no longer any role to play, the Centre launched an investigation through SFIO into the affairs of the company and later issued her two summons on July 30 and September 27, 2021 to personally appear before it and to also provide certain bank-related documents. In its reply, the SFIO said Shradha has been “deliberately avoiding presence” and also “tried to leave India” during the ongoing investigation in August 2021. The SFIO said she received funds in her personal account from certain other entities to which funds were transferred from BCL directly or indirectly. Shradha’s petition for quashing of the summons was on the grounds that since the CIRP was successfully complete, BCL is immune from any prosecution for any offence alleged to have been committed prior to the resolution process. The summons are beyond the powers of the SFIO under the Companies Act and also violative of her fundamental rights under Articles 14 (equality) 19 (1) (g) (freedom of trade and profession), 20 (3) (self incrimination) and right to life and liberty under Article 21.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/binani-scion-moves-hc-over-sfios-summons-relating-to-movement-of-funds/articleshow/88818687.cms||Swati Deshpande

It is set to reboot production operations on January 12 at the plant. Though operations would resume in a staggered manner starting Wednesday, the return to normal scale of production “will be in phases and likely take several months to stabilize,” sources told TOI. Foxconn has also made changes in the local management team here at India and Chennai, they added. Foxconn had earlier admitted to lapses in living conditions at its Sriperumbudur facility, which employs around 17,000 people. Over 200 employees had taken seriously ill in December due to a bout of food poisoning. The company had then said in a statement that it was also ‘restructuring its local management team.’ Last week, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, in his address in the state assembly, said Foxconn would resume its production activities at its plant near Chennai on January 12 with around 500 workers across two hostel premises. Tech giant Apple, whose flagship smartphone model the iPhone 12 is made at the facility, has placed the Taiwanese electronics maker’s Sriperumbudur plant on probation, and said it is continuing to monitor the facilities closely to ensure it meets standards. “For the past several weeks, teams from Apple, along with independent auditors, have been working with Foxconn to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions is implemented in the offsite accommodations and dining rooms in Sriperumbudur. Workers will start to return gradually as soon as we are certain our standards are being met in every dormitory and dining area,” an Apple spokesperson told TOI on Monday. Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) said they “have been working on a series of improvements to fix issues found at the offsite dormitory facilities in Sriperumbudur" to enhance the services provided to employees. “We have implemented a range of corrective actions to ensure this cannot happen again and a rigorous monitoring system to ensure workers can raise any concerns they may have, including anonymously,”' a statement from Foxconn on Monday said. “We will gradually begin to welcome back team members as each offsite dormitory becomes ready and is approved. We continue to support our employees and thank them for their patience as we work through the improvements,” it added. Foxconn’s employees will continue to be paid till necessary improvements are made to its facility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/foxconn-set-to-start-operations-from-wed-with-about-100-staff/articleshow/88818314.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Thirteen of the accused, including Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish Mishra, were brought from the jail where they are lodged and produced before the judge. Ajay Mishra's brother-in-law Virendra Shukla, who has been charged under Section 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, was granted bail after he surrendered before the court. TURNS HERE He was accused of hiding the third SUV in Ashish's convoy that allegedly ran over five persons -- four farmers and a journalist -- who were at that time protesting against the now rolled-back farm laws. The case was later in the day sent to the district and sessions court where the next hearing will be on January 20. "This is procedural and is followed in every criminal case after the chargesheet is filed and the charges framed," senior prosecution officer (SPO) S P Yadav told TOI. A special investigation team (SIT) had filed a 5,000-page chargesheet against all the accused on January 3 in relation to the violence that took place on October 3 last year. Four farmers and a journalist were allegedly mowed down by Ashish’s convoy. Three BJP supporters were killed in a retaliatory attack by enraged farmers. The minister's son is the main accused in the case. “After Shukla's bail, two counsels, Ramashish Mishra and Chandran Singh, appeared on behalf of 12 of the accused and were provided with a copy of the chargesheet by the court. All the accused made an appearance through video conferencing at 4 pm. By then, the court had completed procedures to commit the file to the district and sessions court, where the case is expected to go for further trial from the next date of hearing,” the SPO said. Ashish's counsel Awadhesh Singh had already received a copy of the chargesheet earlier. An FIR was initially registered under Sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (offence committed in prosecution of common object), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly), 304A (causing death by negligence) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. On December 14, the SIT called the incident “a premeditated one and not an act of negligence” in court. The court later dropped sections pertaining to "accidents" from the FIR and included Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death), and 34 (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC, along with sections 3 (25), 5 (27) and 30 of the Arms Act.

The minister called upon all eligible beneficiaries deployed on the front-lines of the battle against the pandemic, and all senior citizens to receive the precautionary jab. “The government has already made all the necessary arrangements to administer the booster dose to all the eligible beneficiaries. The drive will help reduce the impact of the third wave of Covid-19. There is no need for the people to panic, and worry about the spread of Covid-19,” said Angara. The district administration in Dakshina Kannada has set itself a target to administer booster dose to3,37,447 people, of whom 52,523 are healthcare workers, while 15,924 are other front-line workers, while 2,69,000 are senior citizens.

The district administration, in association with the Indian Red Cross Society’s (IRCS) district branch and District Working Journalists’ Association (DWJA), launched the campaign called Mask Dharisi, Sariyagi Dharisi. Angara, who is the minister of fisheries, ports and inland transport, said that it was important to wear the mask properly to fight Covid-19. “The government has imposed night curfew and weekend curfew keeping in mind the health of people. The cooperation of people is the most important in preventing Covid-19 from spreading. Everyone should wear masks and they should ensure that they wear it properly,” he said. Deputy commissioner Dr K V Rajendra said there was need to create awareness among people on wearing masks properly. “The mask should be worn in a proper way so that the nose and mouth are covered. There is no advantage in wearing a mask below the nose or around the neck. Similarly, distancing and using sanitisers are important to prevent the spread of the virus. We can win this war against Covid-19 if we wear our masks properly. Do not get out of your home without wearing a mask and avoid touching the mask unnecessarily. Despite several measures, people are seen violating Covid-19 guidelines by holding events. Another lockdown can be avoided if people follow the government’s guidelines regarding distancing, masks and vaccination. Everyone should undergo tests for Covid-19 if they have disease symptoms and they should remain in quarantine,” Rajendra said. DWJA president Shrinivas Indaje, Indian Red Cross Society Dakshina Kannada branch honorary secretary Prabhakar Sharma and chairman Shantharam Shetty were present.

---||Goa||Catholic association calls for security for feast of St Vaz at Sancoale||Panaji: The Catholic Association of Goa (CAG) on Monday appealed to the chief secretary, director general of police, chief electoral officer, South Goa collector and other authorities for increased security at Sancoale and for action against individuals and groups for “trying to sow discord and disharmony among religious communities” in the village. “As the feast of St Joseph Vaz is fast approaching, we fear that some right-wing outfits may create mischief,” president of the association Emidio Pinho said. “Moreover, Goa being in the din of assembly elections these days, there is also a high possibility of vested political interests fomenting these flames for political mileage and polarisation,” Pinho said. He added that social media is abuzz with video clips of individuals belonging to right-wing groups threatening to disrupt the celebration of the feast to be held on January 16. The association had stated that some agenda-driven individuals, misled and instigated by one individual having a civil dispute with the church, had approached the high court of Bombay at Goa with the same claims last year and the matter was disposed off by the court with no relief granted as sought by the petitioners. “The failure of these individuals before the court, it appears, has made them use other devious means to achieve their ulterior goals. Communal disharmony should not be allowed to be festered in Goa on frivolous pretexts on any count. The law enforcement authorities must, therefore, come down heavily on such elements that create enmity and conflict amongst the people and communities without any fear or favour,” the association said calling for precautionary steps to be taken to ensure peace and security during the novenas and the feast of St Joseph Vaz.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/catholic-association-calls-for-security-for-feast-of-st-vaz-at-sancoale/articleshow/88819850.cms||TNN

This resulted in the year 2021 recording a higher inflow in every successive month. Monthly SIP contribution for December 2021 hit a historic high of Rs 11,305 crore with net assets under management (AUM) of MFs ending the year at Rs 37,72,696 crore — a notch above Rs 37,33,702 crore as of November. According to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), the number of SIP accounts for December was 4.9 crore, up from 4.78 crore in November. This shows a month-on-month change of 12.5 lakh. SIP AUM as of the end of December was Rs 5.65 lakh crore, higher than Rs 5.46 lakh crore in November. According to Amfi’s December data released on Monday, the net flow for all the four categories of open-ended schemes — growth/equity, hybrid, solution-oriented and others (index schemes, ETFs, fund of funds) — reported positive flows during the month. The exceptions were income/debt oriented schemes, which saw some outflow. Even within the closed-ended category, for the first time this fiscal, the income-oriented schemes led by fixed-term plans have shown positive flows of Rs 180 crore compared to nearly Rs 7 crore in November. “The year 2021 has been a momentous year, with mutual funds emerging as the preferred investment destination with continued record equity flows through NFOs (new fund offers) and ongoing investment into existing schemes. The year has seen remarkable growth in mutual funds with a hike in inflows across all categories of funds,” said Amfi chief executive N S Venkatesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-rs-37-7l-cr-mfs-end-2021-at-record-high/articleshow/88818795.cms||---

The special investigation team said that the chargesheet will be filed in connection with the first case in which around 85grams of MDMA was seized from the accused persons on August 18. However, the investigation into the case registered in connection with the seizure of 1kg of MDMA from the same accused persons on August 19 is still progressing. Around 24 accused persons, who were arrested in connection with the two cases, are currently in judicial custody. Excise CB sources said that as the second case involves a huge quantity of MDMA, worth Rs13 crore, more details need to be collected before submitting the chargesheet. However, the investigation team has not yet been able to get clear leads about the suppliers of the contraband, believed to be smuggled in from Chennai. “We have arrested almost all persons connected with the case, including those who made financial deals with the main accused for purchasing drugs. The chargesheet in the first case will be submitted by the month end. We need some more evidence in connection with the second case and a probe is underway,” said an officer. Initially, the excise arrested Sreemon, Mohammad Favas and Shamna of Kozhikode, Aju alias Amal of Kasaragod and Mohammad Afsal of Ernakulam from the apartment. Later, two more persons, including a woman, were arrested. The contraband was hidden in a waste bin where three dogs owned by the accused were tied in the apartment. The modus operandi of the gang was to travel as family with ladies along with furious dog breeds like Rottweiler and Doberman to evade inspection by law enforcement agencies at checkpoints.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/excise-cb-to-file-chargesheet-by-month-end/articleshow/88819140.cms||TNN

But he always evaded the question. The pandemic however proved to be a turning point when work from home forced the couple to stay together the whole day. Frequent squabbles eventually confirmed her feelings, and she sought women helpline’s intervention to address the issue. The year 2021 was the worst for Gujarat in terms of pandemic with a very high number of Covid cases and deaths – but it was also a testing year for the women. The annual data of Abhayam 181 women helpline indicated 22% spike in the van dispatches and 21% rise in the counseling calls than to 2020. “The rise was recorded across the categories – domestic violence, which accounts for 48% of the total call volume, recorded a 32% rise compared to 2019, which was a non-pandemic year. Likewise, calls related to the extramarital affairs increased by 59%, Legal counseling increased by 73% and harassment complaints by 66%,” said a senior Abhayam helpline official. Falguni Patel, the helpline coordinator for Ahmedabad, said that compared to the earlier years, the 2020 and 2021 were different due to the added layer of the pandemic. “In majority of the cases, the women were not okay with their surroundings, but the pandemic caused despair and they decided that they would not want to continue suffering in silence,” she said, adding that in a significant number of cases, the women chose to stay at government facilities instead of going back to their parents’ home. Mini Josef, ACP (women) of Ahmedabad city police, said that the issues they witnessed in the pandemic years were cutting across socio-economic strata.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Mute swan in Jamnagar creates a rare spotting flutter||AHMEDABAD: The presence of a solitary mute swan (cygnus olor) in Jamnagar has created a flutter among birdwatchers as they flock to catch a glimpse of this rare bird that has not been previously spotted in the wild for almost a century now, according to experts. The majestic bird, which gets its name ‘mute’ as it is less vocal than other species of swans, was spotted by three birdwatchers Yashodhan Bhatia, Ashish Pankhania and Ankur Gohil on Sunday at Dhinchada lake that falls within the city limits of Jamnagar and is closer to Bedi port. “If this is a wild bird then possibly this is a first recorded sighting of the bird in India. But I think this is an escapee from a zoo or an aviary,” said Suresh Kumar, a senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India (WII) who is involved in a number of projects on migratory birds. Commonly found in the US, the UK and other countries with colder climates, experts are not ruling out the possibility that the bird could have escaped from an aviary or a zoo for they are not known to be long distance migrants. State a haven for migratory birdsBut there are records that show that the bird has been spotted in the past during winters. The latest sighting comes at a time when the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a cold wave warning for North Gujarat districts, including Banaskantha, Patan, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad. “Salim Ali and S Dillion Ripley mentioned sighting a Mute Swan near Pune Solapur roadway way back in 1922 in their 10-volume work on birds of Indian sub-continent. Prior to that, there are two records of sightings of this bird from Kashmir in 1897 and 1899. It has also been spotted at least 15 times (Baker 1929) in Pakistan during cold winters (e.g.,1878,1900, 1910, 1911),” said Parasharya, an ornithologist working with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) .Considering the sighting by Ali & Ripley of 1922, in Maharashtra, this is almost after100 years. In May last year, an Amur falcon, satellite tagged by WII, arrived in Gir after flying over lions while crossing Africa.

Such birds with abnormal plumage condition are quite rare; this particular bird was photographed by ornithologist Devvratsinh Mori. The bird belongs to the genus Halcyon and according to the Greek legend, the halcyon could calm the sea waves when nesting (hence the term halcyon or peaceful days). Mori said, “In the last week of December, when I was clicking pictures of a common pochard (a medium-sized diving duck), I saw a white bird fly past. As the bird perched itself on a branch, I noticed that it was a partial leucistic white-throated kingfisher. While the colour of its eyes, feet and mandibles were not affected by the loss of pigmentation, its throat was white.” As opposed to albino birds, leucistic birds display normal pigmentation in other parts of the body, such as the beak, eyes, and legs. The percentage of leucistic birds in natural populations is rarely greater than one per cent, he said. A senior ornithologist unwilling to be quoted said, “Since the lockdown, sightings of such birds have increased. In December 2020, a leucistic common crane was sighted near Gandhidham in Kutch. The same month, white or leucistic greylag goose was sighted in Nal Sarovar in Ahmedabad. In 2020, white sparrows and white common babblers were also spotted.” He said that this was the second sighting of a leucistic bird in Ahmedabad, the first being the leucistic greylag goose. Leucism is also a genetic condition but does not result in a complete lack of melanin or colour. In this case, all colour pigments, including melanin, look slightly faded. Sometimes, these birds appear pale as if their overall colour has been lightened.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/rare-white-throated-kingfisher-spotted/articleshow/88820713.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Ahmedabad||State begins survey to find buildings sans BU nod||Ahmedabad: Following a high court directive, one of the widespread discrepancies involving town planning department in the state is finally being addressed. For the first time, a statewide sample survey of properties without Building Use (BU) permission across municipal corporations and nagarpalikas is being undertaken. A total of 8,320 buildings, including residential properties, will be part of this sample survey. Sources claim that the survey is being carried out to devise a legal provision to legitimize such buildings, even after these buildings could not be legalized under the Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorized Development (Impact Fee for regularization of illegal properties) Act or the impact fee law which was in force till 2018.“Even newly merged municipal areas like Bopal-Ghuma have 80% properties that do not have BU permission. This is largely due to flawed building permission processes employed first by gram panchayats, then by nagarpalikas. In 2006 areas like Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Jodhpur and Thaltej and other areas that were brought in, nearly 60% of the properties did not have BU permissions,” admitted a senior AMC official. A senior state urban development official told TOI that this problem was seen not only in Ahmedabad but also in urban pockets in Vadodara, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Surat, and Rajkot that were run by village panchayats and nagarpalikas. Construction permissions were issued arbitrarily in these areas. “There were instances where AUDA in Ahmedabad was charging unauthorized development fee but were not giving BU permission. Several of these buildings now have extra floors for which there is no BU nod,” adds a senior AMC official. There is also the issue of implementation of the provisions of the central law of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, which is yet to be implemented in the state and requires that hospitals, nursing homes and clinics operate from legal and fire-safe premises. “Fire safety and structural safety are of primary concerns. But one of the biggest impediments is the legal status of these buildings,” adds the senior AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-begins-survey-to-find-buildings-sans-bu-nod/articleshow/88820715.cms||Paul John

As a result, the full revenue recovery of multiplexes across states will be pushed back to the second half of the next fiscal, rating agency Crisil said on Monday.Earlier, the multiplexes were expected to achieve revenue recovery by the first quarter of 2022-23.“A few big-ticket films such as ‘RRR’ and ‘Jersey’ have already been postponed indefinitely. Our base case assumes the third wave to peak in February and bottom out by the end of March. We expect theatre release of big-ticket content to resume in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which should sharply improve occupancy. A full recovery, however, is expected only in the second half of next fiscal,” said Nitesh Jain, director, Crisil Ratings.The rating agency further added that the pace of recovery is expected to be sharp — as was witnessed after the second wave — once restrictions are lifted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/3rd-wave-to-push-recovery-of-multiplexes-by-3-5-months/articleshow/88820724.cms||---

Routine out-patient treatment has also been curtailed in these hospitals and manpower diverted for Covid management. An AIIMS official told TOI that more than 400 healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and other staff, had tested positive for Covid at the hospital. At Safdarjung and RML hospital, sources said, the number of healthcare workers infected is over 200 each. Though there is no consolidated data on the exact number of healthcare workers with Covid across the city’s hospitals, doctors said it could well be over 2,000. Nearly 50 healthcare workers in Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals have been affected. Among private hospitals, according to sources, 50 staffers tested positive for Covid on Monday. Vibhu Talwar, managing director, Moolchand Healthcare, said around 25 workers in their hospitals are down. A Fortis Healthcare spokesperson said, “We have 28 hospitals across the country. The total number of workers who have tested positive for Covid overall in January is 960, of whom, 27 required hospitalisation.” When asked about steps being taken to tide over the potential manpower crisis infection has created, Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, said, “We are only conducting emergency surgeries at present. All clinical departments are contributing 50% of their manpower to the Covid pool.” At RML Hospital, the administration has asked healthcare workers who come in contact with Covid patients not to undergo tests or isolate themselves if they didn’t have symptoms of infection. Only those who develop symptoms need to get tested and isolate themselves, the hospital said. A doctor at the hospital said, “Omicron is causing mild symptoms in most people. If it was as severe as Delta, which necessitated medical attention in at least 5% of the infected individuals, the situation caused by the manpower shortage would already have become unmanageable.” Dr Anuj Kumar, general secretary, Resident Doctors’ Association of Safdarjung Hospital, added, “During the first and the second waves, the hospital provided accommodation to doctors working in the Covid wards so they wouldn’t spread the disease among family members. But this time there is no such provision.” Delhi government has, in the meanwhile, issued orders permitting the hiring of qualified staff, including specialists, consultants, nurses and interns on a daily pay basis. While the specialists are being hired for an honorarium of Rs 15,000 per day, the consultants and nurses will get, respectively, Rs 10,000 and Rs 2,000 on a daily basis according to the government order. The central government too has issued directives allowing the deployment of final year MBBS and nursing students to bridge the gap in manpower available and required.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/routine-operations-take-a-hit-as-healthcare-workers-come-in-line-of-covid-fire/articleshow/88819154.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The students want action based on complaints made by undergraduate students and junior doctors.Kamlesh Upadhyaya, the head of the medicine department, had allegedly told final-year undergraduate students that they would not be given attendance marks that would enable them to take their final exams, as 75% attendance is compulsory. The protesting students said that while they may not have reached the minimum figures for the medicine department, they have been on duty at various hospitals while dealing with the Covid pandemic.BJMC dean Dr Jayesh Sachdeva said, “Students had sat on protest outside my office.” He added: “To deal with this extraordinary situation, we put out a circular that all clinical postings of students while dealing with the Covid situation should be taken into account to compute attendance and internal marks.”Protesting medicos said that while the surgery, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynaecology departments had considered Covid duties performed, only the medicine department did not. The students had alleged that the medicine HOD had also been mentally harassing students.Dr Oman Prajapati, vice-president of the BJMC junior doctors’ association (JDA), said, “Dr Kamlesh Upadhyaya has been facing accusations from postgraduate students that he was harassing them mentally.” Prajapati added: “Now even undergraduate students are making the same allegations. Yet no action has been taken against him. Who is shielding him?”Students had accused Professor Ila Upadhyaya, head of the ENT department, of demanding ‘gifts’. The Junior Doctors’ Association wrote a letter to the dean on Monday, to press its demand for action against these professors as ample time has passed since the complaints were made.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bj-medicos-demand-action-against-hods/articleshow/88820730.cms||---

Triathlete Pragnya Mohan, however, made it look easy winning the gold in 2000 metres at the National Sea Swimming Competition 2022 in Porbandar, on Sunday. The competition was organized by the Shree Ram Swimming Club under the aegis of Swimming Federation of India. The race was held in the waters of Arabian Sea on the coast of Porbandar.Pragnya, who competed in the 14-45 years category, won the gold medal in the 2,000 metres open sea race race in 36m.44s. The silver medal was won by Jital Pitroda, who clocked 37m.02s, while Niva Raval captured the bronze in 40m.24s. There were more than 80 entrants in this category. Talking to TOI after her victory, Pragnya said, “I was in Melbourne during the lockdown (in 2020) and training there in open seas helped immensely. In open sea swimming, there are no lanes unlike in pools. However, I managed a good swim here and was able to win.”In November 2021, while participating in the 80km mass start category (cycling event) at the nationals in Kurukshetra, she and 14 other girl participants fell on each other at the home straight (the last 400m). “I suffered a sprain in the right ankle and also injured my right arm. It took more than a month to recuperate. This is my first race after the injury and I’m happy to start with a win,” she added.Elaborating the challenges of open sea swimming, the Ahmedabad-based triathlete, who became the first Indian to represent the country at the Triathlon World Cup in 2019 said, “I was initially sceptical to the idea of open sea swimming as the skills required are a lot different and difficult. The most important aspect is sighting and swimming in a straight line. Waves hit you and the water current is many a times unfavourable. I learnt to swim diagonally to the waves and reach the destination.” Fear of the unknown is also there at the back of the mind. “There are many water animals which can attack. They may not be deadly but can hurt you,” the 28-year-old said, adding that once the current Covid wave abates, she will head to Europe with an eye on qualification for 2024 Paris Olympics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pragnya-wins-gold-in-open-sea-swimming/articleshow/88820742.cms||Sabu Cherian

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Angadia men robbed of Rs 15 lakh, 1 shot||AHMEDABAD: In a daring loot executed at the busy Ashram Road on Monday evening, three bike-borne miscreants opened fire at employees of three angadia firms and robbed them of Rs 7.5 lakh cash, and silver bars and ornaments worth Rs 7 lakh. The incident took place at 7.15 pm near Hotel Hyatt Regency, in close vicinity of Vadaj, Naranpura and Navrangpura police stations. All three accused have been arrested from Sardarnagar. Investigating officials are tightlipped about their identities as they suspect more people may be involved in the incident. Balwant Rajput, 40, one of the three employees who were fired at, was rushed to Sola Civil Hospital with a bullet wound below his left knee. According to the police officers, the incident took place when the three employees of the angadias got down from an ST bus near the Ashram road flyover. “The three employees work for Madhav Magan, K Ashwin and Mahendra Pravin Angania firms from Ratanpol. They had arrived from Deesa in Banaskantha after collecting silver ornaments, silver bars and cash from an angadia firm. Later, they collected some parcels from Unjha in Mehsana and boarded a bus for the city,” said ACP B division LB Jhala. Jhala added, “They alighted from the ST bus in front of a car showroom near the hotel and called up an autorickshaw driver so they could be dropped off to their angadia firms in Ratanpol.” After getting off the bus, the employees carefully placed the parcels and the three bags containing the valuables on the road and were waiting for the rickshaw when three men reached the spot on two different bikes and fired at least four rounds at them. A police official said, “Rajput got hit by a bullet and fell. He managed to get up and ran along with the others towards the car showroom. The miscreants then picked up all the bags left behind by the fleeing employees and sped towards Income Tax.” Rajput was rushed to the hospital while the police recorded the statements of the two other employees. Vadaj police have registered a case of robbery and under Arms Act and are investigating the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/angadia-men-robbed-of-15l-1-shot/articleshow/88820746.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Rs 49,000 for man wounded in riots 30 years ago||AHMEDABAD: Three decades after a youth sustained bullet injuries in the riots that broke out during Rath Yatra in 1992, a city civil court has ordered the state government to pay him Rs 49,000 compensation with 6% interest. The case involved one Manishkumar Chauhan, who was 18 when he suffered two bullet injuries. His mother was admitted to the VS Hospital. On July 2 that year, the city witnessed communal riots. On the evening of July 5, when Chauhan and his relative were returning from the hospital, two unidentified people opened fire at Nehru Bridge. Chauhan and his relative got injured in the attack. Chauhan sustained bullet injuries on his waist and chest. He was rushed to VS Hospital, where he was treated for 12 days. After issuing a legal notice to the government, seeking compensation, Chauhan filed a suit in 1994 and demanded Rs 7.01 lakh in damages. He contended that the government had failed in its duty to ensure safety and security of its subjects in the event of communal riots. The authorities had failed in preventing people from carrying arms while roaming on public streets. The state government questioned the maintainability of Chauhan’s claim and submitted that Rs 1,000 ex-gratia was paid to him after his injury. He was not entitled to any more compensation, they argued. After hearing the case, the court said that though Chauhan did not have to incur any expenditure for his hospitalisation, the injury and treatment as an in-door patient must have caused inconvenience to him and his relatives. Chauhan had suffered immense pain and shock owing to his condition. The court was not ready to grant compensation sought by Chauhan, but ordered the government to pay Rs 49,000 towards compensation with 6% interest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/49k-for-man-wounded-in-riots-30-years-ago/articleshow/88820747.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Keep old number for your new vehicle||AHMEDABAD: Got a vehicle number of your choice — there is good news for you. While selling your vehicle, you will have the choice to retain the number for your new one. The buyer of your old vehicle will get another number, if you choose to retain your existing one. Transport minister Purnesh Modi said that a decision has been taken to give vehicle owners with fancy registration numbers the ability to retain their number, and the person buying the vehicle will get a new number. He said such numbers can be retained for two vehicles only. The vehicle will have to be registered to the same entity as the existing vehicle. He said in no circumstances will numbers be transferred to family members or the like. An RTO officer said that now, a vehicle registration number cannot be transferred or allotted to another vehicle even if the car is scrapped. The procedure to transfer numbers to the next vehicle has already been implemented in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and the state government, after studying it, has decided to implement it in the state. Officials in the transport department said usually there is bidding for ‘gold’ and ‘silver’ numbers and vehicle owners pay high prices for them. For example, the numbers 7777 or 1111 or 786 are ‘golden’ numbers and are usually auctioned. These number fetch no less than Rs 1 lakh. For a car, bidding for such numbers opens at Rs 40,000; and at Rs 8,000 for two-wheelers. A person who retains a ‘golden’ number, will not have to go for another auction, but will need to pay the base price of Rs 40,000 for a car and Rs 8,000 for a two-wheeler. Similarly, silver numbers of other numbers can be retained on paying the base prices. “Usually, such numbers have sentimental value as people choose numbers due to various reasons including numerology, religious sentiments, birthdays or wedding anniversaries or others. The officer said the new scheme will apply even for vehicles that are scrapped after 15 years of registration. Officials said the process of transferring the existing number to the new vehicle will have to completed within 15 days of the sale of the old vehicle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/keep-old-number-for-your-new-vehicle/articleshow/88820750.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Ahmedabad||AMC to bite into industry incentives||Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has proposed a 25 percentage point reduction in property tax rebates to Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) estates. Currently, AMC keeps 25% of property taxes and returns 75% to GIDC estates, which is used to develop and maintain common civic works such as roads, water and sewerage within the estate.The civic body has now proposed to keep 50% of the property tax and return 50% to GIDC estates. This will increase the revenue of the civic body but will add a financial burden to industrial units, which are already under financial stress caused by the Covid situation.“In 2003, AMC introduced this incentive to promote industrial activity in GIDC estates. Now, when the civic body is reeling from revenue lost during lockdown periods, we have decided to cut down on this incentive,” said an AMC official.The official said the civic body collects about Rs 30 crore in property tax every year from GIDC estates in Vatva, Naroda, Odhav and Kathwada. Three quarters of this money is returned to the estates.“Property tax is a significant cost for industries. The reduction in rebates on property tax will increase costs for units. It will also have an impact on industry associations. Maintaining common infrastructure is already a challenge with the 75% rebate. With the proposed reduction, it will be a bigger challenge for associations,” said Ankit Patel, past president, Vatva Industries Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-to-bite-into-industry-incentives/articleshow/88820753.cms||---

A source privy to the development also confirmed that at least 30 flight movements are expected to be suspended during this period, which means roughly 170 flights will operate through the day. SVPI airport authorities have received a nod from the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), for the resurfacing activity. Earlier, the runway recarpeting was to begin from January 3. However, it was postponed keeping in mind more passenger arrivals in the wake of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2022. The summit, however, was deferred by the state government following rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. Under the guidance of the safety regulator, all relevant stakeholders have been consulted and given ample notice to revise schedules to minimize passenger inconvenience during the period, according to airport authorities. “The work will include runway overlaying, runway strip grading and slope assessment, Runway End Safety Area (RESA) grading and slope assessment, along with storm water drain construction and reinstallation of signages in the maneuvering area. Runway maintenance closures are mandatory procedures in line with international safety standards to ensure aircraft safety and increase the runway life,” said an SVPI airport spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/runway-work-from-jan-17-52-flights-rescheduled/articleshow/88820756.cms||---

Petitioner Depankar Deb is a professor in the institute’s electrical engineering department. Through his counsel Sudhanshu Jha, Deb submitted that he raised several grievances against the presence vice-chancellor who is also the director because he was taking undue advantage of his position and had allegedly been drawing extra income. The petitioner is being penalized for raising these objections; his non-appointment as a dean is a high-handed action on part of the university and a personal vendetta of the director, Jha submitted. It was further submitted that though Deb is entitled and eligible to become the dean, he has not been made one and instead the director has appointed six associate deans, which is unheard of in any educational institute. Two deans used to serve till 2020. But the posts were not filled later and in their places six associate deans have been appointed. The HC has sought a reply from the institute by February 17.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/not-appointed-as-dean-iitram-prof-moves-hc/articleshow/88820758.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||AIMIM splitting Ahmedabad Congress unit?||AHMEDABAD: Even as Congress faces stiff resistance from several of its municipal councillors in Ahmedabad over the proposal to name Shehzad Khan Pathan as leader of the opposition in the AMC, the All IndiaMajlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has rolled out the red carpet to welcome disgruntled Congress councillors. “Not only Shahzad Khan Pathan, other Congress councillors are also in touch with us. We are welcoming everybody who wants to join us and strengthen AIMIM in Gujarat,” Shamshad Pathan, state general secretary of AIMIM, told TOI on Monday. He added that the party has been expanding its base in the state rapidly and those who want to join AIMIM are welcome. This came even as Congress’s Danilimda councillor Shehzad Khan Pathan said that it was not wrong for a party worker to have expectations from the party. Pathan, however, added that he would abide by the decision of the party regarding the post of leader of opposition in the AMC. On Sunday, a dozen city Congress councillors handed over a signed letter to the state leadership saying they would quit the party if Pathan was chosen as the leader of opposition in the AMC. All of AIMIM’s gains in the AMC election last year, have been at the expense of the Congress. Making its debut in Gujarat’s electoral politics last year, AIMIM contested 21 seats in the AMC election and won seven seats. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led party won four seats in the Jamalpur ward and three in the Maktampura ward. All these seven seats were held by the Congress in the 2015 AMC election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/aimim-splitting-city-congress-unit/articleshow/88820759.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Mehta cracked civil services, but love for nature changed arc of his life||He had a dream, to be a top police officer, and he cracked the civil services exam in 1981. But he had no idea that the customary medical examination before joining his dream job would change the arc of his life. He was told that he cannot be taken in because of his partially defective colour vision. He could still have been an IAS officer, but he declined. "My family thought I made it to the civil services and I would stick to it. When I said I would not join, they were flummoxed. It was a tough decision. As always, I again went to the forests to seek answers in nature as to what I should do next," recollects Sunil Mehta, who today runs nature resorts, forest lodges and advises state governments on wildlife, eco-tourism and nature conservancies. His father was a well-known doctor in Jaipur and as a result he had some idea about the pharmaceutical industry. "I wanted to help people with cheaper drugs. That led me to setting up a pharmaceutical company for manufacturing and marketing of formulation drugs. I ran it successfully for 10 years but got disillusioned with the idea of helping people through the company. That’s when I decided to shut it down," says Mehta. He consulted his CA who said if he closed the company immediately, he could go bankrupt. But Mehta had already made up his mind. "In the end I did what I wanted. It was again a difficult decision. Fortunately, I salvaged some money because of the brand royalty. After that I went to Sariska, back to nature, sat inside the 5,000-year-old Hanuman temple contemplating what to do next," recalls Mehta. He wanted a break before starting his next innings. A nature buff since early days of his life, the idea of creating a nature farm and giving people an alternative lifestyle, closer to nature, birds, and wildlife engaged his mind. He nurtured the vision in 2000 but he did not have details as to the location and financing. In the meantime, he dabbled as an importer of silk yarn for supplying to carpet manufacturing firms in the country. "Between 2002 and 2005, I started purchasing land where the Treehouse exists today. It was a barren land, absolutely nowhere, a godforsaken piece of land. People advised me to throw my money into a well so that I would lose once, not time and again. But in the topography of the land, I could see its intrinsic potential. I planted lakhs of trees. Birds and animals started coming in. By 2006, we declared it as a nature farm, often inviting people to stay free. We had only a couple of rooms as treehouses. But as the word spread, people started calling and I could not say no to them all the time. That’s how The Treehouse Resort came up at the nature farm and became a hospitality resort in 2008 with all the modern trappings. I still say it was by accident and my destiny," says Mehta. In his passion for nature and wildlife, he sought a solution for man-animal conflict. Project Tiger and conservation programmes had increased the population of wild animals but forests had already shrunk, leading to routine unpleasant incidents. Mehta thought of a sustainable model where humans, wildlife and the local community can live in harmony. "I came up with the concept called COCOON conservancies which aimed at participation of the local communities living on the periphery of the forests. We offered them more than what they were earning from their land to divert their land for reforestation. We trained their family members and engaged them in the forest resorts I built. That’s how I entered wildlife hospitality with the Bamboo Forest Safari Lodge in Tadoba National Park. A similar resort will be launched soon," says Mehta. While he is currently working on a few more forest lodge projects at Umred Karhandla, Pench National Park, Kanha National Park, and Bandhavgarh, Mehta is keen to develop wildlife tourism in Rajasthan. "Rajasthan has a great potential for wildlife tourism. Besides the beach and snow, we have everything else here. Sariska is not only at the centre of the golden triangle, it is the gold mine for tourism. The park occupies the most beautiful landscape in Rajasthan. Here, Aravali is at its natural best. Similarly, because of Jhalana, Jaipur has become the leopard capital of the world. I want to see a wildlife corridor covering Jhalana, Amagarh, Galta, Nahargarh, Achrol, Ramgarh and all the way to Sariska. The corridor was there historically, but that needs to be reestablished," says Mehta. Mehta’s eldest son has also followed in his footsteps bringing in technology to operations while adding new assets of hospitality like a modern heritage restaurant. "Yes, he is taking the businesses a step further, while I devote more time on conservation," adds Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mehta-cracked-civil-services-but-love-for-nature-changed-arc-of-his-life/articleshow/88819153.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Dehradun||European Smew duck sighted for the first time in U'khand||Dehradun: Experts monitoring the Tumaria reservoir, close to Corbett National Park, since for over 1.5 decades have sighted a special tiny fowl called the Smew duck (Mergellus Albellus). The reservoir is visited by more than 18 migratory birds every year. The International Union For Conservation For Nature's (IUCN's) Duck Specialist group has tagged its presence in Uttarakhand as ‘extralimital migration'. This indicates that the landscape has a high potential to turn into a robust habitat for more species of migratory birds from different parts of the world. To ensure that the sighting is cited correctly, experts took a final clearance from the IUCN, who confirmed the bird's presence. A native of Europe and Eurasia, these fowls are small and highly migratory diving ducks. They belong to the "only living" member of the genus Mergellus of the Anatidae family of ducks. The creatures are known for nesting and inhabiting freshwater lakes, reservoirs, flood woods, ice-free rivers, sheltered bays, estuaries, tidal creeks, and lagoons. One of its special features is that it feeds food by diving into the water. They primarily feed only upon aquatic plants, insects, crustaceans, mollusks, frogs, fish, and invertebrates. “This is the first sighting of this fowl and the Tumaria reservoir has already sighted 18 species of fowls since October. It is turning into one of the most promising reservoirs and needs more conservation,” said Dr Harendra Singh Bargali, deputy director, The Corbett Foundation (TCF). This organisation is involved in monitoring the status of resident and migratory waterfowls in Baur, Haripura, and Tumaria Reservoirs for over 15 years now. They were the first ones to record the sighting of a rare Bean Goose in Uttarakhand in 2012. The recent sighting was done by a team of researchers led by Dr H S Bargali, comprising Deepti Ptwal, Idrish Hussain, and Chandrashekhar Suyal from TCF. The smew is an occasional visitor of the Indian subcontinent. The wintering grounds of these fowls include sheltered coasts or inland lakes of the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Great Britain, the Caspian Sea, East China, Korea, and Japan. This duck is of significance as it comes under the Agreement on the Conservation of African Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Therefore, its conservation is essential for ornithologists (those who study birds). Even though the population trend appears to be decreasing, the species is evaluated as "least concern" under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that it is not a focus of species conservation. Experts feel that if the Tumaria reservoir, which is situated in Terai West of the Western Circle, is given better attention and protection, it can be turned into a promising eco-tourism site. The reservoir mainly serves as a source of water for irrigation in the surrounding areas. The area comes under the Terai-West forest division and is not very far from the boundaries of Corbett Tiger Reserve. “The sighting of so many fowls indicates that the functioning of the ecosystem can be improvised as it nurtures robust biodiversity. The fowls in its extra-limit area indicate a possibility of nurturing more migratory birds in this landscape,” Bargali said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/european-smew-duck-sighted-for-the-first-time-in-ukhand/articleshow/88817806.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||Jaipur as a wedding destination owes it to hospitality industry: Dangayach||For Harimohan Dangayach, challenge has a different connotation. “It’s only in challenges you get opportunities and successes. A businessman is always up against challenges. One has to man up and take it,” says Dangayach, owner of seven branded properties like Marriott in Jaipur, Le Meridien in Hyderabad, Jaipur Ramada, Chomu Palace, and Radisson in Agra among others. From his student days, Dangayach was convinced that he would do business, not any job. He felt that he could give shape to his ideas only through entrepreneurial ventures. “I left my engineering college in Ranchi half way through for some personal reasons and came to Jaipur to set up a coloured stone business in 1970. My father was a grain merchant. Since Jaipur was emerging as a hub for cutting and polishing of coloured stones, I saw opportunities there,” recalls Dangayach. A clear headed entrepreneur with a penchant for granular insight, Dangayach learnt the ropes of the trade quickly and forayed into exports of gemstones. As the business was flourishing, he again saw scope in jewellery making which was new to Jaipur at that time. “Jaipur was known for gemstones, not jewellery. We were one of the earliest companies to take up the challenge in 1995 and it paid dividends. By 2000, the jewellery business had gained a firm footing and that’s when we decided to diversify into real estate,” says Dangayach. Initially, he built 5-6 projects but soon realised that there is a vacuum in the hospitality sector that can be worth a gamble. “In 2003, I opened Park Plaza in C-Scheme. It was the first modern boutique hotel. Again my instincts proved right as the hotel clocked in the returns I expected,” says Dangayach. The success of the first hospitality project became a turning point in his life. While he was growing his jewellery business and real estate side by side, the lack of good hotels in the city pricked his brain. A foresighted entrepreneur, which he admits in understatements, Dangayach took a big bet by opening Marriott Jaipur 2010 with 365 rooms. “Many in my circle said I was overplaying my hand. But in the heart of hearts, I was convinced that it would be a gamechanger not only for me but for the whole hospitality sector and the state. There were not many big star hotels of that size. Today, I feel happy that it has played out the way I had foreseen then,” says Dangayach. Le Meridien, ITC Rajputana and a couple of others were the only modern properties before Marriott opened its gates. But after Marriott, a flurry of big chain hotels added heft to Jaipur’s strength as a tourist destination. “Marriott Jaipur set off two new trends. The city suddenly became a new wedding destination. Big weddings needed a large number of rooms. Once those facilities became available, weddings started coming into the city. Secondly, because of the new hotels, the business did not get divided, rather it generated new business, further expanding the tourism market and creating an all new events industry,” says Dangayach. Even today, given the turbocharged growth the hospitality sector has witnessed, Dangayach feels there is a huge scope for new capacity. “Rajasthan has a good future as a tourism destination. That’s why I am currently building two projects, one each in Udaipur and Jaipur. We will have 500 more rooms in less than three years. Udaipur property will be one more Marriott hotel for our group. With those two new hotels, our group will have 2,000 rooms,” says Dangayach. The impact of the Covid pandemic has been severe on the industry. But Dangayach says during such times one learns how to sharpen one’s entrepreneurial skills. “Be it Corona or any other crisis, they teach a lot about how to run a business like a tight ship. We did not close our hotel during the pandemic but reduced expenses. The exercise brought us new learnings where we can cut costs and make the business stable and sustainable,” says Dangayach. While hospitality has become the mainstay of the group’s business, his son Atul is heading the jewellery business. “Yes, Atul has taken over the jewellery business even though I help him in some key decisions. But he is also contributing to the hotel business,” says Dangayach. About the pace of growth, Dangayach says he is happy to have seized the opportunities at the right time but could have done more if he had more hands. “For every window of opportunity, there is time to enter. If you don’t enter, the window gets shut. Along with Atul, I have grabbed as much as I could. But certainly, I had to let go some,” says Dangayach. As a businessman, one thing he likes to tell the aspiring entrepreneurs. “Always respect commitments. If you do that you will sail through all difficult times.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-as-a-wedding-destination-owes-it-to-hospitality-industry-dangayach/articleshow/88819156.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The man was apprehended when he was waiting to get an autorickshaw at Hanspura Crossroads on SP Ring Road near Dehgam Circle in Naroda. The man nabbed is Yasin Shaikh, a resident of Peer Sakarganj no Mohallo near Patwa Sheri in Karanj. He told the cops that the weapon and the cartridges belonged to his brother Yusuf Shaikh who died about two months ago. According to the city crime branch cops, they got an input that Yasin was at Hanspura Crossroads with some weapon which he was trying to sell. The cops kept watch on the area on Monday afternoon. At about 1.30pm, they spotted the suspect and cornered him. On checking him, the cops found the two pistols worth Rs 50,000, two magazines worth Rs 1,000, and 23 cartridges worth Rs 2,300. Yasin told the cops that Yusuf had given the weapon and the cartridges to him about two years ago to sell them. The crime branch booked Yasin under the Arms Act and began an investigation. According to the cops, Yasin was caught by Vatva police in 1997 in connection with a clothes theft case and was sent to Jamnagar jail for seven months. In 2002, he was caught with 7kg of charas at Shamlaji check post and was released by the high court in 2009.

---||Ahmedabad||Our law against land grabbing superior: Govt to HC||Ahmedabad: The state government on Monday defended its Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act in 2020 with the advocate-general submitting in the Gujarat high court that the law is far superior to anti-land grabbing laws enacted by other states. The chief justice continued to pose pertinent questions about provisions of the law. The land grabbing laws are under challenge as nearly 175 petitions have been filed claiming that several provisions are in violation of the Constitution and those parts of the law should be scrapped. As it was the state government’s turn to defend itself, advocate-general Kamal Trivedi submitted that there are claims that the act is bereft of guidelines, “but I will cite judgments to show that my Gujarat act is far far superior to those which has skeletal legislation barring object clause and no guideline was there. We have object and reason. We have preamble, sections 2D and 2E defining the land grabbing. There is special court and special procedure laid down.” He insisted that all the guidelines are available in the law and the rules too are compatible with the act.The government law officer tried to justify the constitution of committee by revenue officers for scrutiny of complaints, and asserted that the government has competence to form the committee. He clarified that the action of the committee, if found in violation of constitutional provisions, is liable to be challenged. He also submitted that the committee is a filter that protects land holder from direct intervention of cops and serves as a preliminary inquiry by revenue officials.Chief Justice Aravind Kumar questioned whether the committee can take a decision about land dispute even after three courts — trial court, the high court and the Supreme Court — have passed decrees against the complainant’s claims. The chief justice also questioned the state government’s enactment that covers private land dispute. He said, “Your apprehension is to ward off land grabbing, to prevent and prohibit it. You take care of your (government) land, why are you concerned about private land?”The judges also warn of a situation in which complaints about land grabbing would flood, “your officer will be waiting. The moment the decree is declared, they will pounce upon. There will be thousand and thousands of cases.” The court also posed a query, whether the IPC and CrPC have provisions that take care of land grabbing issue or criminal trespass in private land. The AG replied it by citing section 441 of the IPC.The court also raised concerned about the fate of alleged land grabbers after the committee suggests FIR, “Damage is done by the committee. By the time special court decides (the case) in six months or a year, the person is prosecuted and chargesheet comes as a bar for him to contest for election. What happens?”The HC will hear the case further on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/our-law-against-land-grabbing-superior-govt-to-hc/articleshow/88820763.cms||---

Several eligible beneficiaries enthusiastically queued up before the vaccination centres for the third dose. According to officials, at least nine months should have elapsed from the date of administration of the second dose to receive the third one. Andhra Pradesh reported 984 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the cumulative caseload to 20,82,843. About 11,000 senior citizens availed the booster dose, while about 31,000 frontline respondents were jabbed with the third dose. As many as 70,000 healthcare workers received the vaccine. Nellore district alone administered about 20,000 doses, the highest among all the districts. M Rama Rao, a retired banker who received the third dose at MVP colony in Visakhapatnam on Monday, said the booster shot can increase the antibodies against the novel coronavirus, which will be crucial with the emergence of the Omicron variant.

Police say people are coming forward and availing LHMS service as this year, many in Vizag city will be heading for villages to celebrate the three-day festival starting from Wednesday. If LHMS is in place, and burglars enter a locked house, the city police would get an alert and also pictures from the CCTV cameras installed at the house. The control center at the police commissionerate would then immediately inform the nearest police station of the house to prevent the burglary and nab the offenders.  Speaking to TOI, ADCP (crimes), DS Sravan Kumar, who is also DCP (in-charge) of crimes, said they have urged the city residents to utilise the police’s app LHMS to prevent possible property offences during Sankranti vacation when most of the people would visit their native places or villages. “We have been receiving requests every day for LHMS. City police have 100 CCTV cameras in its possession. The force may procure more surveillance cameras if the demand keeps surging. As Sankranti is the biggest festival with over four-day celebrations, most people in the city will visit the villages by locking their houses. So, there is a possibility for property offence cases, the police added. “Property offences during Sankranti festival are very low in Vizag city as most people have been utilising the LHMS facility. We have decided to increase the night and day patrolling during the festival to prevent cirmes. We are expecting an increase in demand for LHMS from Wednesday,” Sravan Kumar added. “By giving a few details, people can get themselves registered on the app. Police will install CCTV cameras at the house free of cost and the cameras would be linked to the police control room. We have hundreds of CCTV cameras and are ready to acquire more if demand grows,” police added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/police-expect-demand-for-lhms-to-grow-during-sankranti/articleshow/88820765.cms||Nalla.Babu

Two persons –– Praveen Kumar and his father Subhas Paswan –– have been arrested in this connection. A dismantled pistol and 32 cartridges were also recovered from the house of the accused persons. The development happened days after Dhurwa police arrested three persons with five SIM cards that were to be handed over to PLFI extremists. While police were searching for Nivesh Kumar, a close associate of PLFI supremo and an accused in the case, Ranchi SSP Surindra Jha received information that the accused is hiding in the house of his brother Praveen in Prem Nagar. Police did not find Nivesh during the raid but came across the huge amount of cash. Praveen said that Nivesh had asked them to keep the money in the house. Sources said that Nivesh was involved in investing Gopesh’s money in different companies and other assets including land. Though Nivesh is unemployed, a large amount of cash is deposited in bank account of his wife as well. DSP Neeraj Kumar said, “The case is being investigated from various angles. Police are carrying out raids to arrest the absconders in the case in order to elicit crucial information regarding sources of money.” Earlier, the Ranchi SSP had received a tip off that Nivesh and Dhruv Singh, both residents of Dhurwa, along with their accomplice Subham Kumar were supplying arms, explosives, SIM cards and other essential materials to the PLFI. On January 6, police nabbed Arya Kumar Singh, Ujjwal Kumar Sahu and Amirchnad Kumar from the Dhurwa dam area. Arya and Ujjawal were about to hand over five SIM cards to Amirchand for supply to PLFI when the police carried out the raids.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/police-arrest-two-with-61-lakh-plfi-money/articleshow/88820771.cms||---

Other members of the delegation included former chief minister and BJP’s national vice-president Raghubar Das, state general secretary Balmukund Sahay, Chandankyari MLA Amar Bauri and mayor Asha Lakra.Sanju Pradhan, who hailed from Dalit community, was lynched and later burnt by a mob in Simdega last week for allegedly felling Sal trees. The incident occurred weeks after Hemant Soren government passed anti-mob lynching bill. The police had lodged FIR against 38 people, including 13 unnamed, in this connection. So far, nine, including a village pradhan, have been held arrested in this case.Opposition BJP alleged that Pradhan was killed as he was vocal against cow slaughtering in the area and accused the state government and the district administration of trying to give it a different colour. The BJP had also demanded removal of local police station in charge and Simdega SP for failing to save the life of a Dalit claiming that when the mob fury was on, the police remained mute spectators. It had also demanded a CBI probe.Earlier in the day, Das also addressed a press conference at party office wherein he lashed out at the Hemant Soren government trading hosts of charges against him for lawlessness, corruption and jungle-raj since the government came to power two years ago. Taking a dig at the mob-lynching law, Das questioned the Soren government to explain its intention. “I want to ask the CM, if this law is applicable only if a Muslim is killed by Hindu or when Dalit, tribals, and others are also killed? This government’s whole intention behind this law is appeasement politics for a specific community,” he said, adding that the tribals and dalits in this state under the CM are facing numerous atrocities since last two years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bjp-demands-compensation-job-for-lynch-victims-family/articleshow/88820772.cms||---

Temple authorities said that normally around 20,000 devotees used to visit daily to offer prayers and the number would go up to around 35,000 during the weekends. But now there are barely 500 devotees coming to the temple on a daily basis. Ajay Panda, a senior priest at the temple, said that the footfall has gone down due to host of restrictions initiated by the government to control the virus spread. “On weekends, the temple and the adjoining tourist places often witness heavy crowd but with government closing tourist spots till Jan 15, the footfall has come down. Also, the increasing cases of Covid-19 is also a deterrent,” he added. Active cases of Covid-19 in Ramgarh have crossed the 1,000-mark and since the past few days, it is registering a triple-digit spike. As a result, the district administration has directed the temple committee to ban the entry of devotees without masks and maintain social distancing. All priests were directed to get double dose of the anti-Covid vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/daily-footfall-down-to-500-from-over-20000-at-rajrappa-temple/articleshow/88820777.cms||---

RSS office-bearers should have a debate with me. Where is your organization, what is your existence, where is your registered organization?” Singh asked.Accusing RSS of spreading misinformation in society, the Congress Rajya Sabha MP said: “I want to ask if RSS, as an organization, has ever held any protest, fought for farmers, labourers and the common man.” Singh alleged that a false narrative is being created to spread the message that Hindu religion is under threat. “Muslim and Mughal rulers ruled for 500 years, and Christian-British rulers for 150 years, but Hindu religion was never under threat. So, today, when everyone from the President to the lower posts is a Hindu, how can any threat emerge to Hindu religion?” he asked.“This is done so that the fascist ideology can be taken forward and money can be earned through political posts,” he claimed. Singh alleged that RSS isn’t a registered organization, doesn’t have any account, nor membership. “If any RSS activist is caught in any criminal activity, they never accept him as their activist,” Singh said.Speaking on the upcoming elections in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, he turned to mediapersons and said, “You people must be listening to the speeches delivered by Yogi Adityanath. Have you heard phrases other than ‘Hindu-Muslim’, ‘Hindustan-Pakistan’ or ‘shamshan-kabristan’ in them?”RSS office-bearers refused to comment on Diggy’s remarks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/rss-is-secretly-damaging-the-system-from-within-alleges-diggy/articleshow/88820784.cms||---
---||Goa||Everyone loves FC Goa! 98% football lovers in state support the club: Survey||Panaji: FC Goa are fan favourites in the state. A recent survey commissioned by the club has thrown up interesting numbers – Indian football, it states, has 165 million fans across the country and 33m of them are FC Goa fans. Goa’s population is just 1.8m and the study has shown that FC Goa fans are everywhere – from Kashmir in the north to deep down south. While it was known that the club has plenty of support in Goa, the study states that 98% of the fans here back the Gaurs, as the team is called. The survey was conducted by YouGov, one of the world's largest and more respected research firms. “If you had asked me before the study, how many fans do you think FC Goa have in India, I would say around 8-10 million fans, and even that I was being very optimistic,” club president Akshay Tandon told TOI. “Once we did the research, we realised there were 165m people who consider themselves fans of Indian football. And 33m consider themselves to be FC Goa fans. That to me was the biggest revelation.” When Covid-19 struck the world last year, clubs took a major hit. For Goa, who were trying to minimise their losses – from Rs 25 crore annually to Rs 15 crore – the pandemic put a spanner in their works. They had to think differently. “We were actually on our way to start hitting the profit and loss targets that we were identifying as a roadmap we need to have for the next five years. Had the pandemic not happened, if the stadiums were still open, we would have been able to do that. “Obviously when that did not happen because of the pandemic, and sponsorships were further hit, we went to the drawing board and talked about what we want to do to keep this viable,” said Tandon. The club scanned its data and found they had approximately 50,000 fans who had contributed monetarily in the last five years. Then the math began – if Goa somehow got through 150,000 fans who could dip into their pocket, a “financially sound roadmap” could be achieved.  It would, in Tandon’s words, “break dependence on just sponsorship and broadcast.”  “We wanted to know how many fans do we have. We all know we have fans in Goa, in the football community, but what is the number? Where are they? What age-group? When we started asking these questions, we realised we wanted someone to do the research. That’s when we commissioned YouGov to do this for us,” said Tandon.  Summoned in September 2021, YouGov’s data is based on 2100 sample omnibus survey across 14 cities. This includes four major cities, six tier-two cities (including places in Goa) and four tier-three cities.  “The study shows that FC Goa fans could be thought of as the apex segment in terms of football fans. We are impressed with the findings and will look forward to aiding them further in their quest to know more,” said Joseph Eapen, YouGov Sport’s senior vice president. The survey comes up with some interesting findings. For example, Goa fans have a 33% higher household income when compared to the average football fans in India. The average household income of the club’s fan is Rs 47,000 and the average age of their fans is 26.3 years - 10% younger when compared to the average football fans in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/everyone-loves-fc-goa-98-football-lovers-in-state-support-the-club-survey/articleshow/88819173.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Ahmedabad||State begins survey to find buildings sans BU nod||Ahmedabad: Following a high court directive, one of the widespread discrepancies involving town planning department in the state is finally being addressed. For the first time, a statewide sample survey of properties without Building Use (BU) permission across municipal corporations and nagarpalikas is being undertaken. A total of 8,320 buildings, including residential properties, will be part of this sample survey. Sources claim that the survey is being carried out to devise a legal provision to legitimize such buildings, even after these buildings could not be legalized under the Gujarat Regularisation of Unauthorized Development (Impact Fee for regularization of illegal properties) Act or the impact fee law which was in force till 2018. “Even newly merged municipal areas like Bopal-Ghuma have 80% properties that do not have BU permission. This is largely due to flawed building permission processes employed first by gram panchayats, then by nagarpalikas. In 2006 areas like Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Jodhpur and Thaltej and other areas that were brought in, nearly 60% of the properties did not have BU permissions,” admitted a senior AMC official. A senior state urban development official told TOI that this problem was seen not only in Ahmedabad but also in urban pockets in Vadodara, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Surat, and Rajkot that were run by village panchayats and nagarpalikas. Construction permissions were issued arbitrarily in these areas. “There were instances where AUDA in Ahmedabad was charging unauthorized development fee but were not giving BU permission. Several of these buildings now have extra floors for which there is no BU nod,” adds a senior AMC official. There is also the issue of implementation of the provisions of the central law of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, which is yet to be implemented in the state and requires that hospitals, nursing homes and clinics operate from legal and fire-safe premises. “Fire safety and structural safety are of primary concerns. But one of the biggest impediments is the legal status of these buildings,” adds the senior AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-begins-survey-to-find-buildings-sans-bu-nod/articleshow/88819164.cms||Paul John

---||Indore||New variant is less severe as it spreads very fast, says MGM dean||INDORE: Even though active cases of Covid-19 rose to over 3100 on Sunday night, the bed occupancy in the district remained low because of less than three percent hospitalisation this time. The health department records suggested that of those 3182 active cases, 80 were hospitalised in different hospitals including only three in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Because of this, most of the beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in hospitals are vacant. There are around 10,000 beds in Covid-19 hospitals and Covid Care Centre (CCC) identified for them. HoD, Respiratory department MGM Dr Salil Bhargava said, “It is a good sign that the rate of hospitalisation is very low. Even those getting hospitalised after Covid-19 infection are because of other diseases.” “We have three patients in ICU right now. Of those 3, only one on bipep, but she is also recovering. On daily basis, a few are getting hospitalised”, said Dr Bhargava. “Last year, the hospitalisation rate was very high”, said Dr Bhargava. “The hospitalisation rate dipped only because of Covid-19 vaccines and herd immunity”, said Dr Bhargava. The records further suggested that around 97 persons were isolated in Covid care centres. These persons are isolated in CCC because of non-availability of separate rooms attached with toilets in their house in accordance with protocols, said health officials. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit when asked about it said, “The Covid-19 surge is reported because of a new variant of the virus. Because the new variant is spreading very fast it has lost its capability to cause severity.” “Epidemiologically, it is known as the start of an endemic phase of a disease. The disease has begun to become endemic that it will remain as any other disease”, said Dr Dixit. There are around 3,000 Covid-19 infected persons under home isolation recovering.

Restrictions have been imposed in almost all states and this is hindering our supplies to those markets.”Rural belts are the major markets for locally made confectionery items that are supplied to West Bengal, Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh among other states.Confectionery product manufacturers said if Covid-19 cases continue to rise and more restrictions are put in place then units may have to slash production within a week. Another confectionery manufacturer wishing not to be named said, “We can not slash output just in a day, we have to observe the trend but if the situation continues then we will be left with mounting stocks and then at that point units will have to cut down production.” Confectionery manufacturers said the increase in cost of raw materials and overall production cost has hit many small sized manufacturers.They said moving to a cluster with combined and common facilities will help in reducing the overall cost of operations especially for smaller units.A cluster for confectionery units is proposed at Rangwasa in which over 50 units have booked plots for setting up facilities.Choudhary said, “Registries for all plots are done and a few of them have started construction. We are waiting for the completion of infrastructure work in Rangwasa such as road connectivity, water supply and electricity connection to start full-fledged work.” TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/omicron-scare-confectionery-cos-slash-production/articleshow/88820789.cms||---

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, demand for commercial properties that had plummeted just after the outbreak of pandemic, has again surged, pushing carpet area cost by atleast 15-20 per cent. Enquiries from retailers contemplating to venture into online grocery, super market, garments, food business has triggered a lot of demand for sprawling properties in the middle of the city, claimed real estate agents.Arvind Gupta, president, Indore Realtor Welfare Association said, “Commercial leasing has gone up despite the pandemic because multiple large retailers are looking for spaces. Most customers are looking for ground floor big size commercial properties to set up outlets but such spaces are limited within the city and this has pushed rates high.”Real estate agents said Vijay Nagar, New Palasia, Race Course Road and MG Road are a few locations in prime demand among commercial customers.They said most of the properties vacated in the first lockdown have been re-occupied forcing new entrants to move to the outskirts.Another real estate agent Shailendra Agrawal said, “I have a lot of demand from IT companies because offices have adopted dual mode of working for their employees creating online and offline infrastructure. Many companies that have shut offices in the first lockdown have again started hunting for properties.”Players said educational institutions, finance companies and small dealerships were most hurt in pandemic and vacated posh spaces. Vinod Verma, a real estate agent said, “Apart from retail joints, branded jewellery and garment chains are looking for spaces on lease in the city. The requirements for most of these retailers are the same such as ground floor big properties but such spaces are limited within the city.” TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/rate-of-commercial-property-up-by-15/articleshow/88820790.cms||---

So far in the current oil year until December 3.8 lakh ton soyabean meal is exported from the country as against 6.9 lakh ton in the same period. Exporters from Indore, a leading trader center and hub for soyabean meal exporters as Madhya Pradesh is a leading producer of soyabean in the country contributing over 60 per cent in the country’s total output, has claimed a sharp decline in export orders for the next two-three months owing to high prices of local produce. Exporters said local origin soyabean meal is expensive by about $250-$300 per ton as compared with other countries like Brazil and Argentina. An exporter from Indore wishing not to be named said, “Indian meal prices are not competitive at all for exports. Export orders are negligible. If we calculate exports so far in this oil year, total exports must be down by over 70 per cent.” Soyabean oil year starts from October and ends in September and initial months usually see heavy demand from traditional South East Asian markets.Exporters said soyabean meal prices have failed to come down despite higher output in the country. SOPA had estimated soyabean output at 119 lakh ton, up 14 per cent from the previous year. In Madhya Pradesh, soyabean production was estimated at 52 lakh ton as against 41.7 lakh ton last year. Consumption of soyabean meal by the poultry sector in December has remained stable at 5 lakh ton, little higher than 5.5 lakh ton consumed as feed in the same period last year.

The authorities beefed up sample collection to around 10,000 samples in a day for the last one week with rise in in Covid-19 infections in district. In the last one week, around 3299 Covid-19 cases were reported but the sampling remained stagnant in between. ADM Abhay Bedekar however when asked about to increase in sampling he said, “Sampling teams are already collecting maximum samples in a day and there is no possibility to increase it further.” There were 38 RRTs conducting contact tracing and sample collection. With rise in cases in over 12 areas under different police stations 12 more teams were employed to further increase the surveillance, said ADM Bedekar. Around a week back, the sampling was only around 6500 to 7,000 in a day. It was but with surge in pandemic virus infection that the sampling rose to around 10,000 in a day, showed record. The teams had collected around 10,000 samples on daily basis even during second wave last year, when delta variant of pandemic caused havoc, showed record. The experts are demanding for increase in sampling and testing from the level of second wave as the daily cases are expected to surge to over 5,000 in a day in district. Microbiologist MGMMC Dr Sadhna Sodani, said, “Because of more transmissibility of Omicron than delta variant, the sampling should be more than that happened last year during peak.” “The increase in sampling will help in putting a check over its spread. Scientifically, the sampling should be increased”, said Dr Sodani. Crisis management committee member Dr Nishant Khare said, “Sampling should be increased and will be increase based on requirement. The daily review of the situation is undergoing.” “But, everything is not dependent on absolute numbers. There are other parameters like capacity to perform test, bed occupancy, oxygen requirement and others”, said Dr Khare. “Indore is in good situation and processing around 10,000 samples on daily basis. The sampling will further increase as an when require”, said Dr Khare. The district now could test around 20,000 samples through RT-PCR in a day by its network of over 20 labs. The alone public lab at MGMMC in this network has a testing capacity of around 2000 samples.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/sampling-at-max-capacity-but-experts-say-its-not-enough/articleshow/88820794.cms||Antriksh Singh

This comes after complaints that the government is taking a Bengaluru-centric approach with regard to Covid curbs. Now, any decision on school closure will be taken based on the situation at the taluk level.“We have decided to consider taluks as units. DCs and tahsildars are empowered to take a decision on school closure,” primary education minister BC Nagesh told TOI. He also made it clear that school closure will be the last option exercised by the government as it has affected academic activities adversely in the last two years.“Due to the school closure in the last two years, students endured irreparable loss. We don’t want to continue this. Decisions on school closure will be taken at taluk level based on the prevailing Covid condition in the respective area. Our data analysis revealed that there are not many cluster outbreaks in schools or infection among the students in the last two waves,” he explained.According to the state war room data dated January 7, more cases are being reported in urban areas compared to the villages. For example in Mysuru district, on January 8, cases were recorded in single digit in eight taluks. Only Mysuru city recorded cases in three digits.He also made it clear that mid-day meals will not be cancelled even if the schools are shut. “Already, we have issued directions to all the DDPIs. Emphasis will be given to serving warm cooked food. Only if difficult situation persists, dry ration will be supplied to the students,” he said.Teachers welcomed the minister’s statement. Chandrashekar Nuggi, the general secretary of the Government Teachers’ Association said teachers are ready to teach students even in difficult times.However, the private schools managements are cautious in their decision. According to them, the DPI must plan well ahead to implement this decision. D Shashikumar, the general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools said, this decision may result in more teaching hours in a few districts while less in other places. “This should not result in any confusion as the same syllabus is followed in all the districts,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/local-officials-to-decide-on-closure-of-schools/articleshow/88820808.cms||---

---||Delhi||74% of 46 who died of Covid in Delhi between January 5 & January 9 had comorbidities||NEW DELHI: January has seen 70 people succumb to Covid-19 within the first 10 days of the month, more than the combined toll of the last five months of 2021. Of the 46 who dies between January 5 and January 9, nearly 74% had comorbidities and only 24% were vaccinated. On January 5, Delhi saw eight people dying. From then till Sunday, when there were 17 deaths, a total of 46 Covid patients succumbed to the infection — 28 men and 18 women. More than half (25, or 54.3%) were aged 60 years or above, 14 were in the 41-60 year age group and five cases in the 21-40 age group. One was in the 16-20 group and one was younger than 15 years. In 37 cases, oxygen saturation level was lower than 94%. According to Delhi government data, 21 patients became infected after hospital admission. Most of the patients were in hospital for three-seven days before succumbing, though 12 died the day they were admitted to hospital. Among the 46, 34 patients had comorbidities. The figures indicate such patients at high risk of death. Another indication of fatality was the lack of full vaccination. The government sources said 76% of the deceased weren’t fully vaccinated. “The early trends of Covid fatalities suggests the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions remain vulnerable despite the mild nature of the Omicron variant which is behind the current wave of the pandemic,” said a government official. AIIMS Trauma Centre, which is a designated facility for Covid, alone has seen 12 infected patients dying in the last one week. “I do not remember the details about the individual cases. But the overall trend suggests that the disease is causing severe symptoms mostly in people with comorbidities and underlying medical conditions,” explained a senior doctor at AIIMS Trauma Centre. “Some of the patients who died at our hospital after testing positive for Covid had actually been admitted for other health emergencies and the coronavirus infection was a chance diagnosis.” At Fortis Healthcare, which runs 28 hospitals across the country, a senior official said that 22 deaths of Covid patients had been recorded between January 1 and January 9. “Those with comorbidities and not fully vaccinated are at highest risk, same as what is being seen in the US and Europe,” said a hospital spokesperson. Some doctors suggested that the Delta variant, which was behind the second wave, hadn’t vanished completely yet and that could also be causing severe symptoms in many Covid patients in the current surge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/74-of-covid-dead-had-comorbidities/articleshow/88819187.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Post-Covid parosmia robs 24-year-old from Nagpur of all good smells||NAGPUR: Covid-19 infection has brought yet another hitherto lesser known complication to the fore in the form of parosmia in which the patient experiences altered sense of smell. Nagpur’s 24-year-old Rishi Dubey is suffering from this rare type of post-Covid disorder for the last seven months. Rishi can’t eat any dish, howsoever tasty it may be, because the cuisine smells like rotten food to him. He can’t visit restaurants and hotels as the food preparation there smells like sewage or garbage to him. Even perfumes smell stinky. In temples, it’s impossible for him to stay for long because the fragrance of incense sticks smells like a decayed animal to him. “My father contracted Covid-19 in April, 2021, when the second wave was at its peak. I had to struggle a lot to find a hospital bed for him. During this period, I lost the ability to taste and smell. Considering it as a symptom of Covid-19, I isolated myself,” recalls Rishi. Though he recovered at home with some basic medicines, Rishi’s sense of taste and smell hardly came back. Gradually, things with good aroma started smelling bad to him. The same happened with taste buds. “For almost a month, I had no taste. Now, even if I take a bite of some spicy food or sweets, it tastes like filth to me. I just can’t eat,” said Rishi. This disorder has forced him to stop socializing. He has also lost weight. Rishi manages to eat only simple dal-roti and white rice as other things cause severe nausea to him. He also consulted specialist doctors. Modern medicine recognizes this disease, but has no complete cure. Doctors told TOI that parosmia is a potential symptom of long-haul Covid-19. It’s believed to stem from damage that occurs to the tissues involved in smell during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. “Parosmia can go away with time,” said Dr (Major) Vaibhav Chandankhede, head & neck surgeon, IGGMCH. “We have seen several cases of parosmia followed by Covid-19 in the last few months. It takes own time to recover. Sometimes, it could stay for months together,” he said. According to him, a technique called smell training may be used to treat parosmia due to Covid-19. “We call it as olfactory training. It involves sniffing the same group of scents for 20 seconds at a time. This is typically done at least twice a day for 3 months or longer,” said Dr Chandankhede. Making various lifestyle changes may also help the patient recover. These involve avoiding certain scents that may trigger parosmia such as meat, onion, eggs. Neurosurgeon Dr Ninad Shrikhande said parosmia cases have increased after the second wave of Covid-19. “It’s rare, but we have been receiving increased number of patients in the last six months. We don’t have any targeted medicine on it. General nerve reconstruction drugs are prescribed. But, eventually, the patients recover with time only,” said Dr Shrikhande.

The bench of Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas passed the order after hearing petitions filed by Aman Singh — who was principal secretary to then chief minister Raman Singh in the BJP regime — and Yasmin Singh, challenging the FIRs registered against them. Singh had submitted that he had voluntarily resigned from the services of the Chhattisgarh government in December 2018. He and his wife submitted that it’s a ‘malicious prosecution’ and they were being falsely implicated at the behest of the political dispensation. The petitioner’s counsel Abhishake Sinha, a senior advocate, had argued during the hearing that the ACB/EOW had acted under political pressure and the case on the charge of disproportionate assets has no legal basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-quashes-fir-against-aman-singh-wife-in-assets-case/articleshow/88820819.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Rare white-throated kingfisher spotted in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: A leucistic white-throated kingfisher was spotted in Bavla taluka of Ahmedabad, sparking joy among twitchers. Such birds with abnormal plumage condition are quite rare; this particular bird was photographed by ornithologist Devvratsinh Mori. The bird belongs to the genus Halcyon and according to the Greek legend, the halcyon could calm the sea waves when nesting (hence the term halcyon or peaceful days). Mori said, “In the last week of December, when I was clicking pictures of a common pochard (a medium-sized diving duck), I saw a white bird fly past. As the bird perched itself on a branch, I noticed that it was a partial leucistic white-throated kingfisher. While the colour of its eyes, feet and mandibles were not affected by the loss of pigmentation, its throat was white.” As opposed to albino birds, leucistic birds display normal pigmentation in other parts of the body, such as the beak, eyes, and legs. The percentage of leucistic birds in natural populations is rarely greater than one per cent, he said. A senior ornithologist unwilling to be quoted said, “Since the lockdown, sightings of such birds have increased. In December 2020, a leucistic common crane was sighted near Gandhidham in Kutch. The same month, white or leucistic greylag goose was sighted in Nal Sarovar in Ahmedabad. In 2020, white sparrows and white common babblers were also spotted.” He said that this was the second sighting of a leucistic bird in Ahmedabad, the first being the leucistic greylag goose. Leucism is also a genetic condition but does not result in a complete lack of melanin or colour. In this case, all colour pigments, including melanin, look slightly faded.

They were either tested as a part of protocols or contact tracing. The city has registered 35 Omicron cases so far but it is feared that the actual number might be much higher. The first persons to test positive were a couple who had returned from Zambia. They went for Covid-19 test at the insistence of their relatives. All eight close contacts of the couple, that were found to be infected by the Omicron variant, also tested positive in contact tracing. Later, genome sequencing confirmed that all eight were infected with the Omicron variant. Six other persons underwent RT-PCR tests, as they had to travel abroad. To their surprise, they were found positive. Some of them later tested negative and even travelled abroad before the genome sequencing results confirmed that they were infected with the Omicron variant. Advisor for Covid-19 in Vadodara Dr Sheetal Mistry said that the symptoms caused by the Omicron were very mild and hence there are chances that many may not realize that they have been infected. “There may have been Omicron cases even before the first case was detected,” he said. “People who have any symptoms should isolate themselves immediately and get tested. This will ensure that they do not spread it further,” Mistry said. The fact that those infected with Omicron variant never realise that they are sick could be a major reason for the high spread, experts feel. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that it was true that most cases were either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. “But in the case of persons with comorbidities, there can be complications. Such people need to be careful,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/23-out-of-35-omicron-cases-had-no-symptoms/articleshow/88819137.cms||Sachin Sharma

Aslam Khan, a shopkeeper at Handipura kite market, said sale was less than last year. “Rainfall and hailstorms have impacted our sales as people cannot go on the terrace to fly kites. Due to the surge in corona cases, we have been asked to close our shops by 8pm. People usually visit kite markets after office hours, but now they cannot,” said Khan. Sirajuddin Malik, a wholesaler of kites, said shopkeepers who used to purchase goods worth Rs 10,000 were apprehensive of buying kites worth even Rs 1,000. “As people cannot come to the market in the evening and with just three days to Makar Sankranti, shopkeepers are not sure whether they will be able to sell existing stocks,” he said. Fearing low sales due to Covid restrictions, only 15 sellers from Bareilly and Farrukhabad have arrived here and set up shops. The number is very low compared to the pre-corona era when more than 70 shopkeepers used to come. Rizwan Khan, a seller from Bareilly, said they were expecting a good market this year with the economic boom in November and December 2021, but with another wave, their sales were down by 70%. Meanwhile, the Lohri festival, which is celebrated with dhols and big gatherings, has also been affected and people have decided to celebrate at their homes. Ravi Naiyar, president of Pradesh Punjabi Mahasabha, who used to organise the biggest Lohri celebration at Raja Park, has cancelled the event.

They see it as another blow to their business, which had recently started recovering from the major losses endured during last year’s lockdown. Sumit Jain, a Jaipuri jooti shopkeeper in Johri Market said that he has been making a profit for the last two months but due to new restrictions imposed in the market his business is not secure. “I plan to close my rented shop in Johri market due to high rent and shift to another part of the city. The new restrictions have adversely affected our business,” said Jain. Merchants selling clothes, bags, masala, electronic and toy shops in the city have decided to start home delivery of their products if the lockdown is imposed. Kartik Maheshwari, a shopkeeper in Raja Park said, “I used to send kurti designs on WhatsApp to my customers and then home-deliver the products. If the situation worsens, I might have to restart the process.” As per the new guidelines, markets have to be shut by 8 pm, supposedly the peak shopping time for service class. Although in the walled city, the majority of the market is shut on Sundays, but outside, most shops are open on weekends too. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal said, “The government should think about the existence especially of street vendors who are solely dependent on people coming to market from 5 pm to10 pm. The earlier lockdown has already broken our backs and we have still not recovered from its impact. We have ordered big consignments for the upcoming festivals, which have now been cancelled. Every trader is dreading the impending losses.” However, with the rising number of corona cases, strict action by the government was needed, especially when people fail to follow Covid protocols of wearing masks and social distancing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/traders-fear-another-covid-lockdown-soon/articleshow/88820833.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Planners hit, many marriage garden bookings cancelled||JAIPUR: The city’s wedding industry has started reeling under losses following the home department's fresh restrictions limiting the number of guests to 50. Several wedding planners and retailers have been asked to return advance payments, venue bookings have been cancelled and most people have refused to purchase the customised clothes they had ordered. Kundan Lal, a sherwani merchant in Walled City, said although the grooms’ sherwanis were being purchased, other family members had cancelled their orders. “People are asking us to return their advance payments. Many sherwanis are ready to wear, but people are making excuses to collect them. We are facing major financial losses,” said Lal. As things started looking up in November and December last year and businesses were doing well, wedding planners, tent house owners and other retailers in the city had purchased extra materials in advance for the wedding season that will last till February 15. However, extra materials will now get wasted. Chuttan Lal Saini, president of the Flower Market Association in the city, said around 10,000 people associated with the flower business were facing 50% cancellations. “With just 50 guests, no one will want good decoration. Hence, flower merchants and decoration workers will not have any work in the next two months.” Tent owners, wedding bands, caterers and music organisers will also have to return advance money. Merchants have complained that when they were slowly recovering from losses, another Covid wave has damaged everything. With just 50 guests, weddings are shifting to hotels and resorts from wedding lawns and gardens. Bhawani Shankar, president of Wedding Gardens Association in Jaipur, said while they were facing losses due to strict protocols, there were no restrictions imposed on hotels and resorts. "The guidelines should have mentioned that wedding lawns should be spacious enough to accommodate guests with social distancing. With a blanket bar on the guests, we are again looking at massive losses, while resorts and hotels will make profits," said Shankar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/planners-hit-many-marriage-garden-bookings-cancelled/articleshow/88820835.cms||---

A senior forest official said as the majority of families opt for land packages, the forest administration is demanding more land to relocate villagers. The package includes six bighas, 60x90 square-feet plot and electric connection for agriculture. “In the meeting, we have apprised the chief secretary that 100 families in Lodge village will be shifted this year. After this, more land will be required to shift the village,” said an official.

Sunil Mehta, a member of state wildlife board and the committee said, “The last survey was conducted in 2008 for relocating these villages inside the forest. Over the years, many children have become adults and demanding compensation. The government on the priority basis should carry out a fresh survey.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/chalk-out-plan-to-shift-villages-from-tiger-reserves-arya/articleshow/88820836.cms||---

He admitted that the Mewat region covering Bharatpur and Alwar had become an epicenter of cybercrime.Expressing concern over rising cases of cybercrimes and cheating in Mewat region, he said, “In 2022, curtailing cybercrime would be one of the top priorities. We are coordinating with Telangana police to use their technical knowhow in cracking cyber-crimes. We will have a separate cybercrime police station in Bharatpur. Criminals of Mewat have been changing their modus operandi and it is becoming the Jamtara of Rajasthan. We will certainly adopt stronger means to curb cybercrimes and conning in Mewat.”Sharing the details on the crimes against women, he said, “Since police are open for registrations of FIRs, cases registered from courts have come down to 18% compared to 30% earlier,” he added.On rising rape incidents, he said, “Cases have increased because registrations are up and women are freely registering FIRs. In some of these FIRs, cases were found to be fake.”He said for controlling crimes against women, police have ensured timely investigation and charge-sheet in the case. “Earlier, we took nearly 200 days to complete a probe.

Experts say 200 days of guaranteed work under the scheme can sustain a family of five for a whole year and reduce chances of forceful migration by almost one-third. “Poverty is the only reason behind human trafficking from the tribal region to other states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra. It is seen that low-income families whose children are prone to trafficking don’t find the need to migrate if they get continuous work under MGNREGA,” said Jayesh Joshi, CEO of Vaagdhara, an NGO working with tribal populace. The observation has been made by the social justice and empowerment department. Over the years, human trafficking has declined in Banswara, Dungarpur and Udaipur, claimed officials, crediting it to the collective effort of civil society members, NGOs, advocacy groups and government departments. Banswara SP Rajesh Meena said police are heading a collective effort to put an end to the illegal practice. “The effort has created a mass awareness, built a strong network and helped in rehabilitating trafficked persons,” said Meena.In a report to National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in August 2021, SP Dungarpur had informed that there was no active human trafficking gang. “A special team of the district had also been formed and for the prevention, nakabandi and checking are being done continuously in police station areas bordering Gujarat,” reads the report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mgnrega-is-reducing-forceful-migration-from-the-tribal-regions/articleshow/88820848.cms||---

There are over 30,000 such temples in the state. Most of them are managed by one archak. There are archaks who earn less than Rs 5,000 per month. It some temples, located in interior parts of the state, if seva is permitted, the archak may earn around Rs 100 a day,” Bhat said. Last time, several organisations had come forward to extend help to the temples.Bhat said that an archak from a temple near Uppinangady who has to travel nearly 25 km from his house to the temple had invested on a two-wheeler during the first wave and during the second wave, due to the restrictions, he was finding it hard to pay for the fuel. There are many during the lockdown who used to live only on the naivedya (rice) offered to God.

The climb up the 80-foot long and slender areca tree is a dangerous exercise, attempted by people without safety gear. The obvious perils of this activity deter many youngsters from taking up work on areca farms. Thankfully, technology has offered owners of areca farms a way out of this problem.Primary agricultural credit societies have seen the merit in investing in ‘doti’, a carbon fire telescopic spraying a harvesting device, said agriculture researcher and editor of Adike Patrike, Shree Padre. “Youngsters are being trained to use this device. I have been urging more cooperative societies, in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod districts, to train youngsters in using this device. This will also have the added benefit of solving the problem of unemployment,” Padre said.He pointed out that youngsters trained in the use of ‘doti’ and employed on areca farms were earning up to Rs 25,000 a month. The device, Padre said, was the brainchild of NB Hegde, president of the Tyagali Agricultural Cooperative in Nanikatta. “Hegde started working on the project two years ago, when he realised that most labourers were migrating to Bengaluru. He thought that use of the doti in lieu of having them climb up trees could help persuade youngsters to continue farming. Tyagali society’s success inspired others to adopt the same method,” said Padre, cautioning that the device, doti, must not be brought into contact with power cables.Padre called on the agriculture department to introduce a programme to train youngsters in the use of the device under its Attracting and Retaining of Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) initiative.Among those who adopted Tyagali society’s model was the Kangod Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society. President of the society Yadalli has thus far trained 10 youngsters in the use of the doti. “All 10 of them have been booked to work on farms for the next two weeks,” he said.Meanwhile, Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative (Campco) Ltd has decided to organise a three-day training session at the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute in Vittal from January 10. Campco is organising the session, in association with the Adike Patrike and All India Areca Growers’ Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/technology-comes-to-aid-of-areca-farms/articleshow/88820871.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

While the women were already excited about exploring the Rann of Kutch, they were surprised by the welcome and respect they earned during the journey. Divya Poojary, a medical representative, rode a Royal Enfield Himalayan, Pooja Jain, a businesswoman, rode a KTM Duke 390 and Apoorva M and Krithi Uchil, who are software engineers, rode on a Yamaha MT-15. They started their journey from Mangaluru on December 24, and reached the Rann of Kutch on December 29. They returned to Mangaluru on January 5, and covered a distance of 4,300 km. They rode through Maharashtra, and clocked an average 500 km per day.Krithi Uchil who was instrumental in launching the Mangalore Bikerni chapter, told TOI that when they were planning the journey to witness the Rann Utsav, there were many women bikers who showed interest, but eventually dropped out. “Four of us were determined to complete the journey. Interestingly, when we were planning the ride, we met Apoorva, a mother of a six-year-old boy, through a common friend. When she heard about our plan, she was excited, which motivated her to buy a new Yamaha motorcycle the next day. She practised hard for two months, only to be part of this journey,” Krithi said. She said that when IPS officer Shivakumar flagged them on their endeavour, he told them to inspire women through their journey. “Throughout the journey, we received unexpected recognition everywhere we went, with people coming forward to take pictures with us. In Mangaluru too, people have begun to recognise us. The Kannada Sangha in Bhuj reached out to us, and one of the member’s hosted us in his house, and they also arranged for our visit to Vighakot. BSF personnel appreciated our efforts. Since Pooja has relatives in Surat, we halted for a day there, when we were going to the Rann of Kutch, as well as on our return. They arranged for a warm welcome on our return journey, with many from the biker community joining in,” Krithi said. Overall, it was a smooth journey, with no major breakdowns. They visited all the prominent tourist destinations in Gujarat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mluru-women-bikers-inspire-with-4-3k-km-ride/articleshow/88820875.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The situation is growing grimmer. About 25,000 girls and women have gone missing from the state,” Wagh alleged, during a media interaction in Nashik city. Wagh cited the incident in which a woman was allegedly being forced by a duo in Panchavati area to sit on a motorcycle and was rescued by her uncle, instead of the citizens and the police. “The public participation in rescue of the woman was not seen. People fear the police and are afraid of the local goons. People feel unsafe,” Wagh claimed. Wagh was on a tour of Nashik and visited several rural and tribal areas. She claimed that state government had failed to provide drinking water to the people in rural areas as a result of which they had to risk their lives to fetch water. Wagh also pointed out that many of the villagers have been demanding construction of roads from their villages – especially in tribal blocks to the headquarters. There were no buildings for their anganwadis that were declared in 2005 and 2010. Hence, the women were not able to get healthcare especially during their most important time of pregnancy. “We have decided to raise the issues with the state government and hence, our members will now be writing to the state government over one issue every day drawing the attention of the government towards the plight of the people of the rural areas of Maharashtra,” Wagh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/wagh-questions-govt-on-safety-of-women-in-state/articleshow/88820877.cms||---

This alliance between two former partners is essential for the betterment of Maharashtra,” Athawale told reporters on Monday.According to Athawale, Sena and BJP should be in power together in the state and he has always been trying for their re-union.When pointed out that the BJP would stake claim for the chief minister’s post, Athawale said Sena would no longer listen to 2.5 year of chief minister under seat-sharing formula. “Hence, new thought has to be given to it. I have experimented with Bhimshakti and Shivshakti and that has worked very well. I share good bonding with Sena. Given this I suggest the BJP should take up the post of deputy chief minister and allow Sena to be in command for the remaining term,” he said.On alleged security breach of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Punjab during his recent visit, Athawale said, “Local security is a state subject and hence the state is answerable for the security breach. The Prime Minister is not limited to a particular party and hence all have to stand by the protocol.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/shiv-sena-and-bjp-should-reunite-in-state-athawale/articleshow/88820878.cms||---

By 5.30 pm on Monday, the health staff in Nashik district administered at least 3,975 precaution doses, the authorities said. Of them, 927 doses were administered in Nashik city. Some of the senior citizens told TOI that they were happy that the government has started administering the precautionary dose. Nashik divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game, Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare, zilla parishad CEO Leena Bansod and superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil were among the prominent personalities, who took their third dose at the civil hospital. Game warned the people against taking Covid and Omicron, in particular, lightly. “The Omicron may not be very harmful to the vaccinated. Those who are unvaccinated continue to face the risk of infection affecting their lives. Therefore, people should take the due dose of vaccine at the earliest,” he said.Mandhare said as the vaccination programme for ‘precaution’ gets wider coverage, the large number of people who are at potential risk of getting infected will be covered but it does not mean they will be ‘protected’ against the infection. “In Mumbai, the reports said 96% of people who have been admitted were not vaccinated. This shows how vaccines cut down the risk to an individual’s health and life against the infection. People not taking vaccines should study the reports and take their jabs offered,” he said.People above 60 years of age can take the third dose on the advice of their doctor and does not present any kind of documents to prove comorbidity. “People should take their eligible doses of vaccine and thus help in protecting the community at large,” said Keshav Sathe, a 73-year-old resident of Old City.The citizens were critical about people not wearing masks and not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “It is our humble request to wear masks, frequently wash hands and maintain social distancing for safety of the community,” said Rajani Kulkarni another resident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/3975-precautionary-doses-given-in-nashik-dist-on-day-1/articleshow/88820880.cms||---

The silver lining though is that there are only 70 patients admitted in hospitals; all others are recovering at home. The health authorities in the rural areas said that the number of people requiring hospitalisation was very low thought they cautioned that this should not mean that virus was mild. “The virulence of the virus may be less, but the impact it causes on the body if it grows beyond a certain limit would be dangerous and even fatal – especially in case of comorbids. It is, therefore, important to ensure protection and safety against the infection no matter the vaccinated status,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, civil surgeon of Nashik civil hospital. At present, the number of people requiring admission is about five percent and the asymptomatic cases were around 92%. “The number of cases is rising and it is yet to settle. Hence, it would be too dangerous to draw any kind of conclusion over the rate of asymptomatic cases, and the effect on the body. However, the fact is that the number of hospitalisation and criticality among the patients is very low,” the officer added. Out of the 91 symptomatic cases, 70 required hospitalisation. Five patients were put on ventilators and 31 were on oxygen support. 34 patients were admitted because of their comorbidity. Some of these have been admitted for planned surgery and the RTPCR test has turned out to be positive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/few-patients-in-hospital-even-in-nashik-rural/articleshow/88820885.cms||---

The funds have been sanctioned by the central government, he said.Joshi said February 22 is the last date for submitting tenders and stipulated time for completing the work of converting the double road into six lane stretch and construction to two-way service road on either side of the bypass is two and half years. Tenders have been floated on engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) basis and the contractor will have to maintain the road for five years after the completion of the work.Only one toll plaza between Kelgeri and Narendra cross will be retained while all other toll plazas on the bypass will be removed. This will result in commuters between Hubballi and Dharwad being exempted from paying the toll. “This will also reduce the congestion of traffic in city limits. Most of the accidents were occurring because the drivers coming in high speed from highway used to enter the bypass with the same speed. Considering the experts’ opinion, I had pressed the central government to make this bypass a six-lane stretch” Joshi said. The 31-km stretch constructed by Nandi Highway Developers Limited (NHDL) in late 1990s and thrown open to public in 2000 has become a death trap with fatal accidents on the road being reported at frequent intervals. On the morning of January 15, 2021, an accident near Itigatti cross had claimed 13 lives. The accident had evoked sharp criticism from the citizens who had slammed the authorities for failing to widen the bypass. The police department was also blamed for not enforcing traffic management on the stretch.Taking a serious note of the accident, the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety had written to the principal secretary, transport department, government of Karnataka, seeking a detailed report on the accident and the measures proposed by the state government to prevent such accidents in future. The SC committee had also sought details on the number of accidents on the stretch and fatalities that occurred in the last two years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/tenders-invited-for-converting-nh-4-bypass-into-six-lane-stretch/articleshow/88820900.cms||---

If they were serious, they would have raised the Makedatu issue in an assembly session in Belagavi, he said. Keeping the assembly and BBMP elections in mind, the Congress was raising this issue now, he alleged. He said the government would take stern action if Covid norms were violated.Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar said the Congress leaders should have come for discussion with the government and dropped their padayatra plan.“This padayatra is sending the message that it is one rule for commoners and another rule for politicians. However, the government is not mute about their violations and the home minister is taking action as per law,” he said.In Haveri, agriculture minister B C Patil criticised the padayatra and alleged that the party does not have any concern for public health. The padayatra is irrelevant because the issue is in the Supreme Court, Patil said. State Congress chief D K Shivakumar was trying to build his political image by taking out this padayatra risking the lives of people before the assembly poll in 2023, the minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bjp-congress-does-not-care-for-people/articleshow/88820902.cms||---

This has brought cheer to two youths from Karnataka — Lingaraj Niduvani, an environmentalist from Sherewad village of Hubballi taluk and Manojkumar MS, a software professional from Davanagere — who had appealed to the ECI to bring in this reform. Niduvani told TOI that they had been communicating with the ECI since April 2018, requesting online nomination in order to avoid large rallies, shouting of slogans, bursting crackers, distributing leaflets, and blocking roads when nomination papers were being filed. “There were certain nuisances, such as bringing in paid workers and feeding and supplying them with alcohol. We approached the ECI after considering air and sound pollution as well as traffic congestion during the nomination process. Online nomination will avoid all this,” he added.Manojkumar said that they had even met Sanjiv Kumar, Karnataka Chief Election Officer (CEO) in Bengaluru pressing for online nomination for 2019 Lok Sabha election. “We had mentioned that when job aspirants and poor beneficiaries of ration card can upload all required documents, why can’t it be done for election nominations too.

---||Chandigarh||Conversion of leasehold properties to freehold sought||Chandigarh: City traders urged the Chandigarh administration to resolve their longstanding demand for conversion of leasehold properties into freehold in the commercial and industrial areas, phases I and II.A delegation of Chandigarh Business Council (CBC), led by CBC president Chander Verma, met UT adviser Dharam Pal and submitted a demand charter of traders, including conversion of leasehold properties into freehold, reduction in collector rates and one-time settlement of VAT cases on Punjab pattern etc. The Chandigarh administration had recently written to the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) for giving in-principle nod for conversion of leasehold properties into freehold in the commercial and Industrial Area, phase I and II. Thereafter, UT adviser Dharam Pal also met MHA officials and raised this demand.In 2020, before lockdown was enforced, the matter was discussed in a meeting between UT officials and members of Industrial Advisory Committee of Chandigarh. The UT administration had last converted leasehold plots into freehold in 1983 in the commercial category. The matter was also taken up by MP Kirron Kher with the MHA.Recently, the UT administration had conducted a survey in Industrial Area to check leasehold plots. The administration had set up Phases I and II of Industrial Area during the 1970s on an area measuring 147 acres. The plots are governed by zoning and architectural control, which were prepared as per the conditions prevailing at that time. There are 1,884 plots in both phases, of which 700 are 1 kanal and above, while there are 443 and 180 plots measuring 10 and 15 marlas, respectively. There are as many as 381 plots of 5 marlas.Need-based changesIn 2019, the administration allowed Business to Business activities in industrial area and need-based changes in Industrial Area. Owners have made changes in building plans in violation of bylaws, for which they were facing misuse notices. They accused the administration of not amending the bylaws on time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/conversion-of-leasehold-properties-to-freehold-sought/articleshow/88820904.cms||---

He was 82.Patil, known as Champa in literary circles, was loved for his sarcastic, witty style.His plays Gokarnada Goudashani, Kodegalu, Kunta Kurvatti and Gurtinavaru made waves in 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, some of his political moves divided his admirers. Patil was the discovery of Jnanpith awardee litterateur Dr V K Gokak, who was the principal of the Karnatak College in Dharwad when he enrolled as a student of English literature after completing his matriculation at Haveri in 1956.Gokak, himself a versatile writer in English and Kannada, honed the talents of several of his students. He used to organise poetry sessions to guide and encourage interested students. Patil was one of the beneficiaries.Although Patil studied and taught English literature, his pursuit as a writer was in Kannada, like many other English teachers.After completing his degree in Karnatak College and his post-graduation and PhD in Karnatak University, Patil taught for a while in the college before being promoted to the post-graduate department of English in Karnatak University. Patil also participated in the movement launched by Jayaprakash Narayan in early 1970s and for opposing Indira Gandhi’s imposition of national Emergency, he was jailed for a few days.Along with his classmate Giraddi Govindraj and Siddhalinga Pattanshetti, Patil started a Kannada literary magazine called Sankramana in 1964. The magazine promoted new writers, especially from north Karnataka and was a platform for lively and scholarly debates on controversial but relevant issues. After his friends left the magazine, Patil continued to edit and publish the magazine on his own.Patil led the Gokak agitation for primacy to Kannada in the school curriculum in early 1980s and protested against his guru Gokak too.Patil pioneered the Bandaya Sahitya or rebel literature movement in Karnataka and organised the first state-level Bandaya Sahitya Sammelana at Dharwad as a parallel to Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelana organised by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat. However, he later headed the same Parishat and occupied the president’s chair in Akhila Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelana organised by it in 2017.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/champa-activist-writer-known-for-his-politics-and-wit/articleshow/88820905.cms||---

The decision was taken during a meeting held at DAV College, Chandigarh in which representatives of all colleges participated. DAVCTU president Sumit Goklaney said, “Teachers' fight was against the injustice of the government in which students gave their full support. The government neither thought of teachers nor students of the state. With the enforcement of the model code of conduct in the state, it made no sense to make students suffer for the rigid stance of the government. However, the struggle for implementation of the 7th CPC and revocation of the the government's decision to delink teachers' pay scales from UGC will continue by other means.” The teachers added that the PCCTU district council would meet in a few days and decide on a future course of action.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/teachers-call-off-protest-to-hold-semester-exams/articleshow/88820907.cms||---

The least doses of 82 were taken by the frontline warriors, while elderly accounted for 511. The CoWIN portal had a glitch as it asked for employees’ registration who had already been registered during early doses, while it got stuck for an hour for the elderly group. R P Sharma (83), who took his booster shot after a gap of nine months, said, “We are glad we have been cared for by the government and have been covered under the precautionary doses.” The targeted population of 60-year plus with co-morbidities in Chandigarh is 15,600. Further, the targeted population of health care workers and frontline warriors is 26,237 and 22,438. “Within an hour, I had heaviness in my head. But after paracetamol, I was up. This was surprisingly not during any of my doses earlier. But I feel safer now,” said Prof Arnab Pal, department of biochemistry, PGI. For children between the age group of 15years and 18 years, in some places health care workers came late and the vaccination was delayed. The UT health department reasoned that it was due to the addition of 10 new teams and there were some issues of training. “We will try to improve. We apologise to the parents and the children for the inconvenience where the teams reached late,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. A total of 602 people turned up for the Covid-19 booster dose in Panchkula and 127 in Mohali on Monday.

---||Chandigarh||Gyms help people stay fit, why shut them: Owners||Chandigarh: The Covid restrictions imposed by the UT administration have left gym owners staring at financial losses due to closure of their places. People in the fitness industry argued the administration has allowed restaurants and bars to operate with 50 per cent seating capacity, but gyms have been shut, calling the move unfair for the industry that provides employment to many families. Pankaj Kasrija, who runs a prominent chain of gyms in Chandigarh, said their industry follows Covid protocols and sanitises premises and equipment on a regular basis. “Many of us are still trying to recover from the financial losses suffered during first and second wave of Covid,” he said. “The administration should consider our demand and instead of complete closure, allow us to operate with at least 50 per cent capacity,” he demanded. Echoing similar views, Shaurya Khilani, who runs a prominent fitness centre in the city, said the administration should listen to their point of view as well before imposing curbs like complete closure. “The industry is yet to recover from the earlier losses and many are struggling for survival ever since the first closure due to the pandemic last year. Exercising keeps people fit and the administration should encourage opening of gyms instead of their closure,” he said. “We are hopeful the UT administration will consider our genuine demand in its next war room meeting,” he said. Khilani said, “In our centre, we use our mobile application to manage memberships and bookings. We can curb or restrict the number of people at the gym at any given time. We have designated workout areas for each member..”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/gyms-help-people-stay-fit-why-shut-them-owners/articleshow/88820922.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Those who were given consultation were asked for a follow-up after two months. PGI reported consulting 3,000 patients through tele-consultation, while in routine, over 8,000 patients are given consultation in OPDs. Similarly, GMCH attended to 484 patients in the OPD through teleconsultation, while on an average the daily footfall is around 5,000 a day. In GMSH, 1,336 patients were seen, while 183 were provided teleconsultation. GMCH conducted eight elective surgeries while others were put on hold. PGI conducted 20 elective surgeries, which in routine is around 50 a day. “I had come from Saharanpur and was not aware about the OPDs not being functional. We were called by our doctor a month ago for a follow-up for my brother’s severe liver disease. But we have been asked to come after three months now without any further test,” said Ayub Khan, an attendant to a patient in PGI. Due to the surge in Covid cases and the high rate of infection among health care workers, it was decided by the UT administration to close the physical walk in OPDs. A total of 549 health care workers from December 20, 2021, till January 9 have been infected with Covid in the PGI, while around 40 such workers were affected in GMCH. The PGI has opened 29 lines for different centres and departments for teleconsultation, while GMCH has 15 mobiles, equal number of landlines and online appointment open for the OPDs. “These lines are often busy and it is difficult to get through.

Sources said the names may take some days to come out due to multiple political and other reasons.The Punjab and Haryana high court had removed the voting rights of the nominated councillors in 2017. Former councillor and senior BJP leader Satinder Singh had challenged the decision, terming there was no such provision in any rules or constitution. Later, the UT administration had moved the Supreme Court against the HC order.Sources said many BJP leaders were keen on either them or their family members be adjusted in the MC as a nominated councillor. However, this has been causing some internal tussle. A senior BJP leader said, “A former BJP councillor, who is also a senior leader, is trying his best to become a nominated councillor, but there is resentment among others. If it happens, many leaders will be annoyed.” Sources said the administration has received many applications and BJP leaders and city MP were also involved discreetly to “recommend” the names for the nomination. The UT administrator is taking time to finalise the names.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-rush-entry-of-9-nominated-councillors-to-take-some-time/articleshow/88820933.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Allahabad||Taking up Covid challenge, BJP wooing voters digitally||Prayagraj: The district Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership has drawn an elaborate plan to connect with the voters digitally in view of the Covid-19 restrictions. Prayagraj district has 12 assembly seats, including Allahabad North, Allahabad South, Allahabad West, Phaphamau, Bara, Koraon, Meja, Phulpur, Pratappur, Handia, Soraon and Karchhana. BJP has around 2,500 panna pramukh, including senior leaders in each segment. These 30,000 panna pramukhs would be connecting with around 46 lakh voters to woo them ahead of the polling day. Each panna pramukh has been assigned to connect with at least 60 voters of the area. A ‘panna pramukh’ in-charge of a page of voters’ list is the first ‘point of contact’ for most voters in the party’s election management machinery. The party is focusing on strengthening booths and has allotted responsibility of ‘panna pramukhs’ to party post-holders from booth to the higher office-bearer level. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener (Media) Ashish Gupta told TOI, “The party has already started its digital campaign, and each panna pramukh is making efforts to connect with at least 60 voters of the area through social media platform/WhatsApp group to woo them. Besides, five active party workers at each and every booth of the district are also making efforts to connect with the voters of the concerned assembly segment, apprising them about the Union and state government’s achievements.” He admitted that the party undoubtedly has a definite edge in the current prevailing Covid-19 scenario and is focussing on social media platforms. “The social media and IT cell of the party had already held a brain-storming session at the party's district headquarter, Civil Lines last week and claimed that social media has become the voice of the people,” he added. Gupta said, “IT and social media cells of the party have also been given responsibility to take the Union and state government popular policies to the masses so that the lotus (BJP poll symbol) blooms again in the state.” He added that the majority of party leaders and workers are tech-savvy and taking advantage of social media platforms since the 2014 parliamentary polls. “The party has also roped in ‘samajik tolis’ (social teams) for campaigning and leaders of all cells, including Minority Morcha, Mahila Morcha, OBC Morcha, and others have been assigned the task of promoting party’s policies and connect with the voters,” he added. Moreover, the party already has more than 1,200 lakh booth-level WhatsApp groups in the district, which will be used to maximum advantage in view of campaigning in all 12 assembly segments. The party has already set up a war room for campaigns at the local level and its IT and social media teams are connecting with voters through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, among others. Dr. Shailesh Kumar Pandey, state co-convener (National Training Campaign) told TOI, “At a time when physical campaigning is restricted, we are working to maximize the use of social media platforms and virtual campaigning to connect with the voters ahead of polling day. The party leadership has its blueprint in place and campaign through social media has been kicked off in the district.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/taking-up-covid-challenge-bjp-wooing-voters-digitally/articleshow/88819234.cms||---

The potters were hoping to make some good returns this Pongal season after rain played spoilsport to the business.C Nagalingam, cashier of the Manamadurai Manpanda Tholizhalar Kooturavu Kudisai Thozhil Sangam, a society that would turn 100 years in four years’ time, says that the continuous rains affected their production drastically, in the last four months.There are thirty potters in Manamadurai, and they have three halls each in which they store and dry their products. Once a pot is made it is dried in the sunlight directly for an hour and then moved to a shade, where it is kept for about three days, before being fired. But, rain had affected the firing process, damaging about 50% of the pots they made, he said.Though people use brass and stainless steel vessels to make ‘pongal’, it is a mud pot that still continues to be used in all the villages in south Tamil Nadu. A new mud pot is purchased every year, as it is expected to bring prosperity, said T Ganeshan, a potter.“The demand was good this season, but we could not supply it, and we sold pots for about only Rs5 lakh, which was about Rs 10 lakh during the festival in the pre-Covid period,” he said.“Now, people are buying a wide range of mud pots in different shapes as it has become fashionable,” said Rani, a potter. Pots range from Rs 60 onwards, based on the size and type of firing.Poovanthi in Sivaganga district is another place where pots are made for Pongal by about 40 families. “The pots made here are made from the sand in the Vaigai river, and the mud from the local tank, which gives the pots extra sturdiness,” said S Manikandan, a potter. He said that they were trying to meet the demand, but the sudden lockdown had once again made things uncertain.Shanmugapriya T of K K Nagar said that she had been using mud pots to make Pongal for more than seven years. “Pots that come now can withstand the heat of gas stoves and the pongal turns out tasty,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/pot-makers-hit-by-rain-covid-struggle-to-revive-business/articleshow/88820951.cms||---

According to the CWC, the baby was born to the couple a few days ago at the primary health centre at Melakkal. When the doctor and nurses came to know that the child was their third girl child, they counselled the couple and asked whether they could afford to take care of the child. When the couple expressed that they would not be able to do so, the doctor alerted the district CWC. Subsequently, the baby girl was produced before the committee on Monday morning. The baby was surrendered to CWC chairperson Dr V M Vijaya Saravanan and CWC member B Pandiaraja. The child was named ‘Anjali’ and will be cared for at an authorised adoption centre. “We want to create more awareness among the public that anyone who cannot afford to take care of a child, no matter the circumstances, can always surrender the child to the CWC or just approach any government hospital or PHC instead of taking any drastic measures or abandon the child,” said Pandiaraja. The surrender of baby ‘Anjali’ was the first such case this year at the Madurai district CWC. As per the data from the CWC in 2021, a total of 16 children, including 13 girls and three boys were surrendered in Madurai district. The number was less compared to 2020 when 27 children were surrendered during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the Madurai district CWC and the district child protection officer visited the boy who was part of a family of five who had attempted suicide together due to fear of Covid-19 by consuming poison. Two of the family died on Sunday. Adhiswaran, 16, survived without suffering any damage to his health as he had not consumed the poison properly. His brother Sibiraj, 13, and mother Lakshmi are undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, while his sister Jothika and three-year-old nephew Ritish died. The CWC and district child protection officer offered their assistance to the child and also helped him get a medical check-up as he is believed to have developed renal issues. They also offered counselling to the three survivors of the family and support for the care of Adhiswaran and Sibiraj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/couple-surrenders-third-girl-child-to-madurai-dist-cwc/articleshow/88820952.cms||---

Health officials also warned that cases are comparatively low in those districts, but the public must follow Covid-19 safety measures strictly to prevent its spread.Ramanathapuram, Tenkasi and Theni had consistently been reporting hardly one or two cases in December 2021 before the third wave. However, now, these districts are also witnessing around 50 cases per day. But, the districts are testing only less than 1,000 samples daily, whereas most southern districts are testing an average of at least around 2,000-3,000 samples per day.“We are testing around 600 samples per day on average. As per protocol, we are testing contacts of Covid-19 patients, those with symptoms of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), pregnant women etc. through fever camps. Last week, we had hardly a few cases. So naturally testing was also less. But, now that cases have increased, and we will be improving testing,” said a health official in Ramanathapuram. The official further said that cases have been so far sporadic in the district rather than emergence of clusters. Positivity rate in Ramanathapuram had risen from 2.5% on January 7 to 7.7% on January 10.In Theni and Tenkasi districts, the number of samples being tested are around 1,000 or less than that. In Theni, the positivity rate rose from 0.7% on January 7 to 5.9% on January 10, while in Tenkasi, the positivity rate rose from 2.7% on January 7 to 4.6% on January 10. “On days such as Sunday, sample collection was less. However, we are now testing around 1,100 samples per day. We will be increasing it to 2,000 in the next few days. The number of cases is less in a district does not mean the public can let their guard down,” said a health official from Theni.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/few-southern-districts-yet-to-ramp-up-testing-despite-rise-in-covid-19-cases/articleshow/88820954.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

While Jothika, 23, and her son Ritish, 3, died, her mother Lakshmi, 46, and brothers Adhi, 16, and Sibiraj,13, survived the suicide pact.Inquiries revealed that they took the extreme step as Lakshmi’s husband Nagaraj, a labourer, who was the breadwinner of the family, died in December. Jothika was also abandoned by her husband, and the family fell into depression.A few days ago, Jothika tested positive, raising fears of the virus and livelihood of the family.In his statement on Monday, OPS said health department and civic body personnel had advised Jothika to be subjected to home quarantine and also sprinkled bleaching powder around their house. The AIADMK leader said that neighbours started treating the family indifferently, worsening the mental state of the family.OPS said apart from focusing on treating those affected from the virus to help them recover and contain the spread, the government should also focus on the mental health of the affected people and their family as they would be in distress due to indifference shown by neighbours.He urged the government to understand the financial implications of the pandemic on such families and help them. He urged the government to provide compensation to the kin of the deceased .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/take-steps-to-prevent-covid-fear-says-ops/articleshow/88820956.cms||---

A fine of Rs 45,000 each has also been imposed on the duo. The case was almost like a rerun of the 2012 Nirbhaya case in Delhi. The 30-year-old woman, who was on her way from Bareilly to Rampur, had boarded a private bus. It halted at Shishgarh town, 50 km from Bareilly city, at about 9.30 pm on March 8. She was told the bus would proceed to Rampur later. She was carrying her 15-day-old son with her and decided to wait in the bus.There were no other passengers on board. Taking advantage of the situation, bus conductor Ishwari Prasad and helper Shiv Kumar assaulted and raped her. In her struggle to free herself and flee, she dropped her baby who died. Later, the culprits threw the woman and her dead baby out of the bus and sped away. “The woman never came out of the trauma and died in 2017. But she had recorded her statement before a magistrate under section 164 of the CrPC before her death,” said Harendra Rathore, additional district government counsel. Judge Brijesh Kumar Yadav considered the circumstantial evidence to convict the accused. Three people were named in the chargesheet by police and one of them was acquitted due to lack of evidence, said Rathore. A letter has also been sent to the district jail to release him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/2-get-20-yr-jail-for-raping-woman-causing-death-of-her-15-day-old-baby/articleshow/88820964.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In Patna alone, the number exceeded 10,000 and reached 11,707 on Monday. According to the health department’s data, the state had 98 active cases on December 26 and 16,897 on Sunday.Since Patna is the Covid hotspot in Bihar at the moment, the majority of active cases are concentrated in this district. On December 26, it had 60 active cases, which increased to 9,122 on January 9. The virus has begun to spread to remote areas and far-flung districts as well. As of December 26, Bihar had 21 districts with no active Covid cases, while another 16 had cases in the single digits. At the time, only Patna had 60 cases.Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus this year, which health officials attribute primarily to the Omicron variant, all districts of Bihar had active Covid-19 cases as of January 9. For instance, Gaya had the second highest number of active coronavirus cases after Patna on Sunday, with 1,204 people still recovering. On December 26, the district had nine active cases.Muzaffarpur was third from the top with 728 active cases on January 9, compared to just one on December 26.

It has deployed a large number of officials and security personnel to manage the massive rush of passengers at the Patna Junction, which falls under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR).According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, a team of railway officials led by Danapur additional divisional railway manager Bibhuti Bhushan Gupta, Patna Junction director Dr Nilesh Kumar, and other supervisory staff conducted a surprise inspection of the station premises on Sunday evening to determine whether passengers were adhering to the Covid safety protocols.“The team paid a visit to the circulating areas of the Patna Junction, including the Mahavir Temple and the Karbigahiya-end. They thoroughly inspected the waiting halls, ticket booking counters, passenger reservation system counters, retiring room areas, foot overbridges, and main concourse area of the Patna Junction. People seen without masks and those found spitting on platforms were immediately fined,” the CPRO told this reporter on Monday.He added, “The team also distributed free masks to the poor and needy.”A source said, “Government Railway Police personnel are penalizing the passengers who enter the platforms of the Patna Junction without face masks.

---||Patna||Covid-19 third wave may peak by month-end in Bihar: Doctors||PATNA: Medical experts treating Covid-19 patients have claimed that the current wave of the pandemic will reach its peak in the state by the end of this month or early February. They assert that the virus, dubbed the Omicron strain, is spreading rapidly amid the ongoing vaccination drive, which may result in the development of herd immunity in the near future. “The Covid scenario in Bihar is likely to peak between January 24 and 26, with 15,000 to 20,000 new positive cases being discovered daily,” Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), told this reporter and added that the current R-value, which indicates a disease’s ability to spread, was 4.5 (five people infected by a single patient). Although the nature and characteristics of the current wave point to Omicron infections with faster transmission but lower virulence, Dr Sanjeev cautioned that “now is not the time to relax and disregard Covid-appropriate behaviour”. Besides, Dr Pankaj Tiwari of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) predicted that the pandemic would peak at the end of this month or early February. “Combating a viral infection strengthens one’s immunity. Once a significant proportion of the state’s population, say around 65%, is immunised either through vaccinations, infection, or a combination of the two, we refer to this as achieving herd immunity,” the PMCH doctor explained. He continued, “Even if the virus undergoes additional mutations, the likelihood of it losing its virulence is greater.” Another AIIMS-P doctor, Anil Kumar, who returned to duty following a week-long home isolation, speculated that the pandemic’s peak would occur between January 25 and February 15. He added, “Not all mutations in a virus are pathogenic. The Omicron strain is currently spreading at an alarming rate and has been designated as a variant of ‘concern’, whereas strains undergoing mutations that have no discernible effect on human health but are significant scientifically are designated as variants of ‘interest’.” Dr Satish Kumar of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, also said, “Almost 10 to 15 days from now, the infection rate will peak and then decline.” He claimed that a large number of villagers in the state continued to dismiss Covid-related infection as “cold and flu”. “Such misconceptions can land them in serious trouble,” the doctor warned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/third-wave-may-peak-by-mth-end-docs/articleshow/88820969.cms||VK Tripathi

JD(U) has also sent a two-member team of its senior leaders to Panaji, the capital of Goa, to finalise the number of seats the party would contest and the names of its candidates. The JD(U)’s two national general secretaries – Afaque Ahmad Khan and Harshvardhan Singh – who reached Panaji on Saturday evening, held a series of talks with the party’s state unit and the prospective candidates, even from other parties, to finalise the names of candidates for Goa assembly polls, sources in the party said. JD(U) had earlier announced to contest the assembly polls only in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur, out of the five states going to polls in February and March this year. But the party has now decided in Goa as well. Contacted over phone, Khan admitted that he was camping in Goa to assess the election scenario. He added the JD(U) would not join hands with any political group in Goa. Goa, which has 40 assembly constituencies, will vote on February 14. According to the poll schedule announced by the Election Commission, the notification for assembly polls in the coastal state will be issued on January 21, while the last date to file nomination papers is January 28. Scrutiny of nominations will be held on January 29 and January 31 is the last date to withdraw nominations. JD(U) will contest assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the BJP, while it will go solo in Manipur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/assembly-polls-jduto-go-it-alone-in-goa/articleshow/88820973.cms||Madan Kumar

A Patna high court division bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice S Kumar, while hearing the PIL in virtual mode, asked the respondents, including chief secretary, DGP, SSP and city SP of Patna to file their response in the matter.The petitioners – advocates Surendra Kumar Singh and Sanjeev Kumar Mishra – had prayed the court to issue a direction for constitution of a separate task force for implementation of liquor prohibition law in the state. “It will reduce workload on the police and they will be in a position to take immediate action against those involved in other crimes, such as theft, robbery and chain snatching,” they mentioned in the PIL.The petitioners had also sought periodic patrolling by police in residential colonies, highways and flyovers for protection of life and property of senior citizens in Patna. Advocate Singh, while placing his case on Monday, alleged that police personnel were preoccupied in implementing prohibition law at the cost of deterioration of law and order in the state.Singh said cases of theft and burglary have increased in Patna and elsewhere in the state as the police were overburdened.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hc-seeks-states-reply-on-plea-toset-up-task-force-for-liquor-duty/articleshow/88820974.cms||---

The CJP, floated by Tej in September last year after his differences with RJD state president Jagadanand Singh, has urged the RJD leadership to authorise Lalu’s elder son to select the party candidates for 25% of the 24 council seats. “If the RJD gives six seats to the CJP, it would extend its full support to all candidates of the RJD,” the Parishad’s state president Prashant Pratap Yadav said in a written statement here. The CJP state chief also warned that the RJD would not win the council polls without the patronage of ‘Shri Krishna.’ Here, he used the term ‘Shri Krishna’ for Tej, who frequently dresses like Lord Krishna. “It should be kept in mind that victory is impossible without the patronage of Shri Krishna. The results of the recent assembly byelection in the state were examples,” the CJP state president said. The CJP’s demand has caused a flutter in the RJD circles. Political analysts feel the CJP has raised the demand at the advice of Tej, who did not miss any chance to cause an embarrassment for the RJD leadership. The 24 seats in the council had fallen vacant on July 16, 2021 after the previous elected MLCs completed their six-year term. Members of an electoral college comprising the elected representatives of the PRIs, urban local bodies (ULBs) and the cantonment boards cast their votes in the election to the MLCs from the local authorities’ constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tejs-outfit-to-rjd-spare-6-of-24-council-seats-for-us/articleshow/88820976.cms||Madan Kumar

---||---||Goa: Michael Lobo resigns from cabinet and as MLA, quits BJP||PANAJI: In a major embarrassment to BJP, science and technology minister Michael Lobo on Monday resigned from CM Pramod Sawant’s government, and also as MLA. The former minister, who represented Calangute, also resigned from the primary membership of BJP. BJP’s Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said that he called Lobo on Sunday night asking him not to quit the party and be patient for a day, and that he would come to Goa to resolve all issues. However, Lobo told Fadnavis that it was too late, and that he had already made up his mind to quit. Chief minister Pramod Sawant too said he tried contacting Lobo on Sunday night. “I will take a decision on whether to join Congress or contest as an independent within the next two days,” Lobo told TOI. Sources said Lobo's induction could not happen on Monday evening after the Congress block committees of Saligao, Siolim and Calangute wrote strong letters to the party high command on the issue. Since the news broke that Lobo was set to join Congress, its functionaries are strongly opposing his entry. “It was quite a long, good journey with BJP,” Lobo said. The former minister said BJP does not want karyakartas like him, and that if they don’t want you, you yourself should move out and not wait for them to throw you out. “The best way is to exit in the best way, and I will always be friends with chief minister Pramod Sawant. It was nice working with him as minister in the cabinet,” he said. Lobo said that he realised that the party has sidelined him. “When you are sidelined, the next step is to leave the party,” he said. He also pointed out that he had not asked for a party ticket for his wife Delilah, as BJP had already declared the ticket to Dayanand Mandrekar in Siolim. “I have not quit BJP because my wife was not given the ticket. I was made to understand I don’t have any place in the party, and thus I have to exit. I am a 15-year-old karyakarta, and as there is no place for me in the party, I have exited,” he said. Lobo is the third MLA from the minority community to resign as MLA. With the twin exits of Lobo and Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye, BJP’s strength in the Goa legislative assembly has now dropped to 23. Lobo stressed that he would not have not resigned as minister, MLA and from BJP if former chief minister Manohar Parrikar was alive. “Parrikar was a tall leader. I have a lot of good memories with him. He used to resolve issues sitting across the table. We also had arguments on several occasions. Even when he did not agree, he used to understand what was on our mind,” said Lobo. He said constituents of Calangute would give him an opportunity to serve them again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/lobo-resigns-from-cabinet-and-as-mla-quits-bjp/articleshow/88827186.cms||---

The four days consecutive rains have undoubtedly delayed the project in completion but magh mela officials were running from pillar to post to repair chequered plates, pumping sand into water logging areas and repairing of ghats. District Magistrate (Magh Mela) Shesh Mani Pandey told TOI that the four days rains hampered the mela projects but we are now taking hectic preparations to complete the projects on time. He admitted that many ghats constructed for bathing of devotees got submerged due to rise in the level of water in river as well as continuous rains. However, teams have been engaged to repair the ghats. Moreover, activities were also taken up to repair chequered plates in all sectors as levelling of chequered plates got disturbed due to continuous rains. The mela campus also witnessed water logging in many spots spreading from sector two to five and teams of labourers are now pumping sands to solve the waterlogging problem. A senior PWD official said, “The rains had delayed the work of laying chequered plates and water pipe lines in sector two to five. As majority of streets were turned up muddy and slippery, the labourers were not able to take up work in such conditions”. He, however, said, “We have now taken up pending works on war footing level and all works would be completed by January 14. The 47 days magh mela is beginning from January 14 on the banks of Ganga.

Now, if there are any more political rallies, then we will also be forced to open school with the consent of the parents. The government has failed to support both parents and the school managements. The decision to close the schools after there managements have gone through a financial crisis is worrisome. We want to be allowed to open schools with 50% strength.” The director of a private school at Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar said: “Political rallies are in full swing with huge crowd and long processions. Restaurants, bars, cinema houses, and malls are open with 50% capacity. Temples, gurdwaras, mosques, churches are all open with 100% capacity. Then why only the educational institutes are closed? Why only the education sector must suffer?”The diretor said: “Children are facing behavioral changes such as anxiety, panic attacks, stress, depression, and personality disorders because of being confined to home. How is the government going to help them? Covid-19 spreads from the political rallies mainly and the educational institutes are made to suffer for that, which is not fair.”Punjab Private School Organisation Ludhiana chapter president S K Chawla told TOI: “We demand from the Punjab government that it should permit the schools to open with 50% attendance of students. They have claimed that the schools will be permitted to open after January 15. If the government fails to keep its word, then it should pay salaries to our staff , teachers, and non-teaching workers such as bus drivers and conductors.”Chawla said: “Besides, they should exempt us from paying road tax, insurance, electricity bill, property tax, and water tax. It should also enforce the RTE Act or ask for building safety and fire safety equipment and certificates. Also, it should refund the examination fee to the students.”Punjab Private School Organisation secretary general Tejpal Singh said: “The government should provide the poor students enrolled in private schools with laptop computers or smartphones and free recharge packs if they insist that we provide them with online classes. If the government doesn’t accept the demands, it should come up with a radical action programme to save the existence of unaided private schools of the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/schools-want-to-open-with-50-strength-parents-nod/articleshow/88820985.cms||Mehak Jain

This man is Charan Kanwal Singh Sekhon.At 50, Sekhon is a UK councillor from Sharnbrook (Bedfordshire), an officer of the British government, and founder chairman of SEVA Trust volunteer organisation that works for education, health, social welfare, and environment in Britain and the north Indian region of Punjab and Haryana. He has brought laurels to his ancestral village in Ludhiana and his family many times before, and the queen’s award is latest of his achievements.Sekhon has been given this recognition for his work in the fields of charity, environment, diversity, and Covid-19 support. He is the UK’s first British Sikh officer of Indian origin to receive this honour while serving the environment agency. His achievement has brought a sense of pride and joy to the villager of Barundi and the Sekhon family.Sekhon’s father, Narinder Singh, who was a government school headmaster, said: "His achievement has made me so proud that I can’t express in words. Today, I recall the words of his schoolteacher, that one day Charan Kanwal will be very successful. Another thing that fills me with pride is that for long, Charan Kanwal was known by my name, that he is son of school headmaster Narinder Singh, but after today, people will recognise me by his name."Speaking with TOI from the UK, Sekhon said: "I am very surprised and I feel incredibly humbled to receive this recognition. It is also a reflection on the team effort and the enormous support and guidance I received from my colleagues at the environment agency, UNISON, and our fantastic team of volunteers that together with us makes SEVA Trust UK, a community charity that we launched six years ago."Asked about his work, Sekhon said: "During the challenging times of Covid-19, we managed to help a lot of vulnerable work colleagues and diverse communities that faced hardships. During Covid-19, our volunteers in Bedfordshire, Milton Keynes, and Hertfordshire, where hundreds of vulnerable families, homeless, rough-sleepers, and international students were in distress, provided them with food and other essential items. It could have been possible because of the team work and dedication our members demonstrated to uplift the others. I must also thank my entire family for teaching me the true meaning of life."Another villager of Barundi, Gurdeep Singh, a volunteer from SEVA Trust’s youth wing, said: "Sekhon-ji is an inspiration for all of us. He relocated to the UK decades ago but he did not forget his village and its people. For the past several years, he has been working for our people in distress and for the welfare of local society. During the Covid-19 lockdown, he provided 50 needy students with tablet computers to help them continue their online education. Besides, he has sponsored the education of more than 500 children, irrespective of their caste or religion. He also got a solar-energy panel installed at the village’s senior secondary school, reducing its electricity bill to a great extent. A few days ago, our team also distributed immunity booster kits for children in the village, considering the new variant of coronavirus."Sekhon’s charitable work and contributions have been recognised earlier also. In 2013 Sekhon received the British-Asian Pride of Britain Award at the House of Commons inside the UK Parliament, while in 2002, he received Bedford mayor’s ‘Citizen of the Year’ award for his charitable work and community service.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ludhiana-village-hails-british-new-year-honour-to-its-lockdown-hero/articleshow/88820988.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Bizmen oppose govt’s plan to revive truck unions||Ludhiana: The Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) on Monday organised an urgent meeting to discuss the issues being faced by the manufacturers. The major issue for discussion was the unconfirmed reports that the government planned to revive the truck unions.The local businessmen expressed resentment over the reports and they even cautioned the government and the political parties backing this move that it will have severe repercussions for the business and industrial sector. Later, CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja, general secretary Pankaj Sharma, and other office-bearers and members issued a statement that: "The chamber opposes the proposal strongly and criticises the Punjab government’s reported plan to revive the truck unions. If implemented, this decision will prove to be detrimental to the growth of the state’s industrial sector that is passing through a very critical phase already." The Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings added in the statement that: "This decision will also add to the industry’s financial burden, since the transport charges in the state are very high already.”The office-beareres further said that: “The government should understand the situation of the industry and form committees to fix genuine rates to ensure that the interests of both the trucking community as well as the trade and industry are safeguarded."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/bizmen-oppose-govts-plan-to-revive-truck-unions/articleshow/88820989.cms||---

In November, the gazette’s copy was circulated on social media only and people were since waiting for the process to start. But with the announcement of the assembly elections, that notice will remain in abeyance. Under this policy, the government had made a provision to regularised only those unauthorised commercial buildings where the applicants had made parking arrangements. In case the parking lot is unavailable within the building, then there should be one at least within 300 metres. Besides this, fire safety arrangements and structural safety certificates are also mandatory.In case a building is on a non-commercial street, the officials cannot declare that as commercial. In the gazette, the regularisation fee was fixed at Rs 375 per square feet for commercial buildings and Rs 185 per square feet for the residential buildings. Three months’ time was supposed to be given to the applicants for the submission of documents, and buildings constructed up to September 2021 were supposed to be regularised.However, this policy had received a mixed response from the public. A lot of people were not in favour of the policy, while the council of engineers had even expressed its opposition to the governor through a letter, asking him not to approve the policy. Council president Kapil Arora said: "We hear that some officials collected files from many offenders for compounding the building violations under the proposed act, but with the enforcement of the election code, this bill has gone into dustbin. We had raised objections to this bill since the beginning, as it will increase the problems. It is a great relief that it did not get notified."The officials claimed that the policy had gone to the governor for final notification but now when the code was imposed, it was not going to get notified now. When the last regularisation policy was notified a few years ago, it could not gain much response at that time because the regularisation fee was too high.Requesting anonymity, one of the officials claimed that people had raised queries about the policy and the process to submit their documents but even the official website had little information about it. He said the officials had kept certain areas in mind to be taken up under this policy but now they will have to wait for the poll code to lapse. Senior town planner S S Bindra confirmed that: "Now when the code of conduct is imposed, there are no chances of this notification."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/poll-code-dashes-regularisation-hopes/articleshow/88820990.cms||---

None was on a ventilator. By January 4, nine patients were in hospitals (all in private facilities) and one was on ventilator. The next day, the number was 22, including 20 in private centres. The figure increased to 41, including 37 in private hospitals, on January 9, when two patients were on ventilators.No patient from other districts or states was on ventilator from December 30 to January 9.The health department officials said, “Even as hospitalisations have risen, there are adequate number of beds and ventilators in both the private and the government hospitals.”Experts said with Covid cases rising, hospitalisations are expected to increase.Ludhiana IMA former president Dr Narrotam Dewan said, “Cases and hospitalisations are directly proportionate. Even as Omicron cases are considered to be mild, the old variant is still there, which seems to have caused hospitalisations. Besides, due to cold conditions, there is rise in respiratory problems among those infected with Covid which results in their hospitalisation.” Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh couldn’t be contacted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/hospitalisations-increase-with-surge-in-covid-cases/articleshow/88820991.cms||Shariq Majeed
