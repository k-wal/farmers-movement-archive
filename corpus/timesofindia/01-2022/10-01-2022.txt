Rejecting the bail application of one Farhan Ahmad alias Sanu of Gorakhpur, Justice Om Prakash Tripathi said that the allegation against the accused was serious and he, cannot, therefore, be released on bail. The applicant was in jail for offences under Sections 376 (Punishment for rape), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code 1860 and Sections 3 and 5(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act 2020. The FIR was lodged against him at Ramgarh Tal police station of Gorakhpur. The victim, who is also an informant, had alleged that the applicant-accused had established physical relations with her on a false promise of marriage. “He later pressured me to convert to Islam threatening that he will not marry her unless she coverts,” she further alleged in the FIR. She further alleged that due to the threat to her life, the victim lodged a first information report (FIR) against the applicant. However, during the course of hearing, the counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant had been falsely implicated and this was a case of consensual relationship since both the applicant and the victim were adults. He further contended that as per medical report, no external or internal injury was found on the body of the victim, and the doctor had not given any opinion about rape. Besides, the applicant also stated that he had never pressured the victim at any point of time to convert to Islam and the entire prosecution story was false and fake. The counsel appearing for the state government, however, submitted that sexual intercourse with the victim on the pretext of false promise of marriage would attract the offence of rape. The high court, after taking into account the facts and circumstances, refused to grant bail to the applicant-accused. However, while rejecting the bail, the court in its order dated January 5 directed the trial court to conclude the trial in the case expeditiously and preferably within a period of one year. Justice Om Prakash Tripathi said that the allegation against the accused was serious and he, cannot, therefore, be released on bail. "There is serious allegation of rape against the applicant with the victim, in these circumstances, the applicant is not entitled to be released on bail," the Court said. The order was passed on a bail plea moved by one Farhan Ahmad (Shanu) booked for offences under Sections 376 (Punishment for rape), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code 1860 and Sections 3 and 5(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act 2020. It was the case of the victim (informant) that the applicant-accused has committed rape on her by establishing physical relations on the pretext of a false promise to marriage. He later pressured her to convert to Islam threatening that he will not marry her unless she coverts. As a result, due to the threat to her life, the victim lodged a first information report (FIR) against the applicant. The applicant argued that he was falsely implicated and this was a case of consensual relationship since both the applicant and the victim were adults. He further contended that as per medical report, no external or internal injury was found on the body of the victim, and the doctor had not govern any opinion about rape. Moreover, the applicant stated that he had never pressured the victim at any point of time to convert to Islam and the entire prosecution story was false and fake. The counsel appearing for the State, however, submitted that sexual intercourse with the victim on the pretext of false promise of marriage will attract the offence of rape. "It is a heinous crime against a society and has a long effect on the mind of victims. The victim has to go through a serious emotional trauma and physical suffering. Sexual intercourse with the victim on the pretext of false promise to marry is, and ought to be an offence of rape under the penal provisions effect on the mind of the victim," the State counsel contended. The High Court after taking into account the facts and circumstances refused to grant bail to the applicant-accused. "Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, rival contention of learned counsel for the parties and perusal of record and considering the complicity of accused and serious allegation of rape against the applicant, at this stage, without commenting on the merits of the case, I do not find it a fit case for bail," the order stated. The Court, however, directed the trial court to conclude the trial in the case expeditiously and preferably within a period of one year. Advocates Amit Kumar Singh and Satyendra Narayan Singh appeared for the applicant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/allahabad-hc-denies-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-threatening-victim-to-convert-for-marriage/articleshow/88796741.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

It is expected to increase a bit further as sowing in the ongoing Rabi (winter crop) season continues till the end of this month. As part of its move to encourage farmers towards oilseeds and reduce the country's import bills, the agriculture ministry had before the beginning of the Rabi sowing season last year announced the highest hike (both in percentage and absolute term) of 8.6% in the MSP of mustard/rapeseed and lowest hike of 2% in case of the most popular winter-sown crop wheat. "Idea was to give a signal to farmers so that they can opt for crop diversification. Results are now clear as the sown area of wheat declined by 1.7% as of last Friday but the acreage of mustard increased by 23%. More acreage will increase the production of oilseeds during 2021-22 crop season, resulting in less dependence on import during 2022-23," said an official from the ministry. Sown area data, released by the ministry on January 7, shows that the acreage of Rabi crops this year (652 lakh hectares) has, so far, already crossed the last year's corresponding period figure by nearly six lakh hectares. This increase, which may eventually end at record acreage, is mainly due to an increase in sown of oilseeds by over 17.2 lakh hectares -- from 81 lakh hectares last year to over 98 lakh hectares this year. Mustard alone has recorded an increase of 16.9 lakh hectares in the oilseeds basket. More than half of this increase is reported from Rajasthan alone. On the other hand, all other major Rabi crops - wheat, pulses and coarse cereals - reported a decline in acreage, showing how farmers preferred to opt for oilseeds that not only witnessed good hike in MSP but also other basis supports, including seeds, from the government as part of its oilseeds mission to increase production. If we look at the MSP figures, the highest absolute increase over the previous year had been for mustard/ rapeseeds (Rs 400 quintal each) which was an 8.6% increase. On the other hand, MSP of wheat had reported merely an increase of Rs 40 per quintal (2% increase) which did not even cover the increase in cost (Rs 48 per quintal). A higher sown area of oilseeds is reported this year from most of the oilseeds producing states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Telangana, Karnataka, Punjab, Assam, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh. In the case of wheat, even Punjab, known as the wheat bowl of India, reported marginally less acreage this year compared to the corresponding period last year. Other states which reported less acreage to include Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/msps-tilt-in-favour-of-oilseeds-see-23-increase-in-acreage-of-mustard-wheat-sown-area-decreases/articleshow/88796687.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Government sources said though that delivery of wheat via the Attari-Wagah border was still being considered and that help will be sought from Iran only if this option falls through. India has already shared details of Afghan contractors and drivers who will ferry the wheat to Afghanistan and Pakistan media, quoting local sources, reported late last month that India and Pakistan were close to finalising an agreement for the supply of 50,000 MT of Indian wheat to Afghanistan. The Iranian offer to India came in a conversation that foreign minister S Jaishankar had with his counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian Saturday in which the 2 leaders discussed key bilateral and regional issues. "Regarding Afghanistan, @Amirabdolahian stressed the need to form an inclusive government in the country. He also referred to India's humanitarian aid to #Afghanistan, announcing measures and cooperation by Iran to transfer this aid in the form of wheat, medicine... to the country," tweeted the Iranian foreign ministry on Sunday. Significantly, the Iranian offer also came on a day the Taliban foreign minister, Amir Muttaqi, arrived in Tehran for discussions on "economic, transit and refugee issues". India though always had the option of transporting the wheat through the Chabahar wheat it has helped develop in Iran. The government, in fact, had supplied 75,000 MT of wheat to Afghanistan through the same port in 2020. However, India has so far not contemplated the Chabahar option apparently because it remains unsure about the security of the route in Afghanistan that will likely be used in that case. While India has already sent 3 consignments of aid to Afghanistan, comprising mostly life-saving medicines, it's the promise of wheat that the Taliban dispensation in Kabul, crippled by an acute food shortage, has been looking forward to the most from India. The Taliban foreign minister had even raised the need for Pakistan to quickly approve India's proposal for delivery of wheat to Afghanistan during his meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan in Islamabad in November. India reiterated last week that it stood committed to continuing its special relationship with the people of Afghanistan and providing them humanitarian assistance. This was also the reason why, despite reservations, it backed a UNSC resolution last month meant to ensure sanctions against the Taliban didn't block humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. While countries like India and France wanted a short time limit for Taliban sanction exemption, apart from strong oversight, China and Russia ensured there was no time limit for the exemption. India also dramatically proposed to Pakistan, as first reported by ToI on October 19, that the latter allows transport of wheat via the India-Pakistan border. Islamabad had famously rejected the same proposal by India in 2002.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-ready-to-help-india-transport-wheat-to-afghanistan/articleshow/88797003.cms||Sachin Parashar

Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe eligibility for ‘precaution dose’ requires the recipient to have completed nine months after the second dose. The health ministry had earlier said that Co-Win system will send reminder SMS to those eligible for availing the precaution dose. “Reminder SMSs have been pushed to more than 1 crore beneficiaries for the precaution dose. The system is ready to welcome beneficiaries at vaccination centres on Monday,” the official said. While online booking of appointments for precaution dose through Co-Win started from Saturday, beneficiaries can also walk in for vaccination. However, there would be no need for new registration. The government has already clarified that the ‘precaution dose’ will be of the same jab as the first and second dose. Those who got Covaxin will get Covaxin and those who got Covishield will get Covishield. While those above 60 years of age with co-morbidities have been advised to seek medical advice before receiving the third dose, they would not be required to submit any certificate for the same. Read AlsoCovid: Booster to be of same vaccine as previous 2 shots, says governmentThe ‘precaution dose’ (booster) for Covid-19 — which will be administered from January 10 to health and frontline workers, and those above 60 with comorbidities — will be of the same vaccine as the first and second dose, the government said on Wednesday. “Those who got Covaxin will get Covaxin and“Details of precaution dose will also reflect in the official vaccination certificate,” the official further added. As per government’s projections, nearly three crore health and frontline workers are estimated to be eligible in January to get the booster or precaution dose of Covid vaccine. Besides, 2.7 crore people in the 60 plus age group with co-morbidities are projected across the country. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu have most people in this category. However, very few such people may actually be eligible for receiving the third dose in January after completing the nine month gap.

Overall, a total of 151.9 crore doses have been administered in the country till Sunday 8 pm. This includes 63.2 crore or 67% of adults above 18 years of age who are fully vaccinated with two doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/administration-of-precaution-dose-of-covid-vaccine-to-high-risk-population-begins-today/articleshow/88797120.cms||Sushmi Dey

India reported more than 7.8 lakh cases during the week (January 3-9), more than six times higher than last week’s tally of nearly 1.3 lakh. The previous week (December 27-January 2) itself had recorded a 2.8x surge in infections. During the second wave of the pandemic, a corresponding increase in weekly numbers — from 1.3 lakh to roughly 7.8 lakh cases — had taken place in a span of nearly five weeks. On Sunday, India reported nearly 1.8 lakh new cases — 179,902 till late at night, with one state, Tripura, yet to report its data. This was 13% higher than the preceding day’s count of 1,59,583, as per TOI’s Covid database. India has moved to the fifth place among countries with the highest weekly cases and has logged by far the highest rate of growth during the week among 20 nations with the highest case counts at present. Deaths have also risen during the week but at a far slower rate of 54%, from 495 last week to 761. These were fresh deaths reported daily. If old fatalities reported during the period is added, this week’s toll was 2,039, up from 1,897 in the previous seven days. During the current week, Maharashtra posted the highest count of cases at 2,20,176. At 1.05 lakh, Bengal logged the second-highest number of cases, nearly 6 times more than the previous week’s count of 18,500. Delhi numbers rose nine times to 95,609 this week, up from 10,769.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fastest-ever-surge-as-weekly-covid-19-cases-see-6-fold-rise/articleshow/88797316.cms||---

Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to Mayor Eric Adams, confirmed the death toll Sunday to The Associated Press, while a city official who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed the number of children dead. More than five dozen people were injured and 13 people were still in critical condition in the hospital, Ringel said. The majority of victims were suffering from severe smoke inhalation, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said at a press conference earlier that afternoon. According to the FDNY, approximately 200 firefighters responded to the scene at the Bronx's Twin Park apartments, a 19-story building on East 181st Street. Firefighters ``found victims on every floor and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest,'' Nigro said. ``That is unprecedented in our city. We expect there to be numerous fatalities.'' Nigro compared the severity of the fire to the Happy Land social club fire, which killed 87 people in 1990 when man set fire to the building after getting into an argument with his former girlfriend and being thrown out of the club. According to Nigro, Sunday's fire originated in a duplex apartment spanning the second and third floors. Firefighters found the door to the apartment open, he said, which apparently allowed the fire to accelerate and spread smoke upward quickly. The fire is not believed to be suspicious in origin but the cause is under investigation. Sunday's fire comes just days after a house fire in Philadelphia left 12 people - including eight children - dead.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/19-people-including-9-children-killed-in-apartment-fire-in-new-york-citys-bronx-borough-officials-say/articleshow/88797317.cms||---
---||Business||Bank frauds of over Rs 3 crore will need panel nod for CBI probe||NEW DELHI: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has amended rules to mandate that all bank fraud cases of over Rs 3 crore will be referred to an expert panel to decide if an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is warranted in what is seen as a fresh attempt to comfort bankers. Earlier, only fraud cases of over Rs 50 crore in public sector banks were referred to this panel. Separately, bankers have approached the finance ministry seeking a “sunset period” for investigations so that they are not hounded by probe agencies for genuine business decisions. They have suggested that agencies, such as CBI and CVC, should be barred from looking into cases if a loan account remains standard for seven or 10 years. “There can be issues due to the prevailing situation in the economy or a particular industry, or a company’s product may become obsolete over a period (of time). But if there are no problems for a certain number of specified number of years, then there is no need to go on a witch hunt, some of which happens post-retirement,” said a banker. While the department of financial services (DFS) is yet to act on this, it, along with RBI and CVC, has agreed to tweak the rules in fraud cases. The move comes at a time when bankers have raised fresh concerns over what they believe is overreach by the three Cs — CVC, CBI and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India — on several occasions. In the past, they have cited these concerns for going slow in sanctioning loans, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman have repeatedly offered full support on genuine business decisions. In a circular issued last week, CVC said that based on discussions with RBI and the finance ministry, the Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF) will examine the role of all executives and whole-time directors (serving and retired) in cases of Rs 3-50 crore classified as fraud by state-run public sector banks and financial institutions on or after January 6. Cases reported before the January 6 deadline will be referred to the panel if they have reached the disciplinary authority or where criminal cases are yet to be filed. While CVC has said that a separate board for cases between Rs 3 crore and Rs 50 crore will be set up, bankers said that there was a need to have quick decisions as the number of cases being referred to ABBFF will now rise multiple times. In the past, banks have responded by classifying a large number of cases as fraud to ensure that the management does not face action later on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-frauds-of-over-rs-3-crore-will-need-panel-nod-for-cbi-probe/articleshow/88797461.cms||Sidhartha

The crew module will be splashing down near the Indian coast in 2023 after it returns from the week-long mission, and the Arabian Sea, which is comparatively calmer, is the primary choice though the Bay of Bengal is also being considered as a backup option, wrote Dr Unnikrishnan Nair S, director, Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC), ISRO, Bengaluru, in an article ‘Indian Human Space Mission’ in a publication. While in orbit, the orbital module (OM) will be orbiting the Earth with a velocity of about 7,800 metre/second. The crew module, a habitat of astronauts, has an ablative thermal protection system (TPS) to protect it during the intense aerodynamic heating during the flight, Nair wrote. The orbital module will be launched by a human-rated GSLV MK-III vehicle. For Gaganyaan, the four selected gagannauts have undergone generic space flight training in Russia for nearly 15 months and will now undergo training at the Astronaut Training Facility, being set up at Bengaluru. The crew will undergo training in weightlessness condition by flying in special aircraft through a parabolic path that will give 25 to 30 seconds duration of weightlessness. To familiarise the crew with rescue under abort conditions, they will undergo special survival training in sea, snow, mountain and desert conditions. Before the final manned mission, Isro has scheduled to send a ‘vyommitra’ (a human-like robot) to space in two unmanned missions, one of the missions is likely to be launched around this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gaganyaan-crew-will-have-2-landing-choices-isro-expert/articleshow/88797692.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Integrated science labs, smart classes focus of 5-year education plan||NEW DELHI: Integrated science labs, smart classrooms, play-based learning and support for vocational education will be among the focus areas of the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan’s five-year plan, which has been sent to states and Union Territories. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan was launched in 2018 to provide holistic school education. Instead of disparate schemes that looked at pre-school, primary and secondary schools in silos, the scheme treats school as a continuum — from pre-school and primary to senior secondary levels. The scheme was extended up to 2025-26 in August 2021. The scheme has been aligned with the recommendations of the National Education Policy and “many transformative recommendations of NEP 2020 have been made part of it”, says the five-year plan, a copy of which is with TOI. The education ministry said the estimated share of the Centre for 2022-23 would be Rs 42,211 crore, while states and UTs would spend Rs 23,443 crore. Among other thrust areas, the plan includes annual calendar activities, national initiative for proficiency in reading with understanding; implementation of VidyaPravesh — a three-month play-based school preparation module for Class I; targeted and saturation approach for expansion of secondary and senior secondary education; access and retention; and quality and innovation. Issuing the guidelines, Maneesh Garg, joint secretary, department of school education and literacy, said: “Since, the scheme has been continued for next five years till 2025-26, it’s time for us to initiate proper planning process based on the measurable outcomes so that the scheme is able to showcase some tangible benefits in coming years. The planning exercise should be conducted in a decentralised manner involving all stakeholders right from grassroot level so as to make it realistic, achievable and accountable.” The government has announced its aim of achieving 100% GER (gross enrolment ratio) at all levels as envisaged in NEP 2020. To this end, the Centre has asked states and UTs to send their proposals for opening new secondary and senior secondary schools based on GIS mapping done by the education ministry. In a bid to arrest the dropout rate, which is higher in senior classes and to ensure universal access and retention, the ministry suggested “a two two three month readiness module for children entering in Class lX so that they are prepared for the secondary stage”. The document also says that “50% of the composite secondary/ senior secondary schools, as envisaged in NEP 2020, will be provided support for vocational education in the next 4 years”. The Centre has also asked states and UTs to draw up plans to provide integrated science labs, ensure electricity for ICT and smart classrooms in all schools. This is apart from ensuring that all schools have adequate facilities for toilets, and drinking waterand sanitary pad vending machines in girls’ hostels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/integrated-science-labs-smart-classes-focus-of-5-year-education-plan/articleshow/88797747.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

Omicron also has two more sub-lineages — BA.2 and BA.3. “In some sequencing run of clinical samples, we get to see the presence of more BA.1 sub-lineage now than the original Omicron strain,” a senior scientist told TOI. “Since the sub-lineage belongs to the same family, these samples are considered Omicron positive,” the scientist said. Among the three sub-lineages of Omicron, scientists have also noticed the presence of BA.2 in genome sequencing tests. “But this presence is comparatively far too low. We have not yet identified BA.3 sub-lineage of Omicron in India,” another virologist involved in the work said. Omicron is highly transmissible and is the main force in the current surge in cases across the country. So far, most patients have shown very mild illness and a comparatively lesser need for hospitalisation. Read AlsoOmicron sibling can't be detected by imported RT-PCR kits: ExpertsThe elusive sibling (sub-lineage) of the Omicron variant, BA.2, cannot be picked up by the imported RT-PCR kit having an S gene drop, researchers involved in tracking the virus in India said on Sunday.Insacog reports genomic surveillance of SARS CoV-2 across the country through sequencing of samples from sentinel sites and puts out a detailed district analysis for some states, including Maharashtra and Kerala. The diagnostic accuracy of routinely used RT-PCR and antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) assays do not appear to be impacted by Omicron. It means a standard RT-PCR or antigen kit is capable of detecting Covid infection caused by Omicron and all three sub-lineages of the variant. But sifting probable Omicron cases from the daily positive cases using the RT-PCR-S-gene target method cannot be fully relied upon as available evidence shows that the BA.2 sub-lineage cannot be picked up using these RT-PCR-SGTF kits. Read Also‘Foreign test kits can’t spot Omicron’s elusive sibling’The elusive sibling (sub-lineage) of the Omicron variant, BA.2, cannot be picked up by the imported RT-PCR kit having an S-gene drop, researchers involved in tracking the virus in India said on Sunday. The variant has three sub-lineages BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3."According to WHO, the BA.1 sub-lineage of Omicron accounts for 99% of sequences, and overall, over 95% of Omicron variant sequences reported include a 69-70 deletion in the S gene in most countries reporting an Omicron-fuelled surge," a Union health ministry official said. Initial estimates of the severity of illness have, however, been lower than seen in previous outbreaks.

Favourable outcomes for Amazon can derail the Big Bazaar parent’s preparations for its Rs 25,000-crore asset sale to Reliance Retail. TOI had reported that Future Group is likely to approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to seek approval for a shareholders’ meet after a division bench of the Delhi High Court on January 5 stayed ongoing Amazon-Future arbitration proceedings before a Singapore tribunal. In another setback for Amazon, the CCI on December 17 temporarily suspended its approval for the e-tailer’s 2019 purchase of 49% stake in Future Coupons (FCPL), an unlisted Future Group company. The Seattle-headquartered company, which is locked in a bitter legal battle with Future Group over the latter’s proposed asset sale to Reliance Retail, took these steps on Saturday, sources told TOI. “The division bench had mentioned that they will hear about the maintainability of its hearing the matter in the next hearing but went ahead to issue notice. The high court single bench had passed order under a section that can’t be heard by division bench legally and has to be heard by the Supreme Court only,” said a source. Both Amazon and Future Group did not comment on this story. At the NCLAT, Amazon, however, has also challenged the Rs 202 crore penalty imposed on it by the antitrust watchdog for allegedly suppressing certain facts about its “real” purpose behind its investment in FCPL, said three people in know of the matter. Before the division bench at Delhi High Court halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings, Justice Amit Bansal at Delhi HC had dismissed pleas filed by Future Group companies that sought to end the arbitration proceedings with Amazon before SIAC. “They injuncted the Singapore tribunal to stop hearing an arbitration which was underway on the very same day. This was unprecedented,” said the source. The CCI’s suspension of the approval of Amazon’s FCPL investment is critical for the e-tailer because it was the sole basis on which it has been trying to block the Future-Reliance deal. Amazon has claimed in legal courts that its investment in FCPL gave it strategic rights over FRL, since FCPL held a 10% stake in Future Group’s flagship company, FRL. SIAC had passed an interim award in favour of Amazon in October 2020 that barred Future Group from going ahead with its Rs 25,000-crore assets sale to Reliance Retail. Amazon dragged Future to SIAC when the Future-Reliance deal was announced for alleged breach of contract. Future Group approached the Delhi High Court after the SIAC on December 30 refused to consider the retailer’s petitions to stop the arbitration proceedings before the commencement of the final hearings this week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-challenges-cci-order-at-nclat-moves-sc-to-quash-hc-order/articleshow/88797916.cms||John Sarkar
---||India||In outreach to Sikhs, PM Modi says December 26 will be Veer Baal Divas||NEW DELHI: In another big gesture to Sikhs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi marked the birthday of the Guru Gobind Singh by declaring that December 26 will be observed as ‘Veer Baal Diwas’ as a tribute to the sons of the 10th Guru who attained martyrdom fighting the Mughals under Aurangzeb. “Today, on the auspicious occasion of the Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, I am honoured to share that starting this year, 26th December shall be marked as ‘Veer Baal Diwas.’ This is a fitting tribute to the courage of the Sahibzades and their quest for justice,” the Prime Minister tweeted. While two of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons were killed fighting the Mughals, two other sons of Govind Singh were bricked alive on the orders of Aurangzeb’s governor of Sirhind. PM said Veer Baal Diwas will be observed on the same day the two younger sons, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh Ji and Sahibzada Fateh Singh Ji, attained martyrdom after being sealed alive in a wall. “These two greats preferred death instead of deviating from the noble principles of Dharma,” Modi said, in a reference to the refusal of the siblings to agree to change their faith to escape death. The announcement, which coincided with the formal launch of the election process in Punjab, is the latest of a series of decisions the PM has taken to honour Sikh Gurus. He had earlier announced the recall of the three agriculture laws — a sore point with Sikh farmers who led the agitation against the initiative — on the birthday of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev. The Modi government also commemorated the 400th anniversary of the martyrdom of the ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, who was executed by Mughals for protesting against the persecution of Kashmiri Pandits, on a big scale. Modi had spoken about the sacrifices of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons in one of his Mann Ki Baat addresses. On Sunday, he said the bravery of the Guru, his mother Mata Gujri and the four Sahibzades give strength to millions of people. “They never bowed to injustice. They envisioned a world that is inclusive and harmonious. It is the need of the hour for more people to know about them,” Modi said. Welcoming the decision to celebrate Veer Baal Diwas, home minister Amit Shah said the “incomparable sacrifice and patriotism” of the four Sahibzadas and Mata Gujri to protect the country and religion is the heritage of the country. “I heartily welcome the decision… Not only will crores of children be able to contribute today to the service of the nation by taking inspiration from the patriotism of the Sahibzadas, their sacrifice will be remembered for generations to come,” Shah said. BJP president J P Nadda said the decision is a true tribute to the patriotism of the Char Sahibzadas and will inspire the coming generation with the love of patriotism. Terming it a commendable ove, former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said, “The courage portrayed by Sahibzades under enormous oppression is unparalleled and everyone across the globe must know about their supreme sacrifice.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-outreach-to-sikhs-pm-modi-says-december-26-will-be-veer-baal-divas/articleshow/88797841.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Congress launches Mekedatu padayatra defying Covid curbs||BENGALURU: The controversial Mekedatu padayatra, which had seen a week-long political slugfest between Congress and BJP, started on Sunday without drama as the state government allowed congregation of over 20,000 people amid weekend curfew and Covid-19 restrictions. Despite threatening legal action against the organisers, the BJP government chose to allow the event to take place to pre-empt any friction. With the slogan ‘Namma Neeru, Namma Hakku' (our water, our right), the padayatra inaugural was held at Sangama, the confluence of Cauvery and Arkavati rivers, in Kanakapura taluk. The 10-day march covering 60 assembly constituencies will culminate at a public rally at National College Grounds, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, on Jan 19. Claiming the rally ‘apolitical', the Congress led by state unit president DK Shivakumar has organised the padayatra, demanding both central and state governments to implement the project that envisages to provide drinking water to Bengaluru Urban and surrounding districts by storing surplus Cauvery river water in the reservoir to be built at Mekedatu in Kanakapura taluk of Ramanagara district, about 90km from Bengaluru. "The government wanted to scuttle the padayatra through the weekend curfew. They should realise they can never stop us. The flowing river, blowing wind and shining Sun cannot be stopped. Likewise, the walk-for-water cannot be stopped," Shivakumar said. The government had, through Ramanagara district administration, issued a circular prohibiting movement of people in line with the weekend curfew clamped across Karnataka. However, the authorities did little to stop the event on Sunday. Home minister Araga Jnanendra said the government had issued notice for violation of the pandemic norms. "We are taking the appropriate legal action as the district authorities have already served notice on the organisers of padayatra under the provision of the Disaster Management Act," he added. Describing the march as "nothing more than a political gimmick", chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Congress is trying to hide its failure to implement the project when the party was in power. "With assembly elections approaching, the Congress has woken up to launch a padayatra. We have seen what the party and its leaders did after holding the padayatra to the Krishna basin in 2013. You can fool people once, but not all the time," he said. Senior Congress leaders, including G Parameswara, RV Deshpande, HK Patil and M Veerappa Moily, took part in the march on Sunday that covered 14.5km before halting for night at Dodda Aladahalli, near Kanakapura.

The health department will set up 108 sessions on Monday, the first day of the booster vaccination drive. While 68 sessions will give Covishield, 40 will administer Covaxin. Recipients do not have to re-register on the CoWIN portal for the booster dose. Instead, they can make appointments online or walk into any session site. Gurugram has opened 8,000 online slots and 5,000 for walk-in recipients. Nearly 800 recipients in the district are eligible for the Covaxin booster and 37,200 for the Covishield one as per the administration. Meanwhile, the health department has told all government officers to dedicate an area for a vaccination camp in their respective premises so that people working in these offices can take a jab at the earliest. “We are carrying out the vaccination drive in all government departments, as well as in our health care centres across Gurugram. At our health care centres, there will be three sessions. One for the 15-17 age group, the second for 18 and above, where people can get the first and second doses, and the third for people who are eligible for the booster dose,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. On the availability of the Covaxin and Covishield booster doses, he said, “We have nearly 18,000 Covaxin booster doses and nearly 45,000 Covishield booster doses, as well. We will be getting more doses from the state government within a day." On Sunday, 3,371 children in the age group of 15-17 and 9,554 in the 18-44 age group got vaccinated. In the 45-plus category, 1,207 people took the shots. As many as 7,906 first and 6,232 second doses were administered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/booster-dose-from-today-108-vax-sites-for-60-age-group-with-comorbidities/articleshow/88798013.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||60% jump in 24 hours: Gurugram sees 2,300 Covid-19 cases||GURUGRAM: New Covid cases in the city jumped from 1,450 to 2,338 on Sunday — an over 60% surge in 24 hours. The last time so many people had tested positive in a single day was during the middle of the second wave on May 14 last year, when 2,144 cases were recorded in the city. Gurugram, so far, had been adding less than 2,000 cases daily in the current surge of the pandemic. However, the sharp spike in cases has also prompted the positivity rate to jump from 5% on January 1 to 20.6% on Sunday. The testing has also been ramped up. On Sunday, 11,296 samples were collected for tests. The number of active cases now stands at 8,473, of which 55 patients are in hospitals. Officials, however, warned that the number of hospitalisations had been increasing of late. “We are witnessing a rise in hospitalisations, but most patients are not showing any severe symptoms. These patients are not in the ICU or on a ventilator. Some of them are on oxygen support. A majority of the patients are aged over 60,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. Doctors, however, said that people should not fall for the common narrative that the current wave is relatively milder than the two previous ones. They explained that since most patients remained fine for the first few days and were likely to get critical — if at all — after almost a week, hospitalisations might see a spike later. “Right now, patients are coming in with mild symptoms. The symptoms are moderate for the first two or three days, so we have been seeing patients with severe headaches, body pain and extreme weakness. A unique feature this time is high grade fever with chills. People are feeling very cold. They are taking five to six blankets to sleep and still shivering. This is something we haven't witnessed before,” said Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. Haryana, meanwhile, reported 5,166 new cases. While Gurugram registered the highest cases in the state, Faridabad was second on the list with 878 cases, followed by Ambala (420), Panchkula (418) and Rohtak (158). At present, the state has 18,298 active patients, of whom 13,223 are in home isolation. It has carried out 41,109 tests in the past 24 hours and the positivity rate stands at 10.6%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/60-jump-in-24-hrs-city-sees-2-3k-cases/articleshow/88798014.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Business||Multiple agencies to probe Chinese phone companies||NEW DELHI: The government has opened a multi-agency probe against the Indian operations of top Chinese phone companies Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, amid allegations of “lapses and discrepancies” in their statutory financial filings and other reporting over the last few years, apart from looking into their business practices. The agencies will seek to investigate if there was concealment of income, deliberate attempts to suppress profits to evade taxes, and abuse of dominant position in the smartphone market to the detriment of the local industry. Besides, policies related to alleged non-transparent methods in sourcing components and distribution of products will also be looked into, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. Top sources in the government told TOI that the widening of the probe comes amid the recent searches conducted against the Chinese makers by various agencies, including the income tax department and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). Fair play regulator Competition Commission of India may also be roped in over charges of abuse of dominant position and restrictive trade practices, said a source. “An initial assessment of the statutory financial reporting filed by the companies over the past few years has thrown up lapses, especially pointing to possible tax evasion, concealment of earnings, and manipulation of books. There are major concerns, and we are looking into all possible issues,” a top official said. The matter is also being closely followed by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity). An analysis of filings with the registrar of companies (RoC) showed that the major Chinese handset players reported operational losses although they had strong sales and have been claiming top slots in the market league tables. A detailed questionnaire sent to the Indian subsidiaries of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Oppo and Vivo are owned by Chinese electronics giant BBK that also controls the OnePlus and RealMe brands that are sold in India. Officials said that despite gaining in revenue and market share in India with a cumulative turnover of over Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019-20 (they haven’t filed financial records for fiscal 2020-21 yet), Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo paid any taxes in India. “In fact, Oppo and Vivo have been showing negative net worth in India since fiscal 2016-17.” In the case of Xiaomi, which claims to be the leader of the Indian smartphone market, losses have been heavy, though some of these have been negated through a special entry into the Profit & Loss statement (marked as profit from exceptional items), titled ‘reward received from Hong Kong’ for business performance. This was to the tune of Rs 2,447 crore in fiscal 2018-19, and Rs 3,277 crore in fiscal 2019-20. In the last few years, as the sway of the Chinese companies grew in India, the hold of homegrown companies such as Lava, Karbonn, Micromax and Intex went down rapidly. The share of Indian companies in the smartphone market is in low-single digits, against a dominant position they occupied till a few years ago. Another bone of contention is the reluctance of the Chinese companies – especially Oppo and Vivo — to align with local players for distribution. The companies prefer to have Chinese partners as Tier 1 distributors and have not opened up the chain. “The same is the case when it comes to sourcing of parts and components, where there is complete lack of transparency. The Tier 1 suppliers, and even Tier 2, are mostly Chinese and this ensures that they tightly control the technology and pricing aspects,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/multiple-agencies-to-probe-chinese-phone-companies/articleshow/88797980.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Gurgaon||Two more held for trafficking, may have sold nearly 100 infants in Delhi-NCR||GURUGRAM: Hours after the alacrity of a cabbie took the cover of a gang that stole newborns and led to the arrest of three persons on Saturday, two more women were nabbed from Delhi in connection with the racket that is believed to have spread its fangs across NCR. The two who were arrested late on Saturday evening were identified as Pooja and Jeena. Police teams have also been sent to Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to find out about other possible gang members. On Saturday morning, a cab driver from the city had driven straight to the DLF-3 police station and got arrested two women and a man who had stolen two infants and were planning to sell them to childless couples. The driver grew suspicious after overhearing a phone conversation between one of the women in his cab and a possible couple who were planning to buy an infant. According to ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan, there could be at least 15 members in the gang, which is believed to have been active since 2014. “It appears to be an organised syndicate. We are tracking down the people involved in this racket. Given the number of years they have been active, we expect a large number of infants to have been sold by them,” the senior officer said. Another police officer said the gang could have sold over 100 babies till now. “We are checking the missing complaints lodged by parents over the past few years to investigate the matter further,” the officer said. The gang, the police said, mostly targeted pregnant women from humble backgrounds who were willing to sell the newborns after delivery. The infants would then be sold to willing couples. “The accused would strike a deal for Rs 3-4 lakh with each couple. This involved taking the newborns from their biological mothers, travelling across states and delivering the infant safely to the couple,” said Sangwan. The two infants rescued from the three persons on Saturday are just 20 days old, the police said, adding that they had been handed over to the child welfare committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/trafficking-2-more-held-may-have-sold-nearly-100-infants/articleshow/88798015.cms||---

The report, submitted before FDCH managing director Vivek Saxena last week, said that Raman had taken “advantage of his position” as enquiry officer and “acted beyond the scope of his jurisdiction”, and recommended action against him.According to officials, the then Gurgaon divisional manager of FDCH in 2018 had allegedly acted on his own and given a Rs 93-lakh tender to a private contractor for procuring benches for the education department. While the education department had made payments for the benches to the FDCH, the corporation had allegedly used the amount for a plantation drive at Masani Barrage sans approval of a competent authority and no payment was made to the independent contractor, and it continues to remain pending. The forest department report stated that Raman was appointed as a fact-finding officer in the alleged case and had submitted a report in January last year, where he gave a “clean chit” to the FDCH but recommended making payments to the private contractor. The report on the Raman enquiry states: “Perusal of reports and relevant records available in the office makes it clear that the enquiry has not been done properly.” The fact-finding enquiry also “ignored” the issues highlighted by the then MD Jagdish Chandra, involving bypassing the tender process, outsourcing manufacturing process to private vendors, financial misappropriation, etc.“The content of the report appears to be advocating and defending all these serious irregularities and hence is prima facie biased,” the report states, adding that Raman “acted beyond the scope of his jurisdiction” by recommending payment of Rs 93 lakh for a work executed flouting all norms. “His role was only to find facts in the matter and submit them to the government. The integrity of the fact-finding officer has come to question because this transaction was done without tender and work order,” it states. It recommended the government to appoint another fact-finding enquiry and take action against Raman.MS Mallik, chief conservator of wildlife, Gurgaon, said, “Further investigation will be carried out as per the findings of the department.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/act-against-ifs-officer-for-bias-in-inquiry-report/articleshow/88798016.cms||Ipsita Pati

At a meeting held in the Manesar village, it was pointed out that the corporation so far has failed to address civic issues such as cleanliness, sewers, water and roads. The villagers claimed that the situation had been better under the panchayats. They also decided to form a committee, comprising a member from each of the 29 villages, and some members will meet the Pataudi and Badshahpur MLAs on January 12, seeking their intervention to dissolve the MCM. Additionally, every village will hold a gram sabha and the signatures collected from there will be shown at a village meeting on January 16, where the MLAs would be invited. Om Prakash Yadav, the former sarpanch of Manesar, said, “We are completely fed up with the working of the MCM. There has been no improvement at all when it comes to roads, sewers, water, cleanliness. Even to repair motor pumps, agencies keep passing the buck. Meanwhile, MCM has started collecting taxes in electricity bills, sending water bills to areas where there are no water pipelines, so instead of providing facilities, it has become a den of corruption.” Sochand, former sarpanch, Shikhopur, said, “The money that belonged to the panchayats has been taken away but now no one listens to our grievances. We were promised facilities but on the contrary, we are struggling to get the basic necessities.” Meanwhile, Munish Sharma, commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Manesar, said that it was not possible for individual gram panchayats to look after the needs of the urbanised area. He added that initially, MCM did not have many staffers. “We also lost some time due to the pandemic, but now things are moving forward as we have started several development works in our jurisdiction such as road repair, maintenance of streetlights, etc.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-work-yet-29-villages-seek-dissolution-of-mcm/articleshow/88798017.cms||Akanksha Gupta

According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), there has been an over 35% decrease in the number of species sighted at the Okhla sanctuary compared to 2021. This, the census said, was the lowest in the sanctuary — spread over 400 acres — in the past four years. Moreover, the number of IUCN resident species spotted at the sanctuary this year has almost halved from previous year’s tally. However, the total number of birds sighted has gone up. While 8,068 birds of 73 species could be counted last year, this year, 9,243 birds were spotted from only 47 species. Ecologist TK Roy, who is also the AWC Delhi coordinator of Wetlands International, said the total number of birds spotted this year had gone up only because of the Northern Shoveler, which was sighted in large numbers. According to Roy, the authorities needed to urgently address issues such as concretisation, pollution, excessive pruning of trees and planting ornamental trees rather than fruit-bearing ones. Roy said while delayed winters because of global climate change were slowing down the migration of birds across northern India, a few local factors were to blame too. “About 22 drains in Delhi release effluents directly into the Yamuna, causing major water pollution. The natural habitat of the birds has been affected also because of concretisation, pruning of trees, noise pollution, etc,” he said. In February last year, the forest department had urged the Delhi government to ensure that sewage generated into the Yamuna was treated, saying that “excessive pollution” in the river was having an adverse impact on the population of birds at Okhla. It had noted that the wetland had “started to stink” along with visible presence of oil and grease in the water. Roy pointed out that two huts, rooms and several concrete pathways and benches constructed by the forest department in the sanctuary for visitors were a major cause of disturbance for the birds. “The forest department has been claiming they are only prefabricated huts. But they have been constructed after digging up some 8-10ft of the wetland, which has affected the roosting place for the birds. Earlier, birders would sit here during visits. In an eco-sensitive zone, construction of any sort is banned by a Supreme Court order of 2010. Further, the over-pruning of trees along the boundary wall is not conducive for the birds,” he said. Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad told TOI that the power line passing over the sanctuary should not have been there in the first place. “Also, the electricity department simply resorts to excessive pruning of trees, reducing the tree cover along the boundary. The pruning happens once a year, but happens on a massive scale,” he said. Roy agreed. “The branches of huge trees like banyan, etc have been cut in a gross manner. More and more ornamental trees are being planted along the boundary instead of fruit-bearing ones that will support the habitat,” he said. District forest officer PK Srivastava said the census was based only on a single day’s count. “Huts have been made for researchers and forest trainees to have classes only during the daytime. If the government orders us to use them for night stay, it can be done later. They are made of prefabricated material.” He added, “The pruning of trees is done because of the 1 lakh Volt power line passing over the sanctuary. Technically, this line should not have been allowed to pass over the sanctuary. But it was done because the sanctuary fell in the Chambal division. Currently, there is no mechanism for it to be made underground. Pruning is done only after permission from the principal chief conservator of forests.” VK Singh, executive engineer in the irrigation department, said they had recently planted flowers around the raised boundary to ensure people did not enter the premises and threw garbage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/sewage-noise-pruning-of-trees-why-fewer-birds-species-are-visiting-okhla/articleshow/88798021.cms||Shikha Salaria

Ghaziabad, which had recorded 689 cases on Saturday, added 839 patients on the day, taking its active cases tally to 3,268. The district’s sample positivity rate stood at 9% in the past 24 hours, while in GB Nagar it was recorded at 23%. While 7,695 fresh cases were added across the state, a health department bulletin showed that GB Nagar accounted for the maximum number of new cases, while Lucknow with 1,115 cases, remained a close second. In terms of active cases, 12 districts in the state have more than 500 cases. Of these, GB Nagar leads with 4,613 cases, followed by Lucknow (3,653), Ghaziabad (3,297), Meerut (2,519) and Varanasi (1,313). With most patients undergoing treatment at home, the state government on Sunday issued revised guidelines for home isolation. According to the revised guidelines, patients will now have to submit an undertaking that they would follow all the rules of self-isolation at home and would be liable for penal action in case of any violation. In case, a patient does not have a fever for three consecutive days, his/her home isolation would be considered over after seven days from the date of sample collection. While a follow-up Covid test will not be required at the end of home isolation, patients will compulsorily have to wear masks for the subsequent one week. Covid test of household contacts of a positive patient has also been made compulsory. In addition, it will be mandatory to test all symptomatic contacts, the guidelines stated. In districts like Ghaziabad and GB Nagar, where more than 200 new cases are being reported every day, information on the development of any symptoms in patients will now be collected by the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre through phone calls for seven days from the date of the start of home isolation, officials said. Patients with severe symptoms and comorbid conditions have been directed to be admitted to L2 and L3 category hospitals, while critical patients will be admitted to ICU as per need. Such patients will be re-tested after seven days and even if the report is positive and the patient’s oxygen level is more than 94 (without any support), then he/she can be discharged on the tenth day, the guidelines said. Meanwhile, booster doses for senior citizens, healthcare and frontline workers are set to start from Monday. Over 100 booths have been set up for the three groups and the 15-17 years’ category in GB Nagar, while the drives would be carried at over 250 centres in Ghaziabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/at-4613-noida-has-ups-most-active-cases/articleshow/88798024.cms||Aditya Dev

The order comes into effect from January 10 midnight and only those who are fully vaccinated can avail themselves of the services. In salons, “only those activities that do not require removal of masks by anyone shall be allowed”. Masks must at all times in gym, says Maha govtThe notification states, "Beauty salons shall be grouped with hair cutting salons and shall be allowed to remain open with 50% capacity subject to restrictions for hair-cutting salons." Gymnasiums, too, are allowed to be open with 50% capacity subject to use of masks while performing any activity. Rekha Choudhary, wellness ambassador and managing director of OneLine Wellness, said beauty salons and spas had been allowed to resume operations about four to five months ago, but now salons have been allowed to operate, but spas can't. "In 2020, we could convince Union minister Nitin Gadkari about our industry, which is women-dominated but provides important services. He helped us to meet Union home minister Amit Shah who removed us from the negative list and issued a letter to that effect to all state governments. But it took us a long time to convince the Maharashtra government," she recalled. Choudhary said the pandemic has left people mentally disturbed and alternative therapy is required, which is what the industry provides. "While we are not medical practitioners, we follow very high standards of hygiene. Without understanding an industry, decisions are taken by the government," she alleged. Nikhil Rajpuria, preside-nt, Maharashtra Gym Owners' Association, said: "The earlier SOPs allowed the use of shields or masks. We shall continue using the shield and urge people to wear a mask while exercising. Most owners may keep their establishments shut on Sunday,"||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/day-after-state-lets-salons-gyms-open-at-50-capacity/articleshow/88798025.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||State sees 207 new Omicron +ve cases, 40 from Mumbai||Mumbai: The state confirmed 207 cases of Omicron on Sunday, taking the count of the cases caused by the variant to 1,216. Of the new cases, the majority were confirmed from Sangli, followed by Mumbai and Pune. Of the 40 cases detected from Mumbai, as many as 39 didn’t have an international travel history and may have got the variant locally. State officials said 155 cases have been confirmed by the B J Medical College and 52 by the National Institute of Virology through genome sequencing. So far, of the 1,216 cases in the state, 454 have already been discharged. Now, nearly 21 districts have reported cases of Omicron. Even remote districts like Nandurbar and Gadchiroli have reported two cases each. Of the 207 cases found on Sunday, 57 were from Sangli, 40 from Mumbai, 22 from Pune city, 21 from Nagpur and 12 from Thane, among others. The count of cases in Mumbai has touched 606, including international travellers who landed here. Genome sequencing in Mumbai has shown that Omicron is the dominant variant already. The milder illness seen by most patients also supports the findings. No patient has severe disease, the civic officials said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-sees-207-new-omicron-ve-cases-40-from-mumbai/articleshow/88798026.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Back-breaking pain in many recovering from Omicron||MUMBAI: Symptoms of Omicron may be increasingly labelled as mild but many recovering from it say they are grappling with excruciating body pain and weakness for days. Lower back pain is another recurrent complaint doctors are being presented with.  For Vikhroli resident Namrata (32), her symptoms started with sore throat, chills and fever. In a day, she was experiencing acute pain in her legs and back. “Every bone in my body was hurting. More than paracetamol, I needed painkillers,” she said, adding that the pain eased by the third day. Another Andheri resident said her fever and most other symptoms subsided with basic fever medication, but severe pain in the lower back was something she’d never experienced.  South Africa’s health insurer had done an analysis of Omicron symptoms and found that sore throat ranked among most common early symptoms, with congestion, dry cough and lower back pain. In Mumbai, doctors said that a low-grade fever and headache are reported by most patients. In some cases, fatigue and weakness last till the seventh or eighth day. Read AlsoIndia begins administering booster doze of Covid vaccine in high-risk populationAmid rising Covid-19 cases across the country, India began administering the “precaution dose” or the booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine in its high-risk population — frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities — on Monday.Physician Dr Hemant Thacker said body ache (myalgia), backache, low-grade fever, irritation of throat, are classic signs of flu seen in Omicron patients. “In dengue also you get bone-breaking pain, body ache and backache for three days before it starts to get better. Similarly, most Omicron patients start improving by the third or fourth day,” he said, adding that it was exacerbating diabetes and hypertension in patients with these diseases.  Dr Hemant Gupta, head of medicine at JJ Hospital, said the lower back pain is sometimes caused by gastritis due to medicines, including antibiotics. “In many cases, patients already have underlying aches and pains which get aggravated,” he said. But largely many are clear of the virus by the fifth day as their Rt-PCR tests turn negative by then, he added.

The big difference from Delta is that lungs are not affected. “We are not seeing thromboembolic events either such as strokes, heart attacks,” Samdani added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/back-breaking-pain-in-many-recovering-from-omicron/articleshow/88798029.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Daily Covid cases fall second day in a row in Mumbai, under 20,000 on Sunday||MUMBAI: The number of Covid-19 cases fell for the second day in a row in the city, taking fresh detections below 20,000 on Sunday. Mumbai detected 19,474 fresh cases, a 4% drop from Saturday’s 20,318. Even as the city added just 844 more new cases over the previous day, the daily positivity rate remained at 28.5%, a stark indicator that enough tests are either not done or recorded. Maharashtra marked a 7% rise in daily detections, despite the Mumbai dip. The state reported 44,388 new cases, an eight month-high since May 12, which took the state’s cumulative tally to 69,20,044. Mumbai’s caseload breached the 9 lakh mark (9,12,522). As predicted, active cases in the state went past 2 lakh while that of Mumbai rose to 1.17lakh. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the authorities don’t think Omicron has peaked in Mumbai and are preparing for a rise in hospitalisations by next week. More than 1,200 people have been admitting themselves every day since the past five days. On Sunday, 1,240 people were hospitalised. As of Sunday, 21.3% of the overall Covid beds were occupied, while nearly a third of the 2,593 ICU beds were taken. Of 11,326 oxygen beds, around 3,035 (26%) stand filled up. A good share of people coming positive are contacts of positive patients which is why the share of asymptomatic patients is 82%. “But many develop symptoms in the next 2-3 days as our teams have observed, and that could be driving our hospital numbers,” Kakani said. Typically, hospitalisations and ICU admissions lag behind cases by 1-3 weeks. He said ebbing of the surge or even plateauing would seem premature at present. City physicians believe that a huge number of cases are being missed by the official numbers because of the increase in self-testing. “We have more antigen positive cases which are not being measured,” said physician Dr Hemant Thacker, who consults with Breach Candy Hospital. He said the city may see a very sharp peak by the middle of next week. “It’s like a wave that will go through the population and disappear. Luckily, the symptoms are not as severe as Delta,” he added. Testing in Mumbai dropped for the third straight day. From a high of 72,442, it came down to 71,019 on Saturday and 68,249 on Sunday. While the state recorded a dozen deaths, Mumbai saw seven, up from five on Saturday. The state’s toll has increased to 1,41,639, including 16,406 from Mumbai. Discharges continued to be high in the state (15,351) as well as Mumbai (8,063), which state officials attributed to quicker recoveries. While MMR was contributing to 80% of cases till recently, on Sunday, its share was 75%, as Nashik and Pune circles reported a jump in cases. MMR reported 33,299 cases, Pune circle (6,933) and Nashik circle (1,497). Only four districts now have less than 100 active cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/daily-cases-fall-2nd-day-in-a-row-in-city-under-20k-on-sun/articleshow/88798030.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Booster drive kicks off today; less than 10 lakh eligible in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Fewer than 10 lakh people in Maharashtra, including frontliners and senior citizens, will qualify for the booster dose that is being rolled out from Monday. In Mumbai, less than two lakh people from these special groups are eligible to receive the free third shot. There is a lot of anguish among the medical fraternity, who believe the duration of nine months between the second and third shots fixed by the Centre has rendered most of them ineligible to get the booster immediately. Further, with many of them falling ill in the ongoing Omicron wave, they will have to delay it by another three months. The booster shot, which the Centre has called the precautionary dose, is being given to those who had finished their second dose by April 10, 2021, state officials said. Only senior citizens with comorbidities, and not all above 60 years, have been included to receive the booster. As per state figures, of the estimated 29 lakh senior citizens in Maharashtra, 1,00,452 of those with comorbidities will qualify on Monday. Due to the nine-month criteria, only a tiny fraction of frontliners will be able to take the shot—of estimated 12 lakh in the state, 5.08 lakh (42%) will qualify on Monday. Similarly, 3.26 lakh (15.5%) out of 21 lakh frontline workers are becoming eligible. Overall, a little over 9.3 lakh people in Maharashtra can take shots on Monday. In Mumbai, over 1.8 lakh, including 88,892 health workers, 80,969 frontline workers and 12,139 senior citizens with comorbidities, will be eligible. Boosters should have been allowed with a gap of six months, something that most countries have done, the head of a major private hospital told TOI. “We are starting boosters when 30% of healthcare work-ers in any medical institution are down with Covid and many others are probably infected, but don’t know,” he said. Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president, Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said that more than 400 PG doctors are down in Mumbai alone. “Omicron’s effect could have been blunted if we were boosted by now,” he said. Internal medicine specialist Dr Swapneil Parikh said the national vaccine thinktank has blocked the one action that would have taken some load off the system. He said people feel that boosting clinically vulnerable patients only protects them from severe Covid. “Boosting also reduces the risk of deterioration of pre-existing illnesses and takes the lid off the health system,” he said. State officials said vaccination for healthcare workers started on January 16, but the majority didn’t take the shots till the second wave started. Dr Sachin Desai said the drive for frontline workers began in February, but many got infected in the second wave and got delayed to get the second jab. Joy Chakraborty, COO of Hinduja Hospital, said in private facilities, most had taken both shots by April 2021, so would qualify. “In the next three weeks, a massive number will become eligi-ble for precautionary shots.” Watch Maharashtra: Frontline workers and seniors receive 'precaution dose' amid Omicron scare||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/booster-drive-kicks-off-today-less-than-10l-eligible-in-state/articleshow/88798031.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The state CID on Sunday issued summons to Dange to appear before the state CID office at CBD-Belapur in Navi Mumbai on Monday.An official from the state CID confirmed the news but refused to elaborate. However a home department official said that the ACB will continue the open inquiry of corruption against Singh which they had initiated last year on Dange’s complaint. Dange’s complaint pertains to 2019 November when he was attached to the DB Marg police station. Dange went to check pubs operating in the Akruti building at Breach Candy when a pub owner tried to pressurize him to operate beyond the stipulated deadline, claiming he had close connections with Param Bir Singh who was the then DG ACB.Later, a scuffle broke out outside the pub and the grandson of film producer Bharat Shah was arrested for allegedly assaulting a cop. The pub-bar owner was also booked in the case. Dange has alleged Singh suspended him and ordered a departmental inquiry against him in 2020 to shield the pub owner.Dange was suspended on July 18, 2020. He alleged a person claiming to be a cousin of Singh got in touch with him and demanded a huge amount to revoke his suspension.Dange, who is presently attached to South Control Room after his transfer from Gamdevi police station, has stated that his application discloses multiple cognizable offences committed by Singh and others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cid-summons-pi-dange-on-complaints-against-ex-cop/articleshow/88798034.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||Bulli Bai app case: Twitter handle led to arrest of Bengaluru student||MUMBAI: The city cyber police, probing the Bulli Bai app case, made their first breakthrough when they found that Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a second-year civil engineering student from Bengaluru who is one of the accused in the case, was the first among five followers of the Bulli Bai Twitter handle that was hosted on January 1. Jha was tracked down after the investigation team discovered that he had used his real Twitter handle to post content on the Bulli Bai handle. Jha was also found on GitHub, on which the Bulli Bai app was uploaded by its creator. Jha’s arrest helped the police to track the other two followers-- second-year BSc student Mayank Rawat (21) and Shweta Singh (18) from Uttarakhand. Mumbai cyber police claimed that the arrests of the three were done on evidence of their social media activity and links with the app’s creator, Niraj Bishnoi (21), who is currently in the custody of Delhi Police. Their claim was confirmed when Bishnoi (21), a second-year BTech student, told the Delhi Police during his interrogation that he was disturbed after learning about the arrest of three of his followers (Vishal, Shweta, and Mayank). Depressed over their arrests, Bishnoi got in touch with one Shubham Sharma and shared details to support his claim that he had created the app and to prove the innocence of the others. He shared login and email details, and screenshots with Sharma on a Twitter handle created by him on January 3. DCP KPS Malhotra from IFSO, Delhi Police, said the cops found that Bishnoi had intentionally divulged the details to Sharma on Twitter to gain publicity. But he had shared only partial details to support his claim of the creation of the app. He communicated through VPN so that he could not be traced. He even challenged law enforcement agencies to nab him. By using VPN and proton emails, he thought he could never be traced and arrested. Mumbai cyber police said they arrested the trio based on internet protocol (IP) addressed obtained from Twitter. Their cellphones and laptops were seized to recover their chat history and deleted posts. The trio will be produced before court after completing custody on January 10. Bishnoi, a second-year BTech student who was suspended from his institute after his arrest, claimed earlier that he hated certain classes of people and had been using Shweta’s Twitter handle to post content and propagate the Bulli Bai app, an officer from Delhi Police had said on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/twitter-handle-led-to-arrest-of-bluru-student/articleshow/88798037.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

In his weekly column, Rok Thok, in Saamna, Raut said that Mamata was dreaming of power in Goa by taking on board unstable people. Raut said that this did not suit didi’s image. Raut said it’s raining money in Goa ahead of assembly polls. “Now sitting on TMC’s shoulders, BJP wants to win Goa again. Parties like TMC and AAP come to Goa and spend unimaginable money. Goa’s culture and environment have deteriorated. It’s started raining money and all has gone wrong,” Raut said. Raut said he met Union minister Nitin Gadkari at Goa airport. “I met Nitin Gadkari and thought this efficient minister in Modi’s cabinet came to Goa for government work, but he too came for political reasons. He came to Goa to inaugurate the election office. In Goa, there is a queue of national leaders and Union ministers for BJP. Without Manohar Parrikar, BJP is facing elections; But on what issues will BJP contest elections? BJP has been in power in Goa for 10 years. BJP has never got a majority here. For last few years, it’s been trying to buy MLAs from other parties and get a majority after polls. This time too, BJP will not get a majority. It will be the biggest beneficiary of TMC coming to Goa...,” Raut said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-sena-hits-out-at-mamata-on-goa-poll/articleshow/88798040.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

As per the BMC’s Covid dashboard, K-West (parts of Andheri west, Juhu, Lokhandwala and Oshiwara and Juhu) tops the list of 24 wards with the highest active cases at 10,707. It is followed by K-East ward (Vile Parle east, Jogeshwari east and parts of Andheri east) at 7,038, and R-Central ward (Borivli, Gorai, Magathane) at 4,555. These three wards have high population density—7.2 lakh, 8.2 lakh and 5.6 lakh, respectively. A few corportors said that many of the Covid positive patients are those who had been infected in the past too. They added that most of the cases are reported from highrises, who prefer home quarantine. Corporator Vidyarthi Singh said in R-Central ward, cases are being reported from both slums and buildings. “But, people who are fully vaccinated are recovering fast as they have mild symptoms,” added Singh. On Sunday afternoon, Juhu beach, which falls in K-West ward, witnessed huge crowds. Upset, local corporator Renu Hansraj said: “The beach has been bustling despite the surge in Covid cases. Authorities need to try and keep the crowds in check. They can use the watch towers on beaches to make announcements and disperse people.” Dhaval Shah of the Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens’ Association said: “Despite the spiralling cases, markets are still buzzing and attracting crowds... But, unlike the first Covid wave, people now have a better understanding of the situation and are reaching out to general practitioners for treatment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-wards-covering-andheri-w-juhu-vile-parle-e-borivli-become-hotspots/articleshow/88798046.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Godman, IIT dropout among 6 arrested for ‘investment’ scam||MUMBAI: A spiritual leader from Uttar Pradesh is among six people who have been arrested for allegedly duping a businessman by inviting him to pay Rs 27 crore to pay tax to release an inward remittance of Rs 55,000 crore caught up for non-payment of the tax amount. The accused had asked the businessman to pay up Rs 27 crore initially after which the process to claim the big amount would begin. However, the businessman, who has lodged a complaint, did not fall into their trap and paid only Rs 30,000, said crime branch officials. A crime branch team led by DCP Neelotpal arrested the six accused from Bhandup on Friday. They have been identified as Bhaskarrao Yosupogu (44), Arindram Dey (38), Vinay Nair alias Rajvindra Mehra (50), Sumeet Nagarale alias Sumeet Punjabi (31), and spiritual leader Anilkumar Ishwarsharan Singh (63) from Uttar Pradesh and his aide Ajay Kumar Nishad (43). They are in police custody. Yosupogu met the complainant at a hotel in Bhandup. “He claimed that he had sold some precious metal to a company in Canada for 15 billion Euros. He said that the Canadian company had sent 6.7 billion Euros (Rs 55,000 crore) to his bank account but the RBI had held the money due to the unpaid tax. Yosupogu claimed he did not have Rs 27 crore to be paid by way of taxes,” said an officer. Yosupogu asked the complainant to invest Rs 27 crore to get the money cleared from the bank and that in return the investor would be paid 40% of the total money that he would get. At that time, the buisinessman paid Rs 30,000 to Yosupogu of the Rs 60 lakh that was sought as a token amount. A day later, they met at a restaurant in Bhandup where Yosupogu got some documents along to kick off the process to get the funds from Canada. He had agreed to a formal agreement for the deal. This is when the complainant approached the police. “The accused had asked for Rs 60 lakh as token amount which he claimed was required to get files moving. He also claimed that once the file is moved, the businessman would have to get his KYC documents submitted to the RBI office. These all were bogus claims,” said Neelotpal. The police arrested the accused while the six were negotiating at the restaurant. The police have recovered fake documents of RBI, DRDO and other key government agencies. “The brain behind this racket is said to be in Hyderabad,” said crime branch inspector Manish Shridhankar. Punjabi, said the police, claims he is an IIT Bombay drop-out and has studied at London School of Economics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/godman-iit-dropout-among-6-arrested-for-investment-scam/articleshow/88798048.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||DNA proves guilt beyond doubt, says Bombay HC; upholds lifer in rape-murder of 8-year-old||MUMBAI: Holding that DNA tests from hair detected on nail clippings and semen sample collected from a decomposed body nailed the case against the accused, the Bombay high court upheld the conviction and life sentence till his death of a Kurla youth for a June 2010 case of kidnap, rape and murder by strangulation of a minor. Some of the DNA in samples collected was degraded. But forensic expert Shrikant Lade had submitted that he got the specific male markers in the smear of the girl which was the important marker as far as DNA profiling was concerned. The child was about eight years old. Her decomposed body was found two weeks later on June 19, in a secluded locked slum room, a wire around her knee. Her clothes on the side, a man’s clothes in a bathroom. Her parents identified her, based on the clothes. In 2015, Mumbai sessions court convicted the 25-year-old which he appealed before the HC. The Mumbai police had collected DNA of 600 persons, of which the DNA of the convict “matched with the DNA of hair found in nail clipping and semen found in vaginal smear,” said the judgement by Justices S S Shinde and S P Tavade, dismissing his appeal. Last month, the HC had said that the DNA evidence and a witness proving the ‘last seen’ theory clinched the case for the prosecution in a case that rested on circumstantial evidence. The HC found no merit in the accused’s alibi. The accused was arrested on July 1, 2010, and is currently in Nashik central prison. Prior to her, two more girls — in the same age group — had gone missing from the same neighbourhood, said the court, and they too were murdered. The HC said the Supreme Court has held that DNA test has an unparalleled ability, both for exonerating the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty and that “if the sampling is proper and there is no evidence as to tampering of samples, the DNA test report is to be accepted.” Besides, the amended law calls for DNA profiling of accused in rape cases, the HC noted. Defence counsel Amin Solkar criticised the DNA analysis carried out by Lade. But the HC said Lade “is expert witness” who personally received the nail clippings from which he discovered the hair sample used to retrieve the DNA. He had detected eight markers in the hair DNA to match with the accused. Lade had collected the samples from the scene of offence where her body was found and also received samples from the medical officer. Solkar’s doubts on ‘degraded DNA’ were specifically answered by Lade, said additional public prosecutor Geeta Mulekar and the HC said the DNA was collected and stored properly and its test proves “involvement of the appellant…beyond reasonable doubt.” Lade said the DNA in hair was Y – chromosome specific — male Short Tandem Repeats Loci. Explaining it, he said, “YSTR loci means males specific Short Tandem Repeats present on Y chromosomes only. They are used to analyze rape cases.” It is a sensitive process. He said eight markers are needed for a 100 percent match. He submitted that he detected 8 markers on the hair detected on nail clippings of the girl’s body. He said he had 17 markers for the accused. Defence counsel said the DNA on vaginal swab had four markers matching with another man whose involvement cannot be ignored. But the HC said Lade’s evidence of 8 markers for a match excluded the other man.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dna-proves-guilt-beyond-doubt-says-hc-upholds-lifer-in-rape-murder-of-8-year-old/articleshow/88798050.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Cricket Board looking to stage the entire IPL in Maharashtra||Mumbai: Keeping in mind the rapidly rising cases of Covid-19 in the country, the BCCI, in Plan B, is now looking at staging the entire IPL this year in Maharashtra itself. TOI has learnt that the Board is looking at organizing the T20 league across three venues in Mumbai — the Wankhede Stadium, Brabourne Stadium, the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai (also a venue for the 2022 AFC’s Women’s Asian Cup in Jan-Feb), and the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Gahunje, near Pune.“On January 5, Hemang Amin (BCCI’s interim CEO and the Chief Operating Officer of the IPL) approached Vijay Patil (Mumbai Cricket Association president) in this regard, on the sidelines of the MCA’s Apex Council meeting. Subsequently, a few days later, Amin and Patil met Sharad Pawar at the NCP supremo’s residence. Pawar has given his green signal to the BCCI’s proposal. During this week or in the next 10 days, he, the BCCI and MCA officials will meet Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to arrange for the necessary permission in this regard. There should be no problem on this front, as the tournament will be played in a strict bio-bubble with no crowds, and the players and officials will be tested frequently,” reliable sources informed TOI.The source clarified that even though Maharashtra (40, 925 new cases on Saturday) and Mumbai (20, 971 fresh cases) were in the grip of a surge in covid cases, the state government, in its latest order on covid restrictions on Saturday, had allowed for sporting events if a few rules were followed strictly. As per the latest order of the Maharashtra government, “sporting competitive events are to be deferred, except for National and international level competitions already scheduled, with the following:1: No crowd, 2: Bio-bubble for all the players and officials. 3: GOI rules shall be applicable for all participating international and domestic players. 4: RT-PCR/RAT every third day for all the players and officials.” It is due to this reason that the state government has allowed the conduct of 2022 AFC Women’s Asia Cup in Maharashtra.Normally the IPL is staged on a home and away format, but the tremendous surge in covid cases in India— 1,41,986 fresh Covid-19 cases were recorded in the country on Saturday — has forced the BCCI to prune the number of centres from 10 to four. It was this increasing covid number which forced the BCCI to postpone all domestic tournaments on January 5. Restricting the whole league to just three stadiums in Mumbai and one venue in nearby Pune will help the BCCI eliminate air travel during the tournament, something which was cited as one of the major reasons for covid cases in the bio-bubble last year.“As of now, the plan is to stage the IPL in India. If, however, the Maharashtra option too is ruled out in the future, then the BCCI might be forced to take the IPL to the UAE again,” revealed a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cricket-board-looking-to-stage-the-entire-ipl-in-maharashtra/articleshow/88798059.cms||---

The active case tally in the state is shy of 50,000, and nearly 40,000 of these patients are from Bengaluru. The city registered a 27% increase in fresh cases over the previous day. Sources in the government, without admitting to a community spread of the virus, said the number of Covid cases will shoot up further in the next 10 days affecting all segments of the population. BBMP has scaled up daily tests in its limits, saying aggressive testing will help identify cases at an early stage and prevent further outbreaks. Over the past week, daily tests in the city have increased by over 70% — from about 42,000 to 72,000.  In Bengaluru, Bellandur has emerged as a Covid hotbed reporting 226 cases on Saturday alone, the highest among all 198 wards. It has had 1,043 cases over the past fortnight. The positivity rate in the state was 6.3%. The districts reporting cases in big numbers are Mysuru (398), Udupi (340), Dakshina Kannada (298) and Mandya (261).

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Fear of political fallout over health concerns? Govt’s stand on Congress padayatra draws flak||BENGALURU: As much as the Congress, which organised the Mekedatu padayatra amid alarming surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, the BJP government has come under criticism for its failure to prevent the event on Sunday. Till Saturday late evening, the government talked tough and even issued a circular barring movement of people as part of the weekend curfew clamped across the state. The government’s stand appeared so firm that even the organisers of the padayatra were prompted to change the strategy. KPCC president DK Shivakumar had stated that only Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah and he would walk the first stretch of 15km on the first day to avoid crowding. Even Ramanagar superintendent of police S Girish had said police would not allow the inaugural event. Cut to Sunday morning, Congress functionaries were surprised to find not even minimum effort from the government to prevent the congregation of about 20,000 people at Sangama of Mekedatu, the starting point of the padayatra. The SP and his team of police personnel remained mute spectators. “It looked like the government did nothing to stop the event given the sensitivity of the issue, as it involved drinking water and electricity projects. We had dared them to arrest us, but they did not, for obvious reasons,” said Bengaluru Rural MP and Shivakumar’s brother DK Suresh. The elected representatives from Bengaluru, which will be the main beneficiary of the Mekedatu project once implemented, reportedly prevailed upon the government that the tough action against the padayatra would result in huge loss of political dividends for the BJP. The same was conveyed to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai during his meeting with the ministers from the city. The government’s action was limited to tokenism by serving a notice to the organisers under the provision of the Disaster Management Act. “We want to address it politically, as the padayatra is politically motivated. Let the Congress be exposed as they are being irresponsible and unmindful of the rapidly spreading Covid infection. People will know of their political motive and punish them accordingly,” said home minister Araga Jnanendra, admitting that police were asked not to take action. By turning a blind eye to the health concerns, the government appears to have given an opportunity for the pandemic situation to worsen as the infection rate is peaking with daily cases crossing 12,000 on Sunday. Bengaluru, the hotspot for the pandemic, has a test positivity rate of 10.3% and people from the city had visited Mekedatu in hordes which may result in a spike of Ramanagar district TPR which is hovering around 1.8%. “The government should have been strict in implementation of our recommendations, otherwise the exercise of containing the Covid spread will turn out to be ridiculous,” said a member of Covid-19 technical advisory committee. The government’s policy--strictly imposing restrictions elsewhere, with the authorities not allowing shops to open and people to commute--is also being seen as a double standard. “How does the government explain the dual nature of its policy? On one hand, people are being caned for venturing out and their vehicles are being seized, but on the other hand, political parties are allowed to organise events,” said Harish Narasappa, co-founder of civil society organisation Daksh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/fear-of-political-fallout-over-health-concerns-govts-stand-on-cong-padayatra-draws-flak/articleshow/88798062.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||HCL asks exiting staffers to return bonus, draws ire||BENGALURU: HCL Technologies is in the midst of a controversy for asking employees who are quitting the firm to return the performance bonuses that were granted to them every month during the fiscal. The company says it is not doing anything that the employees did not already know. But for employees, many of who have already spent at least part of the money they received, the demand is turning out to be onerous. Some of them have approached IT employee unions. An HCL email sent in November said the employee performance bonus (EPB) will be paid on a monthly basis. It said the amount will be paid as an advance. And then goes on to say: “If the employee resigns and the last working day is during September 1, 2021, to March, 31, 2022, EPB amount from April 2021, till the last working day will be recovered in full.”  When TOI contacted HCL, a spokesperson said, “Supporting employees is HCL’s top priority. We have strict global compliance policies whereby every relevant applicable law, including those applicable to employees, are adhered to as per the laws of the countries we operate in. We would like to put on record that the matter around recovery of bonuses has been incorrectly reported. As a law-abiding organisation, HCL follows the best HR practices and continues to honour commitments and work in a fair and equitable manner towards all including employees.” Harpreet Saluja, president of Pune-based IT/ITeS union Nites, has in a letter to labour minister Bhupender Yadav said the union has received multiple complaints from HCL employees across India on the matter. "If the employees fail to pay the amount, his/her experience certificate, relieving letter and other employment documents & benefits are withheld by the company,” he said. Saluja described HCL's policy to recover the money as "iniquitous, arbitrary and harsh." “It is also to be noted that such recovery policy without any statutory approval is resulting in hardship and it far outweighs the equitable balance of the employer’s right to recover. It is almost impossible for an employee to bear the financial burden of a refund of payment of bonus received over a period of time under the current pandemic conditions," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hcl-asks-exiting-staffers-to-return-bonus-draws-ire/articleshow/88798064.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka may move SC for another round of counselling for engg seats||Times News NetworkBengaluru: The government is mulling moving the Supreme Court again to seek permission for another round of counselling for engineering seats after the NEET UG counselling. While the government had moved the SC once before seeking a mop-up round after NEET counselling, it had not expressed any view on it. That time, the state government had also sought an extension of date for admission to engineering. The SC had extended the last date of admission to engineering for the academic year 2021-22 to December 31. “That time the subject matter was too premature. Now that NEET counselling has got a go-ahead, we can move the SC again seeking a mop-up round. We do not have an estimate of the number of seats that might fall vacant when students choose medical seats. But we are guessing it would be around 1,000-2,000,” said the executive director of Karnataka Examinations Authority. Sources in the department said there have been discussions on removing the penalty for late surrendering of seats, but no decision has been taken yet. To prevent seat blocking, the overnment had stipulated that if a student surrenders a seat after the last date, he or she will have to pay a fine five times the annual college fee. It would amount to around Rs 3 lakh. Many students in a dilemmaMeanwhile, the delay in NEET counselling has left several students who have scored borderline ranks and are hoping to get medical or dental seat in a fix. “We received calls from several students seeking counselling on what they should do – wait for a medical seat or choose an engineering seat. Some of them have joined engineering. Some private universities have told them verbally that they would return the fees in case they get a medical seat,” said Ali Khwaja, founder, Banjara Academy.“This confusion has been happening since degree admissions. Many students got admitted for BSc, and when they joined engineering programmes later, refund of fees became an issue.

Rahul Bhat in his mid-20s, a resident of RT Nagar, was arrested on the basis of the complaint filed by Nishant with cybercrime police in the last week of December. The FIR was registered under the Information Technology Act-2000 and Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 384 (extortion). Bhat is said to be a friend-turned-foe of Nishant. Sources said a couple of more persons could be arrested in the case. “We have taken Bhat into custody for seven days and are tracing the number from which the obscene videos were sent,” police said. The videos allegedly show the minister’s son with a woman. “On December 25, someone sent obscene video clippings and pictures to mobile phones of Srinivas Gowda and Bhanuprakash, personal secretaries of my father. Then, the sender sent messages saying if we don’t pay the money demanded by them, these clippings will be uploaded on social media and shared with TV channels. These fake clippings are edited to tarnish the images of me and my father. There are influential persons behind this,” Nishant stated in his complaint. Nishant alleged that miscreants are plotting to finish their political careers. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Raman Gupta confirmed to TOI that one accused has been arrested in the case and further probe is on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/astrologers-kin-nabbed-for-blackmailing-ministers-son/articleshow/88798067.cms||---

Veerabhadra Swamy of Malagala told police that Santosh alias Tapan of Rajajinagar recently threatened him saying he was a rowdy-sheeter and extorted money in two instalments. But it is not clear how and when Swamy came in contact with Santosh and under what circumstances he paid the money. “Swamy is making contradictory statements, making it difficult for us to arrive at a conclusion.

The victim, Mehaboob Pasha of AK Colony, had rushed to the rescue of a minor boy, who was being beaten up for not repaying a Rs 1,200 loan he had taken from a common friend. Police investigations revealed Manikanta alias Mani, also from AK Colony, had given Rs 1,500 to the minor to open an account in a mobile-gaming app during August 2020. A few months later, the boy returned Rs 30. Manikanta, a daily-wage worker, was repeatedly forcing the minor to repay the balance amount. The boy is a common friend of Pasha and Manikanta. On January 4 evening, the boy met Manikanta and sought more time to repay the balance. As Manikanta refused, Manjunath, who was accompanying the minor, screamed at Manikanta for being rigid. Soon, a heated argument ensued. A little later, Manjunath and some others met Manikanta and his friends near a temple in Konanakunte Cross. The groups clashed and the minor boy called Pasha, who was resting at home. Manikanta and the others attacked Manjunath and Pasha with lethal weapons, severely injuring them. Pasha died of stab injuries the next day, while Manjunath is recovering. Manikanta and eight of his associates have been sent to judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/nine-arrested-for-murdering-labourer-over-1200-loan/articleshow/88798070.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Can levy central excise duty, GST together: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: Holding that the sources of power under Articles 246A (pertaining to levy of GST) and 246 are mutually exclusive and could be simultaneously exercised, the Karnataka high court has dismissed a batch of petitions filed by manufacturers of tobacco and tobacco products. They had challenged the July 6, 2019 notification issued by the central government whereby central excise duty has been levied on tobacco and tobacco products. The court also negated the challenge in respect of levy and collection of National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) vis-a-vis tobacco and tobacco products, saying that Article 271 clearly provides that surcharge can be levied at any time to increase duties or taxes. “It must be noted that the levy is also for the purpose of revenue generation and the choice of the category of goods for the purpose of revenue generation cannot ipso-facto be a ground of judicial review and something more is required such as hostile discrimination and singling out a particular category of goods. In fact, the choice of the category of goods as in the present case may also be influenced by the objective of discouraging consumption and accordingly, the choice of the category of goods for the purpose of revenue generation cannot be held to be arbitrary,” justice Sunil Dutt Yadav noted. The judge also added that as levy under Article 246 is permissible even after introduction of Article 246A, the levy of surcharge tracing power under Article 271 would still subsist even if the goods are subjected to levy of GST under Article 246A. VS Industries and several other companies involved in manufacturers of tobacco and tobacco products had filed these petitions, contending that simultaneous levy of GST under Article 246A of the Constitution and levy of basic excise duty and NCCD under Article 246 on tobacco and tobacco products is legally impermissible and discriminatory. The petitioners had also sought for a declaration that the repeal and saving provision as contained in section 174 of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 (CGST Act) insofar as it seeks to save the operation of the Central Excise Act, 1994 in relation to tobacco and tobacco products as unconstitutional and bad in law. The petitioners claimed that levy and collection of NCCD has been impliedly repealed with effect from July 1,2017 i.e., the date on which CGST Act, 2017 came into effect and hence, whatever amount collected should be ordered to be refunded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/can-levy-central-excise-duty-gst-together-hc/articleshow/88798073.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Weekend curfew speeds up road infra work||Bengaluru: Several important stretches such as Nandidurga Road, JC Nagar Road and an underpass on Dr Rajkumar Road, among others, have been asphalted since Saturday morning. BS Prahlad, chief engineer of BBMP road infrastructure division, said, “When we have to asphalt the entire road, we tend to start work after 10pm as vehicular movement will be low then. But the weekend curfew is helping us in a big way and has given us so much more time to finish work.” “In addition to the curfew, we also have a clear sky and dry weather ,which is the best time to asphalt roads. It has always been difficult to complete asphalting just before and during monsoon,” Prahlad said. In addition to this, work on filling potholes across the city is also being carried out in an accelerated manner during the weekend curfew. As on Friday, the road infrastructure division of BBMP was yet to fill potholes on 21 roads over a distance of 67.3km. But on Sunday, the number of roads with potholes to be filled reduced to eight, spanning a length of 27.3km. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha said, “We have seen BMRCL work round the clock and take advantage of lockdowns and weekend curfews. This is the first time we are seeing BBMP actively make use of the weekend curfew. A couple of weekend curfews are likely to give the Palike time to fix potholes across the city.”Srinivas pointed out that because of low vehicular movement on account of weekend curfew, the asphalt gets enough time to set. “One of the biggest issues with asphalting roads is they are not given enough time to set because of almost immediate vehicular movement,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/weekend-curfew-speeds-up-road-infra-work/articleshow/88798075.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Promising marriage and jobs, man cheats 26 women of 21 lakh||BENGALURU: Cybercrime police have arrested a 34-year-old former lineman with Hubli Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) in Muddebihal, Vijayapura district, on the charge of cheating several women after promising to marry them or get them jobs. Police records show that the accused — Jaibheem Vittal Padukotti, a resident of Vijayapura — was also arrested in 2013 on murder charges. Padukotti has now been arrested in a cheating case registered at Southeast CEN police station in Bengaluru. “Prima facie, probe has revealed that Padukotti cheated 26 women to the tune of Rs 21 lakh. He promised some of them Hescom jobs and others marriage. Padukotti has at least 16 profiles under different names, castes and jobs. While claiming to be an engineer, he made many spelling mistakes in the profiles. Had the women noticed them, they would have grown suspicious and might have saved themselves,” an investigating officer said. The suspect is said to have confessed to cops that he spent most of the money visiting Goa, Puducherry and other tourist places. Padukotti worked with Hescom for eight months in 2012 on compassionate grounds after his father Vittal Yamanappa, a lineman, died in the line of duty. But he was arrested in 2013 on the charge of murdering a woman in Muddebihal. After walking out on bail from judicial custody after two years, he found it difficult to live without a job and began cheating women after contacting them through matrimonial sites. He is married.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Number of untraced minor girls rose tenfold last year||BENGALURU: There was a sharp rise in kidnapped minor girls remaining untraced in Bengaluru in 2021. However, police say most of the cases were reported in the last quarter of the year and they would be rescued at the earliest. According to police records, 105 of the 578 girls kidnapped in 2021 are yet to be traced. The number of girls remaining untraced is 10 times more from the previous year. In 2020, 463 girls were kidnapped and 453 were traced. In 2019, of the 600 abducted, 585 were rescued. Fifteen remain untraced. According to cops, the 2021 number appears high but that need not be a cause for concern as it will take time for them to track the girls and reunite them with their families. “Around 90% of these are cases of elopement. We find it difficult to trace them since the girl would have settled in some corner of the state or the country. In many cases, they would have got married too. They either stop using mobile phones or change their numbers and remain incommunicado. Sometimes, we get the leads after the girls contact their family members or friends. Some elopement cases are solved quickly while some drag on. The number of untraced victims in 2021 will surely come down by mid-2022,” a former DCP said. When a minor girl goes missing and her family is not sure whether it is a missing case or elopement, cops register the case under IPC section 363 (kidnapping). However, when it is confirmed it is an elopement case and the accused had developed physical relationship with the girl, the case is converted into one under Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act with IPC section 366A (procuring minor girl). If the accused is chargesheeted for kidnap, courts will award imprisonment of up to seven years with a fine. Charges under Pocso and IPC section 366A will attract imprisonment of not less than 10 years with a fine. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Raman Gupta said: “In 2021, we detected many cases reported in 2020. We’ll find the untraced girls from 2021 soon,” he said. Though the minor girl would have married the accused, he will be chargesheeted. Courts have convicted such people in many cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/number-of-untraced-minor-girls-rose-tenfold-last-year/articleshow/88798078.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Drive to ‘sanitise’ Kannada language kicks up a row||BENGALURU: Every Kannadiga with an online presence seems to have something to say about ‘Ellara Kannada’ these days. It’s a campaign that seeks to eschew aspirated consonants (mahapranas) in written Kannada and replace Sanskrit/Sanskritised Kannada words with simple Kannada. While the name Ellara Kannada (everyone’s Kannada) itself has raised the hackles of many, quite a few feathers have been ruffled by the campaign’s objectives. From authors to new-age language/script reform enthusiasts to Kannada activists, the debate is swamping the online Kannada world. “We in Kannada have the option of writing what we speak, why do you want to snatch it away? I think it would be foolish to do so. Some people may speak Kannada differently, but I cannot be forced to give up speaking or writing in a particular way,” poet Pratibha Nandakumar said. Ellara Kannada is the term associated with the loosely connected efforts at script reformation by various groups and individuals. Over the past few years, words with roots in Kannada have been coined by these activists as an alternative to technical and common usage words from English and Sanskrit. Some of these words like ‘minchanche’ for email and ‘neralachchu’ for photocopy have gained popularity. Websites such as Honalu.net publish Kannada articles which follow the Ellara Kannada ideals. Publisher Guruprasad DN said aspirated consonants are a real problem. “As a publisher, I know most people can’t make out the difference. And eschewing mahapranas is not a new idea. In 1946, Prof M Mariyappa Bhat showed how mahapranas are not native to Kannada. DN Shankara Bhat is its biggest proponent. There are quite a few like KV Narayana, Ranganatha Kantanakunte and others who are writing about it and in it,” he said. A matter of choiceShankara Bhat started the revolution around 2006 after decades of study. Though he did not use the term Ellara Kannada, he stated the need to reduce phonemic letters in Kannada from 49 to 32 by dropping the mahapranas. Since then, he has penned many books using only the 32 alphabets. Bhat, however, has refused to be drawn into any debate on the issue and has held the view that he will use only the 32 alphabets, notwithstanding what others do. Bharat Kumar, a techie, language activist and Ellara Kannada proponent, has over the years been instrumental in publishing dictionaries like ‘Padanerake’, which he co-authored with Bhat. These dictionaries include alternative words created for Sanskrit and English terms. “Both academic and non-academic individuals and groups have been using Kannada without mahapranas for some time now. There are even novels being written in this form. If someone does not want to follow it, it is their choice,” he said. A few Facebook posts called for Ellara Kannada as a New Year’s resolution last week, sparking off fresh debate. Guruprasad announced he would publish one article every day in his Naanugauri website in Ellara Kannada. Writing Kannada without using aspirated consonants is nothing new. For ages, many have tried to not only eschew the consonants and alphabets derived from Sanskrit, but also completely ignore Sanskrit words in written Kannada. But these have been exceptions, not the rule. Pratibha Nandakumar said the latest attempt has more to do with the anti-Brahminical undertones of Ellara Kannada. “It is obvious. This was a fringe issue. Some people are trying to bring it to the mainstream by projecting it as a Dalit vs Brahmin debate,” she said. Deliberate or otherwise, the rupture between those for and against mahapranas in Kannada is real and is now spilling out into the open.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/drive-to-sanitise-kannadalanguage-kicks-up-a-row/articleshow/88798079.cms||Shyam Prasad S

Although the detailed project report (DPR) suggests that work on the Rs 175-crore four-lane flyover is likely to be completed in 18 months, BBMP claims it may be able to finish it ahead of the original deadline. “No land acquisition or felling of trees is required for this project. These are two things that consume the maximum amount of time. Hence, we are likely to finish it in 12 months,” said BS Prahlad, chief engineer of BBMP road infrastructure division. In addition to this, the Palike is also following the lead of BMRCL and not diverting traffic during construction of the flyover. The elevated corridor will integrate police station circle, NES Junction, Seshadripuram College junction and Sandeep Unnikrishanan Road junction. PV Poornima, joint commissioner, Yelahanka zone, said, “Since the past two to three years, we have noticed a huge rise in vehicular movement in this area. There are many reasons for the increase in traffic, including new educational institutions coming up in this part of the city, Doddaballapura becoming an industrial area and more. This flyover will help decongest traffic to a huge extent.” The flyover is likely to be 1.8km long. “The width of the carriageway is 15 metres, and the total width is 19.2 metres. The flyover has two parts, one on Doddaballapura road where work has already begun, and another which connects Yelahanka Old Town with Kogilu Road or airport road, which is yet to begin,” Prahlad added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/yelahanka-integrated-flyover-may-be-ready-in-1-year/articleshow/88798081.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

---||Chennai||Chennai: It went by drill on first Sunday lockdown of third Covid wave||CHENNAI: Getting used to the lockdown drill over the past two years, city residents on Sunday remained indoors by and large due to complete lockdown amidst a surge in Covid-19 cases. Arterial roads such as Anna Salai, GN Chetty Road, Eldams Road, Poonamalee High Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kamarajar Salai, Rajiv Gandhi Salai and East Coast Road wore a deserted look, except for a few food delivery agents and essential services. As MTC bus services had been suspended, auto and cab drivers fleeced passengers, who waited for long hours at key transit points across the city. S Sivakumar, who reached Central Railway Station by an express train said auto drivers demanded 400 for a ride to Royapettah. Usually, they charge less than 150 for such short trips. He arrived in Chennai to meet a relative, who had been admitted at a local government hospital. Such passengers were solely dependent on suburban trains. But only 50 per cent of the available trains were operated. The situation was no different at Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT), Koyambedu. Some of the passengers from North Indian states were left stranded for the whole day. These passengers, who reached Tamil Nadu after 2-3 days of travel by express trains and later managed to reach CMBT in autorickshaws, had no clue about the complete lockdown. They slept at the terminus overnight waiting to catch the first bus in the early morning on Monday. The food delivery business too was lacklustre with less number of orders, said delivery executives of online food aggregators. Greater Chennai police fined 5,971 people for not wearing masks and collected 11.94 lakh in fines. They registered 318 cases and seized 761 vehicles, including 665 bikes and 66 autorickshaws, on Saturday. As many as 12 people were booked for drunken driving. On Sunday, as many as 312 check points were set up across the city. Those who came with hospital receipts, marriage invitations and train tickets were let off, while those who were found roaming around unnecessarily were booked. In all, 10,000 police personnel from law and order, traffic and armed police wings had been deployed on bandobust duty in the city. Police personnel were continously patrolling to check if shops and commercial establishments were kept open. Autorickshaw and cab drivers were asked to show the photocopy of the train and flight tickets of their passengers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/it-went-by-drill-on-first-sunday-lockdown-of-third-covid-wave/articleshow/88798083.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Man who claimed to be Udhayanidhi Stalin’s aide held||CHENNAI: A 36-year-old man who defrauded a woman of Rs 4.5 lakh by promising her a government job after claiming that he was the personal assistant (PA) to Chepauk MLA Udhayanidhi Stalin was arrested on Sunday. According to police, K Thenmozhi (33) of Tirupattur was working in a private firm in Chennai in 2018 when she got acquainted with Rajesh Karunamurthy of Chennai through a friend. As the friend said Rajesh could get her a government job, she paid Rs 4.5 lakh to Rajesh in installments. However, she soon realised that she was cheated and wanted her money back. Rajesh, meanwhile, failed to return the money and ignored her calls. Hence, the woman lodged a complaint with Kandili police in Tirupattur district. Even while the inquiry was underway on her complaint, Rajesh called her and claimed that he was the PA to Udhayanidhi Stalin, the Chepauk MLA. He also threatened her that her life would be ruined if she persisted with the case Thenmozhi recorded the telephonic conversation, which was later leaked on social media. She again lodged a complaint with Kandili police on the threat issued by Rajesh. The police carried out a detailed probe and arrested Rajesh for cheating the woman and misusing the MLA’s name. Police said Rajesh had no political party affiliation. He was booked on charges of cheating, impersonation and criminal intimidation. He had lured job aspirants with similar promises at other locations in the State as well. “He was using the names of prominent politicians depending on the district where he operated,” said a police officer. He has been remanded.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/man-who-claimed-to-be-udhayanidhis-aide-held/articleshow/88798085.cms||---

The outlets in Chennai and its three neighbouring districts accounted for about 25 per cent of the total sale recorded on Saturday, the official sources said. Usually, the liquor sold for Rs 290-300 crore over the weekend — on Saturday and Sunday combined. However, Covid-19 protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing were thrown to the wind as customers were competing with each other to get their share of liquor. The outlet in Thoraipakkam on Rajiv Gandhi Salai wore a chaotic look in the evening. The customers were jostling with each other and some were seen without wearing masks near the sale counter. The scene was no different at two outlets in Madipakkam.Clearly, enforcement of the Covid protocols at the outlets had taken a backseat. When contacted, official sources in TASMAC said they would bring back the system of circle markings for individuals to maintain social distancing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tasmac-nets-218-cr-in-lockdown-eve-liquor-sales/articleshow/88798086.cms||---

The burglars drilled holes on the walls of the outlets and escaped with the bottles. At a shop located close to the TN-AP border, the employees found the CCTV installed outside the shop broken. While checking the shop, they found a hole on the wall. They had emptied the rack containing nearly 450 bottles from the shop and Rs 10,000 from the cash box. In another shop located in the same area, they have made away with close to 50 bottles and a CCTV installed inside the shop. Kanakammachatram police have registered a case and are investigating.

The woman, Ellammal, was let off in the evening. A ward councillor at Sriperumbudur Panchayat Union, she was picked up from her house in Maduramangalam on Sunday morning and taken to Sunguvarchathram police station for inquiry. The detention comes just three days after BJP leader and former union minister Pon Radhakrishnan visited her at her house, giving rise to speculations that Guna might join the party this week. Ellammal had been nominated for the chairperson post of the panchayat union and managed to get half the votes. She, however, eventually lost in the draw held to break the tie. Guna, who has over 24 cases of murder, attempted murder, kidnap, and extortion pending against him, was into extortion in the industrial hubs of Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, and Tiruvallur districts. He was arrested last year for attempting to grab the land of a woman, but went absconding after coming out on bail. Police sources said Guna continues to control his scrap business through his associates. After ADSP Vellaidurai was transferred to Kancheepuram a few weeks ago to control rowdyism, police intensified search for Guna; two policemen were also arrested allegedly for aiding Guna. Police also summoned representatives of manufacturing units in the region and told them that they need not pay mamool to rowdies. While the police detained Ellammal and let her off in the evening, they arrested Yuvaraj and Bhaskar from Tiruvallur; Thignanasambandan and Jothi from Villupuram; and Subash from Jharkhand for aiding the history-sheeter. Police sources said the special team is questioning them as they were closely associated with Guna and were helping him with accommodation. Police have also seized a car, a minivan, and two bikes from the five.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/wife-of-kanchi-history-sheeter-arrested-let-off/articleshow/88798089.cms||---

The TNSTC had announced that over 2,300 buses would be operated next Sunday from different parts of the state to Chennai and began online ticket booking three weeks ago on government website http://www.tnstc.in/ as well as through private sites like RedBus, PayTM, and Abhibus. Over 25 per cent of the seats were reserved by last Thursday, according to official data. It was against this background that the state government announced that January 9 (Sunday) will be a complete lockdown. No government bus was allowed to ferry passengers on Sunday. "We have put the online ticket reservation on hold as none knows whether there will be a lockdown next Sunday," said a senior transport official, seeking anonymity. Those who had planned to return to Chennai next Sunday in private buses are also in a fix. “The government has to announce its decision soon, not wait till Thursday evening again,” said D Deepak, who cancelled his January 16 ticket from Nagercoil to Chennai in a private A/C sleeper bus. "We had booked tickets in advance to avoid crowd and last minute confusion. It, however, looks like our return trips are going to be chaotic," he added. Meanwhile, the Southern Railway, which has not cancelled any of its express trains, is expected to operate all long-distance trains to Chennai as per schedule.

It has written to the Centre to approach other developing nations and form a coalition at the WTO meeting on January 10 to seek exemption for vaccines, diagnostic kits, medical masks and other personal protective equipment. In the petition to the Union ministry of commerce and industries, association president Sanjai Gandhi pointed out India and South Africa had jointly forwarded a proposal to the WTO in October 2020 seeking a temporary waiver to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and drugs to curb the spread of Covid-19 in developing countries. The move received the support of over 120 countries. The United States announced its support for the proposal. However, this was restricted to vaccines only. “With the COVID cases starting to peak again, it is imperative that all member-states support the proposal to cover not just vaccines but also diagnostics, therapeutics and other health technologies,” the petition said. A waiver of patent rights would provide countries with the policy space to address IP barriers to increase collaboration in research, development, manufacturing and supply of Covid-related technologies. The petition noted that a small group of high-income countries such as UK and Switzerland are still opposed to such a waiver. Citing statements from leaders of countries such as South Africa, Italy, and Mexico in support of the waiver, the petition said developing countries should make a collective application for patent waiver, instead of India and South Africa individually proposing the waiver.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/waive-patent-for-covid-care-petition-to-centre/articleshow/88798091.cms||Srikkanth D

The training will take place during the closure of schools for Classes I to IX owing to a spike in Covid-19 cases. The program will be organized in hi-tech labs in government high schools at block level.“The State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has defined learning outcomes for each lesson. To clarify doubts on learning outcomes and to make sure each student achieve those learning goals, further training is needed,” a circular from the school education department said.Teacher associations, however, opposed a move to conduct training for more than 100 teaches at a location when the Covid-19 cases are set to reach the peak in the coming weeks.“When Covid-19 is spreading fast, asking teachers to assemble at block-level in one place may result in spread of Covid-19 infection.It is not possible to ensure social distancing within the hi-tech labs. Hence, the training program needs to be conducted after the Covid-19 cases subside,” said P K Ilamaran, president of Tamil Nadu Teachers Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/lockdown-lessons-on-learning-outcomes/articleshow/88798094.cms||---

In addition, there is the GST council meetings and the follow up. Last week, PTR informed the leadership about his intent to give up the party post and the leadership too turned around to agree with his decision,” multiple sources in the DMK said. “After looking at options and considering the suggestion from the outgoing IT wing secretary, the DMK leadership has opted to hand over the responsibility of the party’s IT wing to three-time MLA from Mannargudi T R B Rajaa. A formal announcement is likely to be made by the DMK in the next few days,” a highly placed source in the DMK, on condition of anonymity told TOI. Neither Palanivel Thiaga Rajan nor TRB Rajaa responded to calls made by this correspondent on Sunday. Ironically, it was the opposition AIADMK that formally launched an IT wing in 2014 in Tamil Nadu. Political observers credit the AIADMK’s victory in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2016 assembly elections, when it retained the state for a record second time, partly to the IT wing’s campaign strategy. Impressed, the DMK too formed its own IT wing in July, 2017 and handed the responsibility to Thiaga Rajan, a former international banker and the then two-time MLA. It subsequently declared the IT wing as a recognized arm of the party and eventually came to power in the summer of last year. “With finance minister preoccupied with his government-related work, the IT wing had kind of remained dormant to the extent that it is yet to shed its image as an opposition towards its approach to issues, though it has been over eight months since the DMK has come to power,” said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/ptr-quits-as-dmk-it-wing-secy-t-r-b-rajaa-to-get-post/articleshow/88798095.cms||D Govardan

The report, which had been submitted to chief minister M K Stalin, stated that the city's stormwater drains (SWDs) need to be deepened and widened in almost all the 15 zones, according to official sources. “All encroachments along waterbodies need to be removed and rainwater harvesting structures must be installed in all households,” said the report, adding that the current capacity of the SWDs was insufficient to carry all the rainwater during the monsoon. Dhayanand Krishnan, a Geographic Information System consultant who had worked with metrowater and the corporation on stormwater drain projects, said the full report should be made public before the civic body carries out any stormwater drain project. “Stormwater drain projects need to take climate change into consideration. In Singapore, rainwater retention sumps are being constructed as drains alone cannot help the city withstand flooding,” said Krishnan. He said since the capacity of lakes and ponds has shrunk, the corporation may need to think of creating a retention system. “Only if the report is made public can opinion of experts and local residents be sought,” he added. Officials said a detailed report is expected to be submitted in three months and it is likely to be made public. After the committee submitted the interim report, it may be recalled, the chief minister announced flood-mitigation projects worth 1,000 crore and said an exclusive committee would be formed to inspect irregularities in Chennai Smart City projects. The chief minister had said that T Nagar was severely inundated during this year’s rains because of poor implementation of smart city projects. Meanwhile, the corporation has begun stormwater drain projects worth 270 crore. Works are underway in locations like Wall Tax Road in Zone 5.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/flood-report-puts-spotlight-on-holes-in-citys-drainage/articleshow/88798097.cms||---

Lakshmi S, a resident, said her father who had given a test on Wednesday in a private lab received his results only on Saturday. “We took a test in a private hospital. We could not wait for the test results. We went ahead with the CT scan and began his treatment,” she said. Similarly, another 84-year-old woman, who got tested in a government hospital on Wednesday, received the results on Friday. “After my mother tested positive, the corporation officials visited my house in Velachery and took swabs of my wife and children on Saturday. We have not received the results till Sunday night,” said a resident, who did not want himself or the government hospital to be named. While Covid-19 norms say a person can be discharged if they observe no fever after three days of testing positive in an RTPCR, a delay in results may end up the quarantine period for the patients. The delay has its mental aspects too. A doctor from the microbiology department of Stanley GH said there was a rise in samples coming in from the corporation lately. “We process the day's samples fully. A day’s delay in RTPCR status can only occur in one or two cases,” the doctor said. City corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said more than 30,000 tests were being done in the city lately. This is an increase from the 20,000-odd tests done till last week. “To our knowledge, results are given at the right time and there has been no delay. In case of specific private labs delaying the results, we will follow up with them,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/time-taken-to-get-rtpcr-results-shoots-up-in-city/articleshow/88798098.cms||Omjasvin M D
---||Chennai||Chennai: Corporation scrambles to follow up on patients||CHENNAI: As Covid-19 active cases surge, the civic body is struggling to follow up on patients in the city who have tested positive. The city has 25,798 cases and at least 90% of these patients are in home-quarantine, making it hard for the 1,000 door-to-door volunteers, recruited by the corporation, to follow up on all patients. Several residents remain clueless on how to proceed after they turn positive. Many of them said they have not yet received calls or visits from the civic body. N Srijith, a resident from Purasawalkam, said he tested positive on Friday but did not receive a call from the corporation until Sunday. “I did not know if I should isolate myself or visit a hospital. I got myself paracetamol tablets and isolated myself at home, waiting for a call from the corporation staff for a follow up,” he said. Aparna Ganesan from Madipakkam, who tested positive on January 9 at 1pm, received a call from the corporation by 3pm. “The staff said they would only come the next day at 10 am to test other contacts in my family and decide whether they should be isolated or not,” she said. However, corporation protocol directs staff to visit the houses of positive patients the same day, ferry them in the an ambulance to screen them and decide if they must be home-quarantined or hospitalised. 74-year-old S Samy from T Nagar said he received a visit from the corporation on January 6, the day after he and his wife had tested positive. After that, nobody visited to check if the families needed essentials. “I went to a private lab for CT scan and followed up with my private doctor. A corporation staff on the first day visited us, stuck a poster saying I must be in quarantine till Jan 20, and left. Nobody checked on us after that,” he said. Corporation officials, meanwhile, said they have added additional staff in the tele-counselling centres on January 8 to follow up on patients. A total of 129 tele-callers and 19 doctors have been appointed for the call centres, and each person has been asked to make at least 100 calls a day. “In many cases, patients have not attended calls made for follow-ups. However, I have still instructed the counselling staff to call them again repeatedly,” said corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Data shared by the civic body showed that on Sunday, 22 patients did not attend calls in zone 6 (Thiruvika Nagar), 70 did not attend in zone 7 (Ambattur), and 303 did not attend in zone 8 (Anna Nagar) and about 200 did not attend in zone 10 (Kodambakkam). The commissioner said he has instructed a team of 15 IAS officers to visit tele-counselling centres to inspect if the staff are on duty. “I review this on a daily basis and we will be covering all the patients. Follow up on patients through regular phone calls is an exclusive strategy of the corporation and it is not found in other cities. We will make it better, ” he said. The IAS officials are also told to catch up with the door-to-door volunteers every morning, and give them a pep talk to boost their morale. The zonal officials have been instructed to have a list of positive patients at 7 am in the morning, and to ensure 100% follow up of all patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/corpn-scrambles-to-follow-up-on-patients/articleshow/88798099.cms||Omjasvin M D

Sankarbabu, a final-year engineering student from a city college, worried about a possible delay in semester exams and completing his course on time. He got placed in a software company with a rider that he should clear all his exams without arrears. Ankita Kerketta from Andaman and Nicobar islands, a first-year MSc student in a city college, is stuck in her hostel and awaiting the announcement for her exams. She says she will return to her native place only if her college allows her to take her exams in online mode. She is not sure if she would be able to return to the city to write physical mode exams. Colleges say that the syllabus was completed last month but the government gave two months’ time for semester exams without considering the Covid-19 situation. Now, there is an uncertainty regarding the exams. “If the exams had got over in December 2021, I could have focussed on the next semester. Now, I have to study for the last semester and the next semester at the same time. I’m not sure when physical mode exams will be conducted,” Sankarbabu said. Higher education minister K Ponmudi had earlier granted two months time to students to prepare for physical mode exams. The state government also postponed semester exams for all colleges, including autonomous colleges and deemed universities to January 21. Because of this decision, many colleges repeated what they taught online in physical mode classes as well. “The lack of planning on the part of higher education department has created uncertainty among students. It was a good move to conduct physical mode exams. But they wasted a month when exams could be conducted and students could have moved on to the next semester,”said a principal who spoke on a condition of anonymity. S Vaidhyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of Sastra, said final year students should be given priority over other students. Meanwhile, students from Class X and Class XII continue to attend physical classes despite an increase in cases. Hemavathi, a Class XII student from a city school said she was more worried about her board exams than the rapidly spreading Covid-19 cases in Chennai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/surge-in-cases-lack-of-planning-affects-students/articleshow/88798100.cms||A Ragu Raman

Passenger traffic, especially international, increased at a faster rate despite restrictions and a need for testing, in the last two months. However, domestic traffic growth remained sluggish. The airport handled more international travellers after Delhi and Mumbai while it lagged far behind in domestic traffic than the five other metro airports. The airport handled 10.75lakh passengers in November and 12.93lakh passengers in December. There were 1.82lakh international travellers in November while it increased to 2.46lakh passengers in December. The number of domestic passengers was 8.93lakh in November and 10.4lakh in December. There is a faster growth of international passengers (up by 65%) when compared to the same period last year. An airport official said that there is a good demand for international travel because people from other towns are boarding flights in Chennai. "The launch of flights to Singapore gave a boost to passenger traffic,” he added. S Bhaskar of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) said flights to UAE, Saudi Arab and Singapore are packed, while Maldives remain popular. “The demand is huge on the international sector because of limited number of flights,” he added. However, there is a lull in the domestic sector because airlines have cut frequencies or are combining flights based on the traffic on many sectors. "Airlines have withdrawn many flights to smaller cities and have re-deployed them on profitable routes. There are not enough flights to Port Blair, Mumbai, Ahmedabad as there used to be earlier,” he added. Airlines and airports authorities expect a dip in the number of domestic passengers in the coming days. “People are likely to put off their leisure travel plans after the Pongal holidays because of a surge in Covid-19 cases,” said an airline official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/spike-in-arrivals-from-abroad-at-airport-in-nov-dec/articleshow/88798101.cms||---

He also pointed out that Muslim students depend highly on government institutions (54.1%) as compared to other communities (national average 45.2%) and only 18.2% Muslim students go to private aided higher education institutions and 27.4% go to private unaided higher education institutions against a national average of 24.4% and 30.1%, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/muslims-have-lowest-ger-in-higher-education/articleshow/88798118.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Sarojini Naidu’s Hussainsagar poem to be installed at Tank Bund||HYDERABAD: Sarojini Naidu's poem on Hussainsagar lake is likely to be inscribed on a stone plaque at Tank Bund here to immortalise the life and times of the Nightingale of India in the princely Hyderabad State. Responding to a suggestion from a city architect and heritage enthusiast, Asif Ali Khan, on microblogging site Twitter, special chief secretary (urban development) Arvind Kumar said he would look into the suggestion. “Will certainly look into and do the needful,” Arvind Kumar tweeted on Sunday. Hyderabad had a pride of place for Sarojini Naidu, who received a scholarship from the Nizam VI to pursue higher education outside British India. She would sit on the banks of the Hussainsagar lake for hours together for inspiration to pen her poetry. She penned many poems on Hyderabad and its life and culture, events and landmarks including the Puranapul, the oldest extant bridge across a river in India. In May 1912, she brought out an anthology of her poems, The Bird of Time, which contained a tribute to Hussainsagar, then pristine with water as clear as a crystal. She had described the Hussainsagar, now a concoction of all pathogens and chemicals that are harmful to man, animal and environment, as a ‘living image of my soul’. “I request… to inscribe this poem on Hussainsagar by Sarojini Naidu on a plaque and install it at a suitable place on Tank Bund,” Asif Ali Khan said, suggesting that a big gazebo should be erected to house the plaque with the poem on Hussainsagar engraved on it. Landscape architect Sridevi Rao suggested that the poem should be chiselled in stone (to keep the memory of Sarojini Naidu alive forever).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sarojini-naidus-hsagar-poem-to-be-installed-at-tank-bund/articleshow/88798121.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||What ban? Chinese manja still freely available in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: With less than a week left for Sankranti, once again, the illegal sale of Chinese manja continues unabated across the city’s kite market situated in Begum Bazaar, Dhoolpet and Mangalhat areas. Instances of Chinese manja causing injury and death to birds have been reported in the last three weeks. Most recently on January 4, a painted stork was found injured and entangled in Chinese manja at the side of the road in Patel Nagar, Amberpet. Locals who spotted the bleeding bird understood that kite flying using the banned manja thread caused an injury to its left wing. Eventually, the migratory bird was handed over to forest officials for treatment. On December 19, a 31-year-old man identified as Zubair, a resident of Bagh-e-Jahan Ara in Old City, was grievously injured when a Chinese manja slit his neck while he was riding his bike at Purnanapul. At least four such instances have been officially reported in the last three weeks. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the product in its 2016 judgement and put-up stringent punishment for violators which would attract a jail term of up to five years or a fine of up to 1 lakh or both. Despite the ban, there hasn’t been much of a difference amongst retailers and kite flyers in the city. “Because of the sale of Chinese manja, vendors like us who don’t flout the rules get affected as naturally, people will look to buy that which is durable and cheaper compared to the normal manja that we sell,” Krishna Kumar, a shopkeeper at Dhoolpet, told TOI. The Chinese manja is made of nylon or synthetic thread and is treated with glass and metal to make it sharper. Unlike typical cotton thread, the Chinese manja is preferred as children find it crucial in kite flying duels. Cops have booked cases in this regard over the last two weeks across the three commissionerates as officials have seized hundreds of spools of Chinese manja and destroyed them. However, they admit that enforcing the ban is an arduous task because of the scale of the market in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/what-ban-chinese-manja-still-freely-available-in-city/articleshow/88798123.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Hyderabad||Cops fumble, cases against MPs and MLAs in Telangana fall through||HYDERABAD: Irrespective of party affiliations, criminal cases faced by MLAs and MPs in Telangana have been easily falling apart. From October 2020 onwards, of the 141 criminal cases taken up before the MLA and MP Special Court in Nampally, Telangana police secured conviction in just 11 cases. In fact, till date in none of the cases which have resulted in acquittals has the Telangana police sought an appeal in a higher court. Elaborating on the failure of the police in securing convictions, sources, told TOI, on the condition of anonymity, that hostile witnesses were a major reason. “Witnesses declared by the police miserably turned hostile in large numbers,” a source said. Investigative officer not submitting relevant video evidence, not marking CD evidence as per laid down procedure and policemen themselves giving contradictory statements were among other key reasons, sources said. Many a times concerned investigation officers merely filed chargesheets, but did not gather strong evidence and or make an effort to produce reliable witnesses who could depose before court against the charged MLA or MP. Among several cases in which acquittals were given was the sensational incident where Vikarabad district police registered three cases against the then Kodangal MLA A Revanth Reddy, who is now Telangana Pradesh Congress president. Cases were registered for allegedly giving a call to obstruct the public meeting of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the run up to the 2018 assembly elections. Later, Revanth was controversially taken into preventive custody by policemen at night. While dealing with one of these three related cases, the judge in his verdict, given in January 2021, said that “mistakes committed by the investigative officers also contributed their mite in further weakening the case of prosecution”. Except filing the chargesheet, police failed to make the declared witnesses — which includes election flying squard member, photographer and revenue officials — depose before the court in support of the allegations. The judge in the verdict said, “The said aspect supports the contention of learned counsel of accused that because of political rivalry a case was registered against the accused”. In this case, as well as a few others, the court questioned the police for filing multiple cases for the same incident. In a case registered in 2019, against BJP Goshamahal MLA Raja Singh, by Choutuppal police, wherein he is accused of promoting enmity and hate by making a public statement against a police inspector, the court in its verdict found that the concerned investigation officer did not examine the independent witnesses who attended the public meeting and failed to provide any audio or video evidence. Singh was acquitted. The officer also did not attach any document to prove that his two constables — who were witnesses — were on bandobust duty at the meeting. Except in two cases, most cases registered against Singh in the last few years, have resulted in acquittal. “If witnesses turn hostile in trial court, it is difficult to go for an appeal since the ground for an appeal will be weak,” a police officer said, on condition of anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cops-fumble-cases-against-mps-and-mlas-fall-through/articleshow/88798130.cms||Srinath Vudali

Reason: The nine-month gap between the second dose and precautionary dose. Officials said that nearly two lakh people in the state will be eligible for precaution doses this month. According to the health department’s estimates, only healthcare and frontline workers who received their second dose by the third or last week of February last year will be eligible while senior citizens with co-morbidities above 60 who completed their two doses by end of April 2021 will be eligible. They will also be administered the same vaccine as their first and second dose. As per Centre’s guidelines, precautionary doses can be taken nine months (39 weeks) after the second dose. The vaccination drive for healthcare and frontline workers had started on January 16, 2021 while for senior citizens with co-morbidities, it began on March 1. “Taking this into account, very few people will be eligible for the precaution dose in the first week. Many people, during the initial days of the drive, took Covishield, which had a longer time gap. Such people may also have a later eligible date for precaution dose,” officials said. The health department said it will not mobilise the elderly for a concentrated drive. The department said they can take get the shot after consulting their doctors.

---||Kolkata||Covid-19: West Bengal’s daily case surge smashes pandemic record||KOLKATA: Bengal had 24,287 fresh Covid cases on Sunday, breaking the all-time single-day spike record, and Kolkata, with 8,712 cases, broke its previous high of six days ago, as the Omicron-driven third wave of the pandemic showed a steady, steep surge and no signs of slowing down. The biggest daily surge in cases in Bengal, until Sunday, was on May 14, 2021, with 20,846 cases. Experts warned that the crest of the third wave was yet to come, during which the daily case-load could easily double and hospitalisations increase. The reassuring factor was that the rates of hospitalisation and mortality were still low, especially when compared with the devastating second wave’s. But calculated projections of the near future show that absolute numbers would only rise for a while now. Putting things in perspective, on May 14 last year, the positivity rate was 29%, with 70,051 samples tested. Sunday’s positivity rate was 33.8%, with 71,664 tests carried out. But there were 144 deaths on May 14, (0.7% of the total number of cases), compared with 18 (0.07%) reported on Sunday. “The infection is spreading like wildfire,” said a Swasthya Bhawan official, adding, “Let us not be surprised if we reach double the number of what we are seeing at present in the next two weeks. The hospitalisation and mortality rates, too, will start rising gradually. But we intend to hike up testing to detect as much as possible.” Senior healthcare officials in December had already alerted all healthcare stakeholders of the possibility of fresh daily cases rising to 30,000 in two to three weeks. On Sunday, the city, too, recorded an all-time high Covid count, with 8,712 cases emerging in the past 24 hours, surpassing the 4,759 cases recorded on December 4. Even during the second wave, the city’s highest daily count had remained below 4,000 (the highest was 3,990 on May 3). Sources at the health department said the positivity rate in Kolkata was as high as 50%, with several labs recording even 70%. “We are likely to continue to break more records if we continue to increase testing and use proper testing kits,” said Sumon Poddar, associate professor and unit in-charge of the microbiology laboratory at Institute of Child Health. Fresh cases in neighbouring North 24 Parganas have crossed the 5,000 mark. South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and West Burdwan are the other districts reporting cases in four digits. “The cases are rising exponentially due to the predominance of the Omicron variant. The daily case-load will reach 35,000 per day very soon. We need Covid-appropriate behaviour, mask-wearing and controls on public gatherings,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui, who is attached to Swasthya Bhawan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengals-daily-case-surge-smashes-pandemic-record/articleshow/88798148.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

They waited till dawn to enter a tamarisk jungle, a deserted spot, where Abhisek went live on social media. He claimed his sister Punam, who was head of a self-help group (SHG), was accused of embezzling Rs 9.7 lakh funds, and was beaten up along with her husband on Saturday by group members and villagers who brought the couple to the Hara home. They were also humiliated in front of her parents, who were threatened with dire consequences if the amount remained unrecovered.Abhisek claimed he and his parents were left with no option. He said his sister was innocent and named a Sonarpur resident as the mastermind behind the conspiracy against her. The youth asked viewers to make his video viral so his sister could get justice. “No one listened to us and believed us as long as we lived,” he added. Police from Frasergunj outpost traced the bodies. The three were confirmed dead at a local health centre. Sunderbans police district superintendent Bhaskar Mukherjee said: “ We are piecing together the incidents leading to the sucide pact.

---||Kolkata||KMC keeps manpower, machines ready to meet sanitization demand||Kolkata: Struggling to cope with the sanitization demand that has been rising with the spike in Covid cases, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has decided to procure 200 tonnes of sodium hypochlorite to bring city’s major buildings, thoroughfares, markets and even lanes and by-lanes under a mandatory disinfection programme.According to sources, the civic body’s solid waste management (SWM) wing which conducts sanitization drive has sent an SOS to officials of the Central stores department to keep 200 tonnes of sodium hypochlorite in reserve for the growing demand for sanitization across the city. According to a KMC SWM official, the stock (200 tonnes) of sodium hypochlorite would last till February. “We run two mist cannons round the clock for sanitization of major thoroughfares, markets, residential, commercial complexes, government buildings and bus stops. Each such cannon fitted vehicle has a capacity to store 9,000 litres of disinfectant at a time. This apart, we have six water sprinklers which are being used for sanitization,”said a KMC SWM department senior official. The high demand after a lull since October has compelled the civic body’s SWM department to procure 150 knapsack sprayers to take care of sanitizing the housing complexes, apartment buildings, slums and small roads where the large vehicles can’t enter. “The knapsack sprayers will enable the SWM department workers to reach more residential buildings that need sanitization,” said a KMC health department official. The KMC SWM workers had around 300 knapsack sprayers which were heavily used during the peak of the second Covid wave. “Now the infection rate has gone up to such an extent that we need more manpower and machines to take care of the demand for sanitization. The mist cannons and water sprinklers are being used at a pace that they might develop a snag. But we can’t stop at this crucial juncture,” said a KMC SWM department official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-keeps-manpower-machines-ready-to-meet-sanitization-demand/articleshow/88798150.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||Doctors praise Abhishek opinion on poll pushback||Kolkata: Medical experts on Sunday backed Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee’s statement, in which he said that in his opinion, everything, including elections, should be deferred for the next two months while spelling out a two-month ban on political and religious gatherings in Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha till February 28. Banerjee, on Sunday, followed up his statement by cancelling his January 9-12 Goa visit, in which he had several political programmes. Trinamool has backed his views. Goa, where Trinamool is contesting, goes to polls on February 14.Banerjee’s statement got a ringing endorsement from senior medics. Kunal Sarkar took to Twitter to post, “Endorse Abhishek Banerjee’s point of view. Let’s implement.” “The medical opinion suggests this Covid wave may have less severity but is highly transmissible and will lead to overwhelming numbers of people being affected. In that case, normal work-life will be severely impacted. We only seek a ban on large public gatherings so that life and work continue. People must realise this first. Senior political leaders, like Abhishek, resonating this helps in shaping public awareness,” Sarkar said.“Because of political compulsions, most political leaders tend to overlook scientific facts despite being aware of consequences of such violations, which is very agonising to the healthcare community, particularly now, in the context of the pandemic. So, political leaders making such correct noises is a welcome move as this could have quite an impact on the masses,” said IPGMER hepatology head and public health activist Abhijit Chowdhury.Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, associate professor of community medicine at Burdwan Medical College, said, “Political leaders like Abhishek Banerjee are public figures who could leave a huge impression on people. In fact, more political leaders should issue such responsible statements so that it sends an impactful message to the masses.”Doctors also feel that when political leaders with the kind of clout they command say things like this, even the administration will take their tasks more seriously. “Though Abhishek Banerjee’s statement seems to be his personal opinion, making it public makes a lot of sense because they are influential leaders and people tend to listen to them. These days, most political parties don’t heed appeals made by the healthcare community on restraints to help tackle the pandemic. We hope more political lea-ders talk on the need for such restrictions and also set an example by walking the talk,” said general surgery professor Manas Gumta, general secretary, Association of Health Service Doctors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/doctors-praise-abhishek-opinion-on-poll-pushback/articleshow/88798152.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Temp may rise, city could get rain from Tue: Met||Kolkata: The mercury is set to climb further and there may be spells of rain between January 11 and 14 since a developing western disturbance over this region is set to halt the cold spell. The western disturbance and moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal has already started pushing the mercury up. From Monday, it will rise further.“We can expect cloudy sky in the city from the second half of Monday. The wind system has already changed and become easterly, bringing enough moisture from Bay of Bengal to turn the weather warmer,” said G K Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.Because of the rain and overcast sky, the day temperature will remain lower than the normal mark and can dip as low as 22°C while the night temperature will see a surge above the normal mark. The chill, which will be lost due to western disturbances, will reappear from January 15, with clear sky and sun returning. “We can expect the mercury to start dropping from January 15 when the western disturbance starts moving away from this region. But how much it goes down will depend on the preva-iling weather conditions,” Das said.From Tuesday, the sky over Kolkata will be mostly cloudy with spells of rain. Currently, the western disturbance has blocked the path of the cold-bearing northwesterly wind. On Sunday, the maximum temperature at 28.2°C was three notches above normal while the minimum at 15.8C was two notches above normal. This winter has seen the mercury dipping as low as 11.2°C. The cloudy sky and lowering vertical wind speed may worsen the ambient air quality. The overcast sky affects the vertical wind flow. If the wind flow plunges below 2m/s it inhibits the dispersal of pollutants, said a WBPCB scientist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/temp-may-rise-city-could-get-rain-from-tue-met/articleshow/88798153.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||196 fatal accidents in 2021, fewer than Covid lockdown year||Kolkata: In 2021, the city witnessed 196 fatalities in 185 accidents, five less than 2020 when there were 192 accidents. In 2019, 267 deaths were reported in 260 accidents. The fatalities, lowest ever since the added areas came under Kolkata Police jurisdiction, is significant given the lockdown days last year due to Covid was minimal, compared to 2020 that was hit by the first wave and witnessed prolonged lockdown when there were hardly any vehicles or pedestrians on the road. “December has been especially kind, given there is always a spurt in fatal accidents in winters. From 22 deaths in 2019 and another 16 in 2020, this year the number stands at 11,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. Post July 2021, traffic police had hit comparable figures as pre-Covid era. Almost everything was permitted on road and even during night nakas, goods vehicle movement was exempted. An all-time low figure of 196 is being viewed as a achievement by the force. The four roads — Diamond Harbour Road, Basanti Highway, Central Garden Reach Road and Taratala Road — that witness movement of trucks and slow vehicles, account for 26% of the fatalities in 2021. For the first time, Kolkata saw EM Bypass and Basanti reporting fewer fatalities than DH Road, which reported 20 fatal accidents. Bypass saw six deaths and Maa flyover four. “We believe, implementing three Motor Vehicle Act sections — 185 (drink-driving), 184 (dangerous-driving) and 207 (seizure) at various nakas helped invoke discipline,” said a senior officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/196-fatal-accidents-in-2021-fewer-than-covid-lockdown-year/articleshow/88798154.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s defunct tram tracks may be revived for trolley buses||KOLKATA: The discontinued tram routes in Kolkata at various parts of the city may be revived for trolley buses that will be introduced by West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) in a few months’ time. Because of its hybrid avatar, a trolley bus can run by drawing electricity from overhead cables like a tram or operate on batteries like an electric bus. Trolley bus, also called trackless trolley, is a vehicle operated on the streets on rubber tyres and powered by electricity drawn from two overhead wires by trolley poles. In a symposium on sustainable transportation by SwitchON Foundation, WBTC MD RVS Kapur said, “If the trolley bus we are introducing becomes a success, the city’s existing tram network will be bolstered and revival of the tram will be feasible. Trolley buses are not to replace trams, but will play a complementary role.” The first lot of trolley buses will be supplied by a Ukrainian company. The trolley bus also fits WBTC’s ambition of getting its entire fleet electric by completely phasing out diesel buses. Tram tracks in the city have been de-reserved by concretising them and merging them with the carriageway. This means trolley buses can use the overhead wires and also run on the road below. “The bus battery will be charged when the bus will be on the move by drawing power from the overhead cables. Since the buses will run on inflated tyres, they can go where tram tracks don’t exist anymore,” said a WBTC official. Earlier, a German company called Deutsche Geselleschaft Fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), which works on capacity building, carried out a feasibility study and submitted its report. “Thanks to the oldest surviving tram network of the city, we have an excellent network of overhead cables with a good set of experienced engineers handling the oldest EVs (trams). This system must be leveraged to its optimum possibility,” said Kapur. Hybrid trolley buses allow for a majority of the line to be placed under cable. But with an option for a battery to cover distances where setting up cables is unfeasible, trolley buses enjoy greater flexibility. Trolley trucks, which are also gaining traction worldwide, operate under the same principle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kols-defunct-tram-tracks-may-be-revived-for-trolley-buses/articleshow/88798159.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fraudsters use booster-dose bait to siphon money off bank accounts||KOLKATA: Cops on Sunday warned people, especially senior citizens keen on taking a booster dose, that they should be careful about the phone calls offering to register them for the shot online and then seeking personal details, including a one-time password (OTP) to siphon money from their bank accounts. Union home ministry has also sent out a caution and said it had not made any booster dose available in this manner. The warning came in the wake of multiple complaints about this fraud surfacing across the country. A police officer said booster doses that would begin on January 10 for senior citizens did not require pre-booking as they would get it by walking into a vaccination centre. With Omicron cases on the rise, the fraudsters are trying to cash in on the fear and panic of people. They usually introduce themselves as health department officials from the state or Centre and at times even the PMO and then send out online links and QR codes to people asking them to book the booster dose. Sometimes fraudsters choose the victims from social media, from where they get to know about their vaccination status “You are double vaccinated and are due for a booster dose,” is how some of them approach senior citizens. The caller may even share other personal details scanned through social media to make the victim believe that he is a genuine government official. “The monetary losses to such fraud vary from a meagre amount to huge ones. Recovering the stolen money from other states like Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan or Haryana is not so easy,” said an officer. The MHA had earlier warned against putting up Covid certificates on social media to stop this kind of misuse.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fraudsters-use-booster-dose-bait-to-siphon-money-off-bank-accounts/articleshow/88798160.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid positive healthcare workers set to resume work after isolation, others ready to get jabbed||KOLKATA: While a large section of healthcare workers are looking forward to take their booster or the precaution dose on the first day of rollout on Monday, a significant chunk will have to wait for their turn as many are infected currently. Some doctors are also planning to test for their current Covid status before taking the third jab as many healthcare workers are also asymptomatically infected. “The rollout a bit earlier could have been better. But better late than never,” said IPGMER hepatology head Abhjit Chowdhury. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were the first to be inoculated when the vaccination’s first phase drive was launched on January 16, followed by frontline workers and the senior citizens. By February-end many got fully vaccinated to complete the nine months by November. Currently, nine months after the second dose is the cut-off for getting the booster dose. “I am looking forward to taking the third dose,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor of paediatrics at Institute of Child Health. The recently circulated guideline on the booster dose does not specify on how many weeks the infected should wait before taking the booster dose. “Currently, I along with my entire family is infected. Even as I go back to work on Tuesday after I complete seven days of home isolation I will have to wait at least for three months to take the third dose going by earlier guidelines,” said College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital general surgery professor Manas Gumta. HCWs, who got the infection recently, said they would either wait for three months or for a revised protocol if the government comes out with it before taking the precaution dose. “I had plans to take booster dose on Monday. But I tested positive seven days ago,” said head and neck surgeon Saurav Datta of Medica Superspecialty Hospital. Some plan to take the Covid test to be sure that they are not Covid positive before taking the booster jab. Peerless Hospital clinical and academics director Shubhrojyoti Bhowmick said people who have not tested despite symptoms could consider delaying the third dose or get a test done before taking the booster shot. “If the third dose rollout had been advanced by two months, rate of infection among HCWs could have been managed better,” said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, associate professor of community medicine at Burdwan Medical College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cov-hcws-set-to-resume-work-after-isolation-others-ready-to-get-jabbed/articleshow/88798161.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The daily fresh cases in the BMC areas have now surpassed the previous single day highest 634 cases, which were recorded during the second wave last year. However, unlike the previous two Covid waves, in which many people had been hospitalised, most of the patients this time are only showing mild symptoms and are in home isolation. The Covid fatality rate has been very low this time, according to the BMC officials. Till now, a total 362 people died with Covid in the BMC area since March 2020. Till Sunday, the number of micro-containment zones stood at 14,of which 10 zones are in Salt Lake. The civic authorities apprehend that the number of daily cases will cross the 1,000-mark in a few days. Sources said that over 900 fresh cases were recorded in the BMC area on Sunday while the number of active cases stands at 3,700. Most of these patients have mild symptoms and are in home isolation. As per records, there were only 502 active Covid cases and 172 fresh cases in the areas under BMC on January 1.

---||Kolkata||Footfall dips after third wave, Kolkata clubs bank on takeaways and home delivery||KOLKATA: With dwindling footfalls following the Covid third wave and restrictions, most of the premier city clubs are heavily relying on home delivery and takeaway to restrict losses. Almost all the clubs are either doing home delivery or are about to start this. Some premier clubs are also expanding menu in the home delivery offerings. After the first wave of Covid, the clubs first explored the home delivery option because of restrictions. This time, a record drop in footfalls of members has left clubs with very few options. CEO of Tolly Club, Anil Mukherjee said there’s drastic drop in attendance of members. The club is expanding home delivery. “Now menu from each of our restaurants will be available for home delivery. This includes continental, Chinese, Indian and multicuisine. We have told our restaurants to give menu which they can service in home delivery.” Calcutta Rowing Club secretary, Chandan Roychowdhury, said that in the evening there is hardly any footfall. “Some members are coming for lunch in the daytime but in dinner there is hardly anybody. We are now giving big push to home delivery and takeaway,” he said. Roychowdhury added that they have done Covid tests on all staff of the club and result of four came positive. “We have isolated them,” he added. Committee member of Calcutta Club, Pramit Kumar Ray, said they were getting good response from home delivery though footfall has dropped by more than 50%. “We are closing the club by 9pm,” he said.

Joint secretary of Lake Club, Subrata Guha, said they would call a meeting on Tuesday to decide on home delivery. “The footfall now is 20% of the usual figure.

While some cinemas have seen a drastic dip in sales, others have recorded steady numbers. The latter, in some theatres, have prompted many to wonder if the footfall is comprised of Covid survivors keen to end their home isolation with a trip to the theatre. Debjiban Basu of Basusree, which has a seating capacity of 1,020, told TOI the cinema had recorded a sale of 650 tickets of the matinee show of ‘Tonic’ on January 2. “This is huge for any single-screen theatre collection in Kolkata. Back then, the government was allowing 70% occupancy,” he said. However, things changed after the surge in cases. “Now, we are seeing approximately 60 tickets being sold per show. With such low numbers, we have brought down the shows from four to two. We are contemplating shutting down on a temporary basis,” Basu said. Menoka’s owner Pranab Roy said, “The sales of ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’, ‘Tonic’ and ‘Pushpa’ was initially very good. Once the Covid numbers surged, there was a sense of panic and sales have dropped to 20% this week.” Priya’s owner Arijit Dutta told TOI the footfall is “reasonable”. “We have sold more than 50% of the offered seating capacity for ‘Tonic’,” Dutta said. Navin Choukhani, the owner of Navina, said, “Looking at the past, I initially had apprehension about the footfall. Though sales have dipped, it was not to extent I had feared,” Choukhani said. Currently, Navina can sell 410 tickets. The evening show of ‘Tonic’ on Saturday sold 240 tickets. On Sunday, it sold 390 tickets. “This sale can partly be explained if we take into account that a number of those frequenting theatres have recovered after the infection and are keen on watching movies,” he said. Suranjan Paul, owner of the Minar-Bijoli-Chhabighar chain, said, “The few who have recovered now want to let their hair down. Cinema, for them, is a safe space,” Paul said. Joydeep Mukherjee, who has the lease for Star, has cut down on the number of shows to three from five. “Yet, with the offered 50% occupancy, the footfall is fair enough,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mixed-response-at-cinema-halls-owners-say-current-crowd-may-be-of-covid-survivors/articleshow/88798165.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Senior citizens eager for 3rd dose of Covid vaccine||KOLKATA: Senior citizen Ketaki Bhose is among the first lot of people above 60 years who will be taking the precaution dose on the first day of rollout on Monday. The Prince Anwar Shah Road resident had taken her first dose on March 1, the first day of inoculation drive rollout for the 60-plus category. She plans to visit the nearest CVC on Monday for the jab. Many 60-plus recipients who had taken the first dose on March 1 are now eligible for booster dose. Most of these people have got themselves inoculated with the second dose by April 10, making them have the requisite gap of 39 weeks post the second dose. “I have been following the news on booster doses as I was eager for this dose which might keep on protecting me at least from getting a severe infection. I already have hypertension as a comorbidity and hence I am planning to take the jab from a private CVC near my home,” said Swarup Das, a retired engineer of a central government institute. The gap between the two doses of Covishield in the initial days of rollout was four to six weeks before the revised protocol of 12 to 16 weeks gap issued in mid-May. Many had managed to take their second dose by then. “Though I am eager to take booster dose I will become eligible for it only towards February-end because of the mandatory gap of 39 weeks,” said former director of rural development with Arunachal government Manoj Ranjan Bhattacharjee. “We have about 600 eligible senior citizens who took both doses from our CVC and who are eligible for the jab right from Monday. About 60 of them have already called up for a slot. We have kept 300 slots opened for them on Monday,” said R Venkatesh regional director (east) Narayana Health. While those willing to pay can get the jab done at private CVCs, the government CVCs will offer the jab free to any senior citizen. Senior citizens need not register anymore as they are already registered on Co-Win. “We are finding out if we get an option to organise the booster dose for our senior citizen members as some of them do not want to visit hospital,” said Dhires Chowdhury, geriatrician with Banchbo the works for senior citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/senior-citizens-eager-for-3rd-dose/articleshow/88798166.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

We lost some people in the second wave including the president of our society. We try to restrict entry of people from outside into the campus, allow them in only after proper sanitization, take down their names, phone nos. and no. of the house they are visiting. Masks are necessary for anyone getting into the campus including maids,” said secretary of a residents’ welfare society in Trilanga area. President of a residents’ welfare society in Kolar area said, “As the Coronavirus cases go up, people start ordering groceries, food and other essentials online. Some of the major e-commerce companies have given badges to their salesmen or riders which can be checked whether they are fully vaccinated. We only allow them inside. Those, who don't have the badges are asked to show the vaccination certificate before allowing them in. We would, however, like all the companies in the retail or food delivery sector give such badges to their staff, delivering orders to people at their home.” Secretary of a residents’ welfare society in Gulmohar said that in the society WhatsApp group, they have appealed to the residents of the society to let the elderly and children remain at home as much as possible and inform on the group, if someone contracts Corona infection. A resident of a housing society in Trilanga said that a new year celebration programme was cancelled due to spurt in Covid cases in the city and the residents' welfare society has decided to go tough on allowing only people wearing masks in the campus and closing doors of the campus after 11pm when the night curfew starts. Another residents’ welfare society of an apartment in Awadhpuri have given stickers to residents of the colony and only vehicles with those stickers are allowed in while all others visitors are asked about vaccination certificates before being let in. While some of the societies are gearing up to do whatever they can to face the challenge of what appears to be the third wave of Coronavirus, there are colonies, where no such measures are being taken. A resident of an upmarket colony near New Market said, “Except for taking down names of persons going into the colony, the security guard at the gate does nothing. No checking, no washing of hands by sanitiser, nothing. There are two gates of the colony, one is closed, not because of the Corona wave but it was closed to have only one entry and exit gate.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/rwas-insist-on-vax-certificates-masks-to-protect-residents/articleshow/88798211.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

A number of people seen at Boat Club or Sair Sapata or near Van Vihar were wearing masks, giving an indication that either the fear of Corona is again setting in. However, as the teams of police, administration and BMC formed to ensure compliance of Covid norms were nowhere to be seen, many continued to flout the mask rule at the public places. “We normally wear masks. But, you are right. Far more people are in masks today than usual days. Maybe people are beginning to realise that Corona is back,” said Pramod Gupta, who was sipping hot tea in a restaurant at Boat Club. “Wearing a mask doesn’t come naturally to many. So, when Covid cases go down, people tend to give up on masks and other precautions too. But, little do they realise that it's one of the major factors which brings Corona back as is happening now,” said Brijlal Verma, a retired government employee in his car outside Sair Sapata. A youngster at Boat Club, however, felt that wearing or not wearing masks or observance of other Covid protocols does not help. “Since 2020, when the pandemic broke out, it’s in the beginning of the year that you have a wave. I knew the third wave would come despite vaccination and everything. I don’t know how it will stop,” he said, refusing to disclose his name.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mask-rule-violated-at-bhopals-fave-hangout-zones-and-no-one-checks/articleshow/88798214.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Jeevanlal Kushwah, a farmer growing vegetables said, “nothing is left intact. The green peas crop was completely damaged.” Rohanlal, another farmer in Sagar said, “it rained so heavily with hail, that the chana crop in my field was completely damaged. I had to break the boundary of my field to release the accumulated water.” BJP and Congress leaders are out in the fields surveying the damage with the farmers as they demanded compensation. Last week, similar weather conditions damaged crops in Gwalior and Chambal divisions. The maximum damage was caused to mustard crops which had developed to a podding stage at many places. For the 8 districts of Gwalior and Chambal division, mustard is the main crop in rabi season. Some districts like Ashoknagar are also known for their wheat production.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/rain-hailstones-damage-crops-in-bkhand/articleshow/88798223.cms||---

All the concerns of the people will be cleared and all the issues will be sorted out before land acquisition.Rajan said the project is for the people and without taking them into confidence the government will not go ahead with the project. Hence the government is committed to clearing all of their concerns.“Not just this, the government is intending to collect their opinions also before executing this project. This was the reason why the chief minister is interacting with a cross section of people now,” he added.“The social impact study being carried out will look into all the issues concerning the people who will be affected by this project. The present stone laying is just for the alignment work. It should not be considered as a step for land acquisition,” said Rajan.“The land acquisition process will begin only after the social impact study is over. The project has been designed in such a way that a minimum number of households and properties will be acquired. The government has already made it clear that the people losing their properties or land will be adequately compensated. Hence there is no need for any concern over the project,” said the minister.He also made it clear that there are no differences of opinion between LDF’s constituent partners over the SilverLine project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-will-address-all-concerns-before-land-acquisition-min/articleshow/88798224.cms||---

She came to know about the helicopter ride via advertisements two months ago. Soon after seeing it, she contacted the authorities to book her ride. She was one among the many passengers of the first ride conducted on December 29.The helicopter ride organized by DTPC Thiruvananthapuram has turned out to be a success. More than 300 people signed up for the ride which was scheduled for four days from December 29 to January 1. The Holidayshop company was the one behind the execution of the programme. The Holidayshop had organized a helicopter ride during Onam holidays also, but no people had taken a ride to Ponmudi. But this time, there were some people who opted for the 28minute journey to Ponmudi.“I am really happy to share the experience of my first helicopter ride. When I first contacted the Holidayshop company in order to book my ride, I told them about my difficulties and limitations. They are the reason why I achieved my all-time dream. The fear of getting on a helicopter for the first time bothered me but they gave me mental support. I travelled alone to Thiruvananthapuram and it was they who took care of me. They had also given me instructions to be followed. Those minutes will be with me forever, a conflict between the anticipation before the ride and after the ride. After the ride, I felt like I should explore more activities like this. I consider this as my achievement of this new year,” said Sreelatha.“The helicopter ride organized at Kovalam gave us expected results. We had passengers, including disabled persons and the elderly. We have taken our hundred percent efforts to make this a success.

The frequent traffic snarls at Venjaramoodu have often affected the smooth connectivity to Thiruvananthapuram, especially for people taking the MC Road from other districts.As per the project document, Venjaramoodu connects five important places: Thiruvananthapuram (South of MC Road), Kazhakkoottam (on the NH Bypass), Attingal (West of NH bypass), Nedumangad (East To SH) and Kottarakkara (North of MC Road).Venjaramoodu is one of the most congested junction in the district. KSRTC operates a bus depot there and it stands with its entrance and exit leading to the main road. Buses entering and exiting the stand often create traffic blocks in the area. The junction is also highly crowded due to the presence of the Venjaramood market, the Government Higher Secondary School and a few religious centres. Hence, to ease the traffic congestion of the area, the proposal for flyover has been put forth at the junction, the document notes.The project is being funded by KIIFB and is estimated to cost Rs 19 crore as per the tender document. As per the design, the flyover contains nine spans of 30m each and 10 spans of 6m each. The total length of the flyover is 337m. The flyover has a 10.5m carriage way with concrete crash barrier on either sides. The total width of the flyover comes to 11.50m. The approach road of the flyover will have a length of 56.7m on Thiruvananthapuram side and 52m on the Kottarakkara side.The total length of the flyover including the approach road comes to 446m. Service roads on either side of the flyover will have a minimum width of 3m. Right of way varies from 18.2m to 22.3m. Utility ducts are provided on either side of the service roads for various departments like KSEB, KWA and BSNL. Drains and footpaths will also be provided on the service road. The flyover is designed with the existing right of way, hence land acquisition is not required for the project.Administrative sanction was accorded for Rs 25 crore for the construction of a bypass at Venjaramood in 2017. Later, in 2019, the government accorded sanction for construction of a flyover instead of a bypass. The additional cost has to be borne for utility shifting and for providing LED street lights in the flyover, which has been estimated at Rs 4.2 crore. As per the document, the total cost of construction comes to Rs 27.4 crore, including 12% GST.The financial sanction was obtained for the work for an amount of Rs 25.03 crore, however, there was slight change in design when detailed design drawing was prepared and submitted by the PWD design wing. These changes have upped the estimate. The project is expected to be completed in 18 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tender-issued-for-building-flyover-at-venjaramoodu/articleshow/88798230.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to her, even those who left this field are now coming back to take classes for students. She is part of the collective Aksharasloka Kavyakeli that has been keeping alive the richness of language among the younger generation. Aksharasloga Kavyakeli is an organization formed by the prominent personalities of this field from all around Kerala. As part of the organisation’s activities, they have now decided to conduct an online Malayalam recitation competition. The competition will focus on the students of schools and colleges who are between the age group of six and 25. The members are expecting a number of participants above 300.“The love towards Malayalam language is emerging as a new trend among students. A good number of students are waiting to join the classes. Due to the limitations, I was not able to include them in the classes. They started to join the classes as the parents are not satisfied with the Malayalam literature education provided by the schools. This course will surely help the children to start loving the mother tongue and this will also improve their knowledge in Malayalam literature,” said K K Sarasamma, president of the organization.Saketh Shankar, 7,is of the opinion that the classes have helped him to learn Malayalam easily. He has been attending the Akshara sloka classes for a year.“The online Malayalam recitation competition aims at promoting the new generation into the field of Malayalam literature.

The reason: these vaccines will expire in February and March. Kerala Private Hospitals Association (KPHA) had written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in November to take back the stock of vaccines and use it during the government vaccination drive. However, the government did not respond. The private hospitals are now left with no other option but to destroy these vaccines. “Post-Onam, the state government had launched an aggressive campaign to extend vaccination through the public healthcare facilities across the state. With the ready availability of vaccines at all government healthcare facilities, the private sector is faced with nil or minimal demand,” said Dr Anvar M Ali, general secretary, KPHA. While the government is providing vaccination free of cost, the private hospitals were charging Rs 780 per dose. “The private hospitals will be incurring huge financial loss of more than Rs 15 crore,” he said. “Hence the private hospitals were left with no option but to approach the state government for a resolution of this issue by either procuring the balance stock of vaccines in private hospitals at cost price for utilization in the vaccination drive at government hospitals. Or else, the government should facilitate the return of the excess vaccine vials to the manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), for redistribution to other areas needed,” KPHA had mentioned in the letter to the chief minister. Earlier, SII made it clear that the company has a “no return policy”. “The state government had invited the private sector hospitals to participate in the vaccination drive on payment basis. Since only major corporate hospitals could afford the huge cost, KPHA had requested the government to procure vaccines and make it available to small and medium hospitals to maximize the vaccination drive across the state, but it was not accepted,” said Dr Ali. 6,238 new Covid casesMeanwhile, the state reported 6,238 Covid-positive cases from 54,108 samples tested in the last 24 hours on Sunday. The TPR has climbed to 11.52%. Among the new cases, 3,531 had taken both doses and 1,694 had not taken even a single vaccine dose. With 30 more deaths in the past few days being recorded as Covid deaths and 14 deaths added from the appeals received, the death toll has climbed to 49,591. Thiruvananthapuram with 1,507 reported the highest number of cases. As per the weekly infection population ratio (WIPR), six wards in five local bodies are having a WIPR of more than 10%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/2-6l-covishield-doses-face-wastage-at-private-hospitals/articleshow/88798234.cms||---

With a special focus on water supply, drainage, and storm water lines for areas like Sanand, Manipur, Godhavi, Sanathal, Mehmedabad, Aslali, Jetalpur, Telav and Bareja areas. It also placed before the state government a plan to complete piped water supply to 45 villages on the outskirts of the city. In all, the plan is worth Rs 1,580 crore. Under this mission, Auda has covered 45 villages of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar districts for the supply of potable water. But, one of the biggest concerns for Auda has been the access to potable water. In an interaction with Bopal and Ghuma residents five years ago, Auda officials claimed that the residents were using water with exceptionally high TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) as high as 1600 to 2200ppm (parts per million) against the acceptable limit of 400-500ppm. “Residents, especially in villages nearby who couldn’t afford RO systems, sometimes even used high TDS water causing serious health problems,” claimed a senior Auda official handling water supply. He added that water supplied by AMC in these areas was time bound due to which residents were forced to store water for a long term. With unavailability of Narmada drinking water, groundwater levels had plummeted to anywhere between 500-700 feet in these areas. “Over the last three years, several of these difficulties have been overcome. In Sanand, a 20 million litres per day (MLD) capacity water treatment plant, water pumping stations, underground and elevated water tanks, water supply distribution network is being set up. Bopal and Ghuma areas too are getting their own robust water supply systems,” adds the Auda official. “We are currently laying an advanced storm water drainage network with rejuvenation of lake and recharge of ground water,” adds the Auda official. Auda sources claim that the state government has agreed to provide a seed fund of Rs 285 crore. To accomplish these projects Rs 126 crore will be required for project consultancy and Rs 158 crore for any escalation in price during the implementation of the project. In all, most of these projects will cost Auda Rs 1,900 crore approximately.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/1-9k-cr-development-projects-on-the-anvil-for-auda-areas/articleshow/88798236.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The Congress has not been able to elect an LOP in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for almost a year now. Recently, the party began the process of consultation to appoint an LOP. On Sunday afternoon, around 10 councillors arrived at the GPCC headquarters and handed over a letter signed by 14 councillors, stating they would quit the party if Shehzad Pathan’s name was finalised as LOP. “A person who threatens women and does not behave cannot be our leader. Seniority should be the criterion for choosing the LOP,” said councilor Rajshri Kesari. Another councillor Jamuna Vegda said, “We have handed over a letter with our signatures, stating that we will not accept Pathan as LOP.” Kamla Chavda, who was named the leader of opposition before the AMC election, said Pathan and his accomplices had issued her threats. “He personally called and threatened me and others. He has the support of 10 Congress municipal councillors,” she said. Asked about the allegations levelled against him by his fellow councillors, Shehzad Khan Pathan said, “Everybody in the party has expectations. I leave the decision to the party high command. I will abide by it.” State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said that two observers have held detailed talks with all councillors on the matter. “Some councillors have made a representation to the party.

Uncertainty gawks at all associated with the centuries-old trade: the kitemakers, the manja makers, the hospitality industry, and those who rent terraces in the Walled City. Rashmi Dooriwale, 32, and eight of her family members from Kanpur settle in Ahmedabad after Diwali to coat manja with their special, coloured glass-powder paste.  The family make 35,000 yards of kite line in a day. “We usually get Rs 50,000 for each bulk order. This year, we hope the circumstances are better,” Dooriwale said. The sentiment is echoed by Munna Patangwala, whose family has made kites for three generations; and Imran Chipa, who has been in the trade for two decades. Chipa and Patangwala have employed workers to make 10,000 kites a day. They make 25 types of kites including jhalar, bamki, manjula, and pavlo. They also specialize in making kites with photo prints. Each season they sell 25 to 30 lakh kites. Almost 10-20% of the kites manufactured in the city are sold in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka. “After suffering heavy losses last year we have a lot at stake this time,” said Prachi Kashyap, a manja maker. “Covid has harmed people in our trade financially. The sales have reduced up to 50% because of Covid and the competition from Chinese lines.” Kashyap added: “Now we fear that our trade will suffer losses with fresh Covid curbs.” The majority of kite line makers and kite manufacturers in the city are spread across areas such as Jamalpur, Juhapura, Raipur, Kalupur, Kubernagar, Allahnagar, Saraspur, Mirzapur, and Behrampura. They are paid roughly Rs 250 to Rs 300 for 1,000 kites. The vice-president of Gujarat Patang Manufacturers and Trade Association, Nasruddin Shaikh, said: “With each pandemic wave, the charm of Uttarayan is fading away.” He added: “Owing to night curfews we expect only a few people to buy kites this season.” (With inputs from Dhyanvi Chauhan)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/covid-haze-in-uttarayan-sky-cases-soar-like-kites/articleshow/88798244.cms||---

The boat, named ‘Yaseen’, was intercepted by the ICG vessel ‘Ankit’ during an operational patrol on Saturday night. When the crew members of the boat failed to justify their presence in the Indian waters after being questioned, the ICG ship apprehended it, said ICG officers. The boat tried to flee towards the Pakistani waters but the ICG ship acted swiftly and apprehended it, the officers said. “About 2,000kg of fish and 600 litres of diesel were seized from the boat,” said an officer, adding that the boat is registered at Keti Bandar in Pakistan. The apprehended boat is being towed to Porbandar for a detailed investigation, ICG sources said. Sometimes, Pakistani fishing boats cross the notional international maritime boundary and enter Indian waters during fishing expeditions. There has also been a rise in cases of such boats being used to smuggle contraband drugs through the Gujarat coast. The ICG had on September 15 last year apprehended a Pakistani boat with 12 crew members in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast. On December 20, a Pakistani fishing boat with six crew members carrying 77kg of heroin worth about Rs 400 crore was apprehended in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast. It was a joint operation of the ICG and the state Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/coast-guard-detains-pak-boat-crew-of-10/articleshow/88798245.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Booster doses to be rolled out from today||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Andhra Pradesh health department will start giving booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to elderly persons (60+ age group) with comorbidities and frontline respondents from January 10, Monday. Amid the Omicron threat, the Union government has decided to open eligibility for another dose for these groups as a matter of precaution. AP has an estimated 29.42 lakh people falling into the comorbid 60-plus population category. The number of healthcare workers/frontline respondents stands at around 20.5 lakh people. According to officials, the prioritisation and sequencing of the precaution dose would be based on the completion of nine months, i.e. 39 weeks, from the date of administration of the second dose. For the comorbid 60+ age group, no prescriptions or certificates are mandated to be produced at the vaccine centre. The Cowin system will also send SMSes to such beneficiaries for availing the precaution dose when their dose becomes due. The third dose will also be reflected in the digital vaccination certificates following its administration. Potential beneficiaries can either register themselves on Cowin or avail of a walk-in registration. Meanwhile, the first dose vaccine coverage among the 15-18 age group has exceeded the 80% mark in Andhra Pradesh. The state has so far inoculated about 20 lakh teenagers in this category against an estimated 24.4 lakh people. Andhra Pradesh is leading the states in vaccinating this population category to whom the immunisation drive was extended on January 3. The state may achieve 100% first dose coverage among this cohort in the next few days. The state wants to complete administration of the precautionary doses by January 13. The village/ward secretariats would double up as vaccination centres for this drive. Various government offices, from municipal offices to police stations, would also be utilised to administer vaccines to employees. While healthcare workers would be given precaution doses on January 10 and 11, frontline workers would be inoculated with the third on January 12 and 13. Auxiliary nurse midwives will vaccinate the elderly at village/ward secretariats from January 10 to 13. Precaution dose for all the revenue staff and PR&RD department will be given at MPDO offices. Vaccine for the police department staff will be given at police stations, battalions and DPO offices.

The church would, however, continue to host weddings with a maximum of 80 guests – 40 from the bride’s side and the rest from the groom’s family. “All other Covid regulations, like wearing of masks, social distancing, etc., are being strictly enforced even during merriment,” Bakhlaa said. Smaller churches under the Chotanagpur diocese, especially where the physical attendance during church services is not that overwhelming, continue to function for the devotees.However, other churches under the Gossner Evangelical Lutheran Church as well as the Catholic Church continue to serve their faithful with limited gathering at their respective premises. “GEL Church is conducting five services on Sundays at all our churches to prevent crowding. All Covid norms are also being strictly enforced.

---||Ranchi||Senior citizens advised to consult doctor before going for third dose||RANCHI: As the health authorities gear up to administer the third dose of the anti-Covid vaccine from Monday onwards, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh has made it clear that only those health and frontline workers would be considered for the precautionary dose who have completed 39 weeks or nine months from the date of their second dose. Singh has also advised the elderly population with co-morbidities, who will also be considered for the third dose, to consult a doctor before going for the precautionary dose. In a letter to all the DCs and health authorities concerned on December 31 , Singh clarified that the elderly beneficiaries do not need to provide a doctor’s certificate to the vaccinators for taking the third jab but it is advised that they consult their personal doctors for requirement of the precautionary dose. The secretary said, “For the third dose, only those persons would be considered eligible who took the second dose at least 39 weeks ago as presumably their vaccine-induced immunity has gone down.” The precautionary dose meant for frontline workers, health staff and elderly population with co-morbidities, though not compulsory, is aimed at boosting immunity against newer strains of the virus that may hit in the days to come. Underlining the need for the precautionary dose and the vaccine, in general, the head of preventive social medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Devesh Kumar, said the vaccines are meant to generate immunity against the virus. “Though there is no argument over the fact that naturally developed immunity is better and stronger against any virus, the vaccine helps boost immunity and protects people from contracting new strains of the virus,” Dr Kumar added. He further said, “Those being exposed to the virus continuously, like health workers and the frontline staff, are at a greater risk of being under the attack of mutants and no one knows if the newer variants would be as fatal as the Delta one or even more.” Asked why the present variant has breached the vaccine shield, Dr Kumar said, “Vaccines may not prevent infections all the time but they don’t allow the patient to become serious.” Dr Kumar said, “Those who have tested positive should wait for a week after obtaining an RT-PCR negative report before going for the vaccine and for those with mild symptoms of Covid-19 should undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out the possibility of infection. Immunity gets compromised at the time of an infection and taking the vaccine during that time is not advisable.” Doctors have asked the adolescent beneficiaries to avoid taking pain killers after taking the shot. “On-site pain due to a vaccine shot is common and usually goes off within a day or two without any medication. Pain killers for managing such a pain is not advisable,” a health department official said while quoting the recent tweet of Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/senior-citizens-advised-to-consult-doctor-before-going-for-third-dose/articleshow/88798262.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Earlier in the day, the weather office issued a separate advisory for agriculture for the next 48 hours. While it predicted that the isolated rain on the north and central parts of Jharkhand may prove beneficial for wheat if irrigation was avoided, it advised the farmers for immediate drainage in fields where chickpeas, lentils and mustard are there. The weather office also predicted that potato and vegetable plants may be damaged and may be infected with various diseases (such as blight’s disease in potatoes) if insecticides were not sprayed and water was not drained. Sunny skies over Ranchi turned gloomy in the afternoon, which soon made way for a sudden splash of rain in the evening.

---||Ranchi||Passengers’ assn writes to rly ministry for new zone in state||Ranchi: The Jharkhand Passengers’ Association (JPA) has urged Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav to consider constituting a separate railway zone for Jharkhand.The association on Saturday dispatched a letter to the minister’s office proposing a new south east western railway zone with its headquarters in Ranchi and administrative control of all the 225 railway stations in the state.Undersigned by JPA president Rajendra Kumar Sarawagi and secretary Prem Kataruka, the letter pointed out the need for a separate zone for the development of Jharkhand’s railway infrastructure.In its letter, the JPA proposed that a zone may be carved out comprising the Ranchi railway division (under South Eastern Railways), Jasidih railway route (under Asansol division of the Eastern Railways), Dhanbad railway division (under East Central Railways) and Chakradhapur railway division (under South Eastern Railways) as they are mining, forest produce and education hubs.“At present, Jharkhand’s railway routes are controlled by four zones and nine divisions. All the zones are headquartered outside the state while six railway divisions (Hajipur, Adra, Asansol, Kharagpur, Malda and Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay in UP) are controlled by neighbouring states. As a result, the administrative red tape is posing hindrances in development of passenger amenities and infrastructure in key railway stations,” the JPA stated in its letter.Stating that the Indian Railways earns approximately Rs 25,000 crore in revenue from Jharkhand each year through freight loading and transport of minerals and finished industrial products, the JPA claimed that a separate zone was a legitimate demand as the ministry had in the past constituted new zones in newly carved out states such as Telangana for its infrastructure development.Before JPA, former Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das had also demanded a separate railway zone for the state during his tenure in office. In 2021, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth also placed a demand to the Railway Board chairman citing it as a necessity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/passengers-assn-writes-to-rly-ministry-for-new-zone-in-state/articleshow/88798268.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Covid effect: Prices of vegetables crash||Mysuru: Owing to unseasonal rainfall, the prices of vegetables had climbed steeply in the first week of December with a kilo of tomato costing Rs 100. Now the prices have come down, upsetting the farmers who were hoping to cash in on the demand-supply gap.With the lockdown and curfews back, leading to restrictions on vehicular movement to neighbouring state of Kerala, farmers are worried that the prices of vegetables may further come down.Farmers said they were getting good prices for vegetables till first week of January this year in all APMC markets with the easy movement of vehicles to neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Daily, more than 300 trucks carrying hundreds of tonnes of vegetables from Mysuru, Gundlupet APMC markets head towards Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Mysuru also serves as a market for veggies to adjoining districts like Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, Mandya, Hassan and Chitradurga. But now, it has fewer takers and more arrivals due to which vegetables prices have declined by 40% from last one week because of increasing supply. Buyers from other states and neighbouring districts, who regularly buy vegetables from district APMCs, have stopped it from last two days as Covid restrictions are back, due to screening at checkposts, weekend curfew, restrictions on sale of food items in hotels announced by state government to curb the spread of infection, said Mysuru APMC agent Baradanapura Nagaraj, who is also general secretary of Mysuru – Chamarajanagar Vegetable Growers Association.Prices almost dropped by 40% for vegetables including tomatoes, bitter gourd, cucumber, carrot, beans and pumpkin, he said. “Crops are going bad because of intense heat and farmers are harvesting premature crops and rushing to markets, leading to glut in the market and price drop, which further causes loss for farmers. As vegetables like tomatoes, cauliflower, okra are highly perishable, farmers need immediate market facility. Weekend curfew like restrictions will put farmers and horticulture producers at risk. Many farmers are already discouraged from growing vegetables as the government has cautioned about the surge in Covid cases in upcoming months,” said Attahalli Devaraj, Mysuru district general secretary of Karnataka State Farmers Federation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/covid-effect-prices-of-vegetables-crash/articleshow/88798279.cms||---

Although the CCC has a capacity of 600 beds, the authorities have decided to have only 200 beds at the facility for the time being. In addition to the centre on Mysuru city’s outskirts, the authorities have decided to reopen CCCs in other taluks.Meanwhile, the district administration is working towards transforming residential schools such as the Morarji Desai Residential Schools in all taluks into CCCs, while the drive to vaccinate teenagers in the 15-18 age group, and residing in hostels, is continuing apace. With experts predicting the onset of the third wave around the third wave of January, the district administration is pulling all stops to prevent an outbreak.Should people fail to adhere to Covid protocol, there could be an uncontrollable surge in the number of daily cases. Currently, the number of fresh Covid cases is hovering around the 200 mark. As of now, as many as 5,700 beds have been reserved for Covid patients, of which 1,500 are in private hospitals. The district administration is eager to arrange more than 3,000 beds across CCCs.The administration is also making all the arrangements to ensure that the trauma care centre attached to the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) and the Princess Krishnajammanni Tuberculosis Hospital and the Seth Mohandas Tulsidar Maternity Hospital are prepared to receive patients should the cases spike.Mysuru district health officer (DHO) Dr KH Prasad told TOI, “The CCC in Mandakalli can house 500 beds, but it can be increased to 600 should the need arise. We are also taking steps to ensure that CCCs in the other taluks have 50 beds with oxygen support. Each centre will have oxygen plants that can pump up to 500 litres per minute. The CCCs in the taluks will commence operations from Monday.”On Saturday, the district registered 213 Covid cases, a near ten-fold spike in the daily tally compared with the fresh caseload that was being recorded only a few days ago, he said. “But this is the trend across the country. If left unchecked, we may well have to face the third wave of Covid-19 soon,” Dr Prasad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/uptick-in-covid-cases-prompts-authorities-to-reopen-cccs/articleshow/88798282.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Activists oppose closure of schools||Mysuru: As the Covid cases are fast spreading in many parts of the state, especially in the urban pockets, the fear of another school closure has hit the parents of students who have already lost nearly two academic years. Experts and activists are also urging the state government to keep the schools open as another school closure may result in more instances of child marriages and child labour, and exacerbate malnutrition among children.According to the parents, if the children lose another academic year, it may cause more problems than the pandemic itself. “Since April 2020, my daughter is almost at home in the absence of regular school activities, interaction with her classmates, due to the Covid scare. She started going to school in the second week of November. She struggled a lot to adjust to the new school environment and mandatory mask rules among others. Now, if the school is shut down again, she will go back to how she was earlier. It will affect her personality and learning,” said Balakrishna S from RR Nagar in the city.Parashuram ML, member of Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, echoed a similar view. According to Parashuram, domestic violence, hunger, absence of friends and lack of outdoor activities among others have caused a lot of problems to children at the time of school closure in the first and second waves. “The school closure will not serve any purpose. We can’t build a welfare society if we keep our schools closed for an indefinite period,” he warned. Citing examples of challenges faced by the children especially from the disadvantaged sections of society, he stated that there is no alternative for schools in the present scenario.DC Nanjunda, associate professor, Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion of the University of Mysore observed that cancellation of cooked midday meals at schools resulted in malnutrition among children from weaker sections of the society. Similarly, the child labour problem has aggravated, he said. “We all know the effect of the school closure in the last two years. But for parents, children are emotional issues. They prefer school closure instead of getting their children infected. So taking any decision is very difficult,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/activists-oppose-closure-of-schools/articleshow/88798283.cms||---

The zoo sought donors to manage the facility while promoting its animal adoption scheme, even as district minister ST Somashekar had helped it raise nearly Rs 1 crore. Though the Zoo Authority of Karnataka Chairman LR Mahadevaswamy sought financial assistance in the form of the block grant, the state government is yet to extend it. While Dasara and the year-end season were good in terms of visitors, the zoo is again looking at a bleak future with the lockdowns and curfews.The zoo needs funds to take care of the animals. Nearly 1,500 animals, birds, and reptiles of about 180 different species are housed here, and gorillas and chimps were added recently.Mahadevaswamy told STOI that the authority has given representation to the government seeking funds for the management of all nine zoos including Mysuru Zoo and Bannerghatta Biological Park. The government has promised to reserve funds in the budget purely for its management. This is expected to alleviate the burden on the tourist facilities that have been self-reliant all these years, he said.“We have decided to keep the Mysuru Zoo open on Tuesday, which happens to be weekly holiday for the facility,” the chairman stated adding that weekend curfew is likely to hit the tourist flow.Mysuru Zoo executive director Ajit Kulkarni said that visitors’ number has been improving after the second wave of Covid. “There was a good flow of tourists in December and we were expecting the number to increase,” said the director.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/weekend-curfew-may-impact-revenue-collection-at-zoos/articleshow/88798286.cms||Lawrence Milton

The Maoists, however, admitted to the murder of one of their cadres, Kamlu Punem, and claimed he was killed because he worked for police and “was in a relationship with a relative”. On Saturday, police said they had information that Kamlu, a militia platoon commander, and his lover Mangi, a militia member, were produced in kangaroo court and killed by their comrades in Bijapur. A villager was also killed the same day. The Maoists claim this is police propaganda, but the note is silent about Mangi. G Bastar range P Sundarraj told TOI, “If this press note of Gangaloor Area Committee Maoists is authentic, then it supports the police version on the issue. Police have stated that Maoists have executed their own militia cadres Kamlu Punem and Mangi Punem.

To help keep cattle away from the city, the civic body had decided to distribute them to eligible farmers in rural areas.Stray cattle is a major traffic concern for motorists across the city. Busy roads such as Eluru Road, KT Road, Nageswara Rao Pantulu Road, Sivalayam Street and Moghalrajapuram have herds of cattle taking up space on the streets. The cattle owners collect milk every evening and leave them to wander the roads to avoid expenses on feed and shelter.The VMC has strengthened its cattle shed and shifted stray cattle there, as well as imposed fines on the owners. But repeated warnings and fines have not improved matters. Since September 2021, four cows died in road accidents in the city while minor road mishaps are prevalent and many motorists have received injuries.Veterinary officials at VMC have now decided to hand over the cattle to the District Rural Development Authority (DRDA) and distribute the cows to the eligible poor. “We have given ample time for owners of stray cattle and warned them to shift the cattle to their shelters. Many stray cattle are getting injured and some cattle eat plastic waste which poses a health risk. We have decided to distribute these cattle to poor farmers identified by the DRDA to prevent them from returning to the city and causing traffic congestion,” said VMC commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh.The VMC claims it has the sole rights to stray cattle on the city’s roads.Meanwhile, cattle owners have opposed the decision and are preparing to launch a protest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/vmc-to-hand-over-stray-cattle-to-rural-poor/articleshow/88798292.cms||Venu Lanka

Police have so far busted four knife manufacturing units in the district and seized 1,227 knifes that are tied to the roosters during the fight. Police have identified 114 places where it has been a practice to set up cockfight arenas and enhanced surveillance at these places.

---||Business||RBI sets up fintech dept||MUMBAI: The RBI has set up a fintech department to facilitate innovation, and help identify and address challenges & opportunities in the new-age sector. The central bank has appointed Ajay Kumar Choudhary, executive director, to head the department. All matters related to inter-regulatory and international coordination on fintech shall also be dealt with by the department, which will report to the RBI’s centralised administration division. It will also provide a framework for further research on the subject that can aid policy interventions. Most startups in fintech had started operating as unregulated entities. A meeting of the senior management committee of the RBI in June 2018 had resulted in the creation of a fintech unit in the department of regulation. In 2019, the RBI came out with a framework for a regulatory sandbox ‘to provide a structured avenue for the regulator to engage with the ecosystem and to develop innovation-enabling or innovation-responsive regulations’. The RBI had decided to push innovation primarily with the objective of bringing down cost of financial services and improving financial inclusion. As most fintech activities then were in the area of payments, the unit was transferred to the department of payment and settlement systems in July 2020. “To give further focus to the area and facilitate innovation in the fintech sector in keeping pace with the dynamically changing financial landscape, it was decided to set up a fintech department in the bank. With the formation of the new department from January 04, 2022, the erstwhile fintech division under the payments department has been subsumed into it,” the RBI said in a circular. “Accordingly, all matters related to the facilitation of constructive innovations and incubations in the Fintech sector, which may have wider implications for the financial sector / markets and falling under the purview of the bank, will sector/markets the fintech department,” the circular said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-sets-up-fintech-dept/articleshow/88797179.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi CM tells AAP cadre to focus on health, education in poll-bound states||NEW DELHI: With the poll dates for five states announced by the Election Commission of India on Saturday, Aam Aadmi Party national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal told volunteers to gear up for “positive and honest” door-to-door campaigning and to tell people of the work done by the party in the national capital. “When you go out for election campaigning, keep this thought in your mind always —you are going out to bring about a change in this country like a true deshbhakt. You are not campaigning with the purpose of an electoral win, but to eliminate a corrupt system from its grassroots, to implement a system of honesty and integrity,” he said in a digital address on Sunday. “The AAP government of Delhi has proved that the change is possible,” he said. Kejriwal said due to the Covid pandemic, EC had imposed many restrictions on election campaigning. “But door-to-door campaigning is allowed. All our volunteers should get on the task with full strength,” he said, asking the volunteers to first ask people how they were doing and if they needed any help. “Tell them about how we have transformed schools, hospitals, roads and electricity and water supply. Tell them that AAP would do the same in your state too if it assumes office,” he said. Kejriwal also asked volunteers to not abuse or slander any other party or their member(s). “We have to orchestrate a positive campaign. We have to go to every doorstep, no matter their political standing. Consider everyone to be your own, and win them over,” he said. “If someone asks you why AAP gives away freebies — ask them, if it is not a government’s duty to ensure the highest standards of education to each and every child of this country? Is it not the duty of an able government to offer the best of healthcare for free to its citizens?” he said. “Today being in government translates into ministers and MLAs getting all services and facilities for free while the public runs from pillar to post. We will change the definition of government. Now, ministers and MLAs will serve the public while they enjoy the best of the facilities,” he said. He said digital and social media were going to serve a very significant role in these elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/kejriwal-tells-aap-cadre-to-focus-on-health-education-in-poll-bound-states/articleshow/88797229.cms||---

---||Business||A booster dose of optimism||CHENNAI: Will 2022 be a happy new year? Amidst the resurgent pandemic, what needs to be done to put Tamil Nadu on the world map this year? TOI asked industry captains, and what we got was a booster dose of optimism. N Srinivasan, vice chairman and MD, India Cements says tax concessions as a means to attract investment are passé; now viability alone counts. "I am sure the chief minister will continue to strengthen the competitiveness of doing business in the state and make it an ultimate destination for investors," he says. "We hope the government will continue skilling initiatives in collaboration with companies." The automotive sector expects to bounce back after two tough years. Executives are better prepared to manage production and supply chain in 2022 and expect exports to touch new highs. "Market demand is likely to remain strong with the rise of first-time buyers, replacement buyers and the migration from diesel to petrol/CNG and from hatchbacks to SUVs. Exports should improve," says Rakesh Srivastava, MD, Nissan Motor India. Daimler, which set a record in 2021 with more than 9,000 exports of commercial vehicles (CV), expects its growth to be better this year. "With the rise of Omicron, states like Tamil Nadu, which are aggressive on vaccination, will see a faster economic rebound," says Satyakam Arya, MD & CEO, Daimler India CV. Electric vehicle makers are bullish about 2022. Greaves Cotton (maker of Ampere EVs) is set to take the capacity of the Ampere e-two-wheeler from 1,20,000 to 2,50,000 units per year by the second quarter of FY 22-23. "Thereafter we will take that to half a million ahead of the demand," says Nagesh Basavanhalli, MD & Group CEO, Greaves. The tech sector, the biggest gainer from the pandemic, is set to tap into the state’s engineering talent. Cognizant is making Tamil Nadu its largest catchment pool this year. "We expect to onboard more than 16,500 fresh graduates in 2022, making it one of our highest in the state," says Rajesh Nambiar, chairman of Cognizant India. "We will focus on developing our Chennai and Coimbatore centres as hubs for global talent and bridge the skills gap to make the talent digital-ready." Software product firms are hopeful of contributing big to the state’s economic goals this year. "SaaS (software as a service) is going to be the driving force for us to fulfil Tamil Nadu’s vision of being a $1 trillion economy by 2030. We have to focus on creating 3,000 to 4,000 startups in the next 10 years and achieve a growth rate of 15% per annum," says Suresh Sambandam, CEO, Kissflow. Sridhar Vembu, founder of SaaS firm Zoho, says the state’s tech sector is broadening and deepening with more geographic diversity. "Tamil Nadu’s GDP has risen and we are one of the richer states today. We have to make necessary investments that bring higher value additions to the state in order to stay competitive," he says. Ramco Systems is getting ready to compete in the war for tech talent in 2022. Sandesh Bilagi, COO, Ramco Systems, says future growth and competitiveness will depend mostly on attracting talent and empowering them. After the consumption slump in 2021, the financial services sector hopes for a sustained economic recovery. "With vaccinations and safe habit protocols, we can defeat this virus. I hope in 2022 we begin to measure hospitalisation and mortality rates more than infections," says Rajiv Lochan, MD, Sundaram Finance. Ravi Subramanian, MD & CEO, Shriram Housing Finance, says their housing finance business grew at a rate double that of the industry. He urges the government to consider reducing stamp duties for properties priced under ₹30 lakh. "This will benefit the common man and propel sales of affordable homes in Tamil Nadu," he says. N Kamakodi, MD & CEO of City Union Bank hopes Omicron will not warrant lockdown impacting the economy. "Unlike the last time, we would like the government to add bankers along with the front line workers in the priority list to get the booster vacation," he says. IIT-M incubated space tech startup Agnikul Cosmos, which is slated for a test launch in 2022, hopes policymakers pay more attention to Tamil Nadu’s deep tech startups this year. “A single point window for all services coming under the state government will be good,” says Srinath Ravichandran, CEO, Agnikul.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/a-booster-dose-of-optimism/articleshow/88796435.cms||---
---||Business||Nykaa IPO: Kotak, BharatPe co-founder trade charges||John Sarkar & Reeba Zachariah | TNN New Delhi/Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank on Sunday warned of legal action against Bharat Pe co-founder Ashneer Grover and his wife Madhuri for alleged use of unparliamentary language and threat to the lender’s employees after it emerged that the duo had served a legal notice to MD & CEO Uday Kotak and three members of his senior management team, accusing the bank of failing to provide financing and allocating shares during Nykaa’s IPO. The Grovers claimed that they had planned to invest Rs 500 crore in Nykaa through Kotak’s IPO financing services. According to the October 30, 2021 notice sent by law firm Regstreet on behalf of the Grovers, Kotak had assured the couple allocation of shares in the Nykaa IPO but was later informed that it would not be able to provide IPO financing due to “erratic FII movements” and “very high lending rates”. “Kotak’s refusal to provide IPO financing to our clients at the eleventh hour has completely crippled (their) ability to participate in the Nykaa IPO and deprived them of an investment opportunity about which they had informed Kotak more than a month in advance of the launch of the IPO,” read the notice signed by Regstreet partner Sumit Agrawal. The Grovers sought compensation covering listing gains had shares worth Rs 500 crore were allocated to them in the Nykaa IPO. The notice added that Kotak had provided financing in the Nykaa IPO to BharatPe CEO Suhail Sameer. Kotak, however, denied any breach in its financial assistance to the Grovers. “Your clients are well aware that financial assistance is at the sole discretion of the lender and that there is neither any concluded contract nor any sanction letter executed in favour of (them). Therefore, your clients do not have any contractual or other rights enforceable against (Kotak) as alleged or otherwise. We deny allegations levelled by your clients that any amount is due and payable by (the bank) as claimed in the legal notice,” Khaitan & Co on behalf of Kotak wrote in its reply dated November 2, 2021. The development assumes significance after a leaked audio call clip allegedly featuring Ashneer abusing and giving death threats to a Kotak employee for failing to provide funding for the Nykaa IPO went viral. Ashneer had subsequently termed the audio clip fake.Khaitan further said that “Your clients have, in the recent past, on several occasions called (Kotak) employees on the phone and had issued threats to their lives besides using unparliamentary and foul language, for which (Kotak) and its employees reserve their rights to take appropriate legal steps.” The case provides a new twist to the standoff between Ashneer, a former Kotak employee and new age tech entrepreneur and Uday Kotak, one of the world’s richest bankers. BharatPe, an unicorn with a $1 billion valuation, recently forayed into Uday Kotak’s main business domain following its purchase of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank in partnership with Centrum. “Your clients’ assertion that there was no concluded contract in favour of (the Grovers) for the purposes of financing the Nykaa IPO is surprising, given the repeated assurances given by (them) to the contrary. (The Grovers) reserve their right to produce conversations between them and your clients exchanged on WhatsApp, which would lay bare the falsity of your clients’ case. Prior to reneging on their promise, your clients had never once indicated any reluctance or inability in rendering IPO financing services to (them) to the tune of Rs 500 crore for the Nykaa IPO,” read the November 8, 2021 counter-reply by Agrawal. “(The Grovers) vehemently deny the defamatory allegations pertaining to any unparliamentary or foul language having been used by them, or that they have issued any threats to your clients or its representatives whatsoever. It is evident that your clients have concocted these allegations merely as a counterblast to the claims made by (the Grovers) for the breach of various legal obligations committed by your clients.” The counter-reply further stated that the Grovers will be “withdrawing all banking operations maintained by them with Kotak”. BharatPe did not offer any comment on the report, Kotak, however, confirmed receipt of legal notice sent by the Grovers and said that it had also replied to it including “placing on record our objections to inappropriate language used by Grover”. Appropriate legal action is being pursued, it added.The lender, however, did not elaborate on this. “We would like to confirm that there is no breach or violation by Kotak in any manner whatsoever.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nykaa-ipo-kotak-bharatpe-co-founder-trade-charges/articleshow/88797172.cms||John Sarkar
---||Business||They will give you a chicken with three legs||Chennai: During a business trip to Paris, Chennai entrepreneur Nishanth Chandran had a sudden craving for Indian food. "I missed eating our spicy Indian food and went on a cooking spree and that’s how I came across a meat store, which to my pleasant surprise, was so hygienic and well-organised," he says. When he returned to Chennai and realised how different desi wet markets are, he had his eureka moment. That’s how B2C startup TenderCuts was born. It’s motto: to make the meat shopping experience easy and hygienic. Born in a middle-class household, Chandran is a college dropout who launched multiple tech-enabled businesses, including a B2B payments business in 2005. Eight years later he sold the company to a French buyer and started his second innings in 2016 with omni-channel meat and seafood brand TenderCuts. With self-funding of Rs 3 crore and no collateral to pledge, Chandran was determined to disrupt the Rs 2.5 lakh crore meat and seafood industry. Within six years of launch, his company touched Rs 250 crore in revenue last year, with 70% of the business coming from online orders. With five million app downloads, the startup recorded a 60% YoY growth and touched 10 lakh customer base in 2021. It sources supplies from about 1,000 farmers and fishermen, all from local farms in a 100-200 km radius of the stores. With TenderCuts, Chandran aimed to fill gaps left unattended by local meat vendors - from reducing the long waiting queues at dirty shops to not getting specific meat cuts. "You don’t get three chicken legs, for instance, and have to buy the whole chicken. This made me think, one can either sell painkillers or vitamins," he says. The Indian meat market is a `2.5 lakh crore segment. According to FSSAI norms, cut meat has to be sold between 0-4 degrees or frozen/chilled, whereas in the Indian wet market it is sold at room temperature. "We have bet on regulation to kick in, just like demonetization that led to regulation of the payment business," says Chandran. Launching its first store on OMR, TenderCuts clocked business worth `40 lakh within four months. The omni-channel model saw a 100-300% jump in revenue from Rs 20 crore to Rs 60 crore within 3-4 months of launch. "When the pandemic hit, our revenue grew by 300-400% with a sudden digital adoption," he says. "We saw Rs 10 crore-plus a year in FY18, grew to `50 crore a year in FY 2019, and Rs 100 crore in FY 2020. We will touch the Rs 300 crore a year mark this year and target annual revenue of `500 crore by FY22," he adds. In 2021, TenderCuts raised Rs 110 crore ($15 million) in a round led by Paragon Partners, a mid-market PE fund founded by Siddharth Parekh and Sumeet Nindrajog with participation from NABVENTURES, a leading agri-food tech VC fund backed by NABARD. The NABARD partnership is particularly inclusive as it offers full or partial funding to farmers to buy and rear goats for a six-month period, along with a guaranteed buyback at fair market price. That focus on the community is something Chandran is proud of. "Even our waste is put to use – the fat or meat and seafood waste is given to the Chennai Corporation as biogas feed," he says. As TenderCuts grows, it is looking to expand retail footprint from the current 55 locations to 80, opening shop in large markets such as New Delhi, Kolkata and Pune in 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/they-will-give-you-a-chicken-with-three-legs/articleshow/88796497.cms||Mamtha Asokan

According to health department officials, more active cases are there in educational institution campuses in the district. More than 67% of the active cases in the district are people who are below 40 years; 30% are in the age group of 21-30, and 22% are below 20. Of the 994 active cases in the district, as on Saturday, 666 are people who are below 40, 297 are in the age group of 21-30 and 215 are below 20. In the first wave of the pandemic, 51% of those infected were below 40. In the second wave, 50% of those who tested positive were below 40. However, the spread of the virus on educational campuses has increased the percentage of active cases among those below 40, recently. District nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Ashok H told TOI that the majority of active cases reported in Dakshina Kannada are students pursuing medical, engineering and paramedical courses. “We have been monitoring educational institutions, and insisted on quarantining students who arrive from Kerala after holidays. Even if one case is reported on a campus, we carry out surveillance of 200 to 300 students. Soon after finding cases on educational campuses, we declare containment zones in hostels,” he said. “Most of the campus clusters are formed because of lack of awareness about the disease. When asymptomatic cases, especially day scholars, mingle with other students in classes and hostels, the virus spreads. An engineering college was declared a containment zone, after several cases were reported recently. Initially, two of the day scholars in the college tested positive, and they are in Kasaragod now. However, days after they tested positive, many from the college also got infected. It is a difficult task to control the movement of students on campuses,” Dr Ashok said. More tests are conducted on campuses, in nearby areas, and paying guest accommodations near the institutions where Covid-19 cases are found, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/people-aged-below-40-constitute-67-of-active-cases-in-dk/articleshow/88796179.cms||---
---||Business||They funded and fashioned enterprise through the ages, and still do||Chennai: The story of business in Tamil Nadu is the story of its communities -- chettiars, gounders, brahmins, nadars and many more. Historians say much of Chennai’s industry was financed by money from trade with South East Asia – an old geo-political link. "After the Treaty of Allahabad (1765), the East India Company started discriminatory taxation to wipe out local merchants and bankers forcing them to diversify into timber, salt and spice trade with South East Asia," says Professor Venkata Raghottam, former head of the department of history, Pondicherry University. Later much of this money was used to finance banking and manufacturing in Tamil Nadu. But our story goes back much further in time. For millennia, chettiars controlled money lending and financed trade and domestic production of cloth, farm implements, jewellery, conch bangles, and pearl diving. Business historian V Sriram says there are references to chettiars in Sangam literature. "One of the earliest references to a chettiar business family in the Madras region is in the Thevaram (a collection of Saivite devotional poems from the 7th & 8th centuries)," he says. "Historically they were repositories of public money, including temple donations." Today, they own some of the biggest conglomerates such as the Chettinad Group, the Murugappa Group and SPIC. Chidambaram Chettyar, who founded the Indian Overseas Bank in the late 1930s, is a scion of an old chettiar banking family. His father, Sir M Ct Muthiah Chettiar, was an eminent banker. Like the chettiars, the nadar community has also been into financial services for centuries. "A century and a half ago, the nadars were into gold, retail and also dominated money lending and banking," says H Lakshmanan, executive director, Sundaram Clayton. Indeed one of TN’s best-respected private banks, the Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB) headquartered at Tuticorin, was originally a Nadar bank. And let’s not forget the brahmin bankers of Kalladaikurichi in Tirunelveli district. "It started when a canal was dug to improve irrigation, which ensured better harvest and excess agri income that needed to be invested," said Sriram. That’s how the brahmins got into money lending and finance. Today, one of Chennai’s well-known conglomerates, Sanmar Group, has connections to Kalladaikurichi banking. "Sanmar Group chairman Narayanan Sankar’s great grandfather was Nanusastrigal, who had a local bank in Kalladaikurichi. His grandfather S N N Shankaralinga Iyer founded a modern bank called Indo Commercial Bank, which was later acquired by Punjab National Bank. That’s also where K S Narayanan, Narayanan Sankar’s father, began his career in business. S N N Shankaralinga Iyer also founded India Cements," says Sriram. A number of Brahmin families also entered the manufacturing and automotive-retail businesses, which, in time, made Chennai an auto hub. "The TVS family, for example, went from timber to bicycles to truck and bus distribution to car retail, and finally mopeds and motorcycles," says Sriram. Similarly, Coimbatore’s reputation as a textile hub is the result of the gounder community’s entrepreneurial spirit. After Sir Robert Stanes established the Coimbatore Spinning and Weaving Mills in 1888 with help from S P Narasimhalu Naidu, a number of kammavar naidu and kongu vellala (gounder) industrialists followed suit. "It was their entrepreneurial spirit that has turned Coimbatore and nearby Tirupur into a textile hub today," says Lakshmanan of Sundaram Clayton. So, off and on, we will bring you stories about the business communities of Tamil Nadu and the enterprises they build.

Its new MD & CEO Amish Mehta in an interview told TOI how the agency has retained growth numbers despite the new Covid variant. Mehta until September 2021 had led the company’s acquisition and change agenda as president & COO. How do you see the impact of the 3rd wave of Covid? Has Crisil revised any forecasts?If you see how the Omicron wave happened in South Africa, there was a quick rise in infections and then a quick peak-out. If that’s what happens in India, we will see limited impact compared with the delta variant. To be sure, the contact-based services sector will be affected relatively more because people will cut down on travel and there will be fewer public events. Our forecast for India’s GDP growth this fiscal is 9.5%. We expect some adverse impact in the fourth quarter due to Omicron and high-base effect. For the next fiscal, we are projecting a GDP growth of 7.8%. We expect the services sector to pick up decisively, leading to broad-based growth. Markets have been resilient despite the 3rd wave... Is it just liquidity that is driving values?I feel a couple of things have been playing out. The first, of course, is easy liquidity. The second is that through the pandemic, marketshares have consolidated. Smaller companies have lost out due to supply chain disruptions, funding issues, and lack of business-continuity plans. Another interesting aspect is that consumers seem to be focusing more on quality and reliability than price. That is why you see the top two or three companies in each sector doing well. As the CEO, What are your priorities at Crisil?If you look back, we have grown both, organically and inorganically over the past decades. Sustainable growth remains our clarion call. As for priorities, I would like to flag three: Continuing to attract and retain top-draw talent; being future-ready; and, leveraging our institutional capability and data to deliver actionable intelligence to our clients. The other important priority is cyber risk. Sebi requires rating agencies to track IPO end-use. How do you see this role?Yes, this is a new area for us. It’s something that banks and financial institutions (FIs) have done earlier. I feel this shows the regulator’s confidence in the ability of rating agencies to carry out such a critical activity. We are working on our systems and processes to deliver this effectively. Are companies more sensitive to downgrades because of the insolvency process?That’s a great question, and I think it’s fair to surmise that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has established a deterrent — that promoters can even lose their indebted companies if they remain in default. This has improved credit discipline, and we see more intent towards timely servicing of debt. When the pandemic began, there was talk about how things would go downhill for businesses. But timely interventions by the government and the RBI, lenders and corporates themselves have mitigated a lot of the impact. Additionally, many companies have used cash flows to pare debt. So one can say companies have become more sensitive to default because the credit ecosystem is now far more stringent on defaulters. This should help deepen India’s corporate bond market where high priority is accorded to credit discipline. On a separate note, issuers and borrowers in general tend to be sensitive to non-default downgrades. But mature organisations appreciate that downgrades only reflect the relative weakness in their ability to service debt in a timely manner. What are the emerging trends you see in the corporate sector?Since the pandemic began, companies have been investing to create robust and diversified supply chains, accelerating digitalisation on the customer-experience side, and automating processes. The ongoing data explosion is also leading to greater demand for AI and machine language-based solutions. I am also seeing sustainability rapidly becoming an important agenda for corporates. Banks and FIs are integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their risk frameworks for investment and lending decisions. How do you see the push towards sustainability playing out? After investors and climate activists, consumers are also increasingly raising sustainability issues. They say it is not enough that a company has good products. They want companies to adopt responsible practices such as ESG. However, the biggest challenge in India is availability of relevant information. Globally, regulators are working towards improving corporate disclosure norms. At Crisil, we are focusing on sustainability stewardship and availability of independent evaluation, benchmarks and data. Last year, we launched ESG scores for 225 large, listed Indian companies. We aim to extend our coverage beyond 1,000 companies. For the global markets, we work with top FIs on ESG integration through bespoke research and analytics. We have committed significant investments to be future-ready and grow sustainably.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/quick-peak-may-limit-3rd-waves-impact-on-economy/articleshow/88797216.cms||Mayur Shetty

The additional director general (Crime) Ravi Prakash Meherda has asked all the police stations not to make unnecessary arrests in petty crimes. Also every arrested person has to undergo the RT-PCR test. Speaking to TOI on Sunday, Meherda said, “I have asked the IGs and SPs in the state to ensure the RT-PCR test of every arrested person in various crimes. If an arrested person is found Covid positive, he should be sent to the quarantine centre or hospitals as per the need. Also, it is required that for petty crimes, police stations should avoid unnecessary arrests.” He added that since more than 1500 cases have been reported in Jaipur and around 4000 witnessed in the state, it is high time even the cops follow the SOPs needed to ensure lesser Covid spread in the police stations. Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (Crime), said, “After the review meeting we too have decided to ensure the safety of our men at the police station. Covid positive cops will be given leave and will be facilitated in getting hospital or isolation support.” Similarly, the jail authorities too have made elaborate arrangements. “We have made separate isolation barracks for the inmates who are found positive.

They were fully vaccinated.Earlier, the elderlies and those between 45-59 years with comorbidities were among the first ones to be vaccinated at the start of the Covid vaccination drive, which will complete one year on January 16.Secretary (health) Vaibhav Galriya said, those (HCWs, FLWs and 60 + population with comorbidities) who have got their second dose nine months ago, are eligible for the precautionary dose. Around 24.15 lakh are eligible for precautionary dose. Out of these, 5.17 lakh are HCWs, 6.48 lakh are FLWs and 12.5 lakh are 60+ with comorbidities. Galriya said that no certificate is required on comorbidities from the doctor for 60+ for the additional dose. “The elderlies and others eligible for booster doses can register through the Co-win portal or they can register on the spot at the vaccination centre,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, project director (vaccination), health department. Health department officials said that elderlies or people with comorbidities should take precaution and follow Covid appropriate behaviour to ward off risk from getting infected from the virus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/crucial-booster-dose-from-today/articleshow/88798298.cms||---

The entire area was surveyed with the help of Surveyor General of India in a matter of weeks, which earlier used to take years, claimed officials. Besides this, satellite imagery based survey was done for the first time for many defence land pockets, especially for certain pockets of defence land measuring lakhs of acres across the country. As per the records maintained by Defence Estates Offices, the Ministry of Defence owns large tracts of land measuring about 17.99 lakh acres out of which approximately 1.61 lakh acres is situated within the 62 notified cantonments in the country including those in Rajasthan. About 16.38 lakh acres is spread across many pockets outside the cantonments. Out of 16.38 lakh acres land, about 18,000 acres is either state hired land or is proposed for deletion from records on account of transfer to other government departments. Clear demarcation and boundary survey of defence lands and fixing of the boundaries is necessary for protection of the defence land, safeguarding of the title of Ministry of Defence, updation of land records, maps and prevention of encroachments. To this end, the Directorate General Defence Estates, Ministry of Defence, commenced the survey of defence land from October 2018. The entire exercise of survey of about 1.61 lakh acres of defence land inside cantonments and 16.17 lakh acres outside cantonments (total 17.78 lakh acres) has been completed. The magnitude of land holding, location of land in approximately 4,900 pockets across the country, inaccessible terrain in many places and association of various stakeholders makes this survey one of the largest land surveys in the country. Modern survey technologies like Electronic Total Station (ETS) and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) were used in the survey. To further speed up the process, drone imagery and satellite imagery based surveys were leveraged for reliable, robust and time-bound outcomes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/drone-imagery-based-survey-of-raj-defence-land-conducted/articleshow/88798300.cms||---

Due to this, the PwDs are facing a lot of problems in applying for disability certificates online - starting from harassment being meted out to them by the health department officials to money being charged by e-Mitra centres. The four letters were written to the directorate of specially-abled persons on August 13, September 21, October 14 and November 25 last year. Out of 11.79 lakh registrations, 2.99 lakh applications are pending with the health department for clearance of disability certificates and 3.17 lakh applications are pending after registration. In all, 4.24 lakh disability certificates have been issued in the state and 1.36 lakh applications have been rejected. “We have been writing to the disability commissioner for the past six months. The disability court/office of the commissioner for PwDs has written four letters to the directorate of specially-abled persons, but it has not replied even once,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, national vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, who had filed a petition in the matter. “Also, despite several complaints, the court is not issuing notices to the directorate. They should have registered a case by now. Moreover, the court should have written to DOIT and the health department as well in the matter.” “As per the norms, one can apply for disability certificates free of cost. But, they are charged for the tests done for disability assessment (to assess the category of disability). Moreover, posts of the doctors on the medical board for disability certification are vacant. There is a shortage of technical staff as well,” he added. “After registration through e-Mitra, they receive a message on their phone to visit the hospital/health centre for disability assessment. But, it doesn’t mention the documents required for physical verification. Later, they are asked by the health officials to visit again with proper documents. Also, there are no special toilets, ramps or other facilities for PwDs at the hospitals or health centres.” “Moreover, caste and income certificates are sought from PwDs. What is the need for these two certificates in issuing disability certificates? This amounts to harassment of specially-abled persons. They should make the online system more Divyang friendly. Extra budget should be approved for making the online system more effective,” said Goyal. “During the ‘Prashashan Gaon Ke Sangh’ campaign, in a bid to make the certificates in a hurry and meet the target, a lot of these were made incorrectly,” he added. Gajanand Sharma, commissioner, directorate of specially-abled persons, said, “We take appropriate action on every paper we receive at the directorate. We try to solve all the problems faced by the specially-abled persons in online registration. Anything that is brought to our notice is not ignored by us. We try to resolve each and every issue.” However, he could not specifically reply about the letters written by the disability court. The social justice and empowerment minister Tikaram Juli could not be reached for comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/people-face-problems-in-applying-for-disability-certificates-online/articleshow/88798304.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

According to SHO (Manak Chowk) Surendra Yadav, the deceased identified as Heera Chand Sharma was a resident of Johari Bazar in the city.

Even as the city police and his family searched for him, the Farsh Bazar police station in New Delhi had found an unconscious Sharma alongside a road in his innerwear on October 28. He was admitted to a hospital, yet he died the next day. The Delhi police had recovered a small piece of paper from him where he had blamed two persons for abducting him for a month. The same paper mentioned his son, Honey Sharma’s phone number, who told Delhi cops that his father had been missing for the past several days. Yadav said, the Manak Chowk police received the Delhi police’s FIR under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. “We have registered an FIR in the case and the matter is under investigation.” The incident, however, has become mysterious for the city police to solve.

---||Goa||Goa’s beaches filled with liquor bottles, footwear, other waste post-Covid, finds GU study||PANAJI: Goa’s popular beaches were besieged by glass and other waste after easing of Covid-19 norms, as post-lockdown, tourists and others hit the bottle with vengeance. Palolem topped with a 3,103% increase in glass waste while Calangute had a 559% increase in litter. These are findings of a two-phased study by Goa University (GU) researchers and others to assess the quantum and composition of waste on eight beaches in May 2020 during the lockdown and in January 2021, after easing of restrictions. The survey found an exponential increase in beach litter. A part of it may have come from the sea or rivers. After Goa’s beaches became notorious as the most littered ones, recently implemented initiatives for better beach management have made a difference, the researchers said. “Litter density changes between two surveys (May 2020 and January 2021) was highest for Calangute followed by Baina 281%, Miramar-Caranzalem 234%, Morjim 223% and Velsao and Colva 134-136%. Surprisingly it was -6.7 for Siridao, “ the study stated. Researchers from National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), ministry of earth sciences, Vasco, National Institute of Oceanography, Dona Paula and Ryerson University, Canada carried out the study under supervision of GU’s School of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences (SEOAS) professor Kotha Mahender. After a long lull, the increase in tourist footfalls transformed the beaches into a sea of bottles, discarded footwear, rubber, metal and plastic. A recent video showing a heavily-littered Baga beach sparked outrage on social media, but the study by PhD scholar Ritwik Nigam of SEOAS indicated that binge drinking on beaches overshadowed the tourists' complacent behaviour, as intoxication or sheer callousness meant footwear litter increased by 429% on Colva beach. “Glass is becoming a big threat to the beach ecosystem and its density is nudging out even plastic as a nuisance,” Alvarinho Luis, co-author and NCPOR scientist said. Rubber showed a huge 2,140% increase on the scenic Palolem beach while metal and thermocol showed a decrease by over 70%. “Local fishermen accounted for the metal and thermocol in beach litter and this had reduced due to the curtailment of fishing activities during lockdown," Luis said. For plastic litter exceeding 2kg per sqm of transect of 100m along shore chosen for sampling, Colva beach receiving a significant share in increase of tourists to eight million in 2019 ranked first. It was followed by Miramar-Caranzalem, Baina, Siridao and Calangute. The quantum of packaging materials like thermocol stuck out at Velsao, Siridao, Baina and Colva as litter was more than 100gm per transect. But on the positive side, Goa’s waste management has shown an improvement, Mahender said. “Goa being an attractive destination in south east Asia attracted 8 million tourists in 2019 and it shows in the litter density on beaches. But the state has improved as per recent ratings in managing litter pollution due to government’s recent initiatives,“ he said. While anthropogenic stressors are disastrous for marine aquatic life, the study has strongly emphasized segregation at source as the best solution to reduce damage. “A team comprising local residents, social work groups, college students and NGOs can be mobilised as volunteers to undertake beach monitoring and help the administration in keeping beaches clean," the study states. Consumption of liquor on beaches has triggered an increase in beach drownings in the recent past. “Strict implementation of beach discipline will further reduce litter and this in turn saves the expenditure involved for beach management,” Mahender said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goas-beaches-filled-with-broken-glasses-other-waste-finds-gu-study/articleshow/88819657.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Delhi||Taken off streets in Delhi, beggars find new life, skills at shelter||NEW DELHI: Dileep Kumar, 50, has an incredible tale for someone who survived on alms. “No one will believe it, but I practised law for a decade after finishing LLB from an Aligarh college affiliated to Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Agra,” Kumar claimed. “However, my brother, whom I loved and trusted, cheated me. Unable to tolerate this trauma, I ceded all my property to him and left home.” Kumar said he couldn’t work as a lawyer after leaving all his documents at home. Almost starving, he began life as an itinerant labourer in Delhi, often going to Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place to find food. Kumar, who recently worked 10 days as a wall painter, is grateful for the turn his life has recently taken. He is among the 25 beggars being taught house painting at a homeless shelter on Roshanara Road under Delhi government’s pilot project to rehabilitate beggars by providing them vocational training. Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, an NGO, said two months of basic training had been completed and a month of advance training would begin from next week. Apart from skill training, the beneficiaries are being counselled to become self-dependent. In addition, they are being given yoga and spiritual sessions and access to legal aid. Ramesh Singh arrived in Delhi from his village in Haryana eight years ago dreaming of a better income and a better life. But he met with an accident soon that rendered him unemployable. To survive, he began begging. His misery abated two months ago when he was escorted off the streets and taken to Roshanara Road. “At the shelter home, I have been taking lessons on polishing wooden furniture and house painting,” the 62-year-old smiled, proud of the fact that he was recently hired twice by a contractor and paid Rs 1,000 a day to polish furniture. “I used to work in a grocery shop in my village in Rohtak. After living a life as a beggar, I am earning once again. Living with dignity is better than surviving on charity.” Circumstances forced him into beggary, claimed Sanjay Kumar Kushwaha, at 25 among the youngest at the shelter. When he reached Delhi from Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa, his bag and belongings were stolen at the railway station. “I went to the labour chowk but people were reluctant to give me work because I did not have any documents,” said Sanjay. “To make ends meet, I loitered around Hanuman Mandir where I got food and Rs 10-20 as alms a day.” Happily for Kushwaha, his trainers got him his official documents and opened a bank account. “I also managed to buy a SIM card and contacted my family,” said Kushwaha while painting a wall at the shelter. The 25 men now bond with each other. Kurvinder Singh, 39, said that after the death of his parents and with no others to support him, he began begging. “I have a family now. My trainers also take care of me like my parents would,” he said. The pilot project was launched after a joint survey by the department of social welfare and Institute for Human Development identified 20,719 individuals as engaged in begging in the city. Of them, 53% (10,987) were men, 46% (9,541) were women and 1% (191) transgenders. Sanjay Kumar, co-founder and co-director, Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan, said, “We traced the people identified and motivated them to join our vocational training sessions. Our role is to reconnect them with a life without stigma.” Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said, “Delhi government believes that every human deserves dignity, no matter their status. No one takes up the act of begging wilfully, only out of helplessness and lack of opportunity.” He added, “We have established two training centres in Roshanara Bagh for men and women. The men are trained in house painting and the women in making jams, jellies and pickles. Delhi government wants to eliminate begging in Delhi through these progressive measures.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/taken-off-streets-beggars-find-new-life-skills-at-shelter/articleshow/88796744.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Mangaluru||People below 40 constitute 67% of active cases in DK||Mangaluru: A majority of those infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Dakshina Kannada are below 40. According to health department officials, more active cases are there in educational institution campuses in the district.More than 67% of the active cases in the district are people who are below 40 years; 30% are in the age group of 21-30, and 22% are below 20. Of the 994 active cases in the district, as on Saturday, 666 are people who are below 40, 297 are in the age group of 21-30 and 215 are below 20. In the first wave of the pandemic, 51% of those infected were below 40. In the second wave, 50% of those who tested positive were below 40. However, the spread of the virus on educational campuses has increased the percentage of active cases among those below 40, recently. District nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Ashok H told TOI that the majority of active cases reported in Dakshina Kannada are students pursuing medical, engineering and paramedical courses. “We have been monitoring educational institutions, and insisted on quarantining students who arrive from Kerala after holidays. Even if one case is reported on a campus, we carry out surveillance of 200 to 300 students. Soon after finding cases on educational campuses, we declare containment zones in hostels,” he said. “Most of the campus clusters are formed because of lack of awareness about the disease. When asymptomatic cases, especially day scholars, mingle with other students in classes and hostels, the virus spreads. An engineering college was declared a containment zone, after several cases were reported recently. Initially, two of the day scholars in the college tested positive, and they are in Kasaragod now. However, days after they tested positive, many from the college also got infected. It is a difficult task to control the movement of students on campuses,” Dr Ashok said. More tests are conducted on campuses, in nearby areas, and paying guest accommodations near the institutions where Covid-19 cases are found, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/people-below-40-constitute-67-of-active-cases-in-dk/articleshow/88798332.cms||Vinobha K T

Some areas of Mangaluru have suffered flooding at the peak of the rainy season because of clogged stormwater drains. Suresh Udupa of Malemar thought he had had enough of it.Residents in Kottara Chowki, Malemar, Maladi and surrounding areas have been victims of such artificial flooding every year.Suresh has lifted his 1,000 sqft house using more than 200 jacks. An Uttar Pradesh-based company was chosen for the job, Suresh told TOI.“The house has been lifted by three feet by providing elevated plinth beams to its foundation. The work started on December 9 and it is in the final stage now. The contractors have successfully lifted the house without causing cracks to the walls, pillars, ceiling, furniture and electrical equipment,” Suresh, who is a retired banker, said. “Twelve workers have completed the work for a contract of Rs 250 per sqft,” he said.Suresh built his house about 20 years ago. “We have suffered losses because of the flooding in recent years. Even sewage from the underground drainage entered the houses in this area. There is no provision for storm water to flow away as a major drain in the area has not been desilted properly. Accumulation of sludge in the stormwater drains causes artificial flooding during the rainy season,” he said.He also blamed the construction of a flyover on the national highway for the flooding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/fed-up-with-flooding-mluru-resident-lifts-base-of-house/articleshow/88798335.cms||Vinobha K T

---||Delhi||Covid-19: Starting today, 4 lakh seniors among 11 lakh people in line for booster dose in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Starting Monday, nearly 11 lakh beneficiaries will start receiving their third or ‘precautionary dose’ in Delhi. The online appointment of those eligible for a booster dose of vaccine against Covid-19 had started on Saturday, but walk-in registrations will also be carried out at vaccination centres from Monday. The third dose will be administered to Delhiites aged 60 years or more, who have comorbidities, healthcare workers, and frontline workers who have taken their second dose of vaccine nine months ago. While the number of beneficiaries who will become eligible to receive the booster shot on Monday itself is around three lakh, the total number of beneficiaries who will get the dose as and when they complete nine months since their second dose, is nearly 11 lakh. The beneficiaries include 3.8 lakh Delhiites who are aged 60 years or more and have comorbidities, 2.6 lakh healthcare workers, and 4.4 lakh frontline workers. The healthcare workers and frontline workers received vaccine doses during the first phase of the drive, which started on January 16, 2021. As a result, most of these beneficiaries are currently eligible for the third dose. The vaccination of those aged 60 years and above started from March last year and the total population in this age group is around 21 lakh, out of which 3.8 lakh have comorbidities, according to government data. Many of these beneficiaries, particularly those who received Covishield, completed their second dose much later and are yet to complete the mandatory gap of nine months. Those whose third dose will be due in the coming days will receive a SMS from the CoWIN system. The beneficiaries, however, wouldn’t have to open a fresh account as their existing CoWIN account would be used for booking appointments, and also for receiving a digital vaccination certificate. The beneficiaries will receive the third dose of the same vaccine that has been administered for the previous two doses. “Private hospitals that function as vaccination centres can vaccinate their staff (doctors, paramedics etc.) at their hospital itself,” a circular issued by Delhi government’s Directorate of Family Welfare stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/starting-today-4l-seniors-among-11l-people-in-line-for-booster-dose/articleshow/88797255.cms||Sidharatha Roy

AICC senior election observer and election strategist for Goa, P Chidambaram said that a third list is expected around mid-January. The next CEC meeting is to be held soon, sources said. Breaking away from its earlier tendency to wait till the last few days to announce the names of candidates, Congress was the first to announce its candidates with the first list being released on December 16. Though the party had announced eight candidates, one of them — Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco — resigned from the party and joined the All India Trinamool Congress.

---||Nashik||Trimbakeshwar to get sewage treatment plant with 5 MLD capacity||Nashik: The Trimbakeshwar council has issued a work order for the construction of a sewage treatment plant (STP) worth Rs 31 crore, which will be accompanied by a network of underground sewage lines. Recently, the council faced the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) wrath for releasing untreated sewage into the Godavari river. Sanjay Jadhav, the chief officer of Trimbakeshwar municipal council, said that the work order has been issued for the construction of the plant at the council premises itself. The present STP has a capacity of one Million Litre Per Day (MLD), which is not sufficient for the treatment of the sewage generated in the town, especially when the fairs are organized. “We are now installing an STP with a capacity of treating 5 MLD sewage, considering the rise in population over the past 25 years,” Jadhav said. The Trimbakeshwar council has a population of around 20,000 and the waste generation is above 1 MLD. Hence, the town has been facing the problem of treating the sewage – a section of which was released in Godavari river. “The new system is likely to be functional within the next 18 months. The work will start any time now. After the treatment, the water will not be released into the river. Rather, the treated water will be used in the farms and for other utilities,” the officer said. The material that is removed from the water through the STP will be converted into manure, and the same will be made available for farming, the officer further said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/trimbakeshwar-to-get-sewage-treatment-plant-with-5-mld-capacity/articleshow/88798351.cms||---

Sources said Wasim Hazaratsab Mulla, 33, a resident of Rattihalli town in the district, had applied for a loan from the Canara Bank branch located at Hedigonda in Kaginele police limits. As he had low CIBIL score, the bank rejected his loan application recently. Disappointed and aghast over rejection, Mulla came to the bank on Saturday night, broke open a window and poured petrol inside the bank and set it on fire. Noticing smoke, passers-by alerted police and fire personnel. They also caught Mulla while he tried to flee the village. Firefighters from Haveri rushed to the village and successfully doused the fire. Police said cash counter and cabin, CCTVs, five computers, passbook printer, scanner, cash-counting machine, fans, lights, documents and furniture, together worth Rs 12 lakh, have been gutted.

Clearly they lack expertise to train the candidates for tough civil services examinations conducted by the UPSC.“To clear UPSC civil services examinations one needs to be fully focused and dedicated and need to work hard 16-17 hours a day for 2-3 years. This means they have to forgo their jobs and other activities and concentrate only on studies and finally be prepared to face any setbacks. Many youngsters however bright they are will not be ready for this due to financial constraints. Those who are already employed or seeking a job to earn their livelihood will not be in a position to give up the job. One needs to attend coaching classes and to have effective training, they need to go either to Bengaluru or Delhi which again is an expensive proposition. But with all these constraints, the number of candidates from north Karnataka cracking UPSC examinations is gradually rising. This should inspire the youngsters. With internet facility, they can study from wherever they are accessing books and study materials. One can write the examination in Kannada medium and that is an advantage,” said Gurudatt Hegde, who hails from Dharwad and secured 25th all India ranking in UPSC and is presently the managing director, NWKRTC.“Candidates need to be guided properly in choosing subjects and making proper preparations. This plays a crucial role in getting success. The educational institutions, particularly the universities, should arrange for proper coaching at affordable fees and motivate the youngsters. Those with a humble background who have cracked the examination and serving as officers should encourage and guide the youngsters in their native places to go for UPSC exams,” said retired IPS officer Gopal Hosur who hails from Gokak in Belegavi district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/nk-candidates-lag-behind-in-cracking-civil-service/articleshow/88798362.cms||---

Solar power is continuous and farmers have direct access to it. Though the equipment and installation seems to be slightly higher in the initial period it will become inexpensive in the long run.. If diesel pumps are replaced with solar-powered pump sets, carbon emissions will reduce significantly,” he said.The MoU will benefit farmers as MECWIN Technologies is specialised in the production and management of solar irrigation pump sets and the bank is having largest branch network in rural areas with better financial products, he added.Shivakumara said solar pumpsets manufactured by the company have been popular. There are more than 15,000 satisfied farmers across the state, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/kvg-bank-signs-mou-to-finance-solar-water-pumps/articleshow/88798363.cms||---

He said two children were summoned to his chamber for testing temperature as their parents received a message from a school saying their children had come into contact with classmates who have tested positive for Covid. “After finding their temperatures normal, I sent the children to the regular hall. We have CCTV footage of them leaving my office,” he said, adding the exam was conducted fairly between 2pm and 5pm.The drama unfolded at the school located near Udyambag around 1.20pm when Shashidhar Kurer, administrative officer of Command Area Development Authority, entered the campus in his government vehicle. His daughter was also an aspirant.Vishwanath, father of a candidate, told TOI that Kurer went inside the school even after the examination authorities had sent the parents out. A few minutes later, four students were seen coming out carrying question papers, the parents alleged. He further said when Kurer came out, they stopped him and began to question. Vishwanath said: “Kurer defended saying that his daughter has Covid-19 symptoms and he came here to inform the same to the authorities. He left the campus,” he said, adding some students who were standing outside were sent in and made to take the exam separately.Basavaraj, another parent, said four students of government officials were given preferential treatment, raising suspicion of malpractice. Rejecting the allegations, Kurer said he visited the school after the school, where his daughter is studying, informed him about her classmates testing Covid positive. “I came on a government vehicle as I had some official work. I came to speak to the exam superintendent about Covid protocol as my daughter too had complained of symptoms. We have not tested her,” he added. “As my daughter was unwell, I decided to take her home. Allegations of my daughter leaving the campus with question papers are untrue,” he said.2 aspirants disqualifiedBlock education officer Ravi Bhajantri said two aspirants have been disqualified and investigation will be launched to find out whether there was any malpractice during the exam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/tension-prevails-during-sainik-school-entrance-exam-over-alleged-malpractice/articleshow/88798364.cms||Shreyas HS

Stakeholders have pointed out that only 3% of the teachers deputed for Vidyagama ever contracted the novel coronavirus.Vidyagama was the brainchild of then primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar, aimed at ensuring continuity in children’s education during the pandemic. Launched in July 2020, the programme was suspended in September that year, with officials citing concerns over safety of children and teachers alike. The initiative took on a different form, and was re-implemented in January last year.In the recently concluded winter session of the state legislature, data presented by the education department revealed that, of the 1.85 lakh teachers who were deputed for Vidyagama, only 7.269 contracted the infection, of whom 7,220 effected a complete recovery, although 49 succumbed to the disease. Nearly 1.4 lakh teachers were deputed to teach students of primary school, while 47,310 were tasked with educating high school students.Unfortunately, the government has agreed to compensate only two of the 49 bereaved families of the teachers who died of Covid. The department sought compensation for nine primary school teachers – in all, 37 teachers who taught primary school students died of Covid – while only two such pleas were made on behalf of the high school teachers – one is pending clearance by the commissioner of department of public instruction, while the other is being processed.However, the government is yet to launch another initiative along the lines of Vidyagama, and it is unlikely that a programme will be launched in the near future with many teachers being roped in for a host of Covid-related programmes.‘Online classes not effective’VP Niranjanaradhya, a Bengaluru-based expert on education, said, “The state government’s fears over keeping schools open are unfounded, as the data indicates. Experts have already pointed out that the third wave of Covid is expected to be less severe, although the rate of infection may be high. Such being the case, the decision to shut schools down defies logic. Most of the experts on the technical advisory committee appear not to have understood the ground reality.”Citing reports of international scholars, Niranjanaradhya said that online classes were not an alternative for conventional classes. “Such wrong decisions will have a lasting impact on generations of students,” he rued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/only-3-teachers-deputed-to-vidyagama-contracted-covid/articleshow/88798365.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Goa||Goa: Covid cases increasing faster than in first and second wave||PANAJI: Goa has been witnessing a faster escalation of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing third wave vis-a-vis the first and the second waves. Cases began rising from December 23 when the daily case count crossed 50, with cases ranging between 30 and 50 a week earlier. Since then, the growth has been unstable. Chest physicians, Dr Anil Mehndiratta and Dr Haradatt Karande both agreed that Goa could see the peak after 15 to 20 days. “We may see the peak at the end of the month, or the first week of February,” Karande said. With the exponential rise in cases, Mehndiratta said the peak should happen at the end of the month or latest by the first of next month. “In last 10 days cases have multiplied. We have seen cases go from 100 to 2,000. We will continue to see a huge rise unless precautions, which people have forgotten, are taken,” Mehndiratta said. Consulting physician at Healthway Hospital, Dr Chitralekha Nayak, said Goa is expected to reach the peak within a month, in a shorter period as was seen in South Africa. “However, the down trend of cases that is likely from the first week of February, may linger for a longer period with elections happening,” Nayak said. Goa will go to polls on February 14, while counting of votes is on March 10. While the Election Commission has said no public meetings and rallies will be permitted till January 15, even at small events, such as opening an election office, crowding happens and with hardly anybody maintaining social distance. Under the present wave, no sooner had the daily case count crossed 50, than the rise in infections was phenomenal. Cases doubled in five days and crossed 250 in another two days. In contrast, during the first wave of 2020, it took 20 days for cases to reach the 100 mark with a daily average of around 56 and another 20 days to breach the 200-mark on July 27. The peak during the first wave was seen after another 47 days when daily infections touched 740 on September 12 and the highest active count hit 5,920 on September 19. During the devastating second wave, which started in March 2021, the peak came 37 days after Goa breached the 200 mark. But throughout February and till March 19, 2021, daily average cases ranged between 50 and 100. The infection count breached the 200 mark within eleven days and it took another 37 days to hit the peak with 4,195 daily infections on May 7. It took another week to touch the highest active count of 32,953 cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/covid-cases-increasing-faster-than-in-first-and-second-wave/articleshow/88819794.cms||Bindiya Chari

Steps are being taken to treat patients from other districts with better facilities. Officials have been instructed to ensure that there are no problems like scarcity of oxygen and ventilators. We have also instructed educational institutions to ensure that students wear masks and maintain social distance in schools and colleges,” the minister added.Shettar objects to Congress padayatraMeanwhile, speaking to reporters, former CM Jagadish Shettar said that Congress is doing politics by organising a rally during the third wave of Covid-19. “Congress is behaving as though politics is more important than people’s health. People will teach a fitting lesson to the party in the next assembly elections,” he added.He further said, “Congress has stated that it will take out a padayatra for Mahadayi too. Congress leaders should remember that their counterparts in Goa have opposed the Mahadayi project while Goa BJP had supported the project. River water disputes should be resolved smoothly.

Another accused inspector is absconding. The four nabbed were produced before a magistrate on Saturday and were remanded in judicial custody.

The officials have so far shortlisted two places for the proposed food park, which have been selected based on feasibility and ease of access. HDMC is expected to invite tenders soon. President of Hubballi-Dharwad Citizen Environment Committee Shankar Kumbi welcomed the idea. “The dedicated food park will help rid the twin cities of the problems created by street vendors. The HDMC should initiate work on the park at the earliest. However, the civic authorities must ensure that garbage is collected and disposed of regularly at the food park,” Kumbi said. Sources in the HDMC said that the authorities had shortlisted two places – while one was near the Karnataka Arts College in Dharwad, where 20 guntas of open land was deemed ideal for the park, the other plot of land belonged to the horticulture department. HDMC officials are planning to set up the food park near the college, and should problems arise at the location, they are willing to consider an alternative location. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that the civic agency was contemplating setting up a food park to ensure that eating places were hygienic. “We are planning on setting up the food park in Dharwad. The design for the park will be finalised in a couple of days, and we will complete the remaining formalities soon,” Itnal said. Hubballi-Dharwad former mayor Pandurang Patil welcomed the initiative, adding that the food park would provide the residents of the twin cities with a place they could visit regularly, and unwind. “The area surrounding Karnataka College of Arts in Dharwad is a historic location, and officials must ensure that it does not lose its sheen,” Patil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/dedicated-food-park-planned-in-dharwad/articleshow/88798369.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The health department is currently maintaining that the 12 cases are treated as “suspected” as RT-PCR test results are awaited.Though the Sainik school has suspended classes, it is yet to seal down completely. The administration is also mulling over sending Class 7 and 8 students to home after analysing the situation. The school, run by a private trust, has over 400 girl students. An official from the school said when the children were brought to ground for physical activities, they complained of uneasiness. When checked, 102 students reported higher temperature, after which the health department was informed.District health officer Dr Shashikanth Muniyal told TOI that test results are being delayed as only one laboratory is functioning in the district. “At present, there are 12 suspected cases, while the others are isolated.

His newest venture will start in Varanasi on January 7.Domlur told TOI that the digitalisation of palm leaf manuscripts will start at the Jangamawadi Kashimath in Varanasi on January 7. “We have hired four people from Bengaluru and we will hire four more in Varanasi. The Mutt has said it has 180 manuscripts and that needs time of 15 days to digitalise,” he said.Domlur was involved in digitalisation for a decade. He said he has found support and cooperation from the Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha and seers such as Belimath Swamiji, Basava Marulasiddha Swamiji and several mutts in Karnataka and other states.“When we started the digitalisation of Kannada palm leaf manuscripts, we realised that 90% of them are related to Vachana literature. It was interesting to know that there were many mythologies, articles, analyses, discussions in manuscripts, apart from the Vachanas. These manuscripts were from the 15th century during the era of Vijayanagara Proudha Devaraya, who was a follower of Shaivism. Later, they were copied by Lingayat mutts in the 18th century. Now they are in danger of ruin and are neglected. When we approach (an organisation) with our intention, many mutts cooperate heartily. Whatever we digitalise, we share a copy with the mutt or organisation and also store it in our hard disk. We are also working with Google to put the Vachanas online so that these can be accessed by the whole world,” he said.He is also digitising articles printed in papers in the 18th and 19th centuries. “We are getting interesting information. For example, Vachana literature was banned by many kings after the revolution in Kalyan in 12th century,” he said.“We are also digitising issues of the Shivanubhava monthly, published by Fa Gu Halakatti in the early decades of the 20th century. Other Lingayat magazines such as the Kalyana Kirana are also being digitised,” he said.Domlur’s equipment, worth of Rs 10 lakh, comprises eight scanners and laptops. “We have written the donor’s name on particular equipment. We have two units of 4-5 people each for this work. They work whenever we have assignments,” he said. “Currently we are focused on documentation. We have a plan of floating an institute for research of the manuscripts and to spread Vachana literature across the world,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/techie-on-vachana-digitisation-mission/articleshow/88798372.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

This indicates that 73% of Karnataka's elderly population is impoverished. They receive a monthly pension from the state government and all have BPL cards.The poverty statistics was made available during the winter session in Belagavi in December. The data was presented in response to MLC Tejaswini Gowda's concern about senior citizens.These citizens are also at risk of domestic violence, according to the study. The state has recorded 2,193 cases of domestic violence in the last two years. Some activists say that the number is higher since many of such cases go unreported. The state government has set up district-specific toll-free (1090) lines for elderly persons to contact in times of trouble. Some elderly people in Bengaluru are vulnerable because they live alone, which makes them targets for robbers and others. According to MLC Tejaswini Gowda, it is the state's obligation to care for the elderly who are underprivileged. It is sad that more than 70% of senior citizens do not have enough money to live on, she rued.Speaking to TOI, Gowda said presently old-age homes are being run by NGOs but the state government has to take over this responsibility. “The NGOs are not accountable to the people and if anything goes wrong they simply wash their hands off. With over 70% in poverty if the government takes up the onus of their care then problems of elders can be resolved to many extent as government run institutions are bound by transparency,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/73-senior-citizens-in-state-living-in-penury/articleshow/88798373.cms||Shreyas HS

However, this will stop endoscopy and liver transplantation as the previous area has been undergoing renovation where the liver patients will be shifted from the Covid hospital soon. A total of 149 patients are admitted in the 250-bed hospital. Sources inform that all the health care workers who are asymptomatic have been shifted to the Covid hospital. “There are around 35 chronic liver disease patients who will be discharged soon as there is no other place to keep them,” said a paramedical staff in the PGI. Moreover, those liver patients who need endoscopy from time to time as a follow up, will need to wait until Covid cases come down. “The liver department in Nehru Hospital is undergoing renovation. The ICU which has 10 beds is also undergoing renovation. A makeshift arrangement has been done for five beds only. These patients are so sick that they cannot be just kept in any ward,” said a doctor in PGI. The UT administration had asked the PGI to open a separate area for Covid patients in April 2020. As the Nehru Hospital Extension was the only new building which was away from the main patient area, it was selected as Covid hospital. The hospital was meant for liver, ENT, radiotherapy and endocrinology patients. “Liver cancer patients, liver failure patients, need special care which is not available here in this region. There are the highest number of liver disease patients in Punjab due to alcohol. Hepatitis C and fatty liver. This was the reason this specialty was given priority and the centre was developed in this tertiary care hospital,” said a doctor in the PGI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/to-free-up-space-pgi-all-set-to-shift-non-covid-patients/articleshow/88798374.cms||Shimona Kanwar

As many as 15 such laboratories were set up at an estimated cost of Rs 12 crore – each such laboratory was set up at a cost of Rs 80 lakh. Many such laboratories, set up more than three years ago, have remained idle and unused.Sources in the social welfare department said that they had constructed a one-storey building at few hostels using grants disbursed in 2016-17. While the ground floor was to serve as the study room, the first floor was to be used for the computer laboratory. “In 2019, 20 computers were installed in each laboratory, each of which was an air-conditioned room as well. However, students at the hostels have never had an opportunity to use them owing to the negligence authorities,” a source said.Deputy director of social welfare department Jagadish Hebballi said that the administration of the 15 laboratories and study rooms had been entrusted to the Nirmiti Kendra. However, the wardens of hostels denied the charges. A warden said that, while the study rooms and laboratories had been entrusted to them, these facilities had not been provided electricity. “The material used to furnish the laboratories and study rooms was also sub-par,” he added.In fact, many such laboratories had been under repair even before they were officially inaugurated owing to the poor quality of materials used. Most of the computers did not meet the requirements for configuration, and were not functional. On the other hand, many of the structures were found to be seeping, while chairs were found to be broken and the plywood flooring was damaged.An official in the social welfare department alleged that not one computer in all the laboratories was fit for use. “These laboratories do not have internet connectivity either. In fact, the central processing units of many computers have gone missing. Projectors and air-conditioning facilities are not functioning in some of the study rooms,” the official said.Students’ Federation of India district secretary Basavaraj Bhovi alleged that the entire exercise was a scam wherein both the BJP and Congress governments were involved. “The state government must order an independent inquiry headed by a retired judge of a high court, and action must be initiated against the culprits,” he said.Hebballi, however, said that eight of the 15 study rooms cum laboratories had been provided electricity. “We will ensure that power is supplied to the remining buildings within a fortnight. I will issue directions to start operations at each facility,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/computer-labs-set-up-at-cost-of-15-cr-defunct-in-haveri/articleshow/88798375.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Out of Rs 202 crore additional budget, Chandigarh administration had demanded Rs 200 crore for MC on their request, the ministry has turned down entire additional amount. The denial to give Rs 200 crore is major humiliation for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led MC. On September 26, 2021, the then Chandigarh mayor Ravikant Sharma had announced in the monthly general house meeting that MC is going to get Rs 200 crore more grant-in-aid (GIA) from Chandigarh administration, which would have taken the current annual financial budget of the MC from Rs 500 crore to Rs 700 crore.With this decision of the central government to not give any single penny to the Chandigarh administration, it will keep getting its earmarked GIA on regular basis. Since the Chandigarh administration has been giving quarterly GIA, the MC has already get majority of the earmarked amount. “Since we failed to get additional amount from the central government, we will not be able to give additional money to the MC in this prevailing situation,” a senior official of the UT administration said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/with-budget-cut-200cr-dreams-of-civic-body-shattered/articleshow/88798381.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Chandigarh||Centre cuts UT budget by 244cr||Chandigarh: In a major blow to the UT administration, the ministry of finance of the central government has reduced the annual budget of the current financial year from Rs 5,186 crore to Rs 4,942 crore in the revised estimates (RE). The move has come at a time when the UT had demanded around Rs 202 crore more in the revised estimates a couple of months back. Instead, it has received a cut of Rs 244 crore amid the spike in Covid-19 cases.The finance department of the UT is now going to advise all departments to spend their amount judiciously and defer projects and works not of importance for the time being.It will be challenging for the UT to manage funds wisely, as it will have to work in the three months with these funds till the new financial year starts in April. The UT can look up to the Centre for more funds but it is unlikely to get any.“Health is the priority segment for us. We are completely open on any issue, requirement and additional funds related to the health department. But barring health, we are going to write to all the departments to spend their money judiciously, so that they can fulfil their needs of this financial year with the current amount,” a senior officer of the UT said.Salaries, wages and other committed liabilities will remain the priority for the administration and there won’t be any problems in it. But barring that, the finance department will work now as per the new RE amount. “We can’t put any kind of check on salaries and wages of our employees. Their salaries will not be affected,” a senior officer said.Chandigarh was allocated Rs 5,186.12 crore budget against a demand of Rs 5,670 crore in the Union Budget for the financial year of 2021-22 from April 2021. The sum was an increase of only Rs 48.02 crore, a meagre 0.93%, as compared to Rs 5,138.10 crore received for last financial year of 2020-2021. Out of the total, the government had given Rs 4,567.67 crore under revenue and Rs 618.45 crore under capital head, up by Rs 124.31 crore, as it had got rupees 494.14 crore last time. The funds under capital are for development works, while those under revenue largely cater to expenditure of salaries and other recurring expenses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/centre-cuts-ut-budget-by-244cr/articleshow/88798382.cms||Deepak Yadav

On January 6, PGI had decided to halt its walk-in OPDs and restrict elective surgeries from January 10. “Due to the surge in Covid cases and the high positivity in the city, it was decided to stop the OPDs. This time the transmission rate is higher as within a week cases have risen to an alarming high,” said a faculty member in PGI. A day after PGI made the announcement, GMCH and 16 took the decision. These hospitals will give consultations online using the e-sanjeevani platform. The previous two waves of Covid had witnessed collateral damage on non-Covid care. As per the NITI Aayog’s health index report, during 2014-15 to 2019-20, Chandigarh recorded decline in full immunisation coverage. Also, tuberculosis treatment success rate slipped from 88.20 in 2018-19 to 87.77 in 2019-2020.“Closing the OPDs in all major government hospitals will force public to move to private hospitals, which are unaffordable. Instead of closing all OPDs, some hospitals should be dedicatedly open for Covid services and others take up non-Covid services,” said a senior doctor in PGI. He said, “The cases of health care workers have increased in the hospitals. But for that reason why are the private hospitals not being shut? Most of the people depend on government hospitals here.”On the contrary, there are some who do not want the OPDs to function at all. “If Covid and non Covid patients can be seen separately by dedicated teams in the same hospital, the OPDs can operate. But this is not feasible as the transmission is higher and soon we will see an explosion of cases,” said a doctor in GMCH.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-walk-in-opds-at-3-major-govt-hospitals-from-today/articleshow/88798388.cms||Shimona Kanwar

He added that Modi had to stay on a flyover for about 20 minutes, which is a clear evidence of a huge lapse in his security and a well thought out conspiracy against him. A delegation of state BJP led by CM Thakur and state BJP resident Suresh Kashyap submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind through the governor regarding the lapse in security arrangements made by the Punjab government during the PM visit to Punjab.While interacting with media persons after submitting the memorandum, Thakur there was an atmosphere of anarchy in Punjab and Congress was at the root of every conspiracy in the state. “Such a government can be fatal for the nation and the state, so through this memorandum the BJP has requested the President of India to investigate this act of the Punjab government at a high level and take strict action against the culprits as soon as possible,” he said, adding that President’s rule should be imposed there so that law and order should be maintained in the state. Thakur said the country had witnessed an unprecedented situation as the kind of glaring and shocking lapse that occurred in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab was shocking and deplorable. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/himachal-bjp-writes-to-prez-over-pm-blockade/articleshow/88798399.cms||---

The sepoy was enlisted in the armoured corps on December 14, 2017, but was discharged for long absence from training a year later. He had returned to his hometown for treatment of his injured right eye that he suffered when the drill instructor slapped him, he said in his plea to the tribunal. Though he was treated in the military hospital, his eye still hurt and he couldn’t concentrate. Recruits are not permitted to go to hospital repeatedly. So he went to his hometown for treatment, following which he was issued a notice. The sepoy reported to training centre and joined duty, but he was punished for going AWOL and dismissed from service on December 1, 2018. Hearing his plea, AFT’s Lucknow bench of Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava (judicial member) and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve observed that if the petitioner had gone home with no further intention of being in the Army, he would not have returned within a few days or approached the tribunal to allow him to join duty.“The applicant is willing to serve in the Army…Full opportunity should be granted to a recruit so that he can become a sepoy and serve the country,” the tribunal said and directed the Army to reinstate the sepoy. It said the sepoy shall not be entitled to any back wages or other benefits for the period he was out of service. Closing the verdict, the tribunal said there should not be any lack of trust between soldiers and officers. “The officers of the Army must deal with subordinates or soldiers in a just and fair manner to strengthen their trust in them so that during the time of war, the officers may be their heroes to fight with enemies.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/win-trust-be-soldiers-heroes-during-war-aft-tells-officers/articleshow/88797958.cms||Ajay Sura

Henri Tiphagne, executive director of People’s Watch, has termed the case a ‘vilification’ attempt. While the complaint was submitted to the CBI, economic offences zone (EOZ), in New Delhi in 2014 by the then director of home ministry’s FCRA wing, A K Sinha, the EOZ registered a case against both organisations and other unknown people on Thursday under sections 420 (cheating) of IPC and Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), after the state government conveyed its consent to CBI to probe the allegations. According to the FIR, a home ministry team conducted inspection of accounts and records of CPSC in 2012 for the period between 2005 and 2011. A follow-up inspection done in 2014 for the period between 2011 and 2013 unravelled the violations of FCRA. The FIR states that CPSC withdrew 28 lakh in 2012 after its FCRA registration was suspended, and another 44.50 lakh between 2011 and 2013. It has also stated that 1.70 crore it withdrew from 2008 to 2012 did not tally with the vouchers submitted. People’s Watch has been accused in the FIR of having been direct recipients of foreign funds and that the association had used them for reasons other than what was intended. The organisation’s executive director Henri Tiphagne said on Sunday that they believe in being transparent and are co-operating with CBI officials. He also added that many human rights activists are being targeted for the work they do and that their work towards upholding human rights will continue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/fcra-violation-cbi-books-madurai-ngo/articleshow/88798401.cms||---

Dindigul district collector Dr S Visakan said that devotees would be allowed to participate in the festival following all the standard operating procedures.Police sources said that the numbers are expected to be less than 50% of the usual crowd. As the government announced the lockdown on weekends with the temple remaining closed for three days, including Friday, many people took the bus to the temple, said a police officer.People come from Coimbatore, Pollachi, Karaikudi, Melur, Madurai, through various routes to Palani, and all of them converge at Oddanchatram. On Sunday, too, pilgrims were seen walking on the deserted roads, as the temple is opening again on Monday.K Prasath, who came to the city on a pilgrimage, said that he made his offering at the closed doors of the temple as he had come to know of the announcement late.Temple sources said that this year the Thaipoosam festival falls on January 18.

---||Madurai||Tasmac outlets spread Covid-19, shut them down: OPS, Ramdoss||Madurai: Alleging that Tasmac liquor outlets are the new breeding grounds for the pandemic, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and PMK founder S Ramadoss on Sunday urged the government to close them down immediately as part of lockdown restrictions. In his statement, Panneerselvam said the state government announced night lockdown from last Wednesday as the number of daily cases climbed from 605 on December 27 to 1,728 on January 3. From 4,862 on Wednesday, it had gone up to 10,978 on Saturday. The AIADMK leader recalled black flag protests organised by DMK leaders including M K Stalin in front of their houses when the AIADMK government reopened Tasmac outlets on May 27 last year, when only 580 new cases were reported a day. There was also a debate between AIADMK and DMK in the assembly in June 2021 over reopening the outlets.Prohibition and excise minister V Senthilbalaji had then said that Tasmac outlets are closed in districts that have a positivity rate of more than 5%. Going by that argument, liquor outlets should have been closed by now since the positivity rate touched nearly 8% on Saturday, the former CM said. Ramadoss tweeted that even essential services have been brought under control to curtail the spread of the pandemic, but not Tasmac outlets that are not essential. Liquor outlets and bars are turning out to be Covid hotspots, he said and urged the chief minister to immediately close them down.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/tasmac-outlets-spread-covid-19-shut-them-down-ops-ramdoss/articleshow/88798405.cms||---
---||Delhi||Opinion divided over CU-CET route to Delhi University||NEW DELHI: With Delhi University opting for Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CU-CET), academicians remain divided over its implementation. While most agree that the preliminary issue of soaring cutoff marks for merit-based admissions will be tackled, they add that the new mode will come with its own set of restrictions. DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh on Saturday told TOI that the varsity would be going ahead with CU-CET, which would be conducted by National Testing Agency. Many argued that switching between courses during admissions, which was a common practice, might prove to be difficult under the new mode. Stating that every system had its own pros and cons, Sanjay Batra, professor at Sri Venkateswara College, said, “While students will get an equal platform to prove themselves, the entrances will have their own restrictions. Under the merit-based system, students can shift from one subject to another, whereas entrances are supposed to be subject specific. It’s a huge question that needs to be addressed.” Gyantosh Jha, principal of ARSD College, however, said entrances would end the trend of over-admissions in specific courses and colleges. “Several times, admissions under the merit-based system are irregular. CU-CET can end that uncertainty. The demand for each subject will be different and I’m sure some mode of counselling will be devised. This will provide an opportunity to students who have low scores in the board exams,” he added. Considering the large number of courses and colleges, lack of clarity on the exact structure and counselling process has left many hoping for clearer guidelines. DU professor Rajesh Jha said, “Under the current centralised system, seats in several colleges remain vacant. There are 56 colleges and each year around 75,000 admissions take place. How is the university planning to allot and counsel with these many permutations and combinations? The university is not factoring in these things or involving teachers in the process.” The former executive council member added, “If a large number of students are scoring 100%, then it’s for the policy makers to take care of such generalised marking. This one-size-fits-all approach will be counterproductive.” Others said entrances were bound to end in mushrooming of coaching centres. While Jha pointed out that “advertisements have already started appearing” and that it would affect those from marginalised backgrounds, Batra said while entrances would give space to such centres, it might not be on the scale of what existed for other competitive exams. SP Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College said, “With any kind of entrances, the growth of coaching centres is bound to happen. But there are positives and negatives for everything. All these years, board marks were an issue. Now, the exact format of CU-CET is not yet out. It will take time to gauge the issues.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/opinion-divided-over-cu-cet-route-to-du/articleshow/88797280.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The court was hearing the petition filed by S Kumaravel, who is working as an assistant in the panchayat union office at Alanganallur in Madurai district. He had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2021, seeking for a direction to reduce the punishment of stoppage of increment, which was imposed by the collector in 2013.When the petition was taken up for hearing recently, the additional government pleader A Kannan informed the court that the petitioner who posed himself as an officer had approached his juniors and offered to pay money if the government pleader acted in his favour in this case.On coming to know about this incident, Kannan contacted the counsel for the petitioner and informed him that Kumaravel had approached his junior and attempted to bribe him. Despite informing the petitioner’s counsel about this incident, Kumaravel once again contacted his junior over phone and stated that he was informed to pay money, said Kannan, who also filed a memo in this regard before the court.Justice B Pugalendhi observed that it is unfortunate that corruption has reached this extent. The petitioner who is already facing punishment, had entered into the government pleader office and managed to get details as to whom this case has been allotted and contacted the juniors.The judge said that it appears that the petitioner Kumaravel approached the government pleader as if he came to the to give instructions on behalf of the respondents (authorities) in the writ petition, though he is the petitioner.Observing that such an act of the petitioner has to be deprecated and dealt with in an appropriate manner, the judge referred the matter to the DVAC. The judge directed the officials of the Madurai district DVAC to file a report before the court on January 19.Appreciating Kannan for bringing this incident to the knowledge of this court, the judge observed that this must be the conduct of every government servant whenever a person is attempting to bribe them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-orders-dvac-inquiry-into-govt-staff-bid-to-bribe-pleader/articleshow/88798406.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Congress said that while it welcomes support from other political parties that are keen to take on BJP, any decision about an alliance should have been made earlier. “They should have thought about this earlier, before they came to Goa. They were saying what is UPA? Where is UPA? All these things should have been done in a proper manner earlier,” said Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. Rao said that for now Congress has a tie-up with Goa Forward Party and has not formed any alliance with other political parties. He admitted that he met with Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut where the possibility of an alliance along the lines of the Maha Vikas Aghadi was discussed. “There was a meeting with Shiv Sena regarding talks of a mahaghatbandan. We have an understanding with Goa Forward Party and that continues. NCP has been talking to us, but nothing has been finalised as yet,” Rao said. When asked about his views, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat said that he welcomes any party that supports Congress against BJP. “Anybody joining Congress is welcome,” said Kamat. At the same time, Kamat said that the party workers need to understand that while there may be many aspirants, there can be just one party candidate and they must support the selected candidate. Meanwhile, the chairman of AICC’s minority department Imran Pratapgarhi promised that a Minority Commission would be constituted in Goa to address pending issues. “Even the kabrastan issue is pending. We need to address it,” Pratapgarhi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-says-alliance-with-tmc-should-have-happened-earlier/articleshow/88797329.cms||TNN

Referring to TMC’s various schemes for various sectors, Alemao said that the initiatives by TMC would bring prosperity to the state. Slamming BJP for accusing Goa TMC of copying their schemes, Rajya Sabha MP and AITC Goa co-incharge Sushmita Dev hit out strongly at chief minister Pramod Sawant for promising 30,000 jobs to Goan youth. “Why didn’t he give these jobs in the last five years? Where were you when the youth of Goa wanted jobs? BJP claims to give Rs 1,200 to women under the Griha Aadhar Scheme while the ground reality says otherwise. BJP must first look into its own failures and then talk about development,” she said. Taking a dig at AAP candidate Venzy Viegas for accusing Alemao of corruption, Dev challenged him to show relevant documents to prove his charges. “One should be careful before saying anything about a TMC leader, else we will drag you to the court for criminal defamation,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/will-repeat-didis-west-bengal-victory-in-goa-churchill/articleshow/88797284.cms||TNN

They hope to complete 100% vaccination of all eligible children by next week. A total of 1,41,300 children in the age group, who include around 60,000 in the city, had been identified to be vaccinated. Health officials said about 85,000 children have been vaccinated so far. They include about 55% of eligible children within city limits. “As schools were functioning this week, our primary focus was on camps at schools. We will complete the target in schools and thereafter focus on non-schoolgoing kids. Children aged 15-18 years can get vaccinated at any of the vaccination sites,” said a corporation health official. Schools, meanwhile, said most parents were keen to get their children jabbed apart from a few who were worried about sideeffects as their child had other medical conditions. “The vaccine doses are being allotted to different schools in an area by the health department. So, this week some schools did not get their chance for vaccination as they were not allotted despite being prepared. As and when the health department makes the doses available, the camps will be conducted there too,” said the principal of a private matriculation school. In Tirunelveli district, 76,400 students have been identified in the age category and 52,081 (68%) of them have been vaccinated at special camps, district collector V Vishnu said. Efforts are on to cover those students who have not been vaccinated due to closure of colleges and higher education institutions due to the lockdown. Those in the age category also include college, polytechnic and ITI students. We are collecting a database of such students who have not been vaccinated and are planning to vaccinate them at their doorstep next week, the collector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/60-of-targeted-teens-vaccinated-in-madurai/articleshow/88798409.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

In Madurai, places like Goripalayam junction, major roads around Meenakshi temple, including East Avani Moola street, and even the ring road which connects highways were deserted. At the entrance of the Alanganallur Sugar Mill in Madurai, about 50 farmers led by Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association president N Palanisamy continued their protest. ``We asked women not to participate today as we may be arrested, and continued our protest peacefully,’’ said Palanisamy.Trichy city police had established eight check posts at spots vulnerable to lockdown violations and mobilised teams at 22 crucial traffic signals and junctions. Portions of arterial roads including Bharathidasan road, Thennur high road and West Boulevard road were barricaded, but ambulance service was not affected. Except for pharmacies, eateries (allowing only takeaway through food delivery agents), hospitals and bakeries, other outlets remained shut. However, a section of people stepped out without valid purposes which led to 10 two-wheelers being seized in Trichy city. Three shops that were not supposed to do business were penalised Rs 5,000 each. Around 600 people commuting without facemasks were levied spot penalty of Rs 200 each. Shops that flouted social distancing conditions were also penalised.Central and Chathiram bus stands in Trichy city appeared deserted. Police teams were deployed at MGR statue roundabout in Cantonment, Main guard gate junction, Puthur junction and Head Post Office signal to intercept vehicles. “Most of those who had ventured out had genuine reasons, like visiting hospitals and pharmacies. Some brought wedding invitation cards with them, we did not penalise such people,” a police officer on duty at MGR statue roundabout near Aiyappan temple told TOI. Food delivery personnel who were given an exception were seen at many places in Madurai. Police questioned a group travelling together for a bangle ceremony as they did not have an invitation. But they were allowed to go after showing WhatsApp chats. At some places, people were seen going for screening camps in their areas. ``Some autorickshaws should be allowed to ply with police permission during lockdowns as some people would need them for emergency travel, like elderly,’’ said K Sugumar of K K Nagar in Madurai. If mobile markets selling fruits and vegetables are reintroduced it could help reduce crowds the day before lockdown, said T Jansi Rani, a resident of Vilangudi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/total-lockdown-sees-high-compliance/articleshow/88798410.cms||---

Dr Mandal said the samples examined in the first lot were mostly of those with recent travel history. Fourteen patients of Omicron variant of Covid are from Patna and Danapur and the rest from Madhubani, Vaishali, Gaya, East Champaran, Buxar and Purnia districts. “The Omicron variant mainly attacks throat, causing fever and headache for a couple of days. Delta virus infects lungs, leading to severe respiratory problems,” Dr Mandal added.

Due to an increase in the number of RT-PCR samples, the turnaround time has increased from 24 hours to 48-72 hours or more. According to sources, the labs in Patna are receiving approximately five to eight times the number of samples per day to test, and the time between testing and receiving results has increased. Nearly 7,200 to 8,800 samples are tested daily on average in the state capital. Dr Manoj Kumar, the superintendent of Gardiner Hospital, told this reporter that in the last four days, the number of RT-PCR samples collected had increased from 24-30 to 250-280 per day. “The primary issue is that as the sample load has increased, the waiting time has increased as well. We have not received the results of hundreds of samples sent to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRI) in Patna for testing in the last three days. We are unaware of the situation, but have informed Patna’s civil surgeon,” he added. The officials of Gardanibagh Hospital stated that more than 250 samples sent to the RMRI had not yet arrived, causing frustration among the patients. According to information, the RMRI-Patna has been experiencing a lab technician shortage, causing reports to be delayed. Other diagnostic centres and labs, including private ones, have also reported an increase in sample load due to a manpower shortage. Numerous individuals have reported significant delays in receiving RT-PCR test results. Amit, a youth with Covid-related symptoms, claimed, “It has been 80 hours since I underwent RT-PCR test at a government hospital. How will the pandemic be contained given the rapidity with which results are provided to us? The government should increase the number of testing centres.” Aakash Jaiswal, another youngster who underwent RT-PCR test on January 6 at a private hospital in Hanuman Nagar, is still awaiting the results. “The hospital’s service is poor, as the staff did not return my calls when I attempted to inquire about my report. I visited the centre on Friday and was told I would get the report by 7pm, but I have not,” he rued. Meanwhile, Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh stated that the issue of lab technician shortage would be resolved soon. She added, “Testing centres have been directed to provide RT-PCR results within 24 hours.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/amid-big-jump-in-cov-19-cases-labs-struggle-to-give-test-results-on-time/articleshow/88798418.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Goa||Goan who helped revive Marathi natyasangeet dies||Margao: Noted classical vocalist and veteran Marathi theatre artiste Ramdas Kamat passed away in Mumbai on Saturday night. He was 90. Kamat is among the few Goans who has been credited with reviving Marathi natyasangeet in the 1960s, when the art form was passing through a rough patch. Born in Sakhali, Kamat studied at People’s High School, Panaji, and grew up listening to bhajans, kirtans and religious discourses at the Datta mandir in his neighbourhood. For higher studies, Kamat migrated to Mumbai, where he enrolled for graduation in economics in Wilson College. Drawn as he was to theatre art, Kamat seized an opportunity to perform in a Marathi play when he was in the second year of college. However, as his mother tongue Konkani had a heavy phonetic influence on his Marathi oration, he was rejected. That made Kamat work hard on his Marathi-speaking skills. After his graduation, Kamat landed a job in Air India, Mumbai, but nurtured his passion for theatre by participating in the Marathi play competitions as an amateur artiste. Those were the times when the only platform available for budding and aspiring theatre artistes was ‘natya spardha’ (drama competitions). “Sangeet Matsyagandha, which was a major milestone in natyasangeet’s history, also turned out to be the turning point in Kamat’s music career,” said Janardhan Verlekar, president, Gomant Vidya Niketan, and a connoisseur of classical music, who had had a close association with Kamat for several years. “Sangeet Matsyagandha by Vasant Kanetkar in 1964 marked the beginning of revival of Marathi sangeet rangbhumi (theatre) at a time when it was passing through a bad phase. Two Goans became instrumental for its renaissance, one was Pt Jeetendra Abhisheki, the music director for the play, and the other, Ramdas Kamat, the vocalist,” Verlekar says.  Kamat stopped performing in professional shows in 1997, but continued to guide budding singers. He twice assumed the mantle of president of the Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Natya Sammelan. Verlekar describes Kamat as a down-to-earth personality. “I have never come across such a simple, loveable, mild-mannered person in my life,” he says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goan-who-helped-revive-marathi-natyasangeet-dies/articleshow/88797304.cms||---

Even the majority of people who were seen moving around without masks in public spaces are now ensuring, with the exception of a few, that they adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Earlier, Pratyaya Amrit, the additional chief secretary of the health department, had urged everyone to wear a mask, describing it as one of the most effective tools in the fight against Covid-19. According to P K Singh, the president of the Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association, an increase in the sale of masks and sanitizers began in late December. “In mid-December, masks and hand sanitizers were not in demand. At the time, people were not wearing masks,” Singh claimed, adding that there was no scarcity of these items at the moment. Deepak Mandal, who owns a pharmacy in Boring Road locality, also stated that masks and sanitizers were in high demand. Rohit Kumar, a salesman at a medicine store on Ashiana-Digha Road, said he expected the demand to increase in the coming weeks. Many people are also purchasing masks and sanitizers online. Shweta Singh, a resident of Raja Bazar, recently placed an order for two packets of disposable masks as they can be discarded after use. She also refilled the sanitizer bottle in her car. V K Paul, a NITI Aayog member, had expressed concern in the first week of December about the decline in the use of masks in the country. He had warned that India had technically entered the danger zone. At the time, only 20% of Bihar’s population wore masks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/masks-hand-sanitisers-fly-off-the-shelves/articleshow/88798425.cms||Sheezan Nezami

This poses a challenge to the health department as it grapples to check the cases and provide healthcare facilities to infected patients.As per the health department data, 132 healthcare workers contracted the virus from December 30 to January 8.The number of healthcare workers testing positive for the disease was two on December 30; five on January 3; 14 the next day; 22 on January 7 and crossed the 50-mark on January 8.The officials said these comprise around 50% doctors, mostly of private hospitals.The authorities acknowledged that more HCWs testing positive will increase the challenge of checking the disease.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “For treating people, healthcare workers are involved. If they are getting infected, pressure will increase on the health system, as we have limited staff. As the isolation period has decreased to seven days, so they will return to the job relatively earlier. Basic working protocols remain the same.”Experts said healthcare workers are coming positive as they were the first to be vaccinated.“As healthcare workers were the first to be vaccinated, they seem to have lost the disease protection. Most of them had got vaccinated about 10 to 11 months ago. We can say that they no longer have vaccine protection. They should get booster dose as early as possible as they are directly involved in Covid management. People should follow Covid rules,” said Punjab IMA secretary Dr Sunil Katyal.The health department officials said besides taking care of Covid patients, the healthcare workers are involved in testing, vaccination, monitoring of positive patients and contact process, among other things. Forty-one students and a staff member of a nursing college at Malakpur Bet in Ludhiana had tested positive for Covid on January 4.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/132-healthcare-workers-test-positive-in-10-days/articleshow/88798438.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Ludhiana||Rain washes away city roads, leaves potholes galore||Ludhiana: Commuters driving through city roads are having a tough time due to potholes and uneven patches created after water logging and heavy rainfall. The situation is such that in many areas, people are complaining that even newly-constructed roads have been damaged, reflecting the poor quality of construction. While in Dugri, a contractor left road construction work half-way after people complained about poor quality. Before the imposition of model code of conduct, the MC and Ludhiana improvement trust had constructed roads in many areas. The residents, even at that time, had rued that roads are not being constructed properly and quality has been compromised, but those complaints went on deaf ears. A shopkeeper in Dugri, Sukhbir Singh, said, “There was water-logging on the entire road on Saturday, and many people could not judge the potholes. A person was going on a two-wheeler and his scooter was stuck in a crater. The nearby shopkeepers helped him in pulling the two wheeler out.” He also claimed that water had entered the engine of the scooter, and repair will be expensive. Meanwhile, a shopkeeper from Model Town, Arvind Sharma, questioned the poor quality of road in Model Town near Montgomery chowk. He said, “When Ludhiana Improvement Trust had constructed this road, I had warned the officials about poor quality but they did not take me seriously. And now, after rainfall,the road is damaged.” He said such exercises lead to waster of public money. “Similar is the situation at Pakhowal Road where a road was constructed in low temperature and work was left in between,” he added.Kapil Arora, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “Election time has come so people should use their vote judiciously for selecting a proper candidate. The roads in entire city are in pathetic condition, whether those were constructed recently or earlier.” He added that poor drainage system of the city is also responsible for road damage. On being contacted, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Due to election code, new projects will not be taken up but officials have been told to get old roads repaired. In case newly carpeted roads are damaged, we will take action against the contractors.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/rain-washes-away-city-roads-leaves-potholes-galore/articleshow/88798442.cms||---

Health experts say this can prove disastrous in the coming days.In the markets of Jawahar Camp, Dugri, Field Gunj, Chaura Bazaar and around Clock Tower, a team of Times of India found people, including shopkeepers, not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing amid the Sunday rush. At some places in Dugri, people crowded street food vends without following the guidelines. Harinder Singh, a Pakhowal Road resident, said it seems people have forgotten that the pandemic hasn’t ended and cases are rising in Ludhiana. He said the authorities need to strictly enforce norms like wearing of masks and social distancing.Another resident said even those who are entrusted with enforcing rules are not following them, especially wearing of masks. He said this slackness on the part of enforcement authorities may cost Ludhiana dear as the number of cases is expected to rise. He added that politicians also need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma didn’t respond to a question on the issue, but an official in the administration said directions were being issued to staff to be strict in enforcement of guidelines.Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said they have been requesting people to follow rules. President of Ludhiana IMA Dr Bimal Kanish said by not being serious, people were inviting a disaster and the authorities should act tough.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/covid-cases-graph-climbs-but-residents-ignore-rules/articleshow/88798446.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Delhi||Delay by DMRC in award execution costing taxpayers Rs 1.7 crore daily, Delhi HC told||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) has accused the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) of deliberately trying to delay the execution of the over Rs 4,600-crore arbitral award against it. In a plea filed in the Delhi high court, it has claimed that the delay is costing taxpayers a daily interest of almost Rs 1.7 crore. The Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary, in an application filed in the execution proceedings before HC, stated that DMRC was trying to defeat the process by making a “limited disclosure of bank account details only with respect to Rs 1,642.7 crore” in spite of the order directing it to disclose all its bank account details. It further claimed that DMRC, in an affidavit filed in December, had disclosed “total available funds” of Rs 5,800.93 crore, but had not given the full bank account details. An arbitral tribunal, in its May 2017 award, had ruled in favour of DAMEPL, which had pulled out from running the Airport Express line over safety issues, and accepted its claim that the running of operations on the corridor was not viable due to structural defects in the viaduct. In its latest plea DAMEPL submitted that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ought to comply with the high court order in letter and spirit and furnish complete details of all of its bank accounts and the total amount lying to the credit of such accounts along with the respective bank statements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delay-by-dmrc-in-award-execution-costing-taxpayers-rs-1-7cr-daily-hc-told/articleshow/88797307.cms||---
---||Goa||Cause for concern as Covid-19 positive cases on the rise in ISL||Panaji: There is growing concern within the Indian Super League (ISL) after an increase in Covid-19 positive cases inside the bio-secure bubble. In the last 48 hours, three ATK Mohun Bagan players tested positive for Covid-19 through a rapid antigen test (RAT), while three FC Goa players and a member of the coaching staff were previously sent into isolation after their reports threw up contrasting results. On Sunday, Goa were forced to cancel their training session after another player was feared to have tested positive. However, his RTPCR report late on Monday was negative. A match commissioner has also tested positive, though he was only completing his quarantine period and, according to sources, did not come into contact with anyone inside the bubble. Vendors and security officials at one of the stadiums are among those on the growing Covid-19 positive list.  “The cases have largely emerged after new players and support staff joined (teams) this month,” a source who has tracked the development told TOI. “For the last four days, testing has increased with players being tested every day and those teams with suspect cases being tested every 12 hours. “ATK Mohun Bagan were sent into hard quarantine after one of their players tested positive on the morning of the match. If a team has come in contact with someone who has tested positive, they will also be asked to isolate.” The organisers postponed ATK Mohun Bagan’s clash against Odisha FC last week but have told teams to “maintain the sanctity of the bubble.” “The League had to postpone one of the matches because of a Covid positive case in a team bubble. The team had to be unfortunately put in hard quarantine, making all the players unavailable for the match,” FSDL CEO Martin Bain wrote in an email to all clubs. If 15 players are not available for a match, Bain said, the league will “try and reschedule” the match at a later date. If the rescheduling is not possible, a win with 3-0 margin will be awarded to the other team. If both teams have players unavailable, it will be considered a goalless draw. “Besides the testing, the League has made it mandatory for players and officials to wear N95 masks at all times, even when they are seated on the (substitute’s) bench. They can only remove the masks when they are doing warmups,” said another official. Goa missed four days of training prior to the clash against Chennaiyin last week. They missed another session after the game due to a false Covid alarm, and when they returned to training on Monday, it wasn’t the same. According to sources, players had to do a rapid antigen test before they left for training and only six players were allowed in the team bus. The two team buses made two trips each to ensure that all players travelled for training by maintaining social distancing norms. “The next few days are crucial. Everyone is on the edge,” said one source. The second phase of the ISL kicked off on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cause-for-concern-as-covid-19-positive-cases-on-the-rise-in-isl/articleshow/88819218.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

With code of conduct coming into force on Sunday evening itself, the nervousness amongst the leaders has increased further. Moreover, the election commission curbs on the rallies and gatherings too will also prove to be a blow to the campaigning prospects of the candidates if the tickets are declared late.Speaking on the issue, Gurpreet Singh Gogi, former district president of congress, said “Code of conduct is already in place since yesterday and only one month is left for the voting day, therefore it is need of the hour that the names of candidates should be announced by the high command now. Moreover, other major parties like Aam Admi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal have already announced most of their candidates, which leaves the candidates of Congress at disadvantage because they will get less time to campaign”According to Parvinder Singh Lapran, Congress ticket aspirant from Atam Nagar constituency, “Election commission has put various curbs on campaigning through rallies and several other restrictions too have been put in place. Due to this, the candidate whose name is finalised by the party will have huge challenges in front of him for devising his election campaign strategy. Therefore, the party should declare the names of the final candidates by tomorrow and at one go.”According to a Congress leader, who wished not to be named and has applied for ticket from two constituencies, said, “The party should announce the names of its candidates for all constituencies of Punjab once and for all so that those who get the ticket should start their campaign and those who do not get the ticket should get clarity and think about the options available to them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/cong-aspirants-jitteryafter-poll-dates-announced/articleshow/88798451.cms||Mohit Behl

Some areas of Mangaluru have suffered flooding at the peak of the rainy season because of clogged stormwater drains. Suresh Udupa of Malemar thought he had had enough of it. Residents in Kottara Chowki, Malemar, Maladi and surrounding areas have been victims of such artificial flooding every year. Suresh has lifted his 1,000 sqft house using more than 200 jacks. An Uttar Pradesh-based company was chosen for the job, Suresh told TOI. “The house has been lifted by three feet by providing elevated plinth beams to its foundation. The work started on December 9 and it is in the final stage now. The contractors have successfully lifted the house without causing cracks to the walls, pillars, ceiling, furniture and electrical equipment,” Suresh, who is a retired banker, said. “Twelve workers have completed the work for a contract of Rs 250 per sqft,” he said. Suresh built his house about 20 years ago. “We have suffered losses because of the flooding in recent years. Even sewage from the underground drainage entered the houses in this area. There is no provision for storm water to flow away as a major drain in the area has not been desilted properly. Accumulation of sludge in the stormwater drains causes artificial flooding during the rainy season,” he said. He also blamed the construction of a flyover on the national highway for the flooding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/fed-up-with-flooding-mluru-resident-lifts-base-of-house-using-200-jacks/articleshow/88796240.cms||---

When asked why he was campaigning for a Congressman, Lobo in a crytic reply, said, “I will answer this question tomorrow (Monday).” He went on to say that they are moving ahead in the interest of the people of Goa. “Today (Sunday) being Goa Legislators’ Day, good things have been happening.

God will guide the people to vote and elect good candidates.” The BJP Calangute MLA urged people to rally behind one political party so as to rule out poaching and to ensure a stable government. “People should elect 22 MLAs from one political party,” he said. The Election Commission has given the people of Goa 34 days to decide on a good candidate and party, one that will protect Goa, Lobo said. Last week, Lobo, who had kept everyone guessing about his political moves ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, finally broke his silence and announced that he will back six candidates under the banner of ‘Together for Bardez’ and choose the right political party at the right time Naik on Sunday launched his election campaign in the presence of Lobo.

---||Pune||Pune: Businesses brace for losses amid new restrictions||PUNE: Owners of restaurants, hotels, beauty parlours, gyms, and business establishments are bracing for another bout of insecurity, losses and unemployment after the state government on Saturday announced new restrictions to check the spread of Covid-19 infection. Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association president Ganesh Shetty said business has already been badly hit in the last few days. “For hotels and restaurants, 8pm to 12 midnight is a crucial period in business point of view. Most customers visit during this time slot. Since the 11pm-to-5am restriction on movement is now in place, we will have to close the outlets around 10pm so that customers and our staff can reach home without hassle.” “This means we are getting only two hours of peak business time. Second, maximum traders, workers, employees will not come to hotels as they finish their work only after 9pm. Overall the situation is grim for us. Many of our members do not know how to sustain in this tough conditions,” he said. Popatlal Ostwal, the former president of Poona Merchants’ Chambers, said they are keeping fingers crossed. “About 150 trucks of grains, pulses, wheat, bajra, jowar, and edible oil come from outside states and district daily to the market yard at Gultekdi. Since the government has permitted transportation of essential services, the Pune market should not face any issue of supply of these items. We will come to know of the exact scenario in the coming days,” he said. Even after restrictions relating to beauty parlours and gyms were revised on Sunday, the owners of such establishments said they would have to go through losses and financial stress all over again and many of them will not be able to make a comeback. “The new restrictions will result in quite a financial load for the beauty parlours in the city as most of them offer multiple hair and skin services/treatments. Clients take appointments for multiple services when they come to the salon, and many will not make the visit only for hair cutting,” said Manasi Dogra, the owner of beauty parlours in Kalyani Nagar and Kharadi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/businesses-brace-for-losses-amid-new-restrictions/articleshow/88798461.cms||Sandip Dighe

BA.1 with its growing prevalence and with some defining mutations of the original Omicron strain is highly transmissible and is the main force in the current surge across the country. So far, most patients have shown very mild illness and comparatively less need for hospitalisation. The Omicron variant has three sub-lineages, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3, along with the original Omicron strain. Sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.3 have a deletion at the amino acid position 69-70. “In some sequencing run of clinical samples, we get to see the presence of more BA.1 sub-lineage now than the original Omicron strain. Since the sub-lineage belongs to the same family, these samples are considered Omicron positive,” a senior scientist at the department of biotechnology told TOI.

The important site in Pune’s western area to park Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses has become an eyesore. The vacant plot near a Metro station as well as Kothrud depot, is always filled with garbage, claimed locals. The rampant trash dumping at the property is worrying locals, who have now approached the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and PMPML for a solution. They have asked the civic body to clean up the space so that residents don’t face any health hazards. Civic officials said regular garbage lifting and processing is being done here. More awareness will be created to deter people from throwing garbage at the open place. “My house is in front of the bus depot. There are no safety walls or security guards to guard the depot. This makes it easier for anybody to dump anything anytime. Many a times garbage is being burnt at the depot,” said Amey Saraf, a resident of the area. Another resident Girish Hasbanis said, “I stay in Vrindavan society, just a few metres from the station. The place is full of dumped old furniture and consumer items. Many private vehicles are also being parked here and they lay unattended for months.” Yogita Patil, who regularly uses the bus stop to avail public transport, said, “Men loiter around here. Many people sit and drink liquor openly here. It does not feel safe for us.” According to PMC officials, the space has been allotted to the public transport body. “The PMC is carrying out cleanliness there. The place has been given to PMPML and it has the primary responsibility for the upkeep of the facility,” said a PMC official. According to PMPML, the space of around 1.5 acres is under its possession. It is primarily used in parking buses, which ply from Kothrud bus depot. Buses of private contractors attached with the PMPML services use the station. CNG buses are also parked at the depot, which has a capacity to accommodate 55 buses. “The private contractor and it’s solid waste management team are supposed to take care of the place,” said Dattatraya Zende, a senior official with PMPML. “Instructions to remove the trash from the place will be given to the contractor,” added the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bus-depot-in-kothrud-turns-into-garbage-dumpyard/articleshow/88798474.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

An officer with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) told TOI, “Many a times our workers have removed garbage from the service lanes of the bypass, especially near Chandani Chowk and Bavdhan. People have time and again thrown garbage on the service lanes. This creates problems in the movement of vehicles on the bypass. We will clear the garbage again but at the same time, we would request the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to clear the filth.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fire-from-trash-engulfs-mishap-hit-parked-truck/articleshow/88798478.cms||---

The total number of learner licences issued by the RTO (regional transport office) in 2021 was around 34% higher than that in 2020. The permanent licence seekers’ count increased by about 5% last year compared to 2020. (See graphics)An RTO official said, “One reason behind the increase in the number of licence seekers in 2021 could be many offices and establishments opening up after the second wave last year. The fear of availing public transport because of factors like little or no social distance resulted in many people buying personal vehicles, both two- and four-wheelers.”“The RTO last year recorded a major increase in two-wheeler registrations and a marginal rise in that of four-wheelers compared to 2019. So, the need of licences increased, and the numbers shot up,” the RTO official added. Meet Ashish Moghe, a professional. He would go to office in bus of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited or an autorickshaw despite knowing how to drive till the pandemic hit the city. He did not have a driving licence till then.“My office reopened last year. Travelling by bus became a risky affair then because of overcrowding. I took the driving test and got my licence by September,” Moghe said.A representative of a driving school said many people came to learn driving last year. “The number of students started to increase after July 2021, when different restrictions were relaxed. At present, we are running full on all batches. The number of people coming to us to learn driving and get their driving licences has increased threefold when compared to 2020. Many among them know driving but don’t have a licence. A few also learnt driving in 2020 but did not appear for the test,” he said.Another RTO official said, “Some people had applied for a licence before the pandemic in 2020, but everything, including our offices, had to be closed after the first lockdown was announced. Many of them did not appear for their final driving test later out of Covid fear.”“Last year, we started a system under which learner licence test can be taken from home online. More than 80% people are now procuring the learner licence from home,” the official from the regional transport office said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fresh-driving-licence-count-betters-pre-pandemic-figures/articleshow/88798479.cms||Joy Sengupta

Several parents are seeking the help of psychiatrists and psychologists. According to psychiatrists, there has been a threefold rise in the number of cases wherein parents have come with their children between the age group of 10 and 17 years to tackle the issue and bring their children “back on track”. “Before the pandemic, we used to get such cases once a week. Now, we get at least one to two such cases daily. Aspirations of children due to overexposure to mobile phones and the internet have shifted suddenly and they want to pursue such careers seriously. Parents are obviously worried and are seeking help,” city-based psychiatrist Swapnil Deshmukh said. Clinical psychologist Binda Singh termed the problem as identification conflict. “Teenagers are experimenting in nature, and they tend to easily get attracted to flashy things. As parents have no choice but to provide them with phones and the internet for longer periods due to online studies, the issue is more pressing than it was earlier,” Singh said. She added: “I have had teenagers visiting me who, after earning anything between Rs500 and Rs1,000 through online game/s, now dream of becoming millionaires and want to pursue similar games. They have become particularly obsessed with such games. I have also come across teenaged girls stealing money to buy flashy dresses and make-up items and are posting videos with parents who have no clue what they are up to. They get a few likes and start thinking and dreaming about it all day and are confused about their identities.” Experts said teenagers and children needed special care particularly in current times. “They get confused and the latest variant is another shock for them. Many are missing their friends’ and the earlier exercise of mixing with friends, going to schools and colleges, has been cut down. Parents are stressed because of constant fear of losing jobs and have little time for their children,” said psychologist S.K Ahmed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/insta-model-to-yt-sensation-new-careers-worry-parents/articleshow/88798480.cms||Joy Sengupta

For the Indians, who had come together just once before in the Davis Cup tie against Finland last year, the partnership came by chance. France’s Edouard Roger-Vasselin, Bopanna’s partner for the season, withdrew for the week as he got picked for the ATP Cup. The Indian had boarded the flight to Melbourne from Dubai when he received a message from his partner. Luckily for the 41-year-old Bangalorean, his compatriot was on the same flight, headed for the Australian Open qualifying.It was Bopanna’s fifth title playing with a countryman — two with Mahesh Bhupathi and one each with Divij Sharan and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan — and his 20th overall. “Winning with an Indian is always special. We are just a handful of players playing tennis from the country. Anytime I play with somebody from India, it's really, really special,” he said.The title will be more significant for Ramkumar.“I don't think we lost serve all week, all of the tournament,” said the 27-year-old from Chennai. Ramkumar was his usual dominant self with his serve, which his partner found out to stunning effect after being hit on the ear early on in the match. “I really felt Ram's serve today in my ear, so I know how hard it comes through,” Bopanna quipped. What was a revelation this week was Ramkumar’s backhand. “I think it's the first time in his career he was playing the ad side. I think that was a really big advantage for Ram,” Bopanna said.“Everybody thinks his forehand is actually his big weapon and his backhand is weak. This week I realised his backhand is also extremely strong. He needs to start trusting that side of his game.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tour-title-on-debut-for-bopanna-ram/articleshow/88798483.cms||---

The 18-year-old boy was beaten up when he tried to meet his 19-year-old lover, who is a live-in maid in the house of Ramasamy, a non-dalit landlord in Anaimalai, said M Mathi Ambethkar of Welfare Party of India. The girl, a Madurai native, also hails from a non-dalit community. The boy, a resident of Makkal Sakthi Nagar in Anaimalai, had fell in love with her while working as a farmhand in Ramasamy’s fields. Ramasamy dismissed him from work a few months ago when he came to know about the affair. However, the boy kept in touch with the girl over phone. Two weeks ago, Ramasamy’s wife told the boy’s aunt to tell him to stay away from the girl. On Thursday around 9pm, the boy, who was drunk, met the landlord in his house and asked him to send the girl with him. “When Ramasamy refused to do so, he left the house, but came back around 11pm. He jumped over the wall of the house and requested Ramasamy to allow him speak with the girl. Six stooges of the landlord took him to a coconut farm, tied him up and thrashed him. They released him the next day and warned him with dire consequences if he revealed the incident to anyone,” Ambethkar said. The injured boy was admitted to the Vettaikaranpudur Government Hospital.

This adage has been proved true since 1957, when Congress’s Bishambhar Singh won this seat and the party formed the government with Sampuranand as chief minister. Now, Hastinapur has become a coveted seat for any political party. Hastinapur, the capital of erstwhile Kuru kingdom, was ruled by the Kauravas during the Mahabharata times, is currently part of Meerut district. Here, Muslims form a large chunk of the population followed by Gujjars, Jats and Thakurs.Currently, BJP MLA from Hastinapur, Dinesh Khatik, got a state minister rank during the last cabinet expansion in September 2021. In 2012, when SP formed the govt in UP under Akhilesh Yadav, party’s MLA from the seat was Prabhudayal Valmiki. In 2007, BSP MLA Yogesh Verma won this seat and Mayawati became CM. Prior to this, when Mulayam was the CM, Hastinapur seat was won by SP’s Prabhudayal Valmiki. In 1962 and 1967 as well, Congress won Hastinapur seat -- reserved for scheduled caste candidate -- and thereafter ruled UP in these terms. In 1969, Hastinapur was won by Asharam Indu of Bharatiya Kranti Dal founded by Chaudhray Charan Singh. Though Congress formed the government initially, later Chaudhary Charan Singh took over as CM in February 1970. In 1974, Reoti Sharan Maurya of Congress won this seat and party’s Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna became the CM. In 1977, Maurya joined Janta Party and again managed to win. Janta Party formed the government that year with Ram Naresh Yadav and Babu Banarasi Das as chief ministers one after the other. From 1980 to 1989, Hastinapur was won by Congress’s Jhaggar Singh (1980) and Harsharan Singh (1985) during which the party ruled the state with party’s Vishwanath Pratap Singh and ND Tiwari as the CM respectively.In 1989, Janta Dal candidate Jhaggad Singh won the seat and Mulayam Singh Yadav (then in Janta Dal) formed the government in the state.“In 1996, Atul Khatik -- independent -- won this seat, following which UP politics witnessed a major turmoil that saw president’s rule and Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Rajnath Singh and Ram Prakash Gupta sitting on the CM seat one after the other,” said Dinesh Kumar, a resident of Hastinapur.Though this constituency has always got an MLA from the ruling party, not much has been done for the people by all the legislators, feel locals. “Some say Hastinapur has a curse of ‘Draupadi’. It will never grow. Even if we have the MLA from the ruling party, development still eludes us,” said Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/party-that-wins-mahabharata-era-capital-hastinapur-rules-up/articleshow/88798492.cms||---

He is a resident of Indore in Madhya Pradesh. DCP (Special Cell) KPS Malhotra said Thakur was a web developer and had a bachelor’s in Computer Application. His alleged motive was to troll and defame women after discussions on a trad-group on Twitter. TOI was first to report on Sunday that the key suspect in the case had been apprehended from MP. Sulli Deals was released on GitHub in July last year, which allowed people to participate in an online “auction” of Muslim women. The Bulli Bai app released in December was a similar software. The cyber cell had filed an FIR in the Sulli Deals case on July 7, 2021 and sent a request to GitHub for details of the user the same day. A reminder was sent a week later. However, the platform refused to share any details and asked police to come through the legal channel. Delhi Police then started the MLAT procedure and the file was sent to Union ministry of home affairs via the Delhi government home department. Subsequently, the MLAT proposal was drafted and sent to the US Department of Justice. Thakur lived with his parents and a brother in Newyork City township in Indore. His father is a sales manager with a private company. The family had planned to celebrate his birthday on January 17. His father claimed that Thakur was innocent. His brother works with a leading software consultancy firm. “Thakur admitted that he was a member of a trad group on Twitter where the idea to defame and troll Muslim women was shared. He developed the code on GitHub,” said Malhotra. The access to the GitHub application and account was with all members of the group and Thakur had also shared the app on his Twitter account. Photos of Muslim women were uploaded by the group members, said a senior officer, indicating that more arrests were likely. The operations in both Sulli Deals and Bulli Bai cases were conducted by two special teams under ACP Raman Lamba. One team comprised inspector Hansraj and sub-inspectors Neeraj and Pawan, while the other had inspector Bhanu Pratap and ASI Ajeet. The team went to Indore on January 8 and picked up Thakur for questioning. His tech gadgets were also scrutinised.

---||Bhubaneswar||Ready to fight virus with booster dose||Bhubaneswar: An estimated 17.50 lakh beneficiaries are set to receive the Covid-19 booster dose (third jab) as the state begins the special inoculation drive from Monday. The beneficiaries include 60-plus with co-morbidities, healthcare workers and frontline workers, who have received the final dose of vaccine nine months before. The government has roughly estimated the number of 60-plus with co-morbidities to be over 10 lakh, assuming that at least 20% of the total elderly population has one or the other health conditions.“We have estimated that there will be 10,47,400 beneficiaries in the 60-plus category with co-morbidities. We have 3,53,173 healthcare workers who have received their final dose and 3,52,265 are eligible among frontline workers to receive the precaution shot. We have ensured that all the logistics for vaccination are ready at the designated sites. The vaccination drive will be held at more than 2200 sites. Normal vaccination exercise of 15-18 age group and 18-plus will run alongside,” said Bijay Panigrahi, director, family welfare. Health officials said the 60-plus with co-morbidities need not produce the certificate of their health conditions to get the booster shot. “The 60-plus beneficiaries need to book the slot like others or can walk into the vaccination site and tell the vaccinator that he or she has co-morbidity. The eligible healthcare and frontline workers just need to furnish their mobile number, which was provided in the CoWIN portal, to book a slot or provide the number directly at the site,” Panigrahi added. The state has so far administered 5,25,38,339 doses out of which 2,21,21,170 have got their final dose. In the 60-plus age group, the government has so far administered a total of 84,30,842 doses while it has given 3,02,02,123 jabs in the 18-44 age group. In 15-17 age category, 6,00,560 doses have been administered so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/ready-to-fight-virus-with-booster-dose/articleshow/88798496.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Plea to minister for rail division in Balasore||Bhubaneswar: Congress leader Navajyoti Patnaik has urged Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to set up a railway division in Balasore. Currently, the railway related matters of Balasore are being looked after by the Kharagpur division of the South Eastern Railway.“Interests of Balasore, as well as north Odisha, have not been reflected in policy and investment decisions by the railways. The early establishment of a railway division in Balasore will go a long way in meeting the legitimate aspirations of our people and changing the trajectory of economic activities in the locality,” wrote Navajyoti, son of Congress state president Niranjan Patnaik, in a letter to Vaishnaw.Navajyoti said the tourism potential of Balasore can be tapped by extension of the rail line from Nilagiri to Mayurbhanj district, connecting areas bestowed with natural beauty. “There is a scope for creating jobs in the tourism sector and giving a major boost to the economy of Balasore. The railways can play an important role in this regard,” the letter stated.Navajyoti said several Shiva shrines are located along the Jaleswar and Digha route. A railway line along the route will attract more tourists. Though this was promised long back, it has not been delivered yet, the Congress leader said. Besides, there has been a long-standing demand for extension of the Rupsa-Bangiripohi line with Gorumahisani. This will ensure a shorter link to Jamshedpur and improve economy of the region, his letter said.The proposals, if implemented, can give boost to the comprehensive development of north Odisha, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/plea-to-minister-for-rail-division-in-balasore/articleshow/88798497.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Parties fine-tune strategies for upcoming rural election||BHUBANESWAR: With the state government already having issued the gazette notification paving the way for the announcement of schedule for the three-tier panchayat election, various political parties are also gearing up to fine-tune their respective strategies for the rural polls. Though these polls, except for the post of zilla parishad, are not fought on party lines, all the three major political parties — BJD, BJP and Congress — have started putting their respective houses in order. After all, the outcome of the rural polls will set the tone for the general elections scheduled to be held in 2024. On Monday, the State Election Commission (SEC) will meet the representatives of various political parties. The meeting is likely to revolve around conducting the panchayat polls in strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocols. The ruling BJD seems to be ahead in poll preparations with senior party leaders, including ministers, MPs and MLAs making whirlwind tours of different assembly constituencies to conduct public meetings and to take stock of the party’s strength. While chief minister Naveen Patnaik recently released a cash assistance of Rs 3,000 each for house repair for the 31 lakh beneficiaries of the state’s rural housing scheme, party MPs and MLAs are drumming up support by visiting different villages and pasting stickers on the houses of beneficiaries. BJD’s Rajya Sabha member Subash Singh said the ruling party is fully prepared to fight the rural polls. “Our party has already conducted meetings at the constituency, block and zilla parishad-zone level. The workers of the frontal organisations of our party have been assigned the task of popularising the different welfare measures of the state government,” he added. Party insiders said BJD, which has announced that it would field at least 40% OBC candidates, has already shortlisted at least three candidates for each of the zilla parishad zone, while the final list will be out after the announcement of the poll schedule. Emphasising on free and fair elections, BJP leader Prithiviraj Harichandan said the party has also shortlisted candidates for zilla parishad and other affiliated posts at the block-level, which will be finalised by the state committee soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/parties-fine-tune-strategies-for-upcoming-rural-election/articleshow/88798500.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: BJP alleges anomalies in draft panchayat poll rolls||Bhubaneswar: The BJP on Sunday alleged that there were irregularities in the electoral rolls prepared for panchayat election in the state and urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to issue a clarification in this regard. Addressing mediapersons here, BJP’s state general secretary Golak Mohapatra said, “The draft voter lists are yet to be published in most of the districts. This despite the state government earlier announcing that it would do so. Officials at the block and district-level could not provide us with the voter lists even after repeated requests. Except Jajpur, no other district cooperated with us in getting the list.” Mohapatra further said there were several mistakes in the process of publication and preparation of the lists of voters. “If the block or district-level administration does not publish the draft list, how can we submit our complaints about the mistakes in the electoral rolls? This is unfortunate,” he added. The BJP’s state general secretary said the final voter list should have been published on December 14 last year, but it could not meet the deadline. After the preparation is over, two copies of the draft voter list should have been sent to political parties like the BJP. When asked, district-level officials said they did not receive any instruction about sharing the draft voter lists with the political parties. “We have already drawn the attention of the SEC to this issue,” Mohapatra said. He further said they somehow managed to get hold of the voter list of Jajpur district. “The names of around 80 voters are not there in the list of a ward of a panchayat in the district. This is just a sample of the anomalies in the voter list preparation in the state. An official from Bhadrak district said a voter list will be provided after the issuance of a notification. The SEC should clarify on this matter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bjp-alleges-anomalies-in-draft-panchayat-poll-rolls/articleshow/88798501.cms||Hemanta Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Plan to decongest free left turns at major junctions||BHUBANESWAR: The commissionerate police have decided to decongest the free left turns at major junctions. Though there is a rule to make way for vehicles at free left turns, its implementation was lacking. In the first phase, the system will be implemented at the busy Capital Hospital Square, AG Square, Nalco Square and KIIT Square. New DCP (traffic) S Susree along with assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Swastik Panda visited different traffic posts and asked their staff to sensitise motorists about the free left rule. “We have deployed traffic police personnel at the four major signals to educate commuters regarding free lefts. After seeing the response and getting people’s feedback, we will implement the free left rule at other traffic posts. Once the commuters get used to it, then police can start levying fines on those flouting the norms,” Susree said. At present, most free lefts in the capital city are only adding to the traffic chaos, as several motorists end up blocking these lanes while waiting at junctions. Though the traffic police have installed cone-shaped barricades at most junctions to clearly demarcate the free left, the attempt has failed to discipline vehicular movement. The situation turns worse during peak hours, especially in the evening. “It’s not only two-wheelers and private vehicles, even government buses occupy the free left space and don’t allow vehicles to pass through unless the signal turns green. It is difficult for us to regulate traffic at the congested left turns every time. Motorists should learn the basic rules,” a traffic constable said. Traffic ACP Panda said the police will go after the violators following completion of the awareness drive. “We will impose a fine of Rs 500 under Section 96 of the Odisha Urban Police (OUP) Act or Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. If motorists are found blocking the free left intentionally and not giving way for emergency vehicles like ambulances, police will have the power to impose Rs 10,000 fine under Section 194 (E) of the MV Act,” Panda said. Commuters welcomed the move and demanded strict compliance of the rule. “We regularly see two-wheelers and four-wheelers occupying the free left at Nalco Square. Some of the motorists often drive through the free left to take a long right turn and stop right in front of the traffic signal. This leads to chaos,” said Murali Behera, a motorist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/plan-to-decongest-free-left-turns-at-major-junctions/articleshow/88798502.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly poll code under 40 days for third time in a row||CHANDIGARH: When campaigning for Punjab assembly elections ends on February 12, political parties in the state would have gotten just 34 days for canvassing under the Model Code of Conduct — a tool which is considered vital to provide a level-playing field to candidates in elections in India. A perusal of Election Commission data shows that for the third time in a row, the code of conduct has been imposed for less than 40 days in Punjab assembly elections. In 2017, parties had got just 29 days to campaign under the poll code in Punjab — the shortest-ever duration. This time around, campaigning under the code is the fourth shortest among all assembly polls held in the state since 1967. In 2007, the duration was 35 days. In 2002 and 2007, it was 59 days and 44 days, respectively. While the model code of conduct is in operation, the incumbent government cannot announce new schemes and projects and expenses of parties and candidates are closely monitored. Parties can run mass campaigns up to two days before the polling day. That is why campaigning for the February 14 elections would come to an end on February 12. Including this election, there have been only five times when parties have campaigned under the code for less than 40 days. Apart from 2017 and 2012, the period was the shortest in 1977 (31 days), 1985 (34 days) and 1992 (33 days).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/poll-code-under-40-days-for-third-time-in-a-row/articleshow/88798507.cms||Siddarth Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Political parties in Pb brace for digital campaign||Chandigarh: As the Election Commission of India (ECI) banned all physical political rallies and roadshows till January 15 in view of the continuous surge in Covid-19 as well as Omicron cases, political parties in Punjab are making preparations to reach out to the grassroots through digital campaigns and social media platforms. The ruling Congress party in the state kickstarted its digital campaign on Sunday. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu said the party’s social media war room already has more than 10,000 WhatsApp groups and the party workers were reaching out to voters at booth levels via Facebook, WhatsApp, and other digital means. The ECI ban can also be termed as a blessing for the political parties, especially during inclement weather conditions.As per Niti Aayog’s SDG India Index 2020-21 report, Punjab was in second place in the country with 84.32 internet subscribers per 100 population. Delhi topped the chart with 199.88 internet subscribers per 100 population. As the digital outreach will be a crucial factor in setting the poll narrative and there is every possibility of the ECI extending the restrictions beyond January 15, it is to be seen how smartly the traditional political parties will use the digital technology. Though social media war rooms of political parties were also active during the 2017 state assembly polls and also during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Punjab, the parties were not fully dependent on virtual rallies or digital campaigns. The information technology cell head of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Nachhatar Singh told TOI, “Our party has over 23,000 WhatsApp groups, and WhatsApp is the easiest and fastest medium to reach out to the ground level where we can reach out to the voters in less than half-an-hour.” He added that the SAD has 30 to 40 young party workers in every halqa who are well versed with the nuances of digital technology. Since Punjab has good internet penetration, even the elderly have smartphones and if they are not active on WhatsApp or Instagram or Facebook or Twitter, they do use YouTube, said Nachhatar, adding that they are well prepared to handle the challenge.Punjab BJP IT cell head Rakesh Goyal said that the saffron party has got a lot of experience in the last one-and-a-half years during Covid-19 of conducting virtual rallies and reaching out to the workers on the ground through social media, even during the West Bengal polls. “We had conducted the virtual rally of the Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in July last year in Punjab and even on social media we do totally organic work, and you can see our followers,” said Goyal.Similarly, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had been effectively using the social media handles in the previous elections in Punjab with a dedicated social media war room team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/political-parties-in-pb-brace-for-digital-campaign/articleshow/88798508.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Sanjay Sharma and his team are already working in Punjab for over a year, much ahead of SAD walking out of the alliance. The party high command has also prepared a list of 80-100 leaders from Haryana for election management.This comes along with direct monitoring of election management under the supervision of Saudan Singh, the national vice-president of BJP and incharge of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh , Chandigarh and Jammu Kashmir. He is teaming up with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. “This is nothing new for BJP, and Punjab is not the only state. Our leaders shall have active participation in election management in UP and Uttarakhand as well. Since Punjab is our immediate neighbor, we all have a responsibility,” said Om Parkash Dhankar, Haryana BJP president.As public rallies and events are banned till January 15, most national leaders will campaign by other modes. Recently, Khattar and Saudan had teamed up for civic and mayoral polls in Chandigarh. Now, the two have increased their meetings to discuss Punjab elections.Haryana BJP leaders like former minister Capt Abhimanyu and Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia are already camping in UP for six months.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Politicians line up at Dera Sacha Sauda event in Bathinda||BATHINDA: A day after Election Commission announced the assembly poll schedule for Punjab, thousands of followers of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda assembled at the sect’s biggest branch, Salabatpura village in Bathinda district, on Sunday. Leaders of parties too reached the congregation and rubbed shoulders with dera followers. The presence of political leaders is being seen as an attempt to woo dera followers. Though dera members deny having discussed any politics and claim the congregation was organised to observe the birth anniversary month of dera’s second head Shah Satnam, it is presumed as a show of strength ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab to be held on February 14. Former minister in previous Capt Amarinder Singh government Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, BJP leaders Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjit Singh Grewal, and Aam Aadmi Party’s Bathinda Urban candidate Jagroop Singh Gill reached the congregation. Minister in Charanjit Singh Channi cabinet Vijay Inder Singla too is learnt to have been in touch with the organisers. However, the leaders of Shiromani Akakli Dal stayed away. Jyani and Grewal denied any politics behind their visit to dera branch and said their visit to dera had nothing to do with elections. Gill, when contacted, said, “I go to dera every year during birth anniversary celebrations. This has nothing to do with upcoming assembly elections.” Dera ssacha Sauda, till the previous elections, was assumed as politically volatile, but after dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim was jailed in 2017, the dera is considered to have lost considerable ground. Aiming to make its presence, the dera had started mobilising its members recenrly to put on a united face. The dera started naam charcha (advocacy) at dera branches on November 15, 2021, and continued such big meetings thereafter. Though dera functionaries denied that these gathering had anything to do with assembly elections, followers said the dera was trying to show to political parties that it still commanded a large following, which could alter election results in many constituencies in Malwa region, which has the largest number of assembly seats in Punjab. A Punjab Police special investigations team (SIT) is probing cases of sacrilege and has visited the dera head in Rohtak jail twice. SIT has stated that as per information, the conspiracy for sacrilege was hatched at dera headquarters. Dera had been playing its part in electoral scene in Punjab and Haryana. In 2007, elections it had openly supported Congress in Punjab. Though Congress won several seats in Malwa where dera had influence, ithad failed to retain power. Thereafter, the dera has been siding selectively with political parties. It was at Salabatpura, where in 2007 dera head had worn an attire allegedly similar to tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh, resulting in violence in Punjab. Dera spokesman Harcharan Singh, when contacted, denied that the congregation had anything to do with the elections. “Our prime task is to help out needy,” he said, but then he confirmed the presence of political leaders. He said Punjab minister Vijay Inder Singla had called one of the organisers, but some politicians could not reach Salabatpura due to traffic rush. Congress leaders including former MLA Harminder Singh Jassi, ex-CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal’s son Rahul Inder Singh Sidhu, Manoj Bala and Mangat Rai Bansal and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from Dirba, Gulzar Singh, also reached to attend the congregation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/politicians-line-up-at-dera-sacha-sauda-event/articleshow/88798510.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Army officers must be heroes for their subordinates, says AFT||CHANDIGARH: The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has ordered the reinstatement of a sepoy and observed that Army officers must deal with their subordinates or soldiers in a just and fair manner to strengthen their trust in them so that during the time of war, the officers may be their heroes to battle against the enemy. The sepoy in this case had been selected and enrolled as a recruit in the armoured corps of the Army on December 14, 2017. He was discharged for remaining absent from training for treatment of his eye that was injured due to the drill instructor’s slap during training. The petitioner was slapped by the drill instructor during training and sustained an injury in his eye. Due to severe injury, he was always feeling pain in his right eye and was not in a position to concentrate on training. Though he was treated in Military Hospital, the condition of his eye was not stable. Moreover, recruits are not permitted to go to hospital repeatedly for a long time. Petitioner slapped by drill instructor during trainingWhen the applicant found that he is not getting proper treatment, he went to his hometown for the treatment of his eye. He absented himself from duty due to malafide behaviour of respondents. In the meantime, the apprehension roll was issued and the applicant reported to the training centre. As the petitioner was willing to serve in the Army, he joined the duty. However, he was punished and dismissed from service on December 1, 2018. At one place, respondents have shown that the applicant was removed from service on disciplinary grounds, and at the other place they have shown that the applicant himself had requested for discharge. Aggrieved from his discharge from the service, the petitioner had approached the AFT. Hearing his plea, AFT's Lucknow bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava (judicial member) and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, the administrative member, observed that if the petitioner had gone home as unwilling to serve, he would not have returned within a few days and approached the Tribunal with the prayer to allow him to join duty. The Army, however, contended that the petitioner was absent for a long time and that led to his discharge from the service. After hearing both the parties, the AFT observed that the petitioner was willing to serve in the Army but had absented from duty for proper treatment of his eye. "This is an established fact that the petitioner sustained an injury in his eye due to a slap by the drill instructor and he absented himself for treatment of his eye. The applicant is willing to serve in the Army, hence he approached this tribunal for reinstatement in service. An average recruit has the higher physical ability because he has been selected on merit after various tests that comprise running, physical and mental tests in addition to written tests. Full opportunity should be granted to a recruit so that he can become a sepoy and serve the country," held the tribunal, which directed the Army authorities to reinstate the sepoy back into the Army. The tribunal held that the plea of the Army authorities that there is no provision to reinstate in service is not tenable. The impugned order passed by the respondents declaring him deserter is liable to be quashed. "The respondents (the Army authorities) are directed to reinstate the petitioner in service and allow him to join his duty and complete his training as per rules and intimate the date of joining," the AFT ordered. The military tribunal has also made it clear that the petitioner shall not be entitled to any back wages or other benefits for the period he was out of service.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/army-officers-must-be-heroes-for-their-subordinates-says-aft/articleshow/88798511.cms||Ajay Sura

Chadha said Channi came from a scheduled caste community, so Congress used him for SC votes.The AAP leader said the Congress had nothing to offer to Punjab because of it cat-fight. All Congress leaders are fighting among themselves for power, and the people of Punjab are bearing the repercussions for five years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-cong-must-take-call-on-cm-face/articleshow/88798512.cms||---

Last week, two wardens of Halls of Residence at the boys hostel campus tested positive. Later, a cook working at a hostel mess too tested positive of Covid-19. “After the wardens tested positive, tests of all the students who were residing in the same halls, were carried out as part of precautionary measure. None of the students has tested positive,” said Dr K M Chudasama, officiating registrar of MSU. The hostels are already operating on 50% capacity as per guidelines issued by the state government. “We have now decided to restrict cross hostel entries, which otherwise happens freely. We have taken this decision so that spread of infection can be contained,” said Chudasama. Currently, 1,200-odd students including boys and girls are residing at the Halls of Residence campuses of boys and girls. Last year, the university officials had set up isolation wards at three hostel campuses providing isolation and quarantine facilities to students who tested positive during their stay at the hostel premises. This time, however, the officials have not set up such isolation wards but issued a general directive to students to adopt Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/msu-restricts-cross-hostel-entries-of-students/articleshow/88796920.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Digital Election first step towards ‘Digital Punjab’||CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu kick-started the party’s virtual campaign on Sunday as per the Election Commission (EC) guidelines and shared the agenda of governance reforms, primarily through digitisation and making of a ‘Digital Punjab’. The Congress has already been emphasising on the importance of digitisation and maintaining a virtual interaction with the electorate, claimed Sidhu. “Our social media war room already has more than 10,000 WhatsApp groups and we are reaching people on booth-level via Facebook, WhatsApp and other digital means,” he added. “It is the need of the hour to decentralise power by empowering the panchayats and other local bodies, and ensuring that their functioning is digitalised. It is often forgotten that the panchayat has the power to perform 170 functions and levy 12 different taxes,” Sidhu pointed out. “Today Punjab needs a governance reform which translates public issues into policies, with a poverty reduction strategy,” he added. Sidhu said mafia was working in Punjab and money had never been taken out of the pockets of the mafia which should have been gone into the pockets of the public. Explaining the ‘Punjab Model’ through a virtual press conference, Sidhu said it was not a personal or self-serving model but the model of the people of Punjab. “It is a tailor-made solution for the issues prevalent in Punjab which was created after intensive research conducted in the state and its functioning to bring the power back in the hands of the people,” he said. “The Punjab Congress is soon going to pave the way for the people of Punjab through a ‘Whatsapp Service’ to provide their inputs to the ‘Punjab Model’ and seek clarifications.” “We aim to create a ‘Digital Punjab’ where over 150 government services, permits and approvals will be made available to people at their doorstep. The revolution is intended to begin with the first of its kind ‘Digital Election’ which is planned to be held in Punjab and pave the way for digitalisation for all other activities moving further,” said Sidhu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/digital-election-1st-step-towards-digital-punjab/articleshow/88798514.cms||---

The notice came after objections were raised by SAD. Before the 2017 assembly elections, the AAP supremo had asked people to take money from other parties but vote for AAP. The pamphlets were distributed just a day after the Election Commission announced the election schedule for Punjab and four other states. It has been written on the pamphlets that before elections, other parties will distribute money and other things, but electors should not decline it. “If parties offer money, take it. These parties have minted money by looting Punjab,” read the pamphlets. AAP spokesperson Neel Garg said the party had not issued pamphlets, but it agreed with the content.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/notice-to-aap-over-pamphlets/articleshow/88798517.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Rebellion starts in AAP, old leaders hold meeting||JALANDHAR: Two days after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha faced protest from party workers when he came here to induct leaders from other parties and witnessed fisticuffs between old party workers and supporters of a new entrant, angry old party leaders and workers held a meeting here on Sunday. Rebel voices openly emanated from the meeting in which close to 20 state, district and local office-bearers participated. AAP state spokespersons Dr Shiv Dyal Mali and Dr Sanjiv Sharma, along with former Punjab Police IG and prominent wrestler Kartar Singh who was party candidate from Tarn Taran in the 2017 assembly elections, organised the meeting of old party workers from four urban constituencies. They minced no words in criticising the party leadership over selection of candidates. Common refrain at the meeting was that party had already drifted away from its principles and people from outside Punjab were maintaining iron grip over it in the state and Punjabis had little say in decisions of the party. Tag “outsiders” was openly labelled by the speakers. “Those who can’t even speak Punjabi are controlling affairs here, when they can’t even understand the state,” remarked one of the speakers. Rebels kept the meeting an open affair as Dr Mali streamed the meeting live on his Facebook. As several speakers addressed the event, which was held at old party office in Chhotti Barandari, allegations of “tickets for money” were also levelled. As a few speakers suggested that party workers who had joined AAP for its idea and ideals and worked hard should now join hands with Sanyukt Samaj Morcha put together by a section of farm groups, Mali revealed that they were already in touch with the farm leaders. A few speakers said that rebel AAP workers should look towards framers who have already organised themselves in villagers and now those wanting change in urban areas should also join them. “AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal had said that they would not take ‘waste of other parties’ but now they should explain that why have they exactly done the same thing,” said a speaker. Speakers pointed out that while old party leaders and workers, who had good reputation and credentials, had been dumped and new comers have been brought in and had been given tickets. Sheetal Angural was given ticket from Jalandhar West, a day after he joined the party, and Dinesh Dhal was given ticket from Jalandhar North, two days after he was inducted in the party. Speakers joined in asking the party leadership to explain that what criteria was used for their candidature. In Jalandhar, 5 out of 9 are newcomersOut of nine AAP candidates in Jalandhar district, five are entirely new. In all the cases, they were either declared “constituency incharges? just after they joined the party or were directly declared party candidates. From three urban seats of Jalandhar, newcomers have been fielded. Jalandhar West candidate Sheetal Angural was declared party candidate within a day of switching sides from BJP, from Jalandhar North Dinesh Dhal has been declared party candidate within two days of joining the party, while Raman Arora from Jalandhar Central also joined recently. From Kartarpur seat, former Jalandhar DCP Balkar Singh has been fielded. He was declared constituency incharge when he joined the party just after retirement a few months back. Nakodar candidate Inderjit Kaur was also fielded just after she joined. In remaining four constituencies – Shahkot, Phillaur, Adampur and Jalandhar Cantt candidates have been with the party for long.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/rebellion-starts-in-aap-old-leaders-hold-meeting/articleshow/88798519.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Will go into polls with CM face: AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann||CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab president Bhagwant Mann on Sunday urged the people of Punjab to be cautious of those who do politics of hatred at the time of voting and instead use their vote without fear, greed or influence. Addressing media at People’s Convention Centre in Chandigarh, Mann said their party never had any meeting with the Sanyukt Samaj Morch (SSM), headed by farm unionist-turned-politician Balbir Singh Rajewal, on seat sharing. The Sangrur MP, who is himself eyeing to become the AAP’s chief ministerial face in Punjab, said AAP will be the only party which will go into polls with a chief ministerial face. Mann claimed that AAP will form the government in Punjab on March 10. He said no workers will have to go on strike if AAP would come to power. “We guarantee you that AAP already has a road map ready for the development of Punjab. Every section is part of this roadmap and we have been informing people about it,” he added. Mann said the size of the state’s exchequer depended upon the intentions of the ruling party and the AAP government would stop the looting of government coffers, while replenishing the exchequer to use its money for the welfare of people. He also promised that under the AAP rule, no school of Punjab will be without teachers and no patient will die due to lack of doctors, quality treatment and medicine. “The people of Punjab are grateful for the code of conduct. They won’t have to deal with new announcements, lies and propaganda anymore,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mann-will-go-into-polls-with-cm-face/articleshow/88798520.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Cargo ships will start sailing on Brahmaputra later this year: Sarbananda Sonowal||GUWAHATI: Union minister for ports, shipping and waterways Sarbananda Sonowal on Sunday expressed hope that cargo ships will start sailing on the Brahmaputra towards the later part of 2022. The dredging work at critical junctures of the river has already been initiated by the ministry, he said. A statement issued by his office stated that the Bangladesh government, with support from the government of India, is also working on the Jamuna river to make the 2,000-km-long waterway from Sadiya in Tinsukia district in eastern Assam to Haldia in West Bengal via Bangladesh a smooth passage. Emphasizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Gati Shakti, Sonowal, the former Assam chief minister, said that the northeastern region will play a crucial role in resuscitating the economic prosperity of India. “In order to provide a springboard for the region to act as a catalyst in India’s economic rebound, there have been efforts to build waterways of the region and connect it to major ports in the Bay of Bengal. This will not only unlock the economic potential of the region but allow the landlocked region direct access to the international trading routes,” he said. The Union cabinet minister added that the government is working tirelessly to connect Mizoram, Tripura and Assam to strategic ports in Myanmar (Sittwe port) and Bangladesh (Mongla and Chittagong ports). In a bid to integrate expertise from the northeast in order to make the dredging a sustainable and economically viable proposition, Sonowal indicated that the support from experts in Tezpur University, IIT Guwahati and IIM Shillong — the premier higher educational institutes in northeast — will be crucial. The three institutions will provide technical inputs to optimally utilise dredging. “The potential of the Brahmaputra as well as other rivers of the northeast is huge and people will get direct benefit from the development of river tourism, cargo transportation and an alternative economic transportation,” he said, adding that government’s Jal Marg Vikas project is working to ensure an optimal and holistic development of the region by rejuvenating the rivers as a viable and sustainable economic proposition. Early this month, Sonowal interacted with stakeholders of the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust in Kolkata and discussed a roadmap to revive the old route of Haldia to Pandu port in Guwahati — an important growth avenue connecting the river to the sea.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/cargo-ships-will-start-sailing-on-bputra-later-this-year-sonowal/articleshow/88798522.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||---||Manipur Congress vice-president Chaltonlien Amo joins BJP||IMPHAL: Senior Congress legislator and Manipur PCC vice-president Chaltonlien Amo defected to the BJP on Sunday, a day after the Election Commission announced the election to the 60-member state assembly. Amo followed in the footsteps of former MPCC president Govindas Konthoujam, who joined BJP in the presence of senior leader Sambit Patra and Manipur chief minister N Biren in New Delhi on August 1 last year. Govindas, who was an MLA from the Bishnupur constituency, had resigned from the assembly membership on July 28. Among the Congressmen, Govindas was considered the successor of former chief minister O Ibobi Singh and his defection had dented the party. Amo, who is also a doctor, won from the remote Tipaimukh seat in Pherzawl district bordering Mizoram in the 2017 assembly polls. With his switching over to BJP, the current strength of the saffron party legislators has climbed to 28. He was accorded a warm welcome by senior BJP leaders — chief minister N Biren Singh, party in-charge for Manipur election and Union minister Bhupender Yadav, state party president A Sharda Devi — at the state BJP headquarters at Keishampat here in the morning. Congress: Amo's exit won't hit party's electoral statusCommenting on his exit, MPCC president N Loken told TOI, "Amo's departure will not affect our party's electoral status at all. He left because of severe pressure from the BJP and other elements in the hills. We suspended him on Sunday for anti-party activities." A co-opted MPCC member, Seram Neken, said, "Amo leaving the Congress when the election is at the doorstep talks volumes of his political ideology. It shows that he has neither the political will nor principle." State BJP vice-president N Nimbus, however, said, "There was no pressure on Amo. He joined BJP on his own and has been sending feelers to switch over to our party since 2021." Welcoming Amo at the party office, the CM said the joining of many legislators from the hill districts in the last few weeks has shown that people of these districts have full faith in the BJP. "The party is going through certain differences with its coalition partners. Hence, I appeal to all party members to work hard so that the BJP can form the next government on its own," he added. Addressing another programme in Imphal, Biren also indirectly commented on the recent violent activities among BJP workers at Moirang as well as the "BJP workers' attack" on the Congress office here. He said, "All political workers, be it our party or others, should shun violence.

Manipur will go to the polls in two phases — February 27 and March 3 — to elect 60 legislators. Though Manipur is a dry state, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and country liquor are sold in a clandestine manner at different places. This is evident in the haul of a large quantity of liquor by the security agencies over the years across the state. Various local clubs, Meira Paibis (women activists) and anti-drug bodies also recover and destroy the same. “All concerned are requested to support the initiative of checking, raiding and seizure of illicit liquor, beer, wine, and IMFL during the enforcement of model code of conduct for the ensuing 12th Manipur general assembly election, 2022 by providing credible information” to the office of the commissioner or the helpline number, the notification added.

The fair recorded an average daily footfall of around 25,000. “The Covid-19 challenges were there in the last edition of the fair as well. But we received an overwhelming response and recorded the highest footfall of nearly 5 lakh since the first fair in 1984,” said Pramod Kalita, secretary, Publication Board, Assam. He said the publication board faced a similar pandemic situation this time. “The state has seen a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases of late. But the book industry has to survive. Covid-19 protocols were followed on the fair ground,” he said. The board started the book fair movement in Assam, organizing a national-level book fair in Guwahati in 1984. It was organized in collaboration with the National Book Trust of India. It was a huge success. Then, the board organized the first Guwahati Book Fair in 1987 without any collaboration with any institution. Kalita said that books worth Rs 1.92 crore were sold in the fair last year, organized after a gap of two years. The book fair could not be held in 2019 because of violent protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the state and in 2020, the novel coronavirus dashed hopes of all publishers, printers and readers. Kalita added that books, which recently won Sahitya Akademi awards, were the bestselling books this year. “Well-known writer Anuradha Sarma Pujari’s novel ‘Iyat Ekhon Aaronya Asil’, Abhijit Bora’s short stories ‘Deuka Kobai Jay’ and Mrinal Chandra Kalita’s novel ‘Bakul Phular Dare’ have seen highest demand in the fair,” he added. A total of 115 publishers and distributors participated in the book fair; of whom 10 were from neighbouring Bangladesh. Last year, Ranju Neog Hazarika’s “Aalfar Kolngkito Adhyay” and Rupam Dutta’s “Life of a Driver — Cabinor Ipare” were the bestsellers at the fair. Hazarika captures the dark days of the nineties when Ulfa had unleashed a reign of terror while Dutta narrates his experience as a driver in his first novel. The board released 16 new books at the fair this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/12-day-book-fair-ends-defies-rising-covid-cases-to-record-sale-of-2-crore/articleshow/88798529.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Gaurav Gogoi, Akhil Gogoi question stricter curbs for Bihu||GUWAHATI: Politics has begun over fresh Covid restrictions imposed by the Assam government through the new SOP which is going to be a dampener in the coming Magh Bihu celebrations in mid-January. Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha and Kaliabor MP Gaurav Gogoi took to Twitter on Sunday to express heartache over the state government’s decision to restrict Bihu celebrations but giving a go-ahead to electioneering for local body polls. “New SOP in Assam have closed schools and restricted Bihu celebrations but election campaigning for local Thengal Kachari Autonomous Elections are untouched by the state government,” Gaurav tweeted. He termed it an irony to have dual approach of the state government towards elections and festivities and classroom activities amid alarming surge in Covid cases. “I’m part of the political process so will abide by the rules but it’s hard to ignore the irony,” he wrote. Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu is a festival celebrated mostly in the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam, marking the end of the harvesting season. Magh Bihu celebrations begin with the community feasting on the eve of Makar Sankranti, called “uruka”, around hut-like structures called “meji” or ‘bhela ghar” — made of bamboo and straw. On the next morning of Magh Bihu, people burn the meji after a holy bath and pray before it. This is one of the three Bihus, known for feasting and merry-making as the granaries become abundant with paddy harvest. Municipal body elections are also likely to be held in February. Even as political circles were speculating that the urban local body polls in the state may be deferred amid Covid scare, the EC’s decision to conduct the assembly polls in several states in February-March may not change the previous planning of holding local body elections in the state on time. Under such circumstances, opposition parties and political leaders, pitching ethno-regional lines, have come down heavily on the BJP-led state government for not giving ample relaxations to celebrate Magh Bihu, for which preparations are in full swing. Firebrand peasant leader and Sivasagar MLA Akhil Gogoi has threatened to violate Covid restrictions on Magh Bihu. He criticised chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for giving relaxations in night curfew on December 31 night to celebrate the New Year celebration but not in the traditional fest Magh Bihu. “The restrictions imposed by the Assam government on Magh Bihu is not acceptable. By giving relaxation on December 31 night, New Year celebrations were allowed. The government also went soft on Covid curbs on New Year’s Day. But our very own cultural festivals face the attack,” said Akhil. As night curfew is on in the state from 10 pm to 6 am, Akhil said it will spoil the uruka night as well as the tradition of burning of meji early morning on Magh Bihu. “If New Year and puja can be celebrated without worry, why restrict our cultural festivals?” Akhil questioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/gaurav-akhil-question-stricter-curbs-for-bihu/articleshow/88798530.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Assam to encourage home isolation for Covid patients||GUWAHATI: The Assam health department has asked district authorities to encourage Covid-19 patients to stay in home isolation in the third wave. As Omicron may propel the number of positive cases within weeks, officials in the health department said home isolation will be encouraged this time unlike the previous two waves. Though the severity of the disease has been moderate in the third wave so far and only one fatality was reported on Sunday, the positivity rate spiralled to 6.48% from 3.73% on Saturday. In Kamrup (Metro), the positivity rate almost doubled to 11.01% on Sunday from 6.47% on Saturday. On Sunday, daily cases stood at 988 from 15,238 tests. However, Kamrup (Metro) that covers Guwahati, detected 490 or about 50% of the total cases reported on Sunday. “The general guideline is that we will have to allow home isolation in a very well-controlled and positive manner. It will not be a restrictive one but a facilitative one this time,” National Health Mission, Assam, director Dr Lakshmanan S told TOI here on Sunday. “Lots of patients are already in home isolation. District-level coordination or reporting on time is going to be the key. The strategy is to keep the hospital beds for serious patients,” he added. While in the previous two waves, all positive patients were encouraged to get admitted in Covid care centres or hospitals, whenever required, the faster spread of Omicron and rapid rise in daily cases has compelled the health department to rethink its policy. Under 19 police stations in Kamrup (Metro), as many teams have been constituted to take stock of patients in home isolation. Till Sunday, there were 1,690 active cases in Kamrup (Metro). Of these, 1,292 patients (76%) are in home isolation, while 398 are in hospitals and the Sarusajai Covid care centre. Sources said considering the rise in the number of cases in greater Guwahati, the second Covid care centre in the city will be reactivated soon. State health minister Keshab Mahanta recently told the media that under the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital managed units, 1,503 beds were ready. However, considering the spiralling caseload in Kamrup (Metro), where over 2,500 cases have been detected in the last 10 days, a crisis of hospital beds is imminent, if the number of symptomatic patients go up. “Districts with bigger district headquarters towns are showing higher caseload, as expected. These include Kamrup, Jorhat, Cachar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Sonitpur. The riverine island district of Majuli had reported only two Covid cases in the last 10 days till Sunday,” a health department official said. The state health department, in its SOP issued late on Saturday evening, stated that patients under home isolation will stand discharged and end isolation after at least seven days from testing positive, if there has been no fever for three successive days and they shall continue wearing masks. However, they will continue to be under home quarantine for seven more days. “There is no need for re-testing after the home isolation period is over,” it clarified.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-to-encourage-home-isolation-for-covid-patients/articleshow/88798531.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The day saw 236 new Covid-19 cases, the highest in seven months, taking the tally of active cases to 979 in the district. However, the recovery rate has dropped below 95%. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “The number of Covid-19 cases is rapidly increasing and the active cases in the district are likely to cross the 1,000 mark on Monday. To prevent further spread of the virus, we will have to ensure that hotels, restaurants and theatres operate at 50% capacity. Gymnasiums will be shut down. No public event will be allowed to take place. Detailed orders will be issued in this regard. Strict action will be taken against those found violating the Covid-19 protocol.” While not surprised by the decision, president of the Agra Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association Ramesh Wadhwa said they are yet to recover from the losses suffered due to the first and second wave of Covid-19. Around 5 lakh people are associated with the tourism industry in Agra. “With orders of operating at 50% capacity, hotel and restaurant owners will have no option but to curtail 50% of the workforce,” said Wadhwa. He appealed to the government to consider the difficulties and financial distress the industry is facing for the past two years and help by offering concessions and compensation. A gym owner, Manjeet Singh said, “We are following all the required Covid-19 precautions. We are willing to operate with some restrictions but it is unfair to shut down the gymnasiums. Most gym owners have run up debts. Government should either provide us with some monetary assistance or allow us to operate with the required preventive measures.” In the past 48 hours, 407 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district. On Sunday, Rajya Sabha MP Haridwar Dubey tested Covid-19 positive for the second time. Earlier, he had tested positive in April. He is fully vaccinated. He has been referred to Delhi for treatment.  Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr AK Srivastava said, “Most of the 236 people who tested positive in the past 24 hours are asymptomatic. Swabs of their family members and close contacts have been collected for the RT-PCR test.” The cause of concern is the drop in recovery rate from 98.1% on January 1 to 94.62% in just nine days. On Sunday, the sample positivity rate in Agra increased to 1.17%, he added. Since March 2, 2020, as many as 26,761 people have tested positive in Agra district. Of these, 25,323 recovered while 458 people succumbed to the virus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/gyms-to-be-closed-hotels-to-run-at-50-capacity-in-agra/articleshow/88798532.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Sangli grape farmers fix MSP for grapes & raisins||Kolhapur: After Nashik, the grape farmers in the Sangli district have now fixed the prices of grapes and raisins based on the quality grade, ensuring at least 10% profit over the expenses made.For export quality, the farmers would sell grapes at over Rs 85 per kg, while grapes sold in Indian markets would cost around Rs 35 to Rs 55 per kg. Similarly, raisins would cost somewhere around Rs 80 to Rs 250 per kg. Like several other fruit crops, the price of the grapes was also decided by the traders. However, in the past few years, despite the soaring expenses, the prices at which traders were purchasing the grapes from the farmers was much low. A huge investment of around Rs 4 lakh per acre is required for growing grapes.Chandrakant Landge, the divisional head of Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Utpadak Sangh - an association of the grape growers, said, “The farmers have taken a historic decision. Since the deregulation of the fruits, the grape farmers could not fetch a good price for their produce. Most of the time, they were even cheated by the traders. We have also decided to form village-level committees that will serve as pressure groups to ensure that the traders do not force the farmers to sell their grapes at a price lower than the fixed price. It is for the first time the grape farmers are united and making some efforts to ensure grape farming survives.”Sangli district is known for raisin production. The raisins, unlike grapes, are sold at the market committees. However, the raisin producers are cheated by the traders. “We have made it mandatory for the traders to make a payment to the farmers within 21 days after the auction. Earlier, the farmers were not paid for months. Also, we are making efforts to set up a raisin board for marketing the raisins and making new markets available to the raisin producers,” said Landge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/sangli-grape-farmers-fix-msp-for-grapes-raisins/articleshow/88798536.cms||---

The fruit and vegetable crops are facing a threat of infestation by pests due to the dip in the mercury levels as dew makes the leaves and fruits easy targets.Mayur Sutar, agriculture adviser of the Gramin Krushi Mausam Seva, said, “Farmers have been asked to use biological insecticides to get rid of the pest attacks, which are in the initial stage. If the temperature dips below 10 degrees celsius it will be a major concern. The leaves and stocks of fruit and vegetables are susceptible to attacks by pests.”On Sunday, Kolhapur reported a minimum temperature of 17 degrees celsius and it is expected to dip to 14 degrees celsius by Wednesday. Also, people going out for walks in the evenings have restrained themselves at home mainly because of the foggy conditions, which not just block visibility, but also cause breathing problems.Meanwhile, in Sangli district, grapes, which are in maturing stage, are getting attacked by the bats. Manojkumar Vetal, Sangli district agriculture superintendent, said, “The bats like juicy grape berries. They come at night and attack the vineyards. We have advised the farmers to cover the plants with the nets, which will help save the grapes from damage by the bats.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mercury-to-dip-further-in-kolhapur-dist-fruits-vegetables-face-threat-of-infestation/articleshow/88798539.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Following KDCC poll results, Sena leaders eye Kolhapur North bypoll||Kolhapur: The recently announced results for the election to the Kolhapur District Central Cooperative (KDCC) bank have emboldened the Shiv Sena leaders, who have claimed that the party can win any election if its leaders contest in unison.In the recently held election, Sena made inroads into the cooperative institution for the first time by winning three seats. For the first time since the Maha Vikas Aghadi was formed at the state level, Sena contested alone after Congress and NCP failed to accommodate Sena in the panel.Now, Sena leaders claim they will rethink their earlier stance of letting Congress candidate win in the upcoming Kolhapur North assembly constituency by-polls, the seat which fell vacant after the death of sitting Congress MLA Chandrakant Jadhav. Congress is going to field Jadhav’s wife Jayashri and expects that she will get elected unopposed. Earlier, Sena had supported the idea, but now, since they have been sidelined, they are likely to step in and contest the elections. This, if it happens, will be a headache for the Congress leadership.Rajesh Kshirsagar, Sena leader and former MLA for two terms, said, “We had earlier decided to give a pass to Congress in the bypoll. However, during the KDCC election, the Congress-NCP tied up with the Bharatiya Janata Party. That forced us to part ways and set up another panel. In the changed circumstances, we may decide to contest the bypoll if our party president Uddhav Thackeray gives a green light.”The Congress is expecting that even if the election is held, Jayashri will win it riding on the emotional wave which is generally observed during any bypoll effected due to demise of the sitting legislator. Kshirsagar, who will be the first choice of the Sena if the party decides to get into the fray, said his party had helped Congress and NCP win every election since MVA came to power. “We were back-stabbed by Congress and NCP. Now if we contest in unison, keeping our internal differences at bay, then despite any factor, we will win the Kolhapur North seat,” Kshirsagar said.No senior Congress leader has come up with a counter to Kshirsagar. However, it is learnt that they will make a formal appeal to all parties in coming days to elect Jayashri unopposed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/following-kdcc-poll-results-sena-leaders-eye-kolhapur-north-bypoll/articleshow/88798540.cms||---

The cow’s leg had to be amputated following an attack by stray dogs in 2019. The farmer and veterinarians had almost given up hope of saving the cow.“In fact, there was a suggestion from some to sell the cow for slaughter. But all our family members were attached to this docile Vechur cow, a rare indigenous variety. So we accepted the alternative suggestion of the veterinarians for amputation,” said K V Davies, the cow’s owner.According to experts at the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, where the surgery was performed, the cow’s leg had to be amputated well above the hoof and below the hock joint.The farmer’s family had a tough time supporting the cow in the post-operative period as it could not even stand up. Surgeons had retained the viable part of the leg, and thick padding was inserted below the amputated portion, enhancing possibilities of putting an artificial limb.However, the spread of Covid-19 became a major roadblock in the explorations for putting an artificial limb. The development of an artificial limb suited for the cow was also a challenge in Kerala.Finally, officials of KIT-CAT Orthotics and Prosthetics Centre in Thrissur volunteered to produce an artificial limb and try it on an experimental basis on the cow. The artificial limb has been attached with support above the hock joint, said Susanth of KIT-CAT. Even though the cow had initially tried to get rid of the artificial limb by shaking the leg, it has now accepted it and is walking on it in a near-normal manner. “The veterinarians have told us that the cow can even conceive and deliver after it fully adjusts with the artificial limb,” said Davies, who is also the CPM local secretary in Manalur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/injured-cow-gets-artificial-limb/articleshow/88798542.cms||T Ramavarman

On Sunday, she said that SilverLine project will cause ecological disaster like the one witnessed in Maharashtra due to the construction of Konkan Railway project that had blocked the natural flow of river Savitri. “No study has been done to gauge the ecological impact of this project. No approval has been secured from the national green tribunal and even the Centre has not given permission, yet, for the project. I appeal to Pinarayi Vijayan with folded hands – I heard he is suffering from a serious illness – that he should save himself and the people. He can really review the project and improve the present railway system by raising the issue of privatization of Indian railway,” she said. Patkar said that those ruling the country have failed to understand the value of natural resources. “We have lost lakhs of sisters and brothers due to the lack of oxygen and yet the rulers in our country fail to understand the value of natural resources for people’s life and livelihood. That’s why we have to stand up wherever questions are raised, with confidence and courage. This includes K-Rail as well,” she added. Patkar will reach Kozhikode on Monday to visit places, where survey stones were placed, as part of social impact assessment. She said that Kerala too would experience flooding, just like what happened in many districts of Maharashtra after the construction of Konkan Railway line. “This beautiful and bountiful state has faced floods; and Kerala was a place we never thought would be flood-prone. But, it is certain that Kerala now has to look at every single decision related to development projects otherwise it will not only be flood-prone but also destruction-prone as well,” said the activist. She criticized inefficient planning and pointed out how projects must move forward after a proper plan that includes a benefit-cost ratio, since the flood-prone state needs to be careful while implementing such mega projects. Patkar later met the mothers of endosulfan victims from Kasaragod. She said the issues posed by endosulfan has reached a critical stage and she urged the mothers to file an affidavit in court since the grievances are related to one’s right to life.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/please-review-silverline-medha-tells-government/articleshow/88798544.cms||---

Speaking to a TV channel on Sunday, the actor said that incurring a huge debt over the project might bankrupt the state and there would be no support from monetary agencies in future.There are many people without homes in Kerala. They don’t even get food. Let’s resolve their issues before taking up ambitious projects. There are reports that the existing rail system can be improved by spending only Rs 10,000 crore. So, spending over Rs 1 lakh crore for SilverLine would lead to a financial crisis, he added.Political opposition towards the project might be due to the fact that they can’t squeeze money out of this project because they are not the ones in power. “Only a few people will depend on the high-speed rail network. A majority will not come under the purview of the project. So the project is not a necessity,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/provide-basic-amenities-before-taking-up-mega-projects/articleshow/88798545.cms||---

The vessel commenced its third sea trials after two successive high profile visits – the President and the Vice-President of India – within a span of less than two weeks. Both dignitaries have reviewed the progress of the project and expressed satisfaction.The vessel, which is under construction at Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL), has already undergone two successful sea trials through which the stakeholders have gained adequate confidence in the ship’s abilities.During the latest trials, the vessel will undertake complex manoeuvres to establish specific readings of how it performs in various conditions. Scientists from the naval science and technological laboratory, a DRDO laboratory based at Visakhapatnam, would also be embarked during the trials. In addition, various sensor suites of the ship would also be tested. Officials of CSL, Navy and various other stakeholders are on board the ship.While the maiden sea trials in August last year were to establish propulsion, navigational suite and basic operations, the second sea trial later in October-November witnessed the ship being put through its paces in terms of various machinery trials and flight trials. The ship in fact was out for 10 days proving its sustenance in the second sortie. Various seamanship evolutions were also successfully cleared during the second sortie. The IAC is considered a shining example of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and 76% of the equipment is indigenously procured. The ship has been able to carry out basic flying operations during its first trials. The ship would operate a mix of MiG-29K fighter aircraft and various helicopters, ranging from the Kamov 31 Air Early Warning helicopters, the soon to be inducted MH-60R multi-role helicopters and the indigenously developed Advanced Light Helicopter MK III.“Despite surging Covid cases in the country and the resultant challenges, the combined teams from multiple organizations associated with the project, are upbeat and committed to meet the timelines,” said a Navy statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/iac-sets-sail-for-third-sea-trials/articleshow/88798547.cms||---
