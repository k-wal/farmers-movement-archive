---||India||2 Pakistanis among 3 Jaish terrorists killed in Srinagar||SRINAGAR: Two Pakistani terrorists of Jaish-e-Mohammed and one of its Kashmiri hands involved in the December 13 attack on a police bus in Srinagar’s Zewan were gunned down early on Friday after an overnight shootout at Pantha Chowk in the J&K capital. Three policemen and a CRPF personnel were wounded in the operation. Kashmir range IGP Vijay Kumar said the slain JeM terrorist Suhail Ahmed Rather of Pampore in Pulwama district had played an active role in the Zewan bus attack that left three policemen dead and 14 wounded. The identity of the two Pakistanis were yet to be ascertained. No one has come forward to claim their bodies. The shootout happened after a joint team of J&K cops and CRPF personnel cordoned off an area in Pantha Chowk based on information that terrorists were holed up there. When the team closed in, the terrorists opened fire and gave away their positions. They were killed in return fire. Praising the security forces for the successful mission on the last day of the year, IGP Kumar said among many challenges in 2021 the peaceful burial of top separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani after his death on September 1 stands out as a major achievement. According to him, the biggest test in 2022 will be tackling “hybrid” or part-time terrorists—like a boy next door who has been radicalised and kept on standby mode or a person not formally part of a terrorist outfit, but assists them in their activities. “After examining CCTV footage, it was observed that young boys aged 17 carry out attacks on security forces. They aren’t categorized anywhere, neither do we have their photographs in police stations,” the IGP said. Police have discovered such activities of nearly two dozen youngsters in 2021, he said, though politicians disapprove of the term “hybrid” terrorists. The No. 2 challenge will be prevent policemen from becoming soft targets. “Terrorists attack unarmed policemen. A few were killed when they were coming out of places of worship, some while on their way to markets, or some when they were resting,” he said. The IGP said almost all top “commanders” were among 171 terrorists killed in 2021, while 168 terrorists were currently active in Kashmir and the number of locals and foreign operatives is almost equal. “We have a list of 25 hybrid, uncategorised terrorists.” Besides, 34 civilians were killed in 2021 against 37 last year. “There was no collateral damage during encounters. Not a single civilian was killed in law and order incidents,” the IGP said. Like the J&K Police special investigation team (SIT) that warned people and politicians against making “speculative statements” about the November 15 Hyderpora shootout that left two terrorists and two residents “used as human shields” dead, IGP Kumar said “political leaders should refrain from instigating people by terming police probes as false”. He said families of slain people can demand a probe by NIA, CBI and others if they are dissatisfied with police investigations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-pakistanis-among-3-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-srinagar/articleshow/88623968.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Arsalan Feroz alias Arsalan Soub of Zaldagar in Srinagar’s MR Gunj was taken into custody on the charge of recruiting Kashmiri young men for the terrorist outfit. He’s among at least four people arrested so far following specific intelligence that LeT/TRF commanders Sajjad Gul, Salim Rehmani alias Abu Saad and Saifullah Sajid Jutt had planned violence in J&K and elsewhere in India through radicalised recruits. As part of the conspiracy, they have been enrolling youths for recon of targets, and to ferry arms for LeT and TRF, an NIA statement said.

---||India||Numbers rise but government cautiously optimistic on Omicron effect||NEW DELHI: The swift rise and subsidence of the Omicron wave in South Africa, less mortality due to the variant in countries with higher vaccination coverage, along with current trends in India has led to cautious optimism that the variant could herald progressively weaker strains of the Covid-19 virus, preventing serious disruptions of the economy. Official sources said that while preparations to tend to patients needing hospital care — as a result of a cumulatively higher number of cases — were on, evidence provided by domestic and global studies pointed to India’s expanding vaccination coverage and hybrid immunity delivering a high level of protection against serious disease. The presence of Omicron in genome-sequenced samples in India has crossed 50%, indicating that the variant is rapidly replacing Delta as the dominant strain. Around 80% of Covid cases among international arrivals are of Omicron, pointing to its wide footprint. However, many cases being detected in India were due to contact tracing or testing due to travel plans, underlining that the infections are often asymptomatic. While Omicron is certainly more potent than flus, it is being assessed if it will be the first step towards a milder form of the virus. Official sources said infections may not warrant shutdowns that derail a nascent economic recovery. It is being evaluated if the pandemic is moving towards endemicity — becoming a common, but milder ailment. In South Africa, Omicron cases began to rise around mid-November and came down in a month. Studies of the Omicron variant’s action on human cells show it faces effective “blocks” due to immune response, warding off serious disease. Though Omicron has a high number of spike-protein mutations, they are clustered in three key functional areas of the virus. What Omicron gains in higher “escape” ability, it loses in terms of binding action on protein receptors as compared to Delta. And so while antibody strength is reduced, the Omicron spike is less potent, studies say. “We see that the expected binding to the FCD (Furin cleavage domain) is at best the same as the alpha variant, and significantly less than the Delta variant,” says a recent paper on simulation studies on Omicron in biology pre-print publication BioRxiv. A health ministry study of countries with a high number of cases shows daily deaths are higher in countries with lower vaccine coverage or where the vaccination drive has stalled. The US is recording an average of 1,777 daily deaths and a CFR of 1.54 and its vaccine coverage is 61% of the population. The figures for France with 80% vaccine coverage are better, with 184 daily deaths and 1.29 CFR, even as it records 2 lakh cases a day. Though India’s two-dose coverage, in terms of population, is 42%, its double-dose coverage of eligible adults is 65%, and single shot is 90%. Several western nations are seeing a rise in infections due to a higher number of unvaccinated adults. Russia, for example, has recorded full vaccination of 44% of its population, and is registering 932 daily deaths and a CFR of 2.94. It has a significantly high number of unvaccinated adults.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/numbers-rise-but-government-cautiously-optimistic-on-omicron-effect/articleshow/88624408.cms||Rajeev Deshpande

Top government officials had a high-level meeting with senior functionaries from Apple, where they asked the Tim Cook-led company to develop India as a global sourcing base which would be used to export fully-built products across the world, on similar lines to what is being achieved out of China currently. Apple’s manufacturing in India is miniscule at the moment when compared to its global needs, even as its top production partners, the Taiwanese trio of Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, have set up base in India. On the other hand, China accounts for the majority of production for the company and it is estimated that it sources as much as 95% of its goods from the Dragon Land. Foxconn and Wistron are already manufacturing for Apple in India at a top rate, though the volumes are “near negligible” when compared to what they manufacture in China. The company only makes the iPhone in India currently (the latest iPhone13 is still not made here), a part of which is also exported, though other products from its portfolio are not made here and simply imported. “The meeting with the Apple officials happened recently, where senior members of the government – including a top minister – were present. The government told the company that India is setting up an enabling environment to give a massive push to electronics manufacturing in the country, with a big eye on exports. The enabling environment includes production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes to encourage companies to invest in, and grow, manufacturing in India. Also, capital subsidy plans are being given out, such as the one allotted for kickstarting semiconductor manufacturing where the government has extended a support of $10 billion for those willing to invest,” a top source told TOI. Questions sent to Apple on the matter remained unanswered. Apple had revenues of $3 billion in India in fiscal 2020-21, registering a growth of 68%, though a large part of this turnover came from products which had been imported (largely China) and not made in the country. Sale of India-made products would be very low, thus prompting the government to nudge the company to look at deepening its India manufacturing commitment. The manufacturing potential surely looks large for India. Apple’s global sales revenue in the company’s fiscal year, which ended September 25, 2021, stood at a whopping $365 billion, of which $191 billion came from iPhones, while around $67 billion came from Macbooks and iPads. Wearables such as air pods and watch turned in another $38 billion. The government is understood to be working on a fresh production-linked incentive plan for notebook production in India to encourage Apple and its manufacturing partners show interest. Also in the works is a PLI plan for wearables and hearables, which may help in bringing in production of Apple’s air pods and watches. The government’s seriousness on the issue can be understood from the fact that recently, Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw met leaders of the Indian electronics business, and these included functionaries from Apple and its manufacturing partners. The Minister had assured the industry about the government’s ambitious plans to boost electronics manufacturing, and how it sees the segment grow from the current $75 billion to around $250 billion in the next 5-6 years. “In fact, the industry has been more bullish, and told me that the market may grow to as much as $300 billion with the right enabling environment,” Vaishnaw told TOI. Apple’s manufacturing partners have currently applied for and won the PLI contracts extended for smartphone manufacturing, but not in any other category. It is expected that with a more comprehensive incentive policy for notebooks and a scheme for hearables and wearables, the company may look at making new products (beyond iPhones) inside India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-asks-apple-to-make-goods-worth-50-billion/year-in-india/articleshow/88624558.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||69% of 60+ and 73% of those aged 45-59 fully vaccinated||NEW DELHI: India finished 2021 well short of the target of fully vaccinating the entire adult population by year-end, announced in May. However, over 90% of the target population has received one dose and about 64% have been fully vaccinated as of 7 pm on Friday. Himachal Pradesh is the only state which has fully vaccinated its entire population while Punjab has the smallest proportion of fully-vaccinated population, just over 40%. A total of over 145 crore doses of vaccine have been administered and the Centre said over 16.9 crore doses were lying with the states as of Friday morning. Thus the vaccines supplied to the states (150 crore) or administered by private hospitals adds up to about 86% of the 188 crore doses required to fully vaccinate the total adult population estimated to be about nearly 94 crore. Only 69% of those above 60 years, the most vulnerable population, has been fully vaccinated. Almost 73% of those in the 45 to 59 age group have been fully vaccinated, while a little over 55% of the 18-44 age group has received both shots. Among health workers, who constituted the first priority group to get the vaccines, 97 lakh have been fully vaccinated, while just over 1 crore have received one dose. Among frontline workers, 1.8 crore have received the first dose and about 1.7 crore have been fully vaccinated. Barring Bihar, Punjab and Jharkhand, all states have administered the first dose to well over 80% of the population over 18 years. Punjab, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh have not fully vaccinated even half the eligible population. In the South, Tamil Nadu continues to be the laggard state, where just 86% have got the first shot and only 58% have been fully vaccinated. Serum Institute’s Covishield accounts for 128.9 crore doses or about 89%, while Covaxin accounts for 15.7 crore (11%), other vaccines having made a negligible contribution so far. The demand for vaccines is likely to shoot up with children to be vaccinated from January 3 and booster doses to be administered from January 10.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/69-of-60-and-73-of-those-aged-45-59-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/88624614.cms||Rema Nagarajan

The other perfume trader under the IT scanner has been identified as Mohammed Yaqood. The IT searches come close on the heels of the raids by the GST Intelligence on perfume trader Piyush Jain in Kanpur and Kannauj, where cash worth Rs 198 crore was recovered in the past few days apart from several kilograms of gold and sandalwood oil. The Friday raids began at around 7 am when IT teams with police backup reached Pushpraj Jain’s Chhipaiti house when the MLC and his family were present. The raids came hours before SP president Akhilesh Yadav was to address a press conference in Kannauj. According to sources, the IT team conducted searches at nine places including Pushpraj Jain’s house and office in Kannauj. This apart, premises of the two traders in Lucknow and Kanpur were also being searched. Reports said the raids were underway at almost all the locations till the time of filing this report late on Friday evening. As per the initial information, the raids were initiated on the charges of tax evasion. A senior official privy to the investigation said in Kannauj, searches were under way at four locations of Yaqub and two locations of Pushpraj; in Lucknow, raids were conducted at three locations associated with the two traders. Pushparaj Jain, 60, is co-owner of Pragati Aroma Oil Distillers Pvt Ltd. The perfume business was started by his father Sawailal Jain in the 1950s. Pushparaj, with the help of three brothers, has expanded it to Mumbai and even abroad. In 2016, Akhilesh Yadav gave him the ticket to the upper house. He won unopposed from Etawah-Farrukhabad and his tenure will last in March 2022. Recently, Pushparaj Jain hogged the limelight by launching the range of ‘Samajwadi perfume’ on November 9.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-t-raid-on-up-trader-who-is-also-sp-mlc/articleshow/88624913.cms||Faiz Siddiqui

On December 21, the I-T department conducted country-wide search and seizure operations on certain foreign-controlled mobile communication and mobile handset manufacturing companies, and people linked to them. Several premises in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan, Delhi and NCR were covered in the operation. “The search revealed that two major companies have made remittance in the nature of royalty, to and on behalf of its group companies located abroad, which aggregates to over Rs 5,500 crore. The claim of such expenses does not seem to be appropriate in light of the facts and evidence gathered during the search,” the I-T department said without naming the Chinese mobile manufacturers but sources confirmed the names. Xiaomi and Oppo did not comment on the issue. “The search operation has also brought out the modus operandi of purchase of the components for manufacturing of mobile handsets. It is gathered that both these companies had not complied with the regulatory mandate prescribed under the Income-tax Act, 1961 for disclosure of transactions with associated enterprises. Such lapse makes them liable for penal action under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the quantum of which could be in the range of more than Rs 1,000 crore,” the tax department said, adding: “Evidence with regard to the inflation of expenses, payments on behalf of the associated enterprises, etc. have also been noticed..."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/xiaomi-oppo-face-rs-1000-crore-fine-for-i-t-norms-violations/articleshow/88624990.cms||---

Those questioning the searches, I want to ask them... Did the agencies come empty handed? No. It means the inputs provided were correct,” Sitharaman said when asked about the tax raids. She said it was the duty of the former UP CM to condemn such acts of tax evasion and not question the professionalism of investigation agencies. “He should not be raising doubts about the professionalism of the enforcement agencies, which have gone there and proven that house had... the height of the wall is the height of the cash. This is proof that the law enforcement agencies are doing the right work, they are catching the evaders,” said Sitharaman as she launched an all out attack and mounted a strong defence of the raids. She said common people do not keep such huge amounts of cash and gold. During investigations, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) had unearthed cash worth Rs 197.49 crore, 23 kg of gold and other high-value goods from two premises — of Odochem Industries, Kannauj, a manufacturer of perfumery compounds, and its proprietor Peeyush Jain. Former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav had claimed that the enforcement agencies had raided the wrong man and had alleged links with BJP. “How does he know? Does he know them so well? How does he knows whose money is kept there? Is he a partner? If he so sure to say it is BJP’s money, how is he so sure?” asked Sitharaman. “I am saying it is not BJP’s money. He (Jain) has been caught red handed, maybe he is his partner, friend I don’t know… That is why the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is so shaken,” said the FM. The income tax authorities on Friday also conducted searches at multiple premises of perfume traders in Kanpur and Kannauj, and that of SP MLC Pushpraj Jain. “Today when income tax raids are taking place … information is there actionable intelligence is there that is why they have gone there. They have gone there after getting some information about this sector across the country... they are getting unconnected material from here,” the FM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finance-minister-says-akhilesh-yadav-shaken-by-tax-raids-defends-agencies/articleshow/88625083.cms||---

The health ministry also stressed that any person with fever, with or without other symptoms such as headache, sore throat, breathlessness, bodyache, loss of taste or smell, should be considered as a suspected case of Covid-19 and must be immediately isolated, unless proven otherwise by confirmation of another aetiology. In a letter to all states and Union territories, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan underlined the need to upscale testing and fully utilise the existing capacity. A rise in Covid-19 cases accompanied by an increase in positivity rate is being documented in various parts of the country, he said, adding that early testing of suspected patients and their contacts and isolating them expeditiously are key to curbing transmission. The Centre advised states to expedite procurement of necessary testing equipment and set up multiple RAT booths on a 24/7 basis and permit RAT at government and private hospitals, including all districts hospitals and primary healthcare centres. The ministry stressed the need to increase RAT as RT-PCR-based testing leads to delays in confirming diagnosis due to its turnaround time of 5-8 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-any-person-with-fever-covid-suspect-government/articleshow/88625137.cms||---

There are 2014 RT-PCR labs, 941 TrueNat, 132 CBNAAT and 30 others. There are more than 200 manufacturers of RT-PCR test kits while 53 are making rapid antigen kits. A total of seven home-testing RATs should be available soon and daily testing capacity is in excess of 20 lakh, said official sources. Official sources said that the health ministry was working closely with national scientific establishments and the states to ensure that facilties for detection, tracing and medical care are available keeping in mind the lessons learnt from the second wave. States have been asked to ensure the Rs 23,000 crore allotted for upgrade of medical facilities are utilised to the extent possible and beds with oxygen support and those in ICUs are augmented as well as even spread up in urban and semi-urban areas. So far, the need for medical attention in rural areas has been on the lower side. A total of 6,776 crore samples have been tested till December 30 and genome sequencing is being carried out using certain criteria, like all positive foreign arrivals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-centre-prepares-labs-and-hospitals-for-spike/articleshow/88625193.cms||---

The only possible dampener here could be the global semiconductor crunch, though this is also being tackled almost at a war footing. So, be prepared for new electric launches from top makers such as Hyundai, Kia, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, MG Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and BMW, apart from the green two-wheeler brigade of Hero Electric, Ather, Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto, Ola, and Bounce, and three-wheeler maker Altigreen. And the biggest of the draw will be the long-awaited – and highly anticipated -- debut of Tesla in India, even though founder Elon Musk continues to bargain for cuts on import duty for fully-built vehicles while the local companies like Tata Motors and Maruti object. The only notable exception to this green charge will be Maruti, the country’s biggest carmaker, though the company is understood to be working on its plans through the partnership between its Japanese parent Suzuki and compatriot Toyota. Maruti, though, is looking at a strong product offensive in 2022 which will be marked by new SUVs, the highlight of which could be the Jimny, that has long been suspected for an India debut (it had even been showcased at the Greater Noida Auto expo in early 2020). Maruti will also drive in a premium petrol SUV that is being developed in partnership with Toyota in 2022, and will compete with Hyundai Creta. Coming to the electric cars, Hyundai will be leading the pack through its fresh strategy for electrics that will see the company invest Rs 4,000 crore in green technology, and drive in as many as six new vehicles by 2028, the first one being the Ioniq crossover. The company, which already sells the Kona electric SUV but in small numbers due to its relatively-expensive price of Rs 23.7 lakh (ex-showroom), now wants to enter the heart of the market by getting in affordability. “Hyundai’s line-up … will cater to multiple segments, including mass market and mass premium segments. We will introduce the vehicles across different body styles, including SUV body shape as well offer a wide range of models for the customers to choose from,” SS Kim, the company’s India MD & CEO who now returns to Korea, told TOI. Hyundai’s sister company Kia has also started work on launching electrics in India, and is looking at models from its global portfolio as it prepares to launch the first one next year. The company had showcased models such as the Soul and Niro electrics at the 2020 Expo. MG Motor will also be adding to its green fleet where it currently has the ZS SUV. The company has said that it will get an ‘affordable and futuristic’ EV that will be in the Rs 10-15 lakh range. “The new launch will be a global electric crossover vehicle customised for Indian and emerging markets,” Rajeev Chaba, MD of MG Motor India, said. Mahindra has drawn up a comprehensive plan for electrics and so has the other formidable local, Tata Motors. Tata Motors, which perhaps has the most affordable and acceptable range of EVs currently (through Nexon and Tigor EVs), is expected to launch a green version of the Altroz hatch. Mercedes-Benz is planning to drive in the EQS electric luxury, which will be an addition to the EQC that it currently sells here. Volvo will be driving in the XC40 Recharge SUV. On the two-wheelers side, Naveen Munjal’s Hero Electric plans to beef up its portfolio, even as others such as Ather and Ola up the ante. After starting on a strong note, Ola has not managed to keep up with the hype and will be hoping to course correct in terms of production and manufacturing quality. Older two-wheeler players such as Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto, leaders in the petrol category, will also be focusing on greens. Hero Moto’s first electric vehicle will debut in the first quarter of 2022, and Bajaj has also announced a new Rs 300 crore investment plan for electrics. On the commercial vehicles side, companies such as Mahindra and Bangalore-based Altigreen will be expanding and launching new models. Altigreen recently bagged a Rs 75 crore order for supplying 1500 EVs to MoEVing. On the petrol/diesel front, Toyota will launch the Hilux pick-up, while the new Range Rover will also hit the road. Jeep will launch a three-row version of the Compass (called Meridian), while Kia will drive in the Carens MPV, and Skoda the Slavia sedan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-will-be-a-charge-of-suvs-and-electrics-in-2022-tesla-hyundai-kia-mahindra-hero-among-those-to-launch-evs/articleshow/88625253.cms||Pankaj Doval

Of the children available for adoption, only 61 (3%) were categorised as ‘healthy & below two years’ and as many as 1,248 (64%) were put in the ‘special needs’ category. In its quarterly data analysis released on Friday, voluntary organisation — Families of Joy (FoJ) — highlighted that figures collated over December show that the maximum number of healthy children below two years, legally available for adoption in any state, as on date is just about 10. The data is based on figures on children from CARA’s CARINGS database for prospective adoptive parents. FoJ founder Avinash Kumar cautioned that the pandemic has increased the already-long waiting time for the couples. The wait was already two-to-three years for the most sought after category of ‘healthy & below two years’, he said. Comparing data from previous years, Kumar added that it was “shocking that even after the mammoth Covid disaster that orphaned thousands of children, the number of kids legally available for adoption in the CARA pool has actually dropped by end of year to 1,936”. The data also shows that of the total children children in the adoption pool, 463 (24%) healthy children were above two years and 164 (8%) were categorised as sibling-sets. FoJ analysis is reflective of the trends as CARINGS database is dynamic given that those getting adopted keep dropping out of the pool and new children keep get added. FoJ cites data from December 2018 to point that the percentage of children below two years was 11% then. “It was already low but now it is a mere 3%,” says Kumar. On the other hand, the share of children with special needs has gone up — in December 2018, it was 51% and it rose to 56% in 2019 and 60% in 2020. The share for 2021 is around 64%. According to CARA officials, the pandemic period has been a challenging one with the adoption and referral process slowing down.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/36000-couples-in-queue-but-cara-has-1936-kids-report/articleshow/88625272.cms||Ambika Pandit

The staff will increase with the increase in the number of cases. The primary function of the control room is to trace positive cases and their contacts. The control room staff also updates real-time data of Covid cases on a portal which can be accessed by the police and other officials,” MCG joint commissioner (headquarters) Hariom Attri said. He added that the civic body will depute a team of five people to ensure that Covid protocols are followed at the time of cremations or burials.“We are going to ensure proper biomedical waste collection by making provisions for yellow bags in door-to-door collection vehicles. Apart from that, we are going to depute nodal officers to ensure sanitisation in micro-containment zones and coordinate with police and the health department on a regular basis,” additional commissioner Vaishali Sharma told TOI. This was discussed in a recent meeting held between MCG officials and Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav, officials said.Moreover, MCG will also start a mobile health van which will distribute essential medicines and ayurvedic immunity booster kits in all wards. The mobile van will gradually be used for testing symptomatic people, Sharma said. The corporation will also come up with a schedule for biomedical waste collection from Covid-affected homes. Biomedical waste includes used PPE kits, masks, gloves, syringes and tissues or cotton soaked with body fluids or blood.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mcg-to-reactivate-covid-control-room-for-contact-tracing/articleshow/88625317.cms||Vishakha Chaman

This is the highest single-day spike in infections in the past seven months since May 23, when 308 people had tested positive. Gurugram’s case load now stands at 1,82,962. Active cases too saw a 36% jump from Thursday’s 660 to 897 on Friday. Out of these, 886 are recovering at home and 11 in hospitals. Gurugram had 1,049 active cases on May 24, after which the numbers started dipping. Active case figures have seen an uptick this month and have been rising since December 12.  The city has added 1,264 new cases to its tally in December. This means on an average, 40 new cases were added to case load this month, which was nine in November and 22 in June. A total of 5,777 tests were carried out on Friday. The overall positivity rate is 0.6% and the hospitalisation rate is 1.2%. No Covid death was reported on the day. As many as 43 people recovered on the day, bringing the total number of recoveries to 1,81,138. “Less than 2% cases are in hospitals at present. The maximum cases are in home isolation and our teams are calling them to check their status,” Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav said. The health department has asked police to give the “utmost importance” to tracing of primary and secondary contacts of infected persons.  “We need to ensure that the contacts are traced and home isolation patients stay indoors,” he added. Doctors in the city pointed out a general laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as wearing masks in public places, could have contributed to this rise in cases. According to them, the only way to prevent another surge in Covid cases is to follow safety protocols. “Covid cases are likely to continue to rise for the next 15 days. We have been urging people to wear masks in public and maintain social distance, as it is crucial to stopping the spread of the virus. Also, it is very important to get the Covid vaccine at the earliest,” he added. Nearly 430 new cases in HaryanaWith an addition of 427 new Covid cases on Friday, the state has reported 1,156 cases in the past five days. Moreover, as many as 23 new Omicron cases were reported. Notably, Covid numbers have crossed the total count of three previous weeks — from November 28 to December 26. In these three weeks, the state had reported 957 cases and eight deaths. ACS (health) Rajiv Arora said the field staff is monitoring the situation and the state is fully prepared in terms of diagnosis as well as treatment. “Sufficient infrastructure has been put in place. Since our genome sequencing lab has also been operational, hence this will add to our efforts in putting measures in place,” Arora said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/at-280-sharp-jump-in-1-day-cases/articleshow/88625319.cms||Ipsita Pati

However, an official said, the ban on registration of properties owned by the developer or licensee companies has not been lifted. The order was issued on Thursday.RS Batth, district town planner (enforcement), said, “The department has cancelled the licence of the colony after the developer failed to rectify discrepancies despite repeated reminders. The residents didn’t want the authorities to make the ban applicable to those properties which have already been registered. Now, the directorate has allowed the registration of properties owned by residents. However, the ban on the sale and registration by the developer will stay.”The registration of property sales deeds was banned following the cancellation of licence of Ardee City in September. Calling the move unjustified, members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) had approached chief principal secretary DS Dhesi earlier in December and urged them to lift a blanket ban on the registration of their properties.“The authorities’ move to lift the blanket ban on registry imposed in September has come as a huge relief to residents. We had reached out to DTCP officials and the deputy commissioner in a bid to apprise them of our concerns. We also approached local elected representatives, but no step was taken by them. Finally, we met the chief principal secretary and the director of DTCP in Chandigarh on December 2 and raised our concerns on the move to impose a blanket ban on the registry of property sales deeds. It is a New Year gift to all of us,” Praveen Yadav, RWA president of Ardee City. Spread across 209 acres in sectors 51, 52 and 57, the privately developed colony has around 2,500 families who were affected by the authorities’ decision to impose the ban on sales deeds registry. The decision to impose the ban has affected especially those who were planning to purchase the properties. Also, it had created a sense of uncertainty among residents. “The ban on the registry was unjustified. We had to undergo a lot of stress because of the wrongdoing of the builder. The decision taken by the authorities now is a huge relief for all those who had initiated transactions. The pandemic has already inflicted hardship on us and many among us are in need of money,” Chaitali Mandhotra, member, Ardee City RWA.The builder was given three licences in 1995, 1997 and again in 2002 for the project. In 2010, the department received a complaint over the disputed ownership of around 42 acres of land. In September this year, the DTCP cancelled the licence of the colony after the developer failed to resolve land disputes and didn’t have complete ownership. According to the DTCP, even after repeated reminders, it has failed to submit the compliance regarding the clear title of 41.8 acres. Moreover, the developer failed to handover the EWS plots earmarked, a DTCP official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/registry-ban-on-ardee-city-residents-sales-deeds-lifted-they-call-it-ny-gift/articleshow/88625320.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Moreover, three of the patients were unvaccinated. So far, Gurugram has reported 33 Omicron cases so far, of which five are active. Among the 17 cases reported on Friday, 13 have tested negative as of now, while two patients are in home isolation and two are in a quarantine facility. These 17 patients did not have any symptoms and are not among the 2% of the Covid patients whose samples the district is sending as part of its sentinel surveillance. “All 17 patients were asymptomatic. We also found that 14 were fully vaccinated. We have traced 49 contacts of these 17 patients. Nine were found Covid positive, and we have sent their samples for genome sequencing. At present, the city has five active cases of Omicron,” said Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav. “All 17 travellers had travel history to different countries. Most of them had travelled to either the US or the UK. They tested negative at IGI Airport but tested positive when they underwent the second test nearly seven days after they reached the city,” he added. Haryana, meanwhile, reported a total of 26 Omicron cases on Friday. So far, the state has reported 63 Omicron cases, of which 23 are active. “Covid-19 is still a threat to those who are unvaccinated. The new variant, Omicron, is more infectious than delta. Vaccines, however, can not completely block you from the infection. However, it helps in preventing severe symptoms and hospitalisation," said Dr Arunesh Kumar, HOD & senior consultant, pulmonology, Paras Hospitals. Moreover, he said, unvaccinated Covid-positive people who did not have any symptoms can have health problems later. "This shows that vaccination is an important weapon against Covid. After the second wave, Omicron has once again proved that vaccination, along with safety precautions, is the only option to save yourself from Covid.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/17-more-omicron-cases-in-city-tally-reaches-33/articleshow/88625322.cms||Ipsita Pati

The authority plans to, eventually, construct a 2.3km-long road but has acquired land for only 800 metres, for now. According to the current plan, the road will begin near Paras Irene, run parallel to Palra Road and end near St Angel’s Global School. “There is no proper road in this area, currently, and several developers and residents have been demanding for a road, so we decided to undertake this work. A completely new road and a roadside drain will get constructed in the area. The total length we are targetting is 2,300 metres. But, at present, we have only got land for 800 metres of the road,” said a senior GMDA official.The road construction will likely cost the authority nearly Rs 5.94 crore and take six months. The project, according to GMDA, would also include relevant road safety furniture along the stretch, such as solar cat eyes, metal delineators, hazard marker signboards, and flexible median markers. At present, GMDA has floated a tender, seeking online bids for the project.According to residents and commuters, the area lacks basic infrastructure, and the road would create a much-needed travel route. Sector 70A is primarily a residential area, housing several gated colonies such as Astaire Gardens, Paras Irene, Pyramid Urban Homes, BPTP Pedestal, and Capital Residences 360.“This master road will help people travelling to and from our area. However, the authority needs to pay attention to the existing roads here, which lack street lights or have obstructions such as electric poles or trees on the carriageways. Unless this new road is without such problems, it will not be of much help either,” said Santosh Mishra, a resident of Sector 83, who frequents the area to visit his parents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gmda-to-build-800m-long-road-drain-near-sec-70a-in-6-months/articleshow/88625324.cms||Sakshi Dayal

As per Section 7A of the Act, registration of sale deed of a plot having a size of less than 1 acre is not allowed without a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the DTCP.Recently, a survey was conducted in and around Farukhnagar, and several illegal colonies which have come up were identified. Four illegal colonies in Farrukhnagar and Sultanpur spread over 20 acres of prime land were issued notices on Thursday. The authorities will soon launch a demolition drive in the area and clear the land.District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said, “In recent months, as the demolition drive was halted due to various court orders, illegal colonies have come up in the outskirts. Through the notices, the department directed the builders to explain the situation within 7 days, failing which demolition will be carried out.”“The offenders have carved out illegal colonies on prime agricultural lands in Gurgaon and adjoining areas including Sohna, Farrukhnagar, Pataudi and Bhondsi while the officials were busy with Covid duties,” said another official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/bhondsi-sohna-farrukhnagar-turn-hub-of-illegal-colonies-1k-acres-cleared-of-squatters/articleshow/88625325.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

The outfits, under the banner of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, also announced a ‘reward’ of Rs 22 lakh for any cop who arrests AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, accusing him of making “anti-Hindu” speeches. Buoyed by the success of its campaign against namaz in the open, during which they handed in memorandums regularly to the government, the outfit’s members marched to the deputy commissioner’s office and submitted a petition addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind. Asked about the content of the petition, the outfit said it demanded the termination of the Chhattisgarh government for the “illegal arrest” of the seer. Mahavir Bharadwaj, the Samiti member who was the face of the protest against namaz, said, “We will not tolerate such insults to our saints. He was arrested due to pressure from anti-national elements.” The outfit’s members marched from Rajiv Chowk to the deputy commissioner’s office in which slogans like “Nathuram Godse amar rahe (long live Nathuram Godse)” were raised.  “We all have similar views as Kalicharan Maharaj about the nation, Mahatma Gandhi and Nathuram Godse,” said former district president of BJP Kulbhushan Bharadwaj, who was also among the principal namaz protesters.  “Our country has been in existence for thousands of years. One can be ‘son of the nation’ but how can anyone be declared ‘father of the nation’?” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/outfits-that-led-namaz-protests-in-the-city-hail-godse-in-rally/articleshow/88625327.cms||Bagish Jha

One of the boy’s neighbours, who was arrested on Thursday following a complaint by the 11-year-old’s father, was learnt to have told police that he and his friend took the minor to the forests in Sariska in the first week of September and strangled him to death because they wanted to pocket Rs 4.5 lakh he had stolen from home. A police team was sent to the spot mentioned by the arrested neighbour — Aarif (21) — and the boy’s body was recovered. On August 24, the boy — a Class 6 student — had left his home in Pingawan for tuitions but did not return till late night. The boy’s family searched for him for four days and approached the police to lodge a missing person’s complaint on August 28. Two months later, when the police had failed to make much headway into the case, the boy’s father, Rahish Khan, approached the cops once again, this time with a complaint of kidnapping. He told the police he suspected two of his neighbours — Aarif and Sonu (20) — to have kidnapped his son. After conducting an investigation, the police arrested Aarif from his house on Thursday. DSP Shamsher Singh said Aarif had told the investigators that he and his friend Sonu had come to know that the boy’s father — a truck driver — had recently won Rs 4.5 lakh from some scheme and had brought the money home. They allegedly persuaded the boy — the eldest of three siblings — to steal Rs 50,000 and spent the money on shopping and food. “The two manipulated the boy to steal the remaining money too. When he did so, Aarif and Sonu took him to Gurgaon and from there to Bahadurgarh. After a few days, Sonu returned home, but Aarif took the minor boy to Haridwar,” DSP Singh said. The two spent a few days in Haridwar and called Sonu to meet them again in Bahadurgarh. Sonu, the police said, took his brother’s car to Bahadurgarh, from where the three left for Sariska. “After crossing Alwar, they stopped at a dhaba for tea, where they hatched the plan to kill the boy and take all the money,” the senior officer said. “The boy was taken to the forests and strangled to death.” After recovering the body, the police are now questioning Aarif on the money they had pocketed. The other accused, Sonu, is on the run. “We are trying to find out if somebody else is involved in the crime,” Singh said. Aarif was produced in court and remanded in three days’ police custody. The police have now added the murder charge to the FIR filed earlier for kidnapping. “The focus of the case has now changed. The case started with a missing person’s complaint in August. It was then changed to kidnapping and finally murder,” the DSP said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/11-yr-old-missing-from-nuh-since-aug-found-murdered-in-sariska/articleshow/88625329.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Digital training of teachers in model schools restarts||Gurgaon: The education department on Thursday restarted the second phase of the teachers' training programme for the state-run Model Sanskriti Schools, which was stopped abruptly earlier this month amid the uncertainty over school reopening.The department has signed an MoU with a private education technology company, Globus Infocom, to impart digital skills to the teachers and ensure the optimal use of digital devices installed at the schools. While the first phase was completed earlier this month, Omicron concerns and a few other administrative reasons delayed the second, according to the department. Later, from January, the third phase will start. “In this phase, we will cover nearly 52 schools in eight districts, including Hisar, Jind, Bhiwani, Karnal, Kurukshetra. Over 600 teachers will be trained in this phase. Then the third phase will begin in January and last four weeks. If the schools don’t have to close again due to the Omicron surge, we’ll conclude that by the end of January,” said an education department official.In the first phase, nearly 900 teachers from at least 137 schools across Haryana were trained in batches of 40. “The training sessions by experts from Globus Infocom were useful in making the most of digital tools such as digital boards and laboratories,” said Asha Miglani, principal, Model Sanskriti School, Sushant Lok.Globus Infocom CEO Kiran Dham, said, “Digital education has become the pressing need of the times, and the government’s proactive steps to train teachers to adapt to that change is encouraging."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/digital-training-of-teachers-in-model-schools-restarts/articleshow/88625332.cms||---

The company that will eventually be selected will have to build and operate the heliport for 30 years. The company will have to build not just aeronautical, but non-aeronautical and passenger facilities too. While aeronautical facilities include aerodrome control services, airfield lighting, taxiway, helipad, traffic signal, apron, firefighting building and so on, non-aeronautical services mean managing the vehicle parking, cargo, reception area, kitchen and setting up centres for employees. Officials said the Authority would hold a meeting with the interested companies on January 31 and was expected to shortlist the agency by April. “As the project has to be developed through the public-private partnership model, we had been waiting for a go-ahead from the state government. Financial and technical background and expertise of the interested companies would be evaluated before the most suitable one is selected,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of the Authority. The project is estimated to cost Rs 43 crore and will be designed according to the size and specifications of the utility helicopter, Bell 412, and its popular variants. Used extensively by private and commercial operators and by defence forces, Bell 412 is wide enough to accommodate 12 passengers. The heliport has been envisaged as a base for air taxi services to both IGI Airport in Delhi and the upcoming Noida International Airport in Jewar as well as shuttle services to nearby tourist spots. Rajiv Tyagi, the principal general manager, said the parking apron would have the capacity to provide parking space to five helicopters at a time. “The operator will also have to make provisions to allow the movement and parking of MI 172, which is wide enough to hold 26 passengers at a time and is used for emergency operations and for transporting VIPs,” he added. The terminal building, Tyagi said, will be designed to allow the movement of 40 people at a time — 20 alighting from the helicopters and 20 others boarding them. Officials clarified that operations would be allowed only during the day. The heliport will come up on 9.3 acres in Kambakshpur village in Sector 151A. While the Authority will provide the rights to use its land for commercial operations, it will command a share from the revenue. While specifying the terms and conditions in the tender document, the Authority has made it clear that the facility will be named Noida Heliport. A bank guarantee of around Rs 1.3 crore will have to be deposited by the concessionaire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/search-begins-for-firm-to-build-noida-heliport/articleshow/88625334.cms||---
---||Noida||Exam racket: Delhi cop ‘wanted easy money’||Noida: An assistant sub-inspector of police from Delhi and a retired CRPF constable, who were among 18 persons arrested on Thursday for allegedly sharing answer keys to questions of the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (C-TET), have told the cops in Noida they had joined the gang to make some quick money as they were “not being able to make ends meet”.Vikas, the ASI from 2006 batch, and Bhawani Sharma, a retired CRPF constable, would handle the transactions on behalf of the gang, the police said. “Vikas and Sharma would collect the money from the candidates after handing over the answer keys to them. Sustained questioning also revealed that they were not being able to make ends meet and joined hands with Vinay Dahiya (the alleged kingpin of the gang) on a part-time basis,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.The two, according to Singh, had been part of the gang for the past two years or so. Sources said that as an ASI, Vikas would earn Rs 70,000-80,000 a month. “It is very easy to make money through such rackets. These gangs mostly have 4-5 core members and then they involve people who want to earn quick money. Selling a question paper or the answer keys helps them earn about Rs 20-30 lakh in just one night,” Singh said. The police teams from Noida will visit the families of each of the accused to find out more about them and have already contacted banks for the money trail. The cops have also got in touch with their counterparts in Sonipat in an effort to nab the alleged kingpin, Dahiya. “The arrest of Dahiya will reveal a number of things. We hope to nab him soon. At the same time, we also request candidates appearing for competitive exams to not resort to such unfair means,” Singh said. Early on Thursday morning, 18 persons, including five candidates for C-TET, were arrested from a hotel in Sector 71 for allegedly sharing answer keys. The gang would charge Rs 2.5-3 lakh from each candidate for the answers, the police have found. C-TET is held twice every year — July and December. The test is conducted every year to recruit teachers of classes 1 to 8 in government schools.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/exam-racket-delhi-cop-wanted-easy-money/articleshow/88625335.cms||---

In Ghaziabad too, cases doubled to 31 on Friday from just 15 on Thursday.GB Nagar now has 190 active cases, also the maximum in the state, followed by Lucknow (152) and Ghaziabad (111). Out of the active cases, however, only one is undergoing treatment in hospital. In Ghaziabad, seven patients are in hospitals, while 107 are in home isolation. Most of them have a fever, cold, cough and sore throats, while a few have complained of loss of smell or tests.In view of the spike, both districts have ramped up contact tracing. Ghaziabad is tracing 28 contacts of every patient on an average, whereas this figure is 17 in GB Nagar.According to Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta, almost all the infected contacts found on Friday are those who came in contact with a Covid patient. The health departments are anticipating that the infection will spread more rapidly in the coming days and officials have appealed to the public to strictly follow Covid protocols.Ghaziabad has so far received the report of genome sequencing of only two patients after they had already recovered from the infection. Officials said they are sending samples of all new Covid patients in Ghaziabad for sequencing. “At present, it is difficult to say which variant of Covid is spreading in the district. The variant is detected only through genome sequencing and its reports are yet to come. If any case of the Omicron variant is confirmed, the report will be sent from Delhi to Lucknow, and then from the government to the health department,” Gupta said.UP reports 251 casesChief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday urged the people to remain alert and cautious as UP reported 251 cases on Friday. He reiterated the importance of Covid prevention protocol to check the spread of the virus. The CM said, “Coronavirus cannot harm those who strictly follow the prevention protocol. Though the state is ready to fight Covid, it is the duty of every person to stay cautious.”Stating that preparedness on the part of the government was crucial, Yogi said: “Though the daily test positivity rate has been below 0.05%, there is the need to take all steps that help us in fighting the virus.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/new-cases-in-gzb-double-in-a-day/articleshow/88625337.cms||Aditya Dev

We also checked the CCTV cameras and directed the security management of shopping malls and markets to ensure full safety compliance,” Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said.The officer also added that police have been deployed at market places, bus stands and metro stations. “The police are keeping a close watch on people’s movement for safety purposes. The police personnel have also been deployed at different places for women safety,” Elamaran added.Deputy commissioner of police (Noida) Rajesh S said, “There are tight security arrangements all over. We also sent a decoy customer with a weapon to the shopping mall to check on the arrangements.”Police Commissioner Alok Singh has instructed all the station house officers (SHOs) of the respective police station to ensure enforcement of night curfew as well. The UP government had enforced night curfew on December 25, restricting people’s movement from 11 pm to 5 am.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/from-metro-stns-to-malls-ny-revellers-are-on-police-radar/articleshow/88625338.cms||---
---||Noida||Will return to protest if promises are not met, says farmer leader||Noida: Protests are nothing new for Sukhbir Khalifa, the 52-year-old farmer who had been leading the sit-in demonstration outside the Noida Authority’s office for the past 120 days.As the protest was called off on Friday, the farmers’ families served prasad to Khalifa to break the fast, which he had been observing for more than a week. For the farmer leader, this was the second major win after his protest against the Noida Authority’s decision to set up a dumping ground in Sector 123. In 2018, the Authority had planned to set up a landfill in Sector 123 after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed it to stop dumping waste at a site in Sector 54. Several residents’ bodies had started a protest against the decision and Khalifa was at the forefront. The Authority had to eventually backtrack. This time, Khalifa remained on hunger strike for 12 days. He was advised hospitalisation last week itself, but chose to stay put at the protest site.On Tuesday morning, however, he was forced by police and his own supporters to get admitted to the District Hospital. “He was given fluids at the protest site for two days. But when we realised that his health was deteriorating, we decided to take him to a hospital,” said Sudhir Chauhan, one of the protesters.An ex-Armyman who taught wrestling to jawans, Khalifa initially galvanised the local youths and his community against the sale of gutkha and liquor along the main roads around Sarfabad village. “He started an academy where the local youths come for wrestling,” said Subodh Pehalwan, one of the wrestlers. He added that for the past five-six years, Khalifa had even started a movement against dowry. “Those taking dowry were publicly shamed,” he said.A visibly weak Khalifa told TOI he would return to resume the protest if the Authority went back on its promises. “This time, they have approved the demands. But if they are not approved in the board meeting as promised, we are just a call away,” Khalifa said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/will-return-to-protest-if-promises-are-not-met-says-farmer-leader/articleshow/88625340.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Farmers end 4-month abadi land stir as Noida gives roadmap||NOIDA: A protest alike in style to the agitation against the central farm laws ended similarly on Thursday in victory for farmers who had been camping outside the offices of the Noida Authority for 122 days. The Noida Authority agreed to some key demands of the protesting farmers, affiliated to Sukhvir Khalifa’s Bharatiya Kisan Parishad. Two of these demands — increasing abadi land regularisation from 450 square metres to 1,000 square metres and allowing commercial activity on abadi land — will be brought before the Noida Authority board. The Authority is of the view that 250-300 farmers could benefit from the increased regularisation as 25 out of the 81 villages don’t have such claimants and in several other villages that do, the 450 sqm area criteria is not fulfilled. For commercial activity on abadi land, officials said a committee will be constituted whose findings can be taken up at a board meeting. Officials on Friday handed over a two-paper resolution, signed by the deputy collector (V), elaborating on the steps to be taken. Abadi land refers to plots allotted to farmers as part of the compensation package for the land they gave to the Noida Authority. Farmers of 81 villages of Noida from whom land was acquired 1977 onwards, after the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (which gives Noida its name) was formed, were to receive 10% of the compensation as abadi plots. Later, the Authority offered 5% plots, saying the remaining 5% would go into development of roads, drainage, parks, etc. Farmers contend that the land acquisition in the 81 villages was based on a land survey of 1932 and not a fresh one, arguing that along with their agricultural land, residential land too was acquired. After protests, in 2011, the Noida Authority came up with the Abadi Niyamawali 2011 through which it decided to lease back 450 sqm of abadi land to each farmer from whom land was acquired. The farmers, however, said that this was too small a plot size as most families had grown since the acquisition process and so have the properties (hence, the demand for regularisation). The protesting farmers also allege many of them have not received these 5% plots. For such farmers, a survey will be initiated to identify land. Sudhir Chauhan, one of the protesters at the forefront of the agitation, told TOI that while such commercial activity on abadi or leaseback land was allowed earlier, it had been recently stopped and the Noida Authority had been seeking charges from farmers. The resolution says the Authority will apprise the board of this demand. “A committee headed by the ACEO will be constituted in this connection whose meeting will be called soon and the board will be apprised of the commercial activities and the updation,” says the document. ACEO Praveen Mishra, who led the talks with the farmers, told TOI that an agency had been brought in for the survey to identify places where 5% plots can be provided to farmers. “The agency will see whether we have to form a separate cluster. The survey report is expected soon. Not every proposal is required to be brought before the board meeting. The same will be studied on a case to case basis and if the planning department wants, some cases may be brought before the board,” Mishra said. The draft resolution says requests from farmers for 5% plots will be disposed of within six months. The protesting farmers also want villages to be excluded from the ambit of the map policy. “These are traditional properties that have proliferated after families grew bigger. We wanted that the requirement for setbacks around the houses be done away with because the houses have come up adjacent to each other. Further, we demanded that the Authority should not consider the height of the parapet wall and mumty and they should be exempted from the rule specifying a 15-metre height bar,” Chauhan said. The resolution mentions that the demand to measure the height of the property from the plinth level and not from the road level in villages will be “discussed.” The contentious demand of 10% plots instead of 5% will be sent to the state government. The resolution says those farmers who took back their lawsuits following a public appeal by the Noida Authority in 2015 can submit a fresh application, which will be verified and subsequently sent to the state government for consideration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/farmers-end-4-mth-abadi-land-stir-as-noida-gives-roadmap/articleshow/88625341.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Omicron in 55% of Covid positive samples, says BMC survey||MUMBAI: The Omicron variant has been found in 55% of the Covid positive samples that were sequenced recently from the city. A fortnight ago, the variant was present in just 2% of the samples, underlining its rapid spread in the community within days. Despite Omicron’s rise, only 6% had required hospitalisation and vaccination seemed to be effective in curbing severe Covid. On Friday, the state reported four Omicron cases, taking the overall count to 454. The findings of the seventh genome sequencing by BMC is likely to trigger changes in the quarantine and isolation norms of Omicron suspects. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the norm of mandatory hospitalization of Omicron suspects with an international travel history will be amended soon. “If the variant is circulating in the community, there is not much sense in segregating them and keeping them in hospitals. We will be reviewing this shortly,” he said. There are already plans to allow the positive asymptomatic patients to stay in hotels. A total of 376 positive samples were sequenced at the lab in Kasturba Hospital. Of the 376, 282 samples belonged to Mumbai residents. Of the 282 samples, 55% (156 cases) were of Omicron variant, 32% (89) were Delta derivatives and 13% (37) were of Delta variant. The only death reported from the cohort of 282 was of a 60-year-old man who was infected by a Delta derivative. The man also had a history of diabetes and hypertension and had taken the first dose. Dr Sandeep Juneja, dean of TIFR’s school of technology and computer science, tweeted that since these samples were from December 21-22, the ratio of Omicron cases could be upwards of 95% by now. The BMC also analysed all 156 Omicron cases and found that only nine were hospitalised, but none had any major symptoms. Only 17 out of 282 people needed hospitalisation. Of the 17, three had taken only one dose and 10 had taken both doses. From the 282 cohort, 81 people were unvaccinated, but even among them, only four needed hospitalisation. More than one-third of the Covid infections were found in people between 21 and 40 years of age, followed by 41-60 age group (28%) and then senior citizens (20%). State officials said 157 of the Omicron patients have been discharged already.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-survey-finds-omicron-in-55-of-covid-positive-samples/articleshow/88625342.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||At 1.1 lakh, Mumbai records decade’s maximum flat sales||MUMBAI: In 2021, Greater Mumbai recorded the highest apartment sales in a decade with total property registrations of 1.1 lakh flats. This was 70% more than in the previous year and 45% higher than the pre-pandemic year of 2019, said a report. The previous annual high was 80,746 in 2018. The western suburbs (Bandra to Dahisar) were the most prominent market this year, according to property consultancy firm, Knight Frank India. Apartment sales contributed about 53% in this belt followed by the central suburbs with a sales contribution of 31% in 2021. December 2021 also stood out to be the month with the fastest per day registrations in the last five months. In December alone, the Mumbai market recorded registrations of 9,320 units, which is higher by 23% month-on-month (MoM). In comparison to the same period last year (December 2020) that had the lowest stamp duty rate, registrations were recorded to be lower by 52% year-on-year. December 2021 continues to maintain the strong sales momentum that has continued in the absence of any government sops,'' it said. "Notwithstanding, the uncertainty of the Omicron variant, the daily sales rate accelerated towards the latter part of the month. Compared to the daily sales rate of 293 registrations per day in the first twenty days of December, it increased to 314 registrations per day during the remaining 11 days of the month,'' said the report. As much as 83% of the total sales in the city this year were for 1,000 sq ft apartments. Flats up to 500 sq ft contributed 42% of the total registrations closely followed by those in the 500- 1000 sq ft range, which accounted for 41%. The 1,000 sq ft to 2,000 sq ft segment contributed 13% of housing sales. The biggest demand was for flats worth Rs one crore and below. "Properties in price bracket under Rs one crore continue to dominate the market in December 2021 with a contribution of 53% to total sales. Those in the range of Rs one crore to Rs five crore amounted to 42% of the total sales. Shishir Baijal, chairman & MD, Knight Frank India, said, "Despite being the most expensive market in India, factors like lower capital values and decadal low home loan interest rates have made Mumbai more affordable than previous years." Government revenue through stamp duty in December 2021 exceeded that of December 2020. The state collected Rs 738 crore this month, with the stamp duty at 5%, compared to Rs 681 crore in December 2020 when the stamp duty was just 2%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-1-1l-mumbai-records-decades-max-flat-sales/articleshow/88625343.cms||---

---||Mumbai||5 pm to 5 am restrictions at beaches, grounds, parks in Mumbai||MUMBAI: In the wake of an increase in Covid-19 cases, particularly of the Omicron variant, the Mumbai police on Friday issued an order prohibiting people from visiting beaches, open grounds, seafronts, promenades, gardens parks or similar public places between 5 pm and 5 am, starting with immediate effect. The restrictions will apply till January 15. “The city continues to be threatened with Covid-19 pandemic. In light of the increase in cases and emergence of the new Omicron variant, and with a view to prevent danger to human life, health and safety and to curb transmission of the virus, people are prohibited from visiting beaches, open grounds, sea faces, promenades, gardens, parks or similar public places from 5 pm to 5 am,” the order issued by deputy commissioner of police (operations) S Chaitanya said. The BMC has already banned all new year parties or gatherings in Mumbai. The fresh restrictions came a day after the state government issued fresh curbs on social events like weddings, funerals and empowered local authorities to impose additional restrictions beyond Section 144 in public areas which may attract crowds. Senior state officials said that with the rate at which cases in the state are doubling, it was felt more restrictions were needed in cities, especially around the new year celebrations and so local authorities were empowered to take appropriate action. Among other restrictions issued by the state government which will be implemented in Mumbai is the cap on maximum attendance at weddings, gatherings, social and cultural events to 50 people irrespective of whether the event is in a closed or open space. The order also allows only a maximum of 20 persons at funerals. DCP (operations) S Chaitanya issued the order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which came into force from 1 pm on Friday and will be effective till January 15, unless withdrawn earlier. Those flouting the order will attract punishment under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code in addition to the penal provisions under the Epidemic Diseases Act and the National Disaster Management Act, the DCP said in the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/5-pm-to-5-am-restrictions-at-beaches-grounds-parks/articleshow/88625346.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Speeding offences grew 17 times, signal jumping by 100% in Maharashtra in 2 years||MUMBAI: Traffic challans issued for speeding grew 17 times in Maharashtra in two years, data with the state traffic department shows. Around 1.09 lakh speeding challans were issued in January-November 2019 which has surged to over 17 lakh challans in the same period in 2021. Challans for other dangerous violations like signal jumping and lane cutting too have jumped by more than 100%. Police attribute the increase to a modification in their enforcement strategy which involves a greater focus on violations that directly impact the lives of other road users. But experts point out that as long as fines remain unpaid, there is a lesser chance of a behavioral shift among motorists. “Speeding is the greatest causative factor in road crashes globally. Evidence shows that getting hit by a vehicle at 60 kmph increases the chances of death up to 90%,” said Abhimanyu Prakash, an urban designer associated with Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety. "While lowering speed limits and enhanced enforcement are effective tools to lower speeds, they need to be complimented with safer street design. Designing streets that are safe for our most vulnerable road users makes them safe for everyone. Simple measures such as lane narrowing, reclamation of under-utilized road bed space, adding dedicated cycling and bus facilities can be adopted to reduce travel speeds," he said. Transport expert Paresh Rawal said that lane driving discipline was key. "The moment one tries to overtake another vehicle, one ends up speeding and this could result in road crashes,” he said. Police data shows that challans of driving in the wrong direction and drunk driving cases have reduced in January-November 2021 as compared to January-November 2019. But the ground reality is very different. Wrong side driving is rampant in Mumbai, even on the highways. "If motorists are brazenly violating laws, it means there is no fear. The reason there is a high compliance of laws overseas is because an offender knows he cannot get away from paying fines," said Ranjit Gadgil of the non-profit Parisar. The Supreme Court had sent a letter to all states asking them to set a target for compliance of laws, Gadgil added. The law typically provides for higher fines for a second or subsequent offence. But it is unclear if enforcement agencies have been keeping tabs on the number of violations committed per motorist and penalizing accordingly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/signal-jumping-lane-cutting-offences-increase-by-over-100-in-maharashtra/articleshow/88625347.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: I-T raids Samajwadi Party MLC Pushpraj Jain and his relatives||Mumbai: The income-tax (investigation) directorate, Mumbai, conducted searches around 30 premises, including 14 in the city, associated with Samajwadi Party MLC and businessman Pushpraj Jain and his close relatives on Friday. The search at the 30 premises—located at various places in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kolkata, and one each at Orissa and Tamil Nadu--will continue for a few days and I-T officials will collect bank accounts-locker details of Jain and his family members for examination, sources said. Some of the places were searched by Uttar Pradesh’s I-T directorate. The I-T action comes on the heels of the raid on Kanpur-based perfume trader Piyush Jain with Uttar Pradesh assembly elections around the corner. Samajwadi Party is a key political player against the ruling party, BJP, in Uttar Pradesh. Pushpraj is a promoter of Pragati Aroma Oil Distillers Pvt Ltd, which has its registered office on the ground floor of Enterprise Centre building in Vile Parle (E). Besides perfumes, he also has real estate businesses. Registered offices of most of his businesses are in Mumbai and he manages them with the help of his brothers and other close relatives. On Friday morning, I-T officials reached the Vile Parle (E)office and asked the employees to cooperate in the search. A team from the local police station deployed a few personnel outside the office for security. No one from Pushpraj’s family or office employees spoke to the media. A source from Samajwadi Party said that Pushpraj is a key person for mobilization of resources for the party during elections. He is more active in UP and is close to the party’s top leadership. In UP, the government action on Pushpraj Jain and Piyush Jain have become a political issue. Last week, officials of Directorate General of GST Intelligence had recovered Rs 284 ‘unaccounted cash’ at Piyush’s homes in Kanpur and Kannauj. He was arrested on Sunday for evasion of tax and making multiple invoices in the name of fake companies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/i-t-raids-sp-mlc-pushpraj-jain-and-his-relatives/articleshow/88625351.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC gives police 10 days to find woman missing since February||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday said an affidavit in the case of an elderly missing woman with alzheimers filed by a former Kherwadi police station duty officer was “farcical”, and that it only wants the police department to instill confidence of commoners in the police machinery. The HC had on Thursday found the missing complaint to be a “shocking case of police insensitivity” and had called for affidavits from the police on Friday. The court has now directed police to find the woman—missing since February—within 10 days, and posted the matter for January 10, 2022. The vacation bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav came down heavily on the police, observing that on Thursday it was informed that the lady was only uttering ‘Air India’, and in just one day the affidavit now says she was speaking in Bengali. “This shows how insensitive the police officers are, and it is the subordinates, and not diligent officer like the DCP, who are responsible.” Two sons of an ex-Air India employee had petitioned the HC for directions to the police to produce their mother as they said Kherwadi police in Bandra had found her on February 16 but said she left on her own at 8pm. Advocate Shehzad Naqvi said their mother, Uma Shashank Sarkar, 71, went missing on February 13 and on February 14, the sons filed a missing persons’ complaint with the Kasarvadali police at first, and later, on February 22, went to the Kherwadi police station. The HC was informed that the officer was issued a show cause notice on October 6, but no inquiry was conducted. She was, in fact, promoted. Advocate Naqvi said the sons moved court only after they got no help from police. —Swati Deshpande||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-gives-police-10-days-to-find-woman-missing-since-feb/articleshow/88625353.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Khar NYE murder: A year on, family mourns daughter, awaits justice||Mumbai: There will be no New Year celebrations at the Kukreja family’s home. A year ago, on December 31, it was the last time they saw their beloved daughter Jhanvi (19) alive, before she went out to a New Year’s Eve party with her friends in Khar. There, she was allegedly murdered by her childhood friend and another common friend. December 31 was once a day of joy for this family, as they celebrated not only the beginning of a new year, but also Jhanvi’s father, Prakash’s birthday. Now, it only serves as a reminder of the dark day they lost their teenaged daughter. The devastated father has decided not to celebrate his birthday, as it was the last time he was with Jhanvi, who had left home after he cut his birthday cake. “We have had 365 sleepless nights in 2021. We attended all the court hearings to get justice for my daughter, who was killed by her childhood friend Diya Padalkar, on the very first day of the year,” alleged the victim’s mother, Niddhi, who has quit her job to care for her younger daughter, Manya (15). Manya is going to appear for the SSC board exams in this year but is still deeply traumatised by her sister’s murder, said Niddhi, adding that the teenager had undergone several counselling sessions to help process her grief.  Jhanvi was allegedly killed by Diya (18) and their common friend, Shree Jogdhankar (23), during the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. Jhanvi was found on the ground floor, her head had been banged on the metal railing of the building’s staircase repeatedly. Shree is currently in judicial custody, after his bail was rejected, while Diya was granted bail in June. Diya, who was Jhanvi’s neighbour in their Khar building, has since relocated to Andheri. “If Diya is innocent, and has no role in my daughter’s murder, then why did she and her parents relocate?” asked Niddhi, adding, “She is out on bail and has tried to go out of the city with her family and applied to the court for permission in November.” The chargesheet stated that after the murder, Diya stayed back in the house of the party host. She had a cut lip but claimed that she did not know how she suffered the injury. Her hairband, earrings, and footwear were allegedly found at the crime scene. While there were no eye-witnesses to the incident, police said they have very strong circumstantial, forensic and technical evidence to link the duo to the crime. Also part of the chargesheet, is medical evidence that showed that Jhanvi suffered 48 injuries from head to toe and the majority of them were grave. Blood samples collected from the spot, found on Shree’s shirt and on the bed where Diya slept after the incident, all matched with the victim. Devastated as the family is, they have decided to commemorate Jhanvi’s life by sponsoring the education of their domestic worker’s child. “We have decided to take care of the education of our domestic worker’s child in remembrance of our daughter, who was involved in such social intiatives,” said Niddhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/khar-nye-murder-a-year-on-family-mourns-daughter-awaits-justice/articleshow/88625354.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Strong placements attract many to technical courses||Mumbai: With lucrative employment options and introduction of new-age courses, engineering had more takers this year. The vacancies in BE/BTech courses in the state this year dropped to 36% from last year’s 44%. Of the 40,506 MBA seats, only a little over 10% were vacant, while Pharmacy had less than 10% vacancies. MBA had more than 30% vacancies last year. Barring architecture and MTech, technical courses seemed to be the flavour this admission season, revealed data from the state’s CET cell.“Engineering colleges are witnessing the best placement season this year. The average salaries, highest packages offered have all gone up. The bulk placement offers given by IT companies in service and product sector has ensured that students with a fair knowledge of programming language have also landed a job,” said Sandip Meshram, associate professor at College of Engineering Pune, adding that many students in civil and other core subjects had to opt for IT jobs because core companies did not offer jobs. Management courses have seen an increase in demand with more students aspiring to get a B-School degree. “The EWS category is enabling more students from poorer economic backgrounds to also opt for MBA. The intake capacity in sought-after colleges have gone up too,” said Rajesh Srivastava, professor and head of department, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies and Research. He said that many who were retrenched on account of the pandemic, may have decided to complete their higher studies.Sathiyanarayanan L, vice-principal at Bharati Vidyapeeth University Poona College of Pharmacy said that the trend of more students opting for pharmacy began about five years ago, but there has been a drastic shift since the pandemic started. “Covid-19 and the subsequent hunt for vaccines brought awareness about the field. Medical seats are fewer, expensive and it takes a long time to finish the course. Moreover, with many multinational and other regulatory, pharmacovigilance-related companies coming in, placements are also good,” said Sathiyanarayanan.However, with admissions to MBBS, BDS and other allied health science courses delayed, engineering and pharmacy are likely to see some withdrawals as several students have taken admissions in these programmes to prevent loss of a year, said Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/strong-placements-attract-many-to-technical-courses/articleshow/88625355.cms||Yogita Rao

The BJP secured 11 of the 19 seats while the Maha Vikas Aghadi won eight seats. Rane’s son, Nitesh Rane, who is a BJP MLA, is accused in an attempt to murder case. The Sindhudurg police is investigating Nitesh’s role in connection with an assault on Shiv Sena functionary Santosh Parab on December 18. Parab is a close associate of Sindhudurg District Co-operative Bank chairperson Satish Sawant, who was defeated by Nitesh in the 2019 assembly elections. Sawant also lost the bank elections whose results were declared on Friday. Rane has been denied bail by the district court, and according to his lawyers he will be approaching the Bombay High Court. The BJP elated by the victory, accused the MVA of misusing police, resorting to threats to win the elections. “Misuse of government machinery, police terror but the people disregarded all of this and chose democracy,” said opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rane-wins-sindhudurg-coop-bank-polls-for-bjp/articleshow/88625357.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 transpersons convicted, 1 acquitted in 2016 murder case||Mumbai: The Mumbai sessions court recently convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment two transgender persons, including a 21-year-old, for murder of a man at Churchgate station in January 2016, and acquitted a third who had tried to interevene and stop the assault. “It is true that transgender persons are given dignity and right to live but it is nowhere permitted by the Constitution to breach or encroach on the rightful life of other persons… In this particular case, these transgenders encroached on the rights of the deceased Manda Kale, who succumbed to injury due to the brutal assault of these transgenders,” said the judgement by additional sessions judge U J More. The accused had denied the charge and defence lawyer for the acquitted accused said that the victim had tried to molest and tease one transgender after which a dispute occurred. The trial court, however, noted that such defence was not raised earlier and except bare words, nothing is on record, nor was a submission by one of the convicted accused that he was a man with children and not a transgender person. The court cited the World Health Organisation which said ‘transgender’ is an umbrella term that includes person whose sense of gender does not match with gender assigned to them at birth. The court on December 24, said there was direct eyewitness evidence of four hawkers who saw the accused at 11 pm assaulting the man with their fists and legs, kicking him all over and also lifting and throwing him down, causing head injury. There was CCTV footage that supported the prosecution’s case of brutal assault, said the verdict. Iqbal Solkar, the public prosecutor who examined 19 prosecution witnesses, said after the assault, the victim was left lying on the spot and was initially taken to the public St George hospital, brought home and later taken by his wife to another public hospital where he was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit as his intestine had ruptured. He succumbed to his injuries on January 8, four days after the assault, and police registered it as a murder case against three accused. The first two accused who were convicted have been in prison since their arrest in 2016, while the third was granted bail. Defence lawyers questioned the conduct and credibility of the four eye-witnesses and said one of them was running an illegal road side eatery, and also questioned why they never intervened in the fight if he claims to have witnessed it. But the court held, “non intervention of these eyewitnesses” cannot disprove the prosecution case. To defence arguments that the victim had a drinking habit, the judge said “that cannot permit any person to kill him.” Besides the post-mortem report nowhere said alcohol consumption was the cause of death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/16-murder-2-transpersons-convicted-1-acquitted/articleshow/88625358.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB challenges bail for Nawab Malik son-in-law||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Friday filed an appeal in the Bombay high court seeking cancellation of bail granted to Sameer Khan, son-in-law of NCP minister and spokesperson Nawab Malik. The HC is yet to hear the case. The special court trying cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act had granted Khan bail on September 27. The court while granting him bail relied on the fact that prima facie there was no evidence of a drugs syndicate except for the statement of Khan and the co-accused involved in the case. Sameer Khan was arrested by NCB on January 13, 2021 after the NCB claimed that he had conspired to procure, sell, purchase and transport 194.6 kg of ganja. Khan and five others were charged for dealing with commercial quantities of the drug. The court pointed out that based on the CA (chemical analyzers) report, prima facie the charge for commercial quantity cannot be made out. The court said 11 out of 18 samples tested negative for cannabis. The NCB in its appeal has said that if the special judge had perused the chemical report in right perspective, the court would not have come to the conclusion that has been arrived at. Khan was arrested along with British national Karan Sajnani and two others after NCB allegedly found a commercial quantity of ganja from Sajnani’s house. Khan was released on bail after eight months. Khan runs an ancestral salon in Bandra and also dabbles in sales of gyms equipment and real estate. Malik has been at loggerheads with NCB zonal chief Sameer Wankhede since Khan’s release on bail. He has levelled several allegations against Wankhede, including that the case of seizure of drugs from a cruise liner involving Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was fake and fabricated. Malik in a series of press conferences claimed that in the cruise liner case, NCB's witness K P Gosavi was a criminal and the other witness Manish Bhanusali was a BJP activist. Speaking to TOI, Nawab Malik said, “Let them file an appeal. It is a routine process and they are filing this appeal to save their skin. What happened to the Rhea Chakravarthy case, there too they had filed an appeal. NCB is wasting government’s time and money. We will fight it out. I have full faith in judiciary. I am not going to sit quiet and will expose Wankhede’s wrongdoings and how he and his team framed innocents.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ncb-challenges-bail-for-malik-son-in-law/articleshow/88625359.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||Impressed, President Ramnath Kovind seeks info on Mumbai's coastal trees||MUMBAI: President Ramnath Kovind was impressed by the peculiar green leafy trees along Mumbai’s coast, especially the Samudraphal (Barringtonia asiatica) tree, which is a salt-tolerant tree planted along Worli Sea face and the coast in South Mumbai. The President, during his Mumbai visit earlier this month, sought information on Samudraphal from the BMC’s garden department, which instantly sent a note on the tree to Rashtrapati Bhavan recently. According to the BMC, 3,632 of these trees were planted all over Mumbai. The civic officials said that Barringtonia is a large salt-tolerant tree commonly associated with coastal areas and originates from the region extending from tropical Africa, through India, to Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific. “It is typically 10 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) tall and develops a short trunk with a low-branching structure, supporting a densely branched wide-spreading crown. The leaves are large, club-shaped, glossy green, leathery and spirally arranged at the ends of the branches. Blooms are on and off throughout the year, with large, white tulip-like flower buds. These open at night to reveal long white, pink-tipped filaments that, when fully extended, resemble a powder puff,” said an official. President Kovind saw the trees when travelling from Raj Bhavan to the airport in the BMC’s D and G-South Wards. In early December, President Kovind was on a four-day tour of Maharashtra which he began with a visit to the historic Raigad Fort. BMC’s Garden Superintendent Jitendra Pardeshi said that the department had sent the information to Rashtrapati Bhavan. “We were asked for information by the protocol officials on Samudraphal tree. So we sent all the information through the protocol department,” Pardeshi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/impressed-president-seeks-info-on-citys-coastal-trees/articleshow/88625360.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Sensex gains 22% in 2021 to end over 58k||Mumbai: The year 2021 will be remembered, for the most part, as when the sensex scaled new highs on a regular basis. But it will also bring to mind times when the bull rally fizzled out as inflation rose in most major economies, prompting several central banks to stop the money flow by slowing their bond-purchase programme.The sensex scaled the 50k mark for the first time in January and rose steadily to break above the 60k mark later in the year as Reliance Industries as well as leading software and financial stocks rallied. Starting at 47,751 points, and despite the weakness that was seen in the last two months of the year, the sensex ended 2021 at 58,254 points, up 22%, while the Nifty on NSE rallied 24% from 13,982 to 17,354. The rally made investors richer by about Rs 81 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation closing the year at Rs 269 lakh crore. HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli said the market cap-to-GDP ratio touched an all-time high globally and in India due to large liquidity flows, low interest rates, expectations of early return to normalcy and low returns from other asset classes.Among various things, the bull rally in the Indian market led to the emergence of tech-driven, consumer companies on the public market through the IPO route. Food delivery app Zomato was the first major one to show the path, which was quickly followed by online cosmetic retailer Nykaa, tech-enabled financial products retailer Policybazaar and digital payments solutions provider Paytm. While Zomato and Nykaa had blockbuster D-Street debuts, Policybazaar struggled and Paytm left many investors poorer.The relentless rally on D-Street also gave birth to a virtual race between Mukesh Ambani, the head of RIL, and Gautam Adani, the head of Adani Group, for the crown of Asia’s richest. A strong stock market for most part of 2021 also attracted retail investors to open demat accounts in record numbers and start trading. The rally also prompted risk-averse investors to take the mutual fund route with the November-end assets under management at a record Rs 37.3 lakh crore and monthly SIPs at just over the Rs 11,000-crore mark, AMFI data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sensex-gains-22-in-2021-to-end-over-58k/articleshow/88625368.cms||---

Thus, helping us identify the murder suspect.” Sawant added, “Oscar is now three-years-old. He was brought to BDDS, when he was 7 months old. He was trained for nine months in Pune as a tracker dog for crime investigation. Oscar has also helped in detecting a murder case at Wadkhal police station in February. Oscar had smelled the sickle, the murder weapon, and had reached a hutment in the fields, where he barked at a man inside. Thus, enabling the arrest of murder accused.” Pradeep Deshmukh, police inspector of Mahad taluka said, “As the murder victim was found semi-naked, sexual assault was suspected. It was confirmed from advance post mortem report of JJ hospital. Hence, along with murder, we invoked IPC section 376 for rape. We have also sought the forensic report from JJ hospital for a second opinion to confirm sexual assault on the victim.” Deshmukh further said, “Oscar helped us to zero-in on the prime suspect, the cattle shed owner.” The Mahad JMFC court has remanded the accused to custody till January 4.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/tracker-dog-oscar-helps-identify-rape-murder-accused/articleshow/88625370.cms||George Mendonca

---||Bengaluru||Curbs impact: Afternoon busy for revellers but evening dull||Bengaluru: A busy afternoon on Friday turned quiet as evening set in, foretelling how the city would be ushering in 2022.With revised guidelines issued to restrict the gathering of more than four people in public spaces after 6pm on Friday, Bengalureans tried to squeeze in most of their New Year celebrations in the permitted time outdoors.Police commissioner Kamal Pant had announced revised orders, according to which all hotels, pubs, clubs and other commercial establishments were permitted to operate till 10pm on December 31. The orders prohibited gatherings of any form in public places from 6pm on Friday to 5am on Saturday, January 1.To make it to a house party before 6pm, Suhas Kumar and his group of friends were busy with last-minute shopping at a mall in Whitefield in the afternoon. “We will be heading to our friend’s home and ring in the New Year indoors. We miss our parties in city pubs,” Kumar, a business analyst, told TOI. He, however, said it is still better than last year when he was stuck in his hometown.Several Bengalureans like Kumar spent most of their day preparing for night parties.However, some families also visited shopping malls to make the most of the last day of the year. Parag Jain, who was visiting a city mall with his parents, wife and a toddler in the evening, said the decorations and lights added to the New Year mood. “I did not want my family to spend the entire day locked inside the house. You never know when the next lockdown will be imposed, so I wanted to make the most of our time,” he said.Since restaurants, bars and pubs are allowed to operate only at 50% capacity until January 7, streets and commercial centres of the city were relatively emptier and slow on earnings on Friday. Trisha, a communications specialist, said that instead of the New Year Eve’s dinner, she had a brunch outing with friends.While people were finding their way around the restrictions, business establishments were not too happy to see limited occupancy and dwindling revenues. Pub owners said they have seen an 80% drop in occupancy since most people preferred to celebrate at home. Some also pointed out that the prohibitory order on public gatherings after 6pm had confused many who wished to go out but thought it wasn’t allowed.Sibi Ventakaraju, co-founder of Toit, said: “We ran the regular a la carte menu and did not host any special event as per the government order.”Samson Stephens, city manager of The Bar Stock Exchange, said the pub’s staff was directed to ask all customers to leave by 9.30pm so that it can be properly closed down before the 10pm curfew. Nevertheless, restaurant-goers and their managers were relieved that this New Year’s eve was comparatively more pleasurable than last year’s when vehicular movement on MG Road and its vicinity was banned after 8pm.Heavy cop presenceHeavy police presence and strict enforcement ensured peaceful celebrations. Flyovers were shut after 10pm, except for Hebbal and Kempegowda International Expressway. Prime junctions like MG Road, Brigade Road, Church Street, Indiranagar 100 Feet Road, were relatively deserted with a posse of 11,000 policemen standing guard. Police chief Kamal Pant said people coming out with valid reasons were allowed post 6pm. “But we stopped revellers wanting to celebrate the New Year,” he said.A woman tweeted she and her friend were threatened in Koramangala. “Out with a female friend and cops choose to threaten and hit us with lathis and abuse us...” she tweeted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/curbs-impact-afternoon-busy-for-revellers-but-evening-dull/articleshow/88625378.cms||Farheen Hussain

R Latha, chief superintendent of Central Prison, filed a police complaint which said around 12.35pm on December 25, the postman delivered two parcels for the inmates at the prison main gate. They were addressed to Kariyappa and Abhishek, both undertrials. “We found 10 grams of ganja in the parcel meant for Kariyappa and 150 grams in the one for Abhishek,” Latha said in her complaint. The jail staff questioned both to find out who sent the parcels, but neither answered satisfactorily. Police registered a case against them under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and are trying to trace the sender. 32kg ganja seized from peddlerA 51-year-old peddler was arrested and 32kg of ganja worth Rs 7 lakh seized from him. Satyapradhan, a resident of east Bengaluru who belongs to Odisha, was nabbed at Indiranagar when many ganja consumers picked up in the recent past said they purchased the drug from him. Police said Satyapradhan would smuggle ganja from Odisha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ganja-sent-by-parcel-post-to-undertrials-at-central-prison/articleshow/88625380.cms||---

According to Section 12(1)(a) of the Act, an order of detention passed by the state can be modified/revoked by the Centre. Dismissing the habeas corpus petition filed by Khatejutal Najma, wife of Mohammed Kashif who has been detained under the Act, a division bench headed by justice Alok Aradhe said the said power of the Centre is a supervisory one that can be exercised on receipt of a report from the state government along with the order of detention and grounds of detention in the case. But with regards to this case, the bench noted the detainee had been informed of his right to make a representation to the detaining authority, government and the advisory board, and the detention order does not suffer from any infirmity on this ground. The petitioner had argued that Kashif’s detention was in violation of section 12(1)(a) of the Act as he was not apprised of his right to submit a representation. Another argument was that the detention order, dated September 9, 2021, was without authority of law and violated the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 22(5) of the Constitution. Kashif, a resident of Muslim colony in Annasandrapalya area of Bengaluru, was apprehended on August 31 by HAL police in connection with a complaint registered in 2020 for drug peddling. When questioned, he spoke about his role in five other criminal cases as well. He was remanded in judicial custody the next day. Considering his statement, police detained him under the Act.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-mans-preventive-detention-over-drug-peddling/articleshow/88625381.cms||---

According to the transport department, there are around 35,000 illegal autorickshaws plying on city roads. VK Moosa, regional transport officer (autorickshaws), Shantinagar, said, “We issued 1.35 lakh autorickshaw permits in Bengaluru so far, but only 1 lakh are plying with proper documents and fitness certificates.” He said even if the authorities seize all illegal autorickshaws, there is no place to park them. “Traffic police are facing a space crunch on their station premises, so they are not taking any action. We also have a severe shortage of staff for enforcement,” he said. He said FCs of autorickshaws should be renewed once every two years. “But these 35,000 permit holders are not coming forward to renew them. They may be plying without insurance too,” Moosa said. C Sampath, general secretary, Adarsh Auto Drivers’ Union, admitted there are several illegal autorickshaws in the city. “The main reason some drivers refuse to ply to some locations is they might not have a permit/ insurance/ FC. The transport department along with traffic police, legal metrology department, and insurance companies should conduct special camps to regularise illegal autos. Those drivers are also ready to follow the rules, but the authorities will not allow this as they cannot harass and collect bribes from poor drivers if they have all the documents,” he said. Two-stroke autos illegal, but 10k still operate While registration of two-stroke autos in the city was stopped in 2005, many still ply on adulterated fuel and pollute the environment. In 2017, the government announced a subsidy of Rs 30,000 each for two-stroke auto drivers to switch to four-stroke LPG autos. However, drivers demanded that the amount be increased to Rs 50,000 as a new auto costs around Rs 2 lakh. While the transport department recommended increasing the subsidy, the finance department rejected it. Two-stroke autos were supposed to be banned in the city from April 2018 but it came into effect two years later. “It’s illegal to run two-stroke autos, but around 10,000 are still plying,” he admitted. Sources claimed many two-stroke auto drivers who scrapped their vehicles are yet to get subsidy. Sampath said his union has a list of 30 drivers who scrapped such autos. “Of them, 13 have submitted all documents to the transport department, but not one has received subsidy.” The transport department, however, said the amount allocated (Rs 30 crore) for this purpose has lapsed and the government has diverted it for other requirements. Meanwhile, the department’s proposal to introduce Aadhaar-based e-permits for autos is gathering dust. Many financiers are alleged to be in possession of multiple permits under different names. Aadhaar-based permits will expose such violations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/35k-autos-plying-illegally-in-city-no-staff-to-monitor/articleshow/88625383.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Many private schools join hands with hospitals to jab kids on campus||BENGALURU: With vaccination for children in the age group of 15 to 18 kicking off from January 3, many private schools in the city are tying up with private hospitals to conduct vaccination drives on their campuses. Government schools and PU colleges will hold vaccination drives in association with the department of health and family welfare. Delhi Public Schools have collaborated with Manipal Hospitals and their drive begins on Monday. “We have around 6,000 children in the eligible age group in our 6 DPS branches and one of School of India. We are hoping that at least 70% of the students take the vaccine. Once we have covered our students, we plan to open the campus vaccination drive to children from other schools. We hope to get all our kids back on campuses for offline classes after the drive is over,” said Mansoor Ali Khan, who is on the board of members of the DPS branches. Schools planning similar initiatives said they will offer all facilities to the hospitals. “The school will allot a designated area for the vaccination drive and will provide support and facilities required to run it. It will also allot specific slots for students to come in, so there is minimal waiting time,” said Tristha Ramamurthy, founder and MD, Ekya Schools. Around 1,200 students are expected to get jabbed. “As per our operational plan, there will be six nurses, a doctor, and an ambulance available. Consent will be taken from parents. Post vaccination, children will have to remain at the venue for 20 to 30 minutes. Each day, we are planning to cover 200 children in each school,” said Karthik Rajagopal, COO, Manipal Hospitals. Many other schools said they will wait for the government to offer vaccines as parents might not be able to afford them. “For the government, there is already a micro-management plan used for other vaccination drives. We hope it can be used for these drives. Many of our schools are unlikely to tie up with private hospitals as the parents might not be able to afford it. Data collection has begun and we are hoping they roll it out soon,” said D Sashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka. The department of PU education is also coordinating with district officials to get drives organised on campuses from Monday. “The deputy directors (DDs) are coordinating with deputy commissioners of respective districts to ensure sessions are conducted in colleges. Each college is tagged to a PHC or urban health centre. Depending on the availability of health staff, they will take a call on the colleges and number of students vaccinated each day. DDs are also instructed to hold parent-teacher meeting at colleges to help remove vaccine hesitancy and get consent of parents for vaccinating students,” said Snehal R, director, department of PU education. Vishal R, commissioner, department of public instruction, said three rooms in each school will be used for vaccination. “One for registration, one for vaccination and one for monitoring. There will be supervision by health or education department officials. Four departments — education, PU, ITIs and health — will be coordinating. The local urban or rural bodies will be roped in to get out-of- school/college students vaccinated too,” said Vishal. Over 31.7 lakh students are targeted to be vaccinated in the coming days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/many-pvt-schools-join-hands-with-hospitals-to-jab-kids-on-campus/articleshow/88625384.cms||---

District health authorities have been instructed to ensure vaccination centres have separate schedules for kids and the rest of the population. Parental consent must be taken prior to administering vaccine to children with comorbidities. In case the child is given any other vaccine recently, the Covid-19 vaccination must be done only after 15 days, read the circular issued by Arundhathi Chandrasekhar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka. The health department has asked districts to identify schools with three rooms spacious enough for establishing vaccination centres. Drinking water and hand-wash facilities must be set up. The list of schools where Covid-19 vaccination for children is administered must be made public, the circular stated. Schools conducting online classes must schedule dates of vaccination and provide children with jabs. Any adverse event following vaccination must be efficiently managed, the note said.Precautionary doses will be made available for healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities from January 10. “They must have completed 39 weeks or nine months from the time of second dose,” the circular stated. Healthcare/frontline workers aged above 60 who had taken their previous doses under the general citizen category can provide their employment proof and get registered for the precautionary dose. Key decisions to be taken soon, says BommaiAmid a spike in Covid-19 and Omicron variant cases in the state, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said the government will take some “important decisions” in the days to come. He said health infrastructure such as beds, oxygen and medicines should be put in place to deal with the situation. “Cases are increasing across the country; the Centre has identified Karnataka as one among the eight states,” Bommai said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/only-covaxin-jabs-for-children/articleshow/88625385.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Series of election victories in 2021 boost Cong morale||Bengaluru: The impressive performance in the urban local body elections has come as a major morale booster for state Congress amid its attempts to find momentum ahead of the 2023 assembly polls. After its humiliating performance in the Lok Sabha polls and a series of bypolls in 2019 and 2020, Congress has managed to put up a good show in 2021 with convincing wins in Maski and Hangal bypolls and above-par performance in the MLC elections, followed by an impressive feat in ULB polls despite being in the opposition. The most significant takeaway from the developments is that the victories have helped the party get over the defeatist attitude since its rout in the 2019 LS polls. They could lead to unity of multiple camps ahead of next year’s elections. This also implies that the other opposition party, JD(S), that had been aiming to displace Congress by hobnobbing with the ruling BJP, may have to rework its strategy in future.These results have spelt it out in clear terms for the ruling BJP that anti-incumbency is going to be a major issue and cannot be wished away. In fact, after losing Bankapura municipality which falls under his home constituency of Shiggoan in Haveri district, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai opted to blame minority votes for the debacle, suggesting that he had no clear game plan.The resounding victory in Hangal bypoll in the CM’s home district last October was dubbed by BJP as the candidate’s (Srinivas Mane) personal victory and not that of Congress. Later, Congress not only managed to win 11 of 25 seats, equalling BJP’s tally but also got 44.7% of the vote share as against 38.8% of BJP.The party also did well in elections to Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburgi city corporations where BJP struggled to secure victory. All this has reaffirmed that Congress is indeed on a revival mode; it has energised its demoralised party workers. The larger message which has gone out to the cadres is that DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, despite their differences, have managed to play a constructive part in the outcome. “Strong anti-government sentiment, serious disappointment over functioning of the central and state administrations and a strong pitch by a united Congress are the reasons for the party’s good performance in the recent polls,” said AICC spokesperson Brijesh Kalappa. However, party functionaries themselves admit that what happens before 2023 would largely depend on the unity between Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. The two who were at loggerheads on various issues are reportedly fighting over the proposed 170 km 10-day padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru from January 9 to press for early implementation of Mekedatu project across Cauvery. While Shivakumar apparently wants to hog the limelight, Siddaramaiah is not letting it happen.Many political observers are convinced that the tussle between the two would seriously dent the party’s 2023 prospects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/series-of-election-victories-in-2021-boost-cong-morale/articleshow/88625387.cms||---

The arrested are NHAI regional officer Akil Ahmad, Ratnakaran Sajilal, Devendra Jain, Mahim Pratap Singh Tomar, Sunil Kumar Verma — all from Dilip Buildcon Ltd — and another individual,Anuj Gupta. CBI sleuths raided different places connected with the accused in Bengaluru, New Delhi, Kochi, Gurugram, Bhopal, and elsewhere. About Rs 4 crore cash was seized from the premises of private persons in these places while Rs 4 lakh cash was recovered from the premises of the regional officer of NHAI, a CBI press release said on Friday. The regional officer was allegedly in the habit of demanding and accepting illegal gratification from NHAI contractors for clearing pending bills and issuing date of provisional commercial operations for completed projects, the CBI note said. “It is further alleged that the officer demanded illegal gratification from the general manager of a private company with respect to a project under Benguluru-Chennai Expressway package 1 and 2. It is also alleged that Rs 20 lakh was to be delivered to a private person in Delhi for the regional officer. The CBI laid a trap. The private person and an official of the said company were caught.

Pointing out that the magistrate had committed an error in issuing summons against the petitioners by only relying on the sworn statement of some prosecution witnesses, justice HP Sandesh said the memo also lacked ingredients of any offence invoked against the petitioners.P Surekha and her uncle P Radhakrishna, BT Chavan, additional superintendent of police, and head constable Parashuramappa (both working at Davanagere) had challenged the Sindhanur court order. The Sindhanur court had issued summons to them, based on the protest petition filed by KK Vishweshwar Rao, father-in-law of Surekha. Rao had alleged that at the instance of Surekha and her uncle Radhakrishna, Chavan and Parashuramappa subjected him to abuse and without registering a case, brought him to the police station and pressured him to pay Rs 30 lakh in favour of Surekha as alimony. It was further alleged that the two police officials wrongfully confined him in conspiracy with the other two petitioners and on September 29, 2012 even threatened him. Following Rao’s complaint, police filed a B-report. Rao later filed a protest petition..The HC noted the controversy arose out of a matrimonial dispute between the complainant’s father-in-law and daughter-in-law over quantum of permanent alimony. “When police acted in terms of reasonable relation of their police duty and based on representation dated September 14, 2012 given by the first petitioner (Surekha), discharged their public duties, it can’t be termed abuse of power,” the judge observed. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/abuse-of-power-case-against-cops-quashed/articleshow/88625390.cms||---

Instead, he urged them to follow Covid restriction norms and continue to help people.  "This is the first New Year after people voted the DMK to power for the sixth time. I understand that our party functionaries are keen to come to meet me in person and wish me. But this is the time when we have to be on our guard to contain the spread of Omicron," Stalin said in a statement. This government came to power at a time when the Covid second wave was at its peak. "Just as we had contained the second wave through effective steps, our government will take all steps to contain the spread of Omicron. I urge our party cadres to continue to help the affected people, as they did during the earlier Covid wave," Stalin said.  He asked his partymen and general public to follow all Covid norms and abide by the directions from the state government to help contain the spread of Omicron. He also vowed to celebrate every New Year from next year onwards. In a separate message, Stalin extended New Year greetings to the people of Tamil Nadu, and said, "This New Year arrives as a new hope after the last two years, when Covid affected the lives of the people the world over. Our government re-dedicates itself to work more efficiently for the betterment of the people and the state, " he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/stalin-asks-party-cadres-not-to-visit-him-on-new-year/articleshow/88625395.cms||---
---||Chennai||Equal weightage should be given to all states in GST council, says Tamil Nadu minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu minister for finance and human resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Friday urged the Centre to treat requests from all states equally for convening emergency meeting of the GST council.  Friday’s emergency meeting of the council was based on a request from Gujarat to discuss the proposed increase in GST rates to 12%, from the earlier 5%, on textiles and garment sector from January 1, 2022. “This is the first such emergency meeting of the GST council and we were given to understand at the meeting that it was convened based on a request from Gujarat. Taking this as a precedent, several states, including Tamil Nadu, have put forth a suggestion that such requests from other states too for convening emergency meeting of the GST council should be given equal weightage,” Palanivel Thiaga Rajan told reporters, after the GST council meeting on Friday in New Delhi. “While Friday’s emergency meeting was convened at short notice, the government maintained that it was based on the agenda discussed at the 19th GST council meeting in 2020. Friday’s meeting decided to put off implementation of the new GST rates on textiles and garment sector and decided to pass it on to the ‘rate rationalisation’ committee of the council for consideration,” Thiaga Rajan said. He said, the ‘rate rationalisation’ committee, constituted in September and whose tenure was two months, had never met. Similarly, the ‘gaming’ committee, in which Tamil Nadu is also a member, has not met a single time during its six months tenure. There is also lack of clarity on who are all the members of the ‘fitment’ and ‘legal’ committees, he said. Earlier, in his address at the council, Thiaga Rajan highlighted that Tamil Nadu is one of the major states producing handloom and powerloom textiles and hosiery goods in the country and this sector is next only to agriculture in employment. The adverse move planned to increase the GST rates to 12% would make it unviable for the sector to sustain the business, leading to closure of units, most of whom are in MSME segment, and loss of employment to a large section of people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/equal-weightage-should-be-given-to-all-states-in-gst-council-ptr/articleshow/88625396.cms||---
---||Chennai||New green committees to take charge in third week of January||Chennai: The new panels of the State Environment Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) are likely to take charge in the third week of January. Sources in the government said that the Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change has approved the proposal to constitute the new committee. Officials, however, expressed disappointment over the lackadaisical approach of the authority, which caused enormous delay in constituting the committee. The tenure of the previous committee ended on November 4. Since then, development projects were put on hold for want of environment clearance. The committee plays a crucial role in scrutinising development project proposals before SEIAA decides on issuing environmental clearance (EC), which is mandatory for any big project. Officials said several hundred project proposals seeking EC have piled up at SEIAA. Some of them are pending from the tenure of the previous committee headed by Prof S Mohan of IIT Madras. Sources said the impact assessment division of the Union ministry of environment had sent a couple of reminders to the principal secretary of environment, Tamil Nadu, to reconstitute SEIAA and SEAC. “The Union ministry had requested the authorities here to forward the panel of names for reconstitution of SEIAA and SEAC on September 10. It sent a reminder later pointing out that there was no response from the state officials,” said an official, citing the communication from director at the Union ministry of environment, A K Agarwal on November 23. Acting on the reminders, the state government started the process of reconstituting the panels, said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/new-green-committees-to-take-charge-in-third-week-of-january/articleshow/88625397.cms||---

Police have launched a hunt for the absconding students for humiliating and bullying the deceased. Minutes after sending a voice message to friends and family that he was ending his life unable to bear the humiliation by students of Pachaiyappa’s College, 21-year-old M Kumar, a first-year MA (history) student at Presidency College, jumped in front of a train.

The state unit aims to impress their party leader and boost the morale of the functionaries by organising various programmes during Modi's visit. State president K AnnamalaiAnnamalai has constituted a 12-member state committee, headed by state general secretary Karu Nagarajan, to coordinate arrangements for the programme. The party has also formed a committee under senior party functionary Prof Rama Srinivasan to organize a grand welcome for Modi. The party has planned a series of special Pongal events at party mandal level in the state as part of the celebration from January 7. It would culminate in Madurai on January 12 where the PM is expected to participate, said Nagarajan. Folk artists would be roped in for the programme to add colour to the event. “We are planning to bring at least 10,000 women to make Pongal on the occasion. The Modi Pongal festival is also aimed at boosting the morale of the party workers ahead of the urban local body polls,” Nagarajan added. Union ministers are expected to participate in the programme. Last year, party national president J P Nadda participated in the Pongal celebrations of the state unit. This is the first time Modi is visiting Tamil Nadu after Annamalai assumed charge as the state unit chief. Though the PM’s participation in the Mega Pongal event in Madurai is yet to be confirmed, the state president is keen to make the programme a grand success. “The district units have been instructed to bring the party cadres and supporters in large numbers to showcase the party’s growing strength in Tamil Nadu. The programme will be organised in such a way that it will send a strong message to political rivals,” said a state level office bearer of the party.  It may be recalled that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, along with DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin, watched jallikattu in Madurai’s Avaniyapuram last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/bjp-prepares-for-special-modi-pongal-during-pm-visit-on-jan-12/articleshow/88625399.cms||Shanmughasundarm j

I insist the government to extend financial aid of 20 lakh each of the victim’s family,” said EPS in retaliation to Stalin’s statement that the city has been facing the problem of waterlogging due to the poor administration of the AIADMK regime for a decade. He said that the DMK regime has been deflecting issues and diverting attention from current problems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/eps-slams-cm-for-blaming-aiadmk-for-floods-in-city/articleshow/88625400.cms||---

CMRL recorded an additional 80,000 new commuters while suburban trains saw an additional 40,000 commuters during evening peak hours on Thursday. A total of 1.83 lakh passengers travelled in metro trains in Chennai on Thursday. The footfall on Thursday was around 30% more than that on Wednesday, when 1.28 lakh people took the metro. Chennai Metro Rail Ltd, which extended its passenger service by an hour till midnight, saw 1,169 people using the trains to get home between 11pm and midnight while 1.82 lakh people travelled in its trains from 5.30am to 11pm. After several major junctions got choked due to traffic, many people walked into metro stations to reach their destinations. Most of the commuters reached home on time while those who took the road were stuck in traffic for several hours. Metro stations like Central, Alandur and a few others on Anna Salai were unusually crowded. “I left my office on Anna Salai by 5.40pm and reached home in Thirumangalam by 6.05pm. My colleagues who left office around the same time in their own vehicle reached home two hours later,” said S Lakshmi, a government employee and a regular metro rail commuter. The situation at suburban railway stations, especially at Park and Central, was no different. Several people returning from offices decided to use suburban trains instead of driving home. Around 5.60 lakh commuters use the four suburban lines, including MRTS services, on a daily basis. On Thursday, around six lakh commuters used suburban trains. "Many railway staff, including officers, had to leave behind their vehicles and travel by trains after news came in about traffic blocks across the city. Vehicles were taking more than an hour to cover the distance between one junction to another on the main road,” said a railway official.  Metro trains received more takers as the stations are located along the main road where traffic was moving at a snail’s pace. Several commuters who made the switch from their cars to trains said metro rail and suburban trains were packed and enforcing Covid-19 protocol became impossible during evening peak hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/over-80k-switched-to-metro-40k-took-suburban-trains/articleshow/88625401.cms||---

S Ayya of Palayamkotta has moved the plea citing decisions of the governments of Bihar and Karnataka to provide such subsidies for petrol, diesel and kerosene used by farmers. According to the petitioner, the rapid increase in the fuel cost has added to the already high production cost of agricultural products.This apart, the steep rise in taxes, including central excise, cess and state’s VAT, have added additional burden on the input cost of production in agriculture. “Therefore, farmers engaged in mechanised farming in the state are put through several hardships owing to increased cost of production and procurement at a subsidised price,” he said. He added that in Tamil Nadu, a considerable number of farmers merely rely on diesel motor pump sets and they are already struggling to carry out cultivation due to the escalation of input costs, fertiliser, seed and particularly labour costs. The plea moved as a PIL is likely to be taken up for hearing in the first week of January 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/farmer-moves-high-court-for-fuel-subsidy/articleshow/88625402.cms||---

On Friday, authorities reduced the quantity of surplus water from the reservoirs. A senior PWD official said among the reservoirs, Chembarambakkam recorded the highest rainfall of 189mm on Thursday, followed by 103 mm at Red Hills. Both Poondi and Cholavaram reservoirs recorded 90 mm each while Kannankottai Thervaikandigai recorded 60 mm of rain. The unexpected downpour forced PWD authorities to release 2,000 cusecs (cubic feet of water per second) from Chembarambakkam, 1,500 cusecs from Red Hills, 950 from Cholavaram and 744 cusecs from Poondi reservoir on Thursday night. With not much rain on Friday, authorities cut the release of surplus water from reservoirs. From Poondi and Red Hills reservoirs, authorities continued release of 744 cusecs and 1,500 cusecs of water like Thursday. At Cholavaram, the water release was cut to 880 cusecs and at Chembarambakkam, it was reduced from 2,000 cusecs to 1,000 cusecs on Friday. At Kannankottai Thervaikandigai, authorities released only 102 cusecs. This was mainly due to reduction in rain on Friday, said an official. No rain was recorded on Friday in catchment areas of Poondi, whereas Cholavaram received 9 mm rain, Red Hills 7 mm and Chembarambakkam 1.2 mm, said the official. The combined storage of water in six reservoirs, including Veeranam in Cuddalore district, stood at 12,244 mcft as against their full capacity of 13,222. Another one thousand million cubic feet of water is only required for the six reservoirs to reach their full capacity. With reservoirs brimming, Metrowater authorities continued the supply of 1,000 million litres of water to consumers in both core city areas and a few added areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/release-of-surplus-water-from-reservoirs-reduced/articleshow/88625406.cms||P Oppili

---||Chennai||Come June, Chennai airport all set to get swanky upgrades||CHENNAI: With a brand-new terminal and two multi-level car parking complexes, all set to open in June, the year 2022 is going to be a crucial year for the development of Chennai airport. While the terminal construction is still underway, car parking complexes, which include a mall, a hotel, and a multiplex, are almost complete and will be opened by June. The expansion is being taken after 2013 when the domestic and international terminals were commissioned. Works to rebuild the existing international arrivals, add more aircraft parking bays, a parallel taxiway, MRO, altogether will make the airport capable of handling 35million passengers. The deadline for these expansion works is set for 2024. The muti-level car parking complexes can accommodate around 2000 carsAirport director Sharad Kumar said that the new integrated terminal and the parking complexes will be completed and ready by June 2022. “The year is going to be crucial because the new facilities are going to open. These will help improve passenger experience and the airport's passenger handling capacity.” The last section of the truss for the roof of the terminal was installed recently. “The new terminal will have modern facilities including the infrastructure needed to implement bio-metric driven passenger entry and more counters for check-in and immigration,” he added. The integrated terminal with facilities for DiGi Yatra service – a face recognition-based digital processing of passengers - will be implemented after the ministry’s approval. The parking complexes, which can accommodate around 2000 cars, were supposed to open by early 2021 but the deadline had to be moved to the end of the year, and has been postponed further due to the slowing work and rain. The AAI has started discussions with airlines, immigration, customs, and other agencies to shift the international arrivals to the new building so that the old terminal can be pulled down to build a new one. Sources said that capacity addition on the terminal side and to the airside, by adding aircraft bays and taxiways, were being planned and executed because there was a delay in deciding on the construction of a second city airport.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/come-june-city-airport-all-set-to-get-swanky-upgrades/articleshow/88625408.cms||V Ayyappan

Justice P Velmurugan said that the officers are not entitled to receive salary during the period as they failed to perform their duties as station house officers.“Therefore, the commissioner is directed to take departmental action against the two delinquent officials and recover their salary during their period as station house officer in Anna Nagar all women police station and remit the same back to the government and file an action taken report on the same, before this court as early as possible preferably before February 2022,” the court said. The issue pertains to a plea moved by Parimala, who had filed a domestic violence case against her husband. On October 23, 2010, a mahila court had issued a NBW against her husband since he failed to appear before the court.However, even after repeated reminders, the Anna Nagar all women police failed to execute the NBW. Aggrieved, Parimala moved the high court.When the plea came up for hearing, the court ordered the appearance of the inspectors who were in charge of the station at the relevant point of time.Inspectors Dhanalakshmi and Selvi appeared before the court but failed to satisfactorily explain why they did not execute the NBW.Recording the submissions, the court said, “The two delinquent officers being public servants and getting salary from the public money, did not perform their duty satisfactorily and failed to obey the order of this court, for which, there is no valid reason offered.”Hence, according to this court, they are not entitled for the salary during their period as station house officer in the police station, the judge added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-docks-salary-of-two-inspectors/articleshow/88625418.cms||---
---||Chennai||My aim is to become a finisher like Dhoni, says Shahrukh||Chennai: From his last-ball six to help Tamil Nadu retain the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 last month to notching up consistent performances with the bat at the recently-concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy --- M Shahrukh Khan has been the star of Tamil Nadu in 2021. With his ability to clear the fence at ease and keeping a cool head under pressure, he will be a sought-after player in the forthcoming IPL auctions as well. In fact it was a surprise for one and all that Punjab Kings did not retain him.In a chat with TOI, the 26-year-old spoke on the role of a finisher, his learnings from being part of the IPL and more. Excerpts: Having excelled in the white-ball formats this season, what are your expectations ahead of the IPL auctions to be held next year?It is obviously there at the back of my mind. Having said that, I am not thinking too much about what's going to happen (at the auctions). At the moment, I am only focusing on the preparations for the Ranji Trophy as I am keen to contribute for my team.  Where do you derive your mental strength?It all boils down to the process. By process I mean --- the preparations (for a game) begin much before the actual match is. The net sessions and the plans on how to go about my innings --- all fall under the process part. With regards to the mental ability --- I will have to thank our team’s assistant coach R Prasanna who has worked hard on me. He has known me since I was 15 or 16 and understands my game as we have played with each other. Prasanna keeps me highly motivated before a game and backs me to deliver each time I go out to bat. Also, the team management’s role for me has been very clear. The team think tank's communication is clear and that allows me to express myself each time I go out to bat.  Whom have you modeled your game as a finisher? MS Dhoni is the player I have always looked up to and I want to become a finisher like him. The way he goes about the game is a masterclass for all. He is fully aware of his abilities and the beauty of his batting is that he takes the game deep. The deeper you take the game --- the more pressure the bowlers will be under and that gives you more options to score and finish on the winning side. Being a Chennai boy, do you aspire to don the CSK jersey in the near future?At this moment, I am not really thinking too much about the IPL auctions and would prefer to focus more on Ranji Trophy preparations What has been the biggest change in your game after playing for Punjab Kings XI in the IPL earlier this year?After coming back from the IPL, I have done even better than what I did last year in white-ball cricket. This year --- I have got the runs quicker. Being part of the IPL helped me grow in confidence. I started facing bowlers who bowled over 140kph at the nets. We had the likes of Mohd Shami, Riley Meredith and Chris Jordan who were quick in Punjab Kings XI line-up. When you face such high-quality bowlers both in nets and in matches, your skillset is bound to go up.  Having mastered the white-ball game, how keen are you to make a similar impact in red ball cricket too? Red ball is a different ball game. Having said that, I have done well in red-ball cricket as well. In my debut Ranji game against Kerala in 2018-19, I had scored an unbeaten 92 and also hit a gritty 55 against Delhi that season. I am ready for all formats of the game. The world’s best players such as David Warner aren’t just hard hitters of the white ball but also excel in the longest version of the game.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/my-aim-is-to-become-a-finisher-like-dhoni-says-shahrukh/articleshow/88625419.cms||Prasad RS

DGP said that the police foiled the CPI Maoists' attempt to enter the state from Chhattisgarh. On the question of an ex-sarpanch who was recently killed by Maoists, he said that despite several porous borders between Telangana-Chhattisgarh, armed outposts are being set up to avoid such incidents with the support of the union government.Replying to why police are delaying in attempting to pursue cases of alleged over ground activists of CPI Maoists in trial courts, Mahendar Reddy said, “To make sure such accused get conviction, we have to prove beyond reasonable doubt. So, for that we have to collect all the needed evidence. Based on the initial evidence we arrest the accused but to obtain the remaining evidence in some cases it takes a long time. In the coming days, we will focus on this and take action to succeed in getting conviction against them.”In 2021, the crime rate in the state has gone up by 4.6%. The top cop claimed that online petitioning, zero FIRs, enhancement of awareness to lodge complaints are the reasons behind the rise. The rise was noticed under murder for gain, burglaries, homicides, cheating and others. There was a steep rise in the number of cyber crime cases in the state. On the allegations that police has breached the privacy of people by checking their mobile phones during enforcement, DGP dismissed it by calling it a motivated campaign.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dgp-armed-outposts-to-be-set-up-on-t-chgarh-border/articleshow/88625423.cms||---

The firm, which is into manufacturing cement bricks, had taken loans from Bank of Baroda but failed to repay them. The CBI named promoters — Narra Kumar Prasanna, Chigurupati Ram Prasad, Narra Prasanna Lakshmi, Narra Vijaya Lakshmi and Yeduguntla Saritha Reddy — and unidentified public servants for the fraud. It alleged that the promoters had siphoned off funds by diverting the loan amount to other accounts. The company was sanctioned a loan of Rs 29.5 crore initially. Due to lack of surplus internal generation of funds, the company could not pay the interest or instalments on the loan. The company account was also declared as a non-performing asset. Delhi-based MK Agarwal & Co, which conducted a forensic audit, said the borrower company did not comply with the disclosures as required under the Companies Act. The company had also taken back part of amounts in current accounts maintained with other banks, it is learnt. The borrower company had shown incorrect particulars of stock statements submitted to the bank to avail a higher credit limit. The forensic auditors in 2019 opined that the borrower firm was non-cooperative as per RBI circular and that fraud cannot be ruled out.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC says no to fresh Covid curbs||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday refused to direct the state government to impose any fresh restrictions, but told the administration to ensure that central guidelines on Covid-19 and its new variants is implemented. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji, which was hearing a batch of writ petitions, turned critical of counsel Chikkudu Prabhakar who was insisting on imposition of new restrictions. Quoting state public health director’s comments, the bench said that more restrictions will have devastating effects on livelihoods and taking adequate precautions such as masks and sanitisation was the only way to move forward. The director also said that people are free to go to theatres, the bench said. When the counsel pointed out that bars and pubs have been allowed to stay open till late on New Year’s Eve and sought curbs, the bench refused to issue any such order. The bench reminded him that the state has completed the administration of first dose of vaccine to 100% people and the second dose to a significant population. The bench, however, directed authorities to ensure that clubs, pubs and bars in the state allow only those who are fully vaccinated. While the staff in these places should be tested and only those negative for the virus allowed to serve, the bench said. To a suggestion that more containment zones should be created, the bench said that the idea behind containment zone is to shield the area with high cases and prevent it from spreading to other areas. “When there are no such areas with high cases, then the question of declaring any area as a containment zone does not arise. Such restrictions would come when things are abnormal. But the situation in Telangana is now normal,” the bench said. The bench ordered the state to comply with Centre’s orders issued from time to time and also make all endeavour to curb any possible spread of Omicron. It also directed that state to file a compliance report in court on January 4 on the implementation of the government of India’s directions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-says-no-to-fresh-covid-curbs/articleshow/88625439.cms||Sagarkumar Mutha

---||Hyderabad||First Covid vaccine Sputnik V fails to take off in India||Hyderabad: Sputnik V, the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine to be registered, has failed to take off in India, one of the largest vaccine markets in the world.Over six months after its India rollout in mid May 2021, only a little over 11.77 lakh doses of Sputnik V have been administered (as of 9pm on Friday) as compared to over 128.96 crore doses of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and over 15.65 crore doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.These numbers are much lower than what Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and its Indian partner Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had estimated. But Sputnik V’s ride in India was fraught with glitches from the start. After delays in commercial rollout, which took place only in July 2021 because not enough of the second dose component was shipped from Russia, the over half-a-dozen Indian manufacturers roped in to make it found themselves struggling to produce the second dose component (Ad5), which is administered 21 days after dose 1 (Ad26). “Everyone was able to successfully manufacture the first dose but all of us have been struggling with the second dose as the technology is different and its yield is not of commercial quantities. Without adequate quantities of the second dose the vaccine can’t be distributed, which is why they are trying to push for approval for single-dose Sputnik Light,” a top honcho of a local Sputnik V manufacturer told TOI.But by the time Sputnik V could fix some of these glitches, India’s vaccination drive had shifted into a higher gear and the Russian vaccine, which was only a private market player, lost out in the race.“In early September, with supply of the second dose component commencing from a partner in India, our market supply received fresh momentum. We were able to supply equivalent quantities of the first and second dose components to partner hospitals. However, by September, with heavy scale-up in overall vaccine production and free distribution through the government, private market sales overall started to see a sharp dip,” said a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/first-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v-fails-to-take-off-in-india/articleshow/88625443.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement, children in the age group of 15-18 years will be eligible to receive their first dose of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The eligible beneficiaries can register themselves with a unique account or by using their parents existing account on CoWin app from January 1. “We have over 800 eligible students in the age group of 15-18. We have sent out survey forms to all the parents seeking their willingness to get their children vaccinated. So far, more than 50 parents have given their consent. We are expecting more parents to come forward,” said C Hema, principal of Oakridge International School, adding that a vaccination camp will be set up once the school reopens after the winter break. While some private schools are still in discussions with private hospitals, others have already tied up with them for vaccination drives. “We have more than 400 students who would be eligible for their first dose. We have been approached by two private hospitals to conduct the vaccination drive and we are in the process of finalising one of them. While priority would be given to our own students first, the drive would also be open for other children in the same age group,” said Mahender Reddy, owner of Sancta Maria School. Parents too are trying to enrol their children on the CoWin app as soon as the slots open. “Since I have also been administered Covaxin, I am willing to go ahead with the same for my son. I will try booking a slot the moment it opens,” said Vidya Dasari, parent of a 15-year-old.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/schools-tying-up-with-hosps-for-kids-vax-drive/articleshow/88625444.cms||Preeti Biswas

At the same time, GHMC also ends the year on a high note in road work, completing and launching five major flyover work worth Rs 647 crore, including Hitex railway under bridge, Owaisi junction flyover, Balanagar flyover and Shaikpet flyover. Conversely, the much-needed Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP), which was announced in November 2020, is yet to start. A review meeting held by the chief secretary revealed that there were no takers for the project due to the ‘unrealistic’ nature of the detailed project report. In terms of town planning developments, this year 2,241 people, who applied for housing permits for under 75 yards through TS b-pass, were immediately granted nod. Similarly, 8,534 people who applied to build G + 2 houses within 75 to 600 yards too quickly received permission. Over 100 yards, 10 metre tall buildings were cleared for 1,335 applications through a single-window system. The civic body also focussed on illegal structures in the city by establishing zonal-level enforcement committees. Under this process, engineers inspected 4,845 buildings under construction and the committee issued notices to 416 people for illegal constructions and demolished them. On the health front, by the first week of December, GHMC had recorded a vaccination rate of 100% for the first dose across 4,846 colonies in 150 wards and 72% for the second dose. GHMC saw a major improvement in its Swachh Survekshan 2021 ranking, taking it to 13th spot amongst cities with a population of above 10 lakh from 23 in 2020. Hyderabad bagged 37th place in the overall category.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/delays-plague-ghmc-but-work-on-roads-sees-progress/articleshow/88625446.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

One of the reasons for the delay in administering the second dose is that many people have changed their mobile phone numbers, which are linked to their Aadhaar number. “There would be at least 10% of such people and some of them were vaccinated for the second time, but their numbers are scattered. We are attempting to enter the details of such people using digital codes, but even that is becoming difficult,” a senior health official told TOI. He further said: “We are requesting the people not to switch the phone numbers associated with their Aadhaar numbers. This is causing a lot of confusion.” Officials have also noticed a similar pattern among those who are overdue for their second dose of vaccine. There are still 20 lakh people who are overdue for their second dose in the state. Amid this confusion, there are some positive trends as well. Concerns about the rapid spread of Omicron, as well as the announcement of the precaution dose, have elicited an overwhelming response from all eligible age groups. Despite the fact that the targeted age group is only those over 60, authorities are receiving requests from people of all ages. “A lot of us are asking us to give them precaution doses even though they do not qualify under the current guidelines, which is a good sign,” a senior official said. Meanwhile, officials said that four Omicron-tested patients in Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) have serious comorbidities with liver and kidney, but they are all recovering well. There has also been no serious need for any other medicine, they said. “They are also not given any Covid-19-approved drugs. In the hospital, their condition is stable. The others have no symptoms,” an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/changed-phone-numbers-add-to-vax-drive-chaos/articleshow/88625447.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

With over 6 million square feet (sft) of office space being absorbed and residential property rates registering a 3% to 5% jump – the only city in India to record a price rise – it scripted the best bounce back story of the year. The strongest growth corridor: Hyderabad’s IT corridor running through Hi-Tec City-Kondapur-Gachibowli-Narsingi and beyond. City stood second only to Bengaluru that witnessed an office leasing of 7.5 (approx.) million sft during the year. Homes in ‘hitech’ Hyderabad too flew off the shelves, especially between October and December, with over 21,000 units being sold across Hyderabad and Rangareddy. City also saw close to 23,000 new units being -- again highest ever recorded in Hyderabad -- and a 35% growth compared to 2020. “Availability of land, attractive floor-space-index and a growing appetite of home buyers and investors, led to city’s growth through 2021,” said Samson Arthur, senior branch director, Knight Frank India . Some industry insiders predict size of Hyderabad’s office market will surpass even Mumbai by 2024. “There is supply in pipeline – across Gachibowli, Kokapet, Nanakramguda, and this surge is unlikely to stop over next two-three years,” said Veera Babu, MD of Cushman & Wakefield. Recent report by Credai and Anarock pointed to this northward trend in commercial sector attributing it to “vibrant IT/ITeS sector and robust infrastructure development”. While stressing how IT-driven-realty growth is most significant along western corridor, Prashant Thakur, Sr Director & Head - Research, ANAROCK Group said it is likely to spill over into Warangal, Karimnagar and Nizamabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/citys-tech-corridor-sees-fastest-realty-recovery/articleshow/88625449.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

He said the state government had already set up IT hubs in towns such as Warangal, Karimnagar, Khammam and Nizamabad. “Nalgonda IT hub will begin its operations in the next 18 months. It will generate 1,600 jobs to the local youth,” KTR said after laying the foundation stone for the new IT hub in Nalgonda on Friday. He said the government would not only construct an IT hub but also set up TASK centre for imparting training to the youth. “The state government’s aim is to turn locals into entrepreneurs and will work in that direction,” he said. Addressing a public meeting after laying the stone for various developmental works in the town, the minister said CM K Chandrasekhar Rao was keen to change the face of Nalgonda town, which is close to Hyderabad. “The government has sanctioned five basti dawakhanas. Veg-nonveg market will be constructed at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore and two Vaikuntadhamams will be taken up at a cost of Rs 3 crore. A engineering college will also be sanctioned for the town,” KTR said. Telangana may be geographically 11th biggest state and 12th in terms of population. But it is fourth economic power in the country, the minister said. Even Reserve Bank of India in its report said Telangana was one of the biggest contributor of taxes to the country, he said.

He wondered why BJP state president Bandi Sanjay and Telangana incharge Tarun Chugh sat on a deeksha in BJP office for the cause of unemployment when their government itself at the Centre had failed to live up to its promise of giving two crore jobs to youth every year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/vhr-urges-tagore-to-convene-pacmeeting-on-govt-privatisation-bid/articleshow/88625455.cms||---

Now, there is no such need. The new GO has fixed the upper limit. If there is a high budget film, ticket rates will naturally be the maximum,” Sunil Narang, a representative of the chamber, said. He clarified that there was misconception among small budget film producers that the high ticket prices would keep the audiences away. “Ticket prices can be reduced and that is the flexibility the GO gives. Not only that, even if a big budget film is released and if the producers decided to reduce the ticket rates after a couple of weeks of running, they can do so,” he said. Film exhibitors said they have been suggesting to single theatres and also multiplexes not to charge high rates for canteen items. They said if prices were prohibitive, it would have a negative effect and audiences will refrain from coming to the theatres. Film exhibitor Bala Govind Das said there should be no misconceptions about GO No. 120 issued by the government. “It is in interests of film industry and also film-going public,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/go-ensures-ticket-rate-slashing-film-chamber/articleshow/88625457.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Repeal GO 317 on transfers of govt staff: Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar||Hyderabad: BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Friday demanded that the state government repeal GO 317 on transfers of state government employees. He along with state party leaders met governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and urged her to impress upon the state government to repeal the GO which, he said, had created a lot of confusion among the government employees. Speaking to reporters later, Sanjay said: “The way the transfers are being done, it looks like ‘Sakala Janula Samme’ (All People’s Strike) should happen again. Transfers should be put on hold until CM K Chandrasekhar Rao holds a meeting with aggrieved employees. The government does not even have time to listen to employees’ woes.” He said the BJP will wholeheartedly support the employees. He said the GO was issued without any holding talks with the employees. He said many employees were under severe stress. He claimed that the seniority list of employees available with the state government was faulty and that the state government ignored Presidential Orders issued on the subject 40 months ago. “There are serious allegations of massive corruption in the transfers,” he said. He alleged that the government was not even considering the pleas of employee couples, those with health issues and the physically challenged. “We will soon announce an action plan on the agitation against the transfers.” Calling upon the employees and teachers, he said KCR was attempting to create a wedge between junior and senior employees. “The government’s irresponsibility has resulted in a teacher dying by suicide in Mahabubabad district,” he said. Sanjay was accompanied by party MLAs Eatala Rajender, M Raghunandan Rao and T Raja Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/repeal-go-317-on-transfers-of-govt-staff-bandi/articleshow/88625460.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Owaisi will address the rallies, the first of which will be on New Year’s day at Saharanpur. The AIMIM has already announced that it would be contesting 100 of the total 403 assembly constituencies in UP to stop Yogi Adityanath-led BJP coming back to power. Talk in political circles is that the polls may be held in February or March next. With the Election Commission having given clarity that the polls would be conducted under strict enforcement of Covid-19 guidelines, the AIMIM leadership in Uttar Pradesh has planned at least six public meetings between January 1 and 10. Owaisi will address the rallies at Moradabad, Sambhal, Bareilly, Prayagraj and Farrukhabad also. The party is working out a schedule of public meetings at other places between January 11 and 31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/owaisi-to-address-rallies-in-up/articleshow/88625464.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Kolkata restaurants, bars see sudden dip in footfall after Covid cases rise||KOLKATA: The rise in Covid cases led to a sudden and sharp drop in footfall across Kolkata’s restaurants and bars on New Year’s Eve. Till last week, they had expected to get large crowds. Following a nudge from the state, the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India asked all member-restaurants to either cancel or defer their New Year’s events to avoid crowding and strictly follow the 70% cap on seating capacity. Attendance dropped by almost 70% at most restaurants. Kolkata’s party hub — Park Street — that had been throbbing with revellers till Thursday, saw a thinning of crowd on Friday evening and much-restrained celebrations. “We have written to each member, asking them to cancel or defer their New Year’s events. Those who couldn’t were asked to scale down events and prevent crowding at any cost. We have also made it clear that the 70% ceiling on capacity should be adhered to strictly,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. Footfall dropped to just 30% of capacity at Songhai, Manthan and MS Bar, owned by Poddar. The serpentine queues in front of Park Street restaurants either disappeared or shortened considerably on Friday. “While our restaurants are still full, the waiting crowd has thinned. Given the scenario, this was perhaps expected,” said Nitin Kothari, owner of Mocambo and Peter Cat. Attendance dropped at Oudh and Chapter 2 as well. “The attendance was low and it was expected. We have strengthened our Covid norms and are planning to revert to disposable crockery,” said owner Shiladitya Chaudhury. Some, however, felt the thinner crowd and the fact that Park Street remained open to cars led to a far more disciplined celebration, which has never been seen on New Year’s Eve. “It allowed more families to come in as they felt safe without the crowd. It was pleasantly less crowded and the celebrations were different, but more enjoyable,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis. “Our footfall saw a sudden slump on Friday, but we don’t mind since Covid cases are increasing and more restrictions are likely to be imposed next week,” said the owner of another Park Street restaurant. “A set of restrictions might be imposed where we have to maintain a time frame to run our business. But if some rules are needed to prevent something severe, then we will support it,” said Aarunima Dhawan, owner of Hola in south Kolkata.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/restos-bars-see-sudden-dip-in-footfall-after-cases-rise/articleshow/88625465.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Schools send caution messages, await govt safety notice on Mon||Kolkata: Alarmed by the shooting Covid cases and the fast spread of the Omicron variant, many schools are sending out messages to students and parents, imploring them to exercise caution to keep themselves as well as their families safe from the novel coronavirus. Most institutes are waiting anxiously for the state review team’s Monday announcement on Covid-safety measures, from which they will get to know whether or not studies will again go back to offline mode, especially for classes IX to XII. Some other institutes have decided to closely monitor the developments in the first week of January before taking any decision. South Point High School has sent a message to students, cautioning them against the new variant of concern and its high infectivity. Two days ago, the school principal had sent a message, requesting students to take safety measures. “Please wear proper masks and maintain hand sanitisation. The new year festivities must not be the reason for the spread of a virus which we have been fighting for so long,” read the message.Shri Shikshayatan has also started sensitizing students, while The Heritage School plans to send a similar message to students. “We have been continuously sensitizing students and parents over the past few months and we continue with the process for the new variant as well. We hope to understand shortly how the current situation plays out,” said Shri Shikshayatan secretary general Bratati Bhattacharyya. The Heritage School principal Seema Sapru said, “We want to make children aware of the present scene and advise them to avoid unnecessary gatherings.” According to the findings of doctors and experts, the third wave could hit a high in the city in a week and push up cases to an unprecedented number. Many feel safety restrictions are inevitable, and that educational campuses may be one of the first to be shut down for children’s safety. Government officials reviewing the current scene have been in touch with school authorities. “Government officials are also having discussions with us to plan out student’s vaccination. Hopefully, we will get an instruction from the government soon,” a principal said.Some schools in the city, like Don Bosco Park Circus and Julien Day Ganganagar, have decided to wait and watch before taking any decision on campus reopening after the winter break.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/schools-send-caution-messages-await-govt-safety-notice-on-mon/articleshow/88625468.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Uncertainty, safety warnings replace enthusiasm in New Year’s greetings||Kolkata: From hugs, kisses and parties to WhatsApp forwards, virtual meetings and e-cards, exchanging greetings on New Year’s Eve has drastically changed over the two years of Covid. While last year’s messages contained desperation and tragedy as the general theme but had a yearning for a return to normalcy, enthusiasm and hope are entirely missing from greetings exchanged this time. USA-based HR executive Sudipto Banerjee said, “Last year, the messages were more optimistic and hopeful. This year, I have received fewer messages and they are comparatively more formal.”Two trends that have emerged in the 2021 New Year’s wishes are of hope and cynicism. A third emphasises on safety and precautions in the coming year.“…Mr. 2021 is retiring on the 31st of this month…he is retiring with ALL your problems, sickness, disappointment, frustration, untimely death, shame, disgrace, barrenness, discouragement, failure and rejection. His successor – Mr. 2022 asked me to tell you that he is going to compensate you with long life, good health, abundant blessings, peace, joy, righteousness, promotion, uplifting, breakthrough,” reads one message. Physicist and alumnus of Presidency University Keith Basu has received and forwarded a message that says: “This year’s Christmas didn’t Christmas like other Christmases.” “I think the kind of posts or memes we share in my generation reflect a general universal sense of doom and cynicism about our collective future. This is how we cope,” Basu said. Members of a Whatsapp group of Pratt Memorial School alumni have forwarded jokes about how lockdown will be a recurring feature every year if social-distancing measures are neglected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/uncertainty-safety-warnings-replace-enthusiasm-in-new-years-greetings/articleshow/88625469.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 15-18 years can use school IDs for Covid vaccination, register on spot||Kolkata: Youngsters aged 15 to 18 years can register and book vaccination slots on Co-Win or simply walk into a centre for a shot. They can also use their school ID cards as an identity document for registration. The Bengal government allowed these conditions ahead of the roll-out of the inoculation drive for 48 lakh-odd teenagers on Monday. The state has also offered to help schools set up on-campus vaccination sites. In a meeting with private hospitals on Friday, state health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam stressed the need to stock up on Covaxin, the only vaccine allowed for the 15-18 years age group. Three senior health officials—Saumitra Mohan, Y Ratnakara Rao and Rehana Bashir—will head the roll-out. “The new beneficiaries will be those whose birth year is 2007 or before. They will be administered Covaxin, as per central guidelines. They can register and book a slot on Co-Win. Those who don’t have access to the portal, verifiers or vaccinators at the centres will help register and book a slot on the spot,” a health official said. District magistrates have been advised to meet health, civic and district school officials to finalize plans.  The state has given its nod to set up on-campus vaccination camps. TOI has reported that several private schools have already tied up with private hospitals for camps. The state will also ask for data on classes IX-XII students. A health official said, “Schools will be involved actively. All officials have been asked to prepare a list of schools and their eligible students —those in IX to XII—and their contact details. Schools will have a nodal officer who will coordinate with health officials.” He added that Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) can be set up on the premises, with waiting areas, vaccination rooms and observation rooms in place. “The health department will provide support with adequate vaccinators and other logistics,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Colleges reach out to under-18 students ahead of jab drive||Kolkata: Many colleges and universities are reaching out to their undergraduate first-semester students, who are yet to get their Covid vaccine as they are still underage, to get themselves registered for the inoculation drive for 15- to 18-year-olds set to roll out next week.In November, before colleges and universities had reopened for offline classes, institute authorities started collecting data on students’ vaccination status. At that time, they realized a large number of the freshers were yet to turn 18 and so, not eligible for vaccination. This was one of the reasons for junior classes not being called to campuses initially. Now, these youngsters can finally get their shots. At Maulana Azad College, heads of departments have started requesting first-semester students to get themselves vaccinated as soon as the drive starts. “We have details of the number of students who are yet to be vaccinated. Many of them are below the age of 18 years. Till now, they have only been having online classes but once situation gets better and the education department allows, we will be calling them to the campus. It is important that they are fully vaccinated,” said a professor at the college.Many institutes said they might organize camps to vaccinate students if they did not get the opportunity. “Earlier, we conducted several camps for vaccination of students. Once the vaccination drive starts, we are ready to organise camps for youngsters who are below 18 years,” said Swami Mahaprajananda, vice-principal of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira.Before reopening of colleges and universities the education department, along KMC and the health department, had organised vaccination camps for students. “Many students received their first dose from these camps. They will be due for their second doses soon and if the education department organizes similar camps, it will be helpful for students,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colleges-reach-out-to-under-18-students-ahead-of-jab-drive/articleshow/88625471.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Kolkata does better than Christmas weekend, but gatherings still a worry||Kolkata: The city learnt a lesson from its unmasked and unbridled revelry on Christmas weekend and seemed to have taken a cue from the spiking Covid cases as the year drew to an end. Crowds remained thinner than that of previous years at the hot spots, and the largely maskless revelry last weekend was replaced by a more sober and restrained celebration on Friday. However, a large number still ventured out without masks or dropped them at the party spots, forcing cops to penalize them. Till 8pm, 464 people were prosecuted in Kolkata for not wearing masks.While most popular destinations saw moderate attendance till evening, the thick crowd that Park Street gets on New Year’s Eve was missing till late in the evening. Doctors and experts, however, felt the consistent crowding over the past week has hastened transmission.Kolkata Police commissioner Vineet Goyal went to Park Street, as did Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim and his senior colleagues. They distributed masks to those who didn’t have any.Cops put in an effort to maintain Covid norms and rebuked all those not wearing masks. At Eco Park, those without a mask were detained by cops for 30 minutes near the gate and given masks before being allowed inside. Several without masks were detained by the police at the Lake Town New Year carnival. A deputy commissioner chased down a reveller at Park Street around 6pm for failing to follow orders. By evening, as the action shifted solely to Park Street, three checkpoints came up between Park Street and Mullickbazar. Those without a mask were provided one and a few who still defied were promptly fined. The stretch from New market to Park Street that had been spilling over with crowds on Christmas evening, had over 50 cops manning each crossing. Access to Allen Park was cut off. A total of 3,000 cops were deployed on Park Street.By late evening, the crowd movement was made one-way. Most were diverted to Free school Street and Middleton Row. “We ensured not too many went towards Camac Street so social distancing could be maintained,” said an officer. Men from the detective department and south division ensured there was no unnecessary crowding in front of restaurants. At Dorina crossing, Exide and PTS, traffic flow remained normal for most of the day. At Nicco Park and Eco Park, the crowd count dropped to half of what was recorded on Christmas. A mere 2,400 visited Nicco Park compared to 4,600 on Christmas. Authorities said they appointed teams to coordinate with police and ensure Covid norms were followed. But many still dropped their masks, said the authorities. At Eco Park, cops used guard-rails to create enclosures where the ‘maskless’ were detained.The day’s vigil began at Victoria Memorial and Alipore zoo, with cops making announcements, asking people to wear masks. Around noon, senior officers conducted a check of Park Street and last-minute changes were finalized. It was decided that if Park Street got overcrowded, cops would divert people towards Camac Street. But the crowd remained sparse till late in the evening. As the evening progressed, the police made continuous announcements, asking people to maintain Covid protocol. Goyal said. “We want people to enjoy, but that cannot be at the cost of security of the individual or at the cost of public health safety.”Cops, though, are keeping fingers crossed for January 1, a Saturday. “We are keeping a big force at Park Street, Maidan, Victoria Memorial and Alipore zoo for the entire weekend. The crowd will persist since many tend to avoid central Kolkata and Park Street on New Year’s Eve, but go out on January 1,” said a DCP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-does-better-than-christmas-weekend-but-gatherings-still-a-worry/articleshow/88625473.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||‘Take Cov beds to the level of first wave’||Kolkata: The Bengal government on Friday asked private hospitals to increase their Covid beds like the first wave levels due to the fears of an imminent third wave and large scale spread of the virus. The state also asked the hospitals to “stock up essential medicines, LMO (Liquid Medical Oxygen) and other necessary support systems to manage and treat Covid patients.” The hospitals with laboratories were also asked to share regular patient-related data with the state government to help them gauge the spread of Covid in the districts.Addressing the slow pace of genome sequencing that will help in understanding the transmission of Omicron in Bengal, at a meeting, the state health secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam also assured that the state will try to increase frequency of sending samples from School of Tropical Medicine to the Kalyani-based National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. The samples from private hospitals are now sent to STM for RNA extraction and then sent to Kalyani for genome sequencing twice a week.On precaution dose rollout from January 10, the state told private hospitals that they were awaiting more clarity from the Centre. According to sources, the health secretary acknowledged that without the lack of proper guidelines from the Centre, it will be difficult to start booster dose for HCWs and senior citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/take-cov-beds-to-the-level-of-first-wave/articleshow/88625474.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: TMC kicks off Bidhannagar campaign||KOLKATA: As party candidates started campaigning for the Bidhannagar civic polls, Trinamool Congress on Friday tried to resolve rumblings of dissidence over candidates in 2 of the municipal corporation’s 41 wards. Bengal fire minister Sujit Bose, MLA Aditi Munshi and former councillor Debraj Chakraborty called meetings of party workers through the day to resolve the tussle. Party workers in at least two wards openly demonstrated their disaffection towards the selected candidates and demanded that leaders of their choice be fielded. In wards 1 and 6, they blocked roads, burnt tyres and shouted slogans against candidates Pinaki Nandi and Samrat Barua while backing renomination for outgoing councillors Ganesh Roy and Amit Roy. “I had called in all the candidates to discuss the nomination process. The poll strategy will be decided later,” Bose said. On the agitation in the two wards, Bose said the issue would be sorted out. Emphasising larger representation for women, several fresh faces have been inducted into the poll fray this year. Leading the pack is Aratrika Bhattacharya in ward 3, the daughter of MLA and former BMC deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee. Also in the fray are ward 38 ex-councillor Nirmal Dutta’s wife Alo Dutta Roy and ward 5 candidate Nandini Banerjee, who replaces long-time councillor Swati Banerjee. “I will try to continue the good work of my husband and for the development of people in Duttabad,” said Alo, who was among the first to start campaigning as she painted her own graffiti on Thursday, immediately after nomination. Senior leaders such as outgoing mayor Krishna Chakraborty and her predecessor Sabyasachi Dutta too began their campaign in full flow. Dutta visited the Salt Lake swimming pool complex area in BF block, known to be his stronghold, late on Thursday to meet people right after nomination from ward 31. Chakraborty took out a car rally in ward 29. “I seek people’s blessings,” she said. Many are stressing on campaigning via social media due to the new Covid surge. “I have a Facebook page to connect with people,” said Tulsi Sinha Roy, a four-time councillor nominated from ward 40.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-kicks-off-bidhannagar-campaign/articleshow/88625475.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

However, even as airport authorities are amused by the rising numbers, claiming it signifies a positive sign for the aviation industry, travel agents in the city feared the numbers would dip sharply this month owing to the fresh turbulence — rise in Covid cases across the country. Airport officials credited the rise in passenger footfall in Kolkata to RT-PCR relaxation, lifting of travel bans from individual cities and removal of flight passenger cap, which helped it go past the November and October figures, as the airport started registering 50,000 passengers on an average each day since December. “The airport has been registering 50,000 passengers on an average daily for the last few weeks. There were around 15 lakh total domestic passengers using the airport this month, which is the highest in a month this year and is a positive sign for the aviation industry. We have also upgraded our safety checks, testing and sanitization procedures to ensure safety of all passengers as we head towards pre-Covid footfalls,” said a senior airport official. In December 2020, the Kolkata airport had clocked 10,49,279 passengers and the year before it had registered 21,00,785 passengers. Since November this year, the state revoked the mandatory RT-PCR norm even for the vaccinated passengers, making air travel easier for those flyers who have already received both the shots of Covid vaccine. The month earlier, flight restrictions from some cities in Maharashtra and Gujarat, which were in place for more than a year, were revoked too, thereby giving an impetus to domestic air travel. Such was the situation that the Union government was encouraged to lift the restrictions on international flight movement, but the Omicron scare halted the process. As a result, while Kolkata now has around 170 plus arrivals daily, there are only four or five international arrivals in a day. The tourism industry is, however, not very upbeat with the rising numbers this month as they find that future bookings are already dwindling because of the increasing Covid numbers in the country. “With the rise in Covid cases, multiple states shutting down and international borders being sealed again, there would be a slump in air travel from January,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Federation of Travel Agents’ Federation of India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/amid-fresh-cov-hit-turbulence-50-more-footfall-in-dec-21-than-last-yr-at-kol-airport/articleshow/88625477.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Health officials have stepped up the second jab coverage and it now hopes to cover another 1.4 crore eligible adults by January. With enough vaccine stock officials said the ‘precautionary dose’ rollout will not have any impact on its second dose drive. By noon on Friday, more than 4 crore adults in Bengal were fully vaccinated, while 6.5 crore-plus got the first dose. “About 55% of all the eligible adult population in Bengal have got the double dose, while around 89% have been covered with first jab. The first dose drive has become slower after attaining about 85% coverage. But attempts are on to increase the first dose coverage,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. For weeks now much thrust is being given on the second dose drive, especially after the state achieved about 85% first dose coverage. “It is true that many are getting infected even after the vaccine coverage. But the vaccine has given protection from severe infection. It would have been great if we could have achieved 60% to 70% second dose coverage before the third wave,” said a public health expert attached with a medical college. There has been a sustained effort to administer 5 to 6 lakh doses per day, a majority of it being the second. On New Year’s Eve, close to 6 lakh doses had been administered across the state from 4,897 vaccination sites. Health officials said that the daily first dose count has gone down to just about 30,000. “This 25,000-30,000 first dose offered daily is due to efforts like door to door campaigns,” said another health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-touches-4cr-milestone-for-2nd-jab-targets-another-1-4cr-adults-by-jan/articleshow/88625478.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Liquor revenue nears Rs 2,000 crore mark in December||KOLKATA: The state has witnessed the highest ever revenue from liquor in a month in December following drop in prices last month. It is touching Rs 2,000-crore mark, which is almost 25% more than the pre-Covid level. The sale of bottled in origin (BIO) and overseas spirit bottled in India (OSBI) have gone up almost four times in December. Incidentally, these segments have scotches and very premium vodka and gin. Liquor industry sources said that the revenue from liquor at close to Rs 2,000 crore has never been achieved in the history of the state. “The average revenue in pre-Covid times in December used to be Rs 1,500-1,600 crore. In that respect it is quite an achievement. This is a landmark and will itself create history,” said an official of a top liquor company. He also said if there was no closure for election (KMC) for three days, the figure would have been in excess of Rs 2,100 crore. The state excise commissioner Umashankar S though did not comment on any figure but added that there has been an overwhelming response for BIO. “There is a major jump in sales of premium liquors,” he added. India Made Foreign Liquor, beer, bottled in origin liquor (BIO), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI) and wine prices came down by 20%-35%. For beer, the fall was, though, marginal (5%-6%). For some IMFL, the dip was 25%. For some BIOs, the fall was more than 35% and in some cases for OSBI and BIO, too, the new price was lower than pre-pandemic level. Director general of Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), Vinod Giri, pointed out that it is happy to note the jump in alcoholic beverages sales in West Bengal this December. According to him, West Bengal is usually known for progressive excise policy framework. One of the leading liquor retailers, Hiranmoy Gon, pointed out that a lot of consumers have shifted to premium brands in last one month. “We have praised the decision of excise commissioner to make the price highly competitive and we could see the results now,” he added. The president of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar also said the liquor sale during December has crossed all records of the decade. “Had there been no dry days owing to elections the sales could have been even higher. Overseas Spirit is the highest gainer with sales increasing 2-3 times,” he added. Incidentally, Bengal is a market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer annually.

The traffic police is one of the finest and most visible, too. But, we need to continuously upgrade ourselves. Now, with the rapid advent of technology, several people are falling prey to cyber crime. Our force has already taken a number of measures in this regard. Now, each division has a cyber cell which is being strengthened,”said Goyal.The commissioner also focussed on Covid. “It is not only Kolkata but the entire world which has spent the past two years in immense difficulty. The Covid cases are rising again. We would request everyone to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. We appreciate the support the citizens have provided us so far. The reason our track record is good is because we are seen as a people-friendly police. We thank the people for this support. We will wish that, as before, we will continue to get your support. We hope you will follow Covid appropriate behaviour. We want you to enjoy. But that cannot be at the cost of your health or the safety of other people. I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year,” he said.The commissioner said he would be taking a tour of the city on New Year’s Eve. He promised upgrade in all units of the force, including traffic. “This is my first day. I will surely look at all angles.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/focus-on-cyber-crime-cov-goyal/articleshow/88625480.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bhutan road construction behind bear straying in N Bengal: Experts||Jalpaiguri: The frequent incidents of straying of Asiatic black bear in the past 30-45 day has been triggered by construction of roads through their habitat in the jungle tracts of south Bhutan, say foresters and wildlife experts. On Wednesday evening, a female adolescent bear was rescued from Rydak river bed near Newlands beat under Kumargram Range in Buxa Tiger Reserve in Alipurduar. After a health check, the animal was released on Thursday morning in its natural habitat.This was the 20th incident of black bear straying in Dooars and Dajeeling since mid-November, an extremely unusual phenomenon, say veteran foresters. A Bengal tiger was also recorded by camera trap in Buxa after nearly three decades, again possibly displaced from its own territory.“Now that we know that Bhutan is building roads in areas which are habitats for Asiatic black bears, their straying is understandable. Even tigers may be migrating to the Indian side for safety. These are transborder animals and so it is difficult to identify which animal belongs to which country,” said Shyama Prasad Pandey of SPOAR (Society for Protecting Ophiofauna & Animal Rights).In the past, there have been very few cases of bears straying out of the jungles with sporadic cases being reported in Buxa’s Jayanti and Neora Valley in Kalimpong.Soumya Dasgupta of Wildlife Institute of India said: “In India no census has ever been conducted to enumerate bear population. Asiatic black bears are synanthrope, i.e., their food habit is similar to the food found in this region. In winter, they generally come out for food as their habitats go relatively dry. If Bhutan is building roads, they will definitely enter lower tracts, which is the region that’s witnessing the straying.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bhutan-road-construction-behind-bear-straying-in-n-bengal-experts/articleshow/88625481.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Crackers and nylon nets back in action as tiger enters village again||Kolkata: Only a couple of days after a full-grown tiger, that had entered a village in Kultali and was released back into the forest after an 140-hour operation, presence of another tiger in a Gosaba village under Sunderbans Tiger Reserve area kept the foresters and villagers on their toes on Friday. Villagers of Chargheri, on Friday morning, saw pugmarks of a tiger at Bali-r Char area on the banks of Gomar river. A local villager said that they had seen movement of an animal on Thursday night itself but on Friday morning, after seeing the pugmarks, they became sure that it was a tiger. The pugmarks were spotted close to a mangrove thicket in the village and the villagers apprehended that the tiger was possibly hiding there. Soon, a team from Sunderbans Tiger Reserve reached the spot and fenced off the entire area with nylon nets to separate the village nearby from the forest patch where the big cat was hiding. According to them, the tiger has probably come from the forest of Jhila compartment on the other side of the village. A local source, however, said that tiger can also come from the forest of Pirkhali I, walking along the nylon net fencing and after crossing Pichkhali and Garal rivers. Sunderbans Tiger Reserve deputy field director, Justine Jones, said that they suspect the big cat had probably moved into the village in the wee hours of Friday. “Though we are yet to spot the tiger, we have heard it growling. We are bursting crackers and have fenced off the area. We want to drive it back to the forest,” Jones added. One being asked if any trap cage has been placed to capture it, Jones said the focus of the department was to drive it back to the forest. “Since the forest of Jhila is located just 60 metres opposite the site where the big cat is hiding, we want to drive it back to the mangroves. During the low tide late in the afternoon, we had to slow down the operation as tigers, under such circumstances, usually prefer a high tide when they can swim back into the forest,” he added. A few hours after the high tide started (it started after 3 in the afternoon, a source said) the forest staff again started their operation — by bursting crackers — to drive it back to forest. “We have strung nylon nets on one side of the mangrove thicket to make sure the tiger can’t cross over to the village. We have kept the other side open so that it can return to the forest. Two of our boats are stationed at the location to check if it swims back to the forest. If it doesn’t return tonight, we will think of alternative arrangements on Saturday morning,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/crackers-and-nylon-nets-back-in-action-as-tiger-enters-village-again/articleshow/88625482.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee

With the northwesterly gaining strength, the mercury will continue to plunge slowly, said the Met office. It may settle between 14 and 15 °C on Saturday and slide to 12-13 °C by January 4.“With the clouds moving away and the sun breaking through, the minimum temperature has started dropping. With no obstruction in its path, the northwesterly should now continue to flow in and bring in chill from the icy Himalayan peaks. But the drop in temperature will be slow,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das.Last week, a western disturbance reached Gangetic Bengal through central India from Jammu & Kashmir. It eventually turned towards east, triggering clouds and rain in Bihar, north Bengal and western parts of Gangetic Bengal. Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum received moderate showers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mercury-drops-slide-may-continue/articleshow/88625484.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Restos, bars see sudden dip in footfalls after cases rise||Kolkata: The rise in Covid cases led to a sudden and sharp drop in footfalls across Kolkata’s restaurants and bars on New Year’s Eve. Till last week, they had expected to get large crowds. Following a nudge from the state, the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India asked all member-restaurants to either cancel or defer their New Year’s events to avoid crowding and strictly follow the 70% cap on seating capacity.Attendance dropped by almost 70% at most restaurants. Kolkata’s party hub — Park Street — that had been throbbing with revellers till Thursday, saw a thinning of crowd on Friday evening and much-restrained celebrations. “We have written to each member, asking them to cancel or defer their New Year’s events. Those who couldn’t were asked to scale down events and prevent crowding at any cost. We have also made it clear that the 70% ceiling on capacity should be adhered to strictly,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. Footfall dropped to just 30% of capacity at Songhai, Manthan and MS Bar, owned by Poddar.The serpentine queues in front of Park Street restaurants either disappeared or shortened considerably on Friday. “While our restaurants are still full, the waiting crowd has thinned. Given the scenario, this was perhaps expected,” said Nitin Kothari, owner of Mocambo and Peter Cat.Attendance dropped at Oudh and Chapter 2 as well. “The attendance was low and it was expected. We have strengthened our Covid norms and are planning to revert to disposable crockery,” said owner Shiladitya Chaudhury.Some, however, felt the thinner crowd and the fact that Park Street remained open to cars led to a far more disciplined celebration, which has never been seen on New Year’s Eve. “It allowed more families to come in as they felt safe without the crowd. It was pleasantly less crowded and the celebrations were different, but more enjoyable,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis.“Our footfall saw a sudden slump on Friday, but we don’t mind since Covid cases are increasing and more restrictions are likely to be imposed next week,” said the owner of another Park Street restaurant.“A set of restrictions might be imposed where we have to maintain a time frame to run our business. But if some rules are needed to prevent something severe, then we will support it,” said Aarunima Dhawan, owner of Hola in south Kolkata.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/restos-bars-see-sudden-dip-in-footfalls-after-cases-rise/articleshow/88625485.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The accused, Manimoy Mondal, claimed to be a doctor by profession, according to sources. A complaint regarding the fraud was lodged with Hare Street police station against the man by the highest office of administration in March last year, after which the detective department took over the probe. “We went through the leads and traced one of his trusted aides. It was through him that we caught Mondal,” said a police source. Joint CP (crime), Murlidhar Sharma, refused to share any details on the arrest. “The case is still being probed and it has several nuances. We will not like to comment on the arrest,” he said. “However, his credentials are being verified,” said an officer. However, cops are still not clear about his motive. “He might be posing as an IPS officer posted with RAW, but we are not sure why he committed the crime. We are not sure whether he had passed on suggestions to the senior administrative heads. We are questioning him in this case,” said an officer. Cops have slapped fraud charges along with criminal conspiracy. “We have produced him in court. We are planning to record the statement of some witnesses, based on which we can question the accused further,” said an officer. Cops have decided to ascertain if others had helped him in this crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/doc-poses-as-a-raw-officer-lands-in-police-net/articleshow/88625486.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police suspect it to be a suicide case and on the basis of clothes and footwear it was assumed to be of a man. Police suspect that the man died around six months back. The building remained closed due to which the incident did not come into light. Mangalwara police registered a case and started investigations. SHO Mangalwara Sandeep Pawar said that a four-storied building belonging to MBD Group is located near Sangam Talkies in Mangalwara. It remains closed most of the time and the officials visit here rarely. There are two rooms on the terrace of the building.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Seniors more ‘mask-friendly’ than youngsters||Bhopal: Who are the people wearing masks and who aren’t? An answer to this question will have to be divided into several categories- age, gender, area, income and professional groups. Anyone observing the pattern over a period of time can tell you that elderly or middle-aged persons are more particular about wearing masks than the youngsters, women are seen wearing masks than men, residents of new Bhopal are seen in masks more than the residents of old city, residents of posh colonies and housing societies wear masks more than the residents of slum areas and colonies inhabited by lower middle class or poor people and more doctors or teachers are seen in masks than the policemen. “You can blame it on their age. Youngsters obviously don’t fear disease or death so much , maybe it is the reason that they are not seen wearing masks so much as middle-aged or elderly persons. I think their parents should insist with them that they wear masks to protect themselves from Covid-19, which makes no distinction of age or any other factor”, said Akash Agrawal, while talking about a group of youngsters sipping tea at a tea stall outside his office, none of them wearing masks or observing social distancing. Gender-divide in observing the mandatory mask norm can also be clearly seen. Girl students in a college or school are seen in masks even after they have come out of their college or school while boys can be spotted going into the college or school without wearing a mask.  “I think girls have always been more disciplined and it reflects here, too, You don’t have to ask them to wear masks but boys, they often take out masks from their pocket when asked to put on a mask”, said Prerna Shama, a teacher in a private school. In markets and other public places, too, women are seen in masks more than the men in all age groups. The area you are in also makes a big difference in terms of compliance to the mandatory mask norm. In a market at Hanumanganj or Ibrahimpura, you rarely come across shoppers or even traders wearing masks while in upmarket areas like 10 no. stop market, traders and shoppers wearing masks is much much more. “We have seen it right from the beginning of Corona times. Residents of the old city could never come to terms with wearing masks even when many localities were Corona hotspots in the area. More people in the new Bhopal area are seen in masks than the old city”, said Tausif, a resident of Shahjahanabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/seniors-more-mask-friendly-than-youngsters/articleshow/88625503.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

This has put the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials in a fix as they now worry that they would fail to finish the works within the proposed deadline.The Mining and Geology department had sanctioned permit to the construction firm Larson and Toubro Limited, which is carrying out the road works, on December 10 to extract and remove 60,891 metric tonnes of ordinary earth from puramboke land spread over 85.9 areas in Parasuvaikkal village under Neyyattinkara taluk. But on December 24, the firm was served a notice directing them to stop the mining.The notice served by the district geologist said that the department received a complaint alleging that the mining was illegal and the firm’s representatives must appear before the district geologist on January 5, 2022, and produce relevant documents to prove that the mining is done legally to avoid legal consequences.The NHAI officials are perplexed over this action as it was the same department that issued the permit for mining two weeks before after perusing all relevant documents. Two of the major prerequisites to secure the permit were and environment clearance certificate and letters of consent from the owners of land properties in the close proximity of the location where mining would be done, all of which were produced by the NHAI along with the application for mining permit.‘’The validity of the mining permit is from December 10, 2021, to February 28, 2022. If the issue is not resolved soon, we would have to go through all these procedures again, which will lead to further delay. The application for the mining permit was filed back in August, 2021. We can only carry out mining activities when there is no rain,’’ an NHAI official said. He said considering the fact that the state had been receiving excess rainfalls in recent years, they fear that the entire works might get delayed further.Meanwhile, the officials concerned at the Mining and Geology department said that the notice was served after they received a complaint from a local resident.‘’The complainant claims that the land where mining sanction has been permitted shares borders with his 10 cents and his consent was not taken. We have forwarded a letter to the tahsildar and village officer concerned to inquire into the complaint,’’ said an official. Dismissing the allegations, the NHAI officials said that the complainant had initially approached the contractor demanding money and when they refused it, he went ahead and filed a complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mining-dept-notice-to-contractor/articleshow/88625517.cms||---

The parents of the deceased Aneesh George had claimed that the wife of the accused had summoned him to their house over phone.They had even revealed the call history of his phone in which an incoming call from the wife of the accused was the last entry. They also alleged that the accused Lalan and wife knew about their daughter’s relationship with their son. Lalan disapproved of this relationship and hence he had enmity towards Aneesh.Investigation officer inspector Riyas Raja said that this call was made while Aneesh was already at the house of the accused.‘’All the circumstantial evidence lead to the possibility of a murder committed out of sudden rage,’’ the inspector said. The police had traced the route which Aneesh took to reach the house using sniffer dogs and it was revealed that he came through a vacant plot behind the house and entered inside through the kitchen door. This indicates that he wanted to avoid being spotted. If he indeed received the call from the accused’s wife he would have taken the proper route through the main road, the inspector said.The police suspect that the girl’s mother made the call to his phone to warn him before the attack. But he had left that phone at home. Another phone that is suspected to have belonged to Aneesh was recovered from the girl’s bedroom. It was handed over to the forensic experts for detailed examination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/aneesh-murder-police-dismiss-familys-allegations/articleshow/88625519.cms||---

He completed the swim in 2.08.20 ahead of Rajvinayak Relekar of Bengaluru’s Jain University (2.14.70) and Rajat of Rohtak’s M D University (2.15.53). At the nationals in Bengaluru, Aryan had won the gold in 200m by finishing the race in 2.03.52. The Ahmedabad swimmer clinched the gold in 100m butterfly by finishing in 57.14 seconds. Adithya Dinesh, a student of Anna University in Chennai, won silver in 57.37 seconds and Sameer Sejwal of Panjab University, claimed the bronze in 57.63 seconds.Admitting that his timings weren’t best, Aryan said, “I’m not happy with the timings I gave. But, yes a national university medal is a great achievement. It was my first ever University nationals and and it was a great experience.”Lack of tapering (practice of reducing exercise just before a competition) and workload during the off season, Aryan said, played a part in not being able to achieve the personal best timings. “Our training during the off season was mostly based on endurance bulding and technique work. While, the training before a race includes speed work and tapering of work load,” the 17-year-old said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/aryan-wins-2-gold-in-university-games/articleshow/88625524.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s feted terrorist hunter Himanshu Shukla heads to Delhi||AHMEDABAD: Himanshu Shukla, Gujarat’s feted terrorist hunter and the nemesis of hardened criminals, bade farewell to his colleagues at the ATS on Friday. Shukla, who was DIG at the ATS, is headed to Delhi. This 2005-batch IPS officer is one of the rare top cops to serve in both the crime branch and the ATS in Gujarat. He has now been appointed to the grade of director in the class-1 executive cadre of the cabinet secretariat.  In Gujarat, Shukla drew acclaim as an ace case cracker, tackling a series of tough investigations. He will be on central deputation for four years. A notification to that effect was issued by the state home department. The notification stated that the Union home ministry sent a letter on November 21 regarding Shukla’s central deputation. After serving in the Ahmedabad crime branch between 2010 and 2015, Shukla was posted as SP, operations, Gujarat ATS. After joining the ATS he continued to draw praise by solving one case after another. In February 2019, Shukla was promoted to the post of DIG, the ATS. Shukla, who earned the BTech degree from IIT-Kharagpur, had secured the 54th rank in the UPSC exam and could have become an IAS officer. But he chose to become a police officer to eliminate terrorists. Shukla himself believes that his most satisfying achievements were solving terror cases and identifying the terror modules of such outfits as Indian Mujahideen which was involved in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts. “Apart from that, it was gratifying to solve the Bharuch murders of two BJP leaders — Shirish Bangali and Pragnesh Mistry,” Shukla told TOI. “The man involved was Javed Dawood Shaikh alias Javed Chikna, a close associate of the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.” However, Shukla has some regrets which he honestly confesses. “I could not trace an 11-year-old girl named Vishwa Patel who went missing in 2011,” he said. Over a decade, Shukla has spearheaded operations in Gujarat to curb terror on land and to stop it from coming in from the sea. Over the years, he has dismantled drug mafia too. One of the hauls he recovered was among the biggest seizures of heroin worth billions. Only this year, the ATS led by Shukla seized heroin worth Rs 800 crore which was nearly half of the drugs worth Rs 1,617 crore seized by Gujarat Police. Few people know that while serving as ASP Vadodara rural, Shukla had followed the trail of a notorious criminal and loot accused Mehraj Guddu into Etah district of UP and was shot in the abdomen during the arrest on August 17, 2007. Shukla’s pistol jammed and the criminal fired at him. Shukla received the police gallantry award for that operation. After the Vadodara stint, Shukla served as ASP in Sabarkantha. Here, he got the chance to work on the Ahmedabad serial blasts case, which brought him recognition. Working under senior officers such as Ashish Bhatia and Abhay Chudasama, Shukla was instrumental in ferreting out and arresting terrorists of Indian Mujahideen. Courageous and insightful, Shukla has handled the responsibility of a series of high-profile cases, making it clear that when the Gujarat government needs a Sherlock, it calls Shukla. Shukla was the key force behind the detection of the Kamlesh Tiwari murder case, the arrest of the Gandhinagar serial killer in 2019, and the arrest of a Chhota Shakil aide from an Ahmedabad hotel in 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarats-feted-terrorist-hunter-himanshu-shukla-heads-to-delhi/articleshow/88625533.cms||---

Meanwhile, his staffer told him that he did not have money in his bank account as someone had transferred Rs 12 lakh to an account in West Bengal.In another case, a 25-year-old job seeker from Ghatlodia, Raj Zaveri, explored a ‘work from home assignment’ but the cheats, who introduced themselves as owners of the company, took Rs 2.22 lakh from him as ‘processing fees’ on October 16. They then went incommunicado.In two other cases, from Narol and Naroda, two youths, a student and an unemployed man, were approached with job promises and lost Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.46 lakh, respectively.In six cases, cyber cheats posing as bank employees took account details of victims and siphoned off money.In a case from Ramol, a 22-year-old man, who was looking to buy a sports motorcycle, was cheated of Rs 1 lakh by a fake seller.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/10-cybercheating-complaints-filed-in-a-single-day-23l-lost/articleshow/88625534.cms||---

But music with fellow rasikas is like being on a plane crowded with smiles, which takes off with the collective ballast of “wahs” into the arcadia of bright, uninfected rapture. The previous edition of Saptak was a sanitized live stream. On Saturday, in the New Year, Saptak will bring back artists to the stage and allow in 400 fully jabbed rasikas, provided they wear a corona-era accessory, the mask. It is fitting that Saptak’s return to the live format will feature the violin stalwart Vidushi N Rajam. She was the disciple of the Hindustani colossus from Gujarat, Pandit Omkarnath Thakur, who was born in Bhadran. “I have been on with my practice throughout,” Rajam told TOI.As for Pandit Thakur, Rajam said: “Whatever I play is a result of his blessings.” Pandit Thakur’s ‘kaku prayog’, meaning ‘voice modulation’, demonstrated that almost religiously ordered discipline and unconstrained individual panache can be collaborators. In Rajam’s playing, one senses that union between an artist’s liberated instincts and traditional purity. In January 2021, Vidhwan Kumaresh, a Carnatic violinist, had told TOI: “Though Rajam ji talks about the gayaki style on the instrument, I think it is the other way around.” He had added: “Many have tried to incorporate her sound through their voice.” That Kumaresh himself is in the assembly of greats of Indian music reflects the veneration that Rajam draws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-icons-inspiration-to-reboot-live-saptak/articleshow/88625537.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Civil court restrains son from entering father’s house||AHMEDABAD: A city civil court has ordered a man not only to not enter his father’s house but also to not pressure his father to clear the son’s debts incurred after suffering a loss in his business. In this case, a Naranpura area, Nanakram Motiani moved the court in 2017 and submitted that he was a retired bank employee. He has owned a flat in Shastrinagar since 1991. He further submitted that his son, Prashant, was dealing in readymade garments and after a dispute arose in the family, he moved out of the house in 2012 and since then he has been living in Motera. His son incurred huge losses in business and was unable to pay his debts. He was thus pressuring his father to help him out of his financial problems. Motiani also complained that his son tried to threaten him to gain entry to the house. The father, who is in his 70s, requested the court to restrain his son and his family members from pressuring him to clear their debts and to restrict them from entering his house. The court issued notice to the son, but he did not respond, and the court went ahead with ex-parte proceedings and decree. Earlier this month, a city civil judge, R S Purani, declared that the son has no right to enter his father’s house. The son and any other person representing the son has also been restrained from “creating any pressure upon the plaintiff (Motiani) in order to extract any amount against the wish of the plaintiff in order to pay for losses suffered by the defendant (son).” Motiani also feared that because of the debts incurred by his son, financial institutions may try to seize the house. He sought protection against this possibility, but the court said Motiani could not produce any evidence that any bank or financial institution was trying to seize the property to recover their dues or losses caused by his son. Therefore, his demand for an injunction against financial institutions was not sustainable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/civil-court-restrains-son-from-entering-fathers-house/articleshow/88625539.cms||---

One layout will be developed in about 269.3 acres in GS Agraharam and Ramavaram villages, and the other one in Palavalasa (93.8 acres) in the Vizag suburbs. The state government is planning to develop MIG plots in the urban local bodies across the state under ‘Jagananna Smart Towns’. The demand survey for the MIG plots under this scheme received about 3.9 lakh applications from the prospective buyers. As part of the same, the VMRDA identified these different land pockets in the district. As per the preliminary guidelines of the scheme, the plots will be developed in three different sizes – 150, 200 and 240 square yards. According to the estimates, about 4,355 plots will be developed in these two layouts. Meanwhile, the VMRDA has also got approval from the state government to develop two more small layouts in about 41 acres in Vizianagaram mandal. VMRDA chairperson A Vijaya Nirmala said the major objective of the initiative is to provide clear title residential plots at affordable prices to the public. “The layouts will lead to integrated development as they will have all the infrastructural facilities. The plots will be provided at a cheaper price than the market rates,” said Vijaya Nirmala. VMRDA metropolitan commissioner K Venkata Ramana Reddy said all amenities will be developed in these layouts. “The land acquisition would be done through the revenue department. The state-level committee will fix the prices. The allocation will be made in a transparent manner through lottery. The layout development would take about three months. We are also planning to develop layouts in Sabbavaram, Anakapalli, etc.,” said Venkata Ramana Reddy. The VMRDA has long been planning to develop new layouts in the suburbs as the urban development authority has land parcels on all four sides of the city. The joint venture ‘Fortune Hills’ in Dakamarri was the last layout developed by the VMRDA in 2016. As per the guidelines of the Jagananna Smart Towns, the location of the site is such that common facilities like schools, transportation, medical facilities, etc. shall be within a reasonable range. The land selected must be free from litigation. The state government constituted committees at district- and state-level to identify suitable land pockets for the initiative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/plots-for-middle-class-planned-on-363-acres/articleshow/88625546.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

But the journey of the 17-year-old cricketer form Guntur to the cricket pitch has been a tough one, testing him and his family every step of the way.The guiding light has been Rasheed’s father Sheik Baleesha Vali, who stood tall in the face of adversity to ensure his son shone bright. Rasheed is the younger of his two sons. “My father is my real hero as he faced many hardships to see me at this stage. For my training, he shifted the family from Hyderabad to Guntur,” Rasheed told TOI, adding how his mother Jyothi and elder brother Sheik Riaz have always been there for him.It was after observing Rasheed’s passion for cricket that his father Baleesha took a decision to move to Guntur. But the shift was financially crippling and Baleesha had to take up odd jobs, including selling fruits, accounting and work as loan recovery agent for a bank. Though he had never played cricket, Baleesha now coaches children part-time after getting a hang of the game by helping Rasheed at the nets “Eight years ago I was working in sales in an automobile shop in Hyderabad, earning around Rs 50,000. But for his training, we shifted to Guntur in 2012. I joined jobs for as little as Rs 7,000 to keep the family going,” Baleesha told TOI. Rasheed’s coach J Krishna Rao is also all praise for his hard-working student. “He is a tactically sound player and can mould himself according to the situation. His dedication has elevated him to the Indian team,” Rao said. The young cricketer’s skill was on full display in the semifinal against Bangladesh where his 90 guided the boys in blue to victory. In the final against Sri Lanka on Friday, which India won by 9 wickets, Rasheed scored an unbeaten 31. Rasheed was selected to the U-16 team when he was 9 and scored the highest runs in three matches — including a 309 against Srikakulam in Anantapur. He was inducted into the cricket academy at Mangalagiri later. Rasheed led the U-14, U-16, and U-19 Andhra teams and made his mark as captain. He scored the most runs (256) and also won the trophy for his team (Team D) in the U-19 Challengers Trophy.His true test will come in the U-19 World Cup in the West Indies next year. Rasheed said that two people helped his family a lot. One is doctor Indrasena Reddy of Hyderabad, who has been supporting Rasheed since 2013 by providing necessary equipment every year. The other is SBI regional manager Srikanth, who even helped Baleesha get a loan recovery agent’s job. Rasheed’s Ravindranagar club head Sitapati describes him as guy with a cool head and always ready for practice. “His world is totally different. Even on a rainy day, he would go for fitness training,” Sitapati said. Rasheed’s elder brother Riaz, an engineering student, said, “We hope that he performs well in World Cup and also gets selected in the senior team,” he said.It’s a dream that his father Beleesha is hoping will come true soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/sweet-success-for-rasheed-as-he-charts-a-tough-course-to-the-top/articleshow/88625547.cms||Siva G

He said that the virus of communal hatred being sown by vested interests groups is equally dangerous as the Covid-19 pandemic.He said, “As we move into the New Year, there is a new Covid variant, called the Omicron, which is dangerous. We, therefore, request you to be safe, take care and all necessary precautions, so that we do not experience the same sadness and loss that we experienced during the second wave last year.”Expressing concern over the emerging communal hatred in the country, he said since Christmas, a dangerous trend is coming up in India. “I call this the communal variant, which is more dangerous than the Omicron variant. This country is always known for peace and harmony but is now witnessing disturbed Christmas and namaz. People are turning into mobs aimed at disturbing others while celebrating their festivals. This variant is out to destroy our country,” he observed.He urged all governments to be proactive to stop the sowing of seeds of hatred by evil forces.

---||Ranchi||Almost a month on, no end in sight to HEC impasse||Ranchi: With no end in sight to workers’ strike, the six-decade-old Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd.(HEC), Ranchi, is going to step into the new year with all its plants shut and production and delivery schedules in complete disarray.Nearly 3,000 workers at HEC have been on a voluntary tools down strike since December 2 to demand payment of wages that have gone unpaid since July 2021.Till date, five rounds of talks with workers — twice with labour officials, once with HEC CMD and twice with HEC directors, two official appeals by HEC and even a no-work-no-pay threat have failed to break the ice. While workers remained adamant that they would return to work only after all their outstanding wages are cleared in one go, HEC says that with near empty coffers, it does not have the means to accept demandsNo help is either forthcoming from the Union ministry of heavy industries. An urgent meeting between the Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey and HEC directors on December 16 and 17 yielded no result after the former declined to come out with any revival package for the ailing corporation.After 30 days of uncertainty, the only silver lining that is slowly visible is that workers as well as trade union leaders are now striking a conciliatory tone. Against their original demand of a down payment of all unpaid wages in one go, workers have now modified their stance to demand payment of wages in three instalments — two months’ wages forthwith to be followed by another two months’ back wages in January 2022 and the balance in February 2022. On its part, HEC cleared 15 days’ wages for June 2021 on December 13 and followed it up by paying the balance 50 per cent on December 24. Though workers have privately lauded HEC's efforts, they have continued to abstain from work, pointing out that they are yet to receive any concrete assurances from either the Union ministry of heavy industry or HEC management."This strike has been initiated by workers after being forced to go hungry for six months. No trade union is involved and no strike notice has been served on the management either, as required under the law. Now that the strike is already 30 days old, it would be in the interests of both the HEC management and the workers to work towards finding an amicable solution," Bhawan Singh, president, Hatia Mazdoor Union said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/almost-a-month-on-no-end-in-sight-to-hec-impasse/articleshow/88625557.cms||Tapas Biswas

The work has been started by IMC at three locations including Piliyahana, Kandilpura and Chandmari, as the old sewer lines at these locations failed to handle the inflow of wastewater. As per officials, the recent sewer rectification and channelization work has increased the flow of sewer in the old lines, and has led to choking or excessive flow in secondary lines. These issues have been reported in three areas and rectification work has been started by IMC. At Agriculture College, a 1200 meter primary line has been planned between Agriculture College and MP Tourism Office to diverted the inflow of 100mld sewer and supply it to the main line of BRTS. At Kandilpura, a parallel line is being installed on a stretch of 1200 meters to address a leveling issue. And at Chandmari, the inflow of sewer is being diverted and supplied directly to GNT market with help of a new line. “The secondary and old lines were installed to manage the flow of sewer at a certain limit, but with increasing population and settlement in different areas of the city, the load of sewer in those lines has also gone up,” claimed sources. IMC additional commissioner Sandeep Soni also admitted the issues and said that rectification work has been started at all three locations simultaneously. “We are installing bypass lines at identified sites to handle the increased flow of sewer, and also in view of the future requirements related to any further increase in the flow,” said Soni. IMC was engaged in a mega sewer rectification and channelization project for the last one year or so, and closed down around 7000 major and individual outfalls. Around 75km new lines were also installed to channelize the flow of sewer and wastewater, and also to prevent its mixing into water bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/sewer-rectification-to-be-done-in-3-areas/articleshow/88625579.cms||---

The row erupted after two groups started demanding the civic authorities to name the circle after Dalit icon BR Ambedkar and poet laureate Kuvempu. In the first week of December, a few residents tried to install a bronze statue of Ambedkar at the circle, but the civic authorities and police denied permission, leading to protests in the locality.To end further problems, the MCC authorities, after holding discussions with both the groups, took steps to remove flexes and demolish the circle on Thursday. It may be recalled that in mid-September, the civic authorities had prevented installation of a statue of late actor Vishnuvardhan by his fans at Vishnuvardhan Park located near Kote Anjaneyaswamy Temple at the Mysuru Palace North Gate.Mayor Sunanda Palanetra told TOI that the authorities want people of all communities and religions to live in peace and harmony in the city. “We do not want people to clash in the name of caste and religion. There has been a demand from two groups to rename the Mathrumandali Junction after two great personalities. To resolve the issue, after discussion with community leaders, residents and local MLA, we demolished the junction,” she said.Pointing out that there are no disputes on erecting statues in other circles in the city, the mayor said the officials are looking at developing one high-tech junction at a prominent place in all the 65 wards coming under MCC. “So a high-tech junction will be developed at Mathrumandali junction at a cost of around Rs 2.5 crore in a few months,” she said.MCC, during the council meeting in 2000, had named the Kurubarahalli Junction (Jockey Quarters Circle) after 18th century freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna. “However, recently some organisations have installed the statue of Sangolli Rayanna at the junction. As the situation in the state is still tense over miscreants damaging Rayanna statue at Belagavi, MCC has yet to take a decision on the issue,” a senior MCC official told TOI.However, citizens told TOI that there are enough statues of great personalities in and around the city. “Instead of fighting for installing new statues, people must use the funds to repair and maintain the existing statues of their leaders. This will reduce the burden on MCC. The funds generated can also be used to help the financially poor children as preached by all the great personalities,” said Chandrashekar, a resident of Paduvarahalli, close to Mathrumandali Junction||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mayor-no-disputes-over-statue-elsewhere/articleshow/88625585.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

Anandaiah, who supplied ayurvedic medicine for Covid-19 during the second wave, moved the high court seeking to direct Nellore district officials not to refrain people from coming to his home for medicine. Anandaiah argued in his petition that the police were not allowing anyone to come to his home for medicine and constables were stationed outside his home and they were sending people back. He stated that the people were coming for medicine for Covid-19 and he did not claim that he has medicine for Omicron variant. Apart from medicine for Covid-19, people used to come for medicines for other ailments also. The Nellore district officials are not allowing anyone to get medicine from him which is nothing but violation of his rights and the rights of the people also, said the petition. The Nellore district officials and state Ayush commissioner issued a statement recently appealing to people not to believe anyone who claims to have medicine for Omicron variant after some reports went viral on social media quoting Anandaiah that he has medicine for the variant. Police are restricting people from going to Krishnapatnam in view of the past experiences of traffic snarls. People had rushed to his home during the second wave. As there is no scientific basis to the claims of Omicron cure, the officials are suggesting not to believe such claims. An earlier petition by Anandaiah was heard by the Chief Justice's bench.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/hc-cj-to-hear-anandaiah-plea/articleshow/88625602.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||A year of political success for Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s dispensation||VIJAYAWADA: 2021 has been a year of success for the ruling YSR Congress as it won every election with a thumping majority, from village panchayats to municipal corporations. The party registered a record in the local bodies elections, pushing the opposition parties to an insignificant position. The ruling party, amid controversies and allegations of highhandedness, could win more than 98 per cent of local bodies including Kuppam municipality, which was represented in the assembly by TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu since 1998. The party also wrested the Legislative Council from TDP taking its strength from nine in 2020 to 32. The party also wrested the Legislative Council’s chairperson and deputy chairperson posts from TDP by establishing a clear majority in the 58-member Upper House. It was a great fall for TDP which was holding a majority in the House, giving up seat after seat to YSRC. The year was such that it could not field any of its candidates either in the assembly quota or the local bodies quota, where YSRC enjoys unquestionable majority. BJP lost its strength from four members in 2020 to two in 2021. Its state unit president Somu Veerraju too had to retire from the House completing his single term. While Congress and Jana Sena have no presence, the Left parties which have entered the House through the graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies retained their strength at five in the House. However, in policies, YSRC had to roll back several of its decisions in 2021. The major setback was the withdrawal of the three capitals bills in the assembly. Though the CM claimed that the government would reintroduce the bills, it was seen as an administrative failure on the part of the government. Another major step backward was the withdrawal of the resolution made in the assembly for the dissolution of Legislative Council. The CM had the Legislative Assembly pass a resolution in 2020 seeking abolition of the Legislative Council, which was then held by TDP. A year later, YSRC went back on the decision. The government took several zigzag steps on its liquor policy and finally by the end of 2021, it had gone back to the old policy, by bringing down prices, restoring more walk-in stores and reintroducing popular brands.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/a-year-of-political-success-for-jagans-dispensation/articleshow/88625603.cms||Gopi Dara

Bodily offences and property offences also witnessed an increasing trend in 2021. However, city police bettered their performance with increased conviction rate and property recovery. Vijayawada city police commissioner Kanti Rana Tata released annual crime data on Friday. Though crimes against women witnessed an uptick, it was because of the outreach programmes and free registration of cases based on calls received on the Disha app. Property offences registered a growth of 18 per cent in 2021, an increase from 1,103 to 1,358. While the increase in number of cases is a cause of concern, city police have managed to arrest the accused in 62 per cent of cases and recovered 74 per cent of stolen property, said Kanti Rana. Road accidents and cybercrimes were on the downward trajectory in 2021, which is a healthy sign observed Kanti Rana. He said Vijayawada city has one of the best cybercrime teams. “Over the years they have not only cracked many complicated cases but also educated people on various modus operandi of cyber crooks,” he said. Kanti Rana further noted that road accidents were also on the downward trajectory in 2021 and they wanted to further improve the traffic situation in the city. “We are going to introduce a slew of changes in traffic management with an aim to reduce accidents and also to ensure smooth flow of traffic,” he said. As part of the special drive against drugs, ganja and illegal liquor, city police performed better than other police units in the state, said Kanti Rana. He observed that special drives will continue in future and surveillance on the ‘blade batch’ and other anti-social elements will be enhanced. He said they have opened history sheets against several people and are even recommending externing five persons from the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/crime-on-uptick-in-vij-but-cops-better-conviction-rate/articleshow/88625605.cms||---

The Bhakra Beas Management Board, Chandigarh, in its meeting with the officials from Rajasthan on Thursday refused to allocate water for irrigation from January 12 due to poor water level in Pong Dam in Kangra and Bhakra Nangal Dam. This year, poor rainfall in the catchment area of both the dams followed by a poor spell of rain in winter has made the situation worse. The board has cleared that it is most unlikely that the water supply will become normal due to poor rain even in the month of December. Rajasthan has 50% share in Pong Dam which is facing a shortage of water that has led to the crisis. The water from these dams is divided into three states – Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. Amarjeet Meharda, an official of the state waterworks department who attended the meeting, told TOI, "The allocation of water is governed by a set of rules which are not allowing us to receive water for irrigation. The only consolation is that the board has agreed that if rain will come by January 12, they can review the decision." Experts say that farmers require water supply for irrigation till February for their Rabi crops else the productivity or the quality will decline. Crops like wheat and mustard are very popular in Hanumangarh and Sri Ganganagar. Estimates say that over one lakh hectare of land is under wheat cultivation in the area. Farmers have started registering their protest anticipating the delay in water supply. "State has to knock the doors of the Central government which can arrange additional water from other resources. The Rabi season is very important for the farmers since it generates 70% of the annual income," said Balbir Singh, a farmer in Hanumangarh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/west-raj-farmers-to-get-less-water-from-jan-12/articleshow/88625613.cms||---

Talk shows, workshop, and folk music were also organised during the four-day event. The paintings and photographs gave a peek into the mindset of the artists during lockdown and their perspective towards the world. “There was a clear sky during lockdown due to less pollution, but farmers were protesting and people were dying in hospitals in the worst medical emergencies in the country. I have tried to put it on a canvas,” said Prashant Sarkar, another organiser of Anugoonj.Many new artists got a chance to showcase their paintings in a gallery. According to Kirti, renowned artists do not have problems selling their work, but newcomers struggle a lot. “It is all about how you market your talent. We have picked up artists from Jhunjhunu and other parts of Rajasthan, who never got a chance to display their work. Senior artists still have an upper hand in majority of the art galleries, but in Anugoonj we wanted to help the newbies,” said Kirti. Although times have changed and a new artist can promote his/her work on social media, politics of art galleries are yet to be broken. “Having talent and the right platform to market one’s product is very important,” Kirti said.Some of the artists whose artwork were displayed at the event included Jhunjhunu’s Iqbal Khan, Georgia’s Nathela Sajaia who made a decorative owl and Pradeep Negi who did a charcoal sketch of Amitabh Bachchan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/budding-painters-brush-with-bigwigs-at-jkk/articleshow/88625616.cms||---

Apparently, the body was buried without seeking permission from his kin, depriving a man from his fundamental right of last rites as per his religion. The bitter revelation of burial came with a letter to the deceased man’s wife seeking her power of attorney to a senior officer of investigating department of Moscow, Russian Federation, to exhume the body to hand over to kin in India for last rites. Hitendra Garassia (46), a resident of Godwa village in Udaipur, had gone to Russia in April this year through a travel agent for employment. The family members, on September 17, were informed through local police station that Hitendra had died in Russia and the Russian police had recovered his body on July 17. Since then, the family members have been running from pillar to post for Hitendra’s body, however, the Russian authorities, of late, refused to send the body out of Russia even after investigation was over and asked the kin in Rajasthan to travel to Russia and perform burial within Russia disallowing cremation in their country. Following the protest by Hitendra’s family members in New Delhi on December 4, prior to Russian president Putin’s visit, the Russian embassy as well as the Indian embassy assured them to speed up the process of dispatch of the body. The kin had also moved Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur pleading the intervention of judiciary in facilitating the home return of the body. Hearing the matter, Rajasthan Hingh Court took a serious note on the issue and asked Centre to take the best possible measures to bring back the mortal remains of the tribal person from Udaipur. The high court, in its next hearing in the matter on December 20, asked the Centre not give consent for obsequial rites of Hitendra Garasia to the Russian government till the next date. The next date of hearing in the matter is January 4, 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/udaipur/russia-buries-udaipur-man-secretly-kin-livid/articleshow/88625620.cms||---

Participating in the Bandhutva Christmas celebrations at his official residence in the coastal city, Bishop Saldanha said, “Freedom is at the core of his teachings. Misinterpretation of what allurement means will end affecting many charitable initiatives that have been undertaken lawfully, and this is a matter of some concern.”He pointed out that, while Jesus was a contradictory figure for some, while he was rejected by others, many followed him willingly and with love. “Jesus does not reject anyone who follows him,” the Bishop said. Quoting a passage from the Bible, Bishop Saldanha said, “‘One can follow him (Jesus) only if he/ she wants to follow him,’ is what the Bible tells us. The laws laid down by the Catholic Church forbid forced conversion or conversion by fraudulent means. Reports about forced conversion are being exaggerated.”Questioning the fixation with forced conversion in the context of the anti-conversion bill, which was recently passed by the legislative assembly, he said that, misunderstanding of the activities of the church could hamper the many activities undertaken to help the needy. “Who is responsible for this preoccupation?”he asked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/church-forbids-forced-conversion-bishop-saldanha/articleshow/88625629.cms||---

As the work of constructing a new building in the district court premises is underway, there is no space for lawyers to park their vehicles. A seven-storey eco-friendly building that is being constructed will have various features like a rainwater harvesting system, roof-top solar power system, etc. The building is being constructed on 2.5 hectares of land behind the existing court building. The new building will house 45 courts against the existing 34 courts. The existing building faces a shortage of rooms to accommodate courts and other offices. The building will also have waiting rooms, canteens and video conference halls. Nitin Thakre, the president of the Nashik bar association said that lawyers are unable to park their vehicles at the existing place owing to the construction work that is underway. The construction will continue for at least two years and hence, the parking problem will persist. Against this backdrop, we have written to the senior officials of the Nashik Zilla Parishad asking them to provide some space at the Shivaj Stadium for parking vehicles. Thakre said, due to the unavailability of the parking space, the lawyers and staffers of the district court have to park their vehicles outside the court premises. Daily, at least 500 four-wheelers and close to 1,500 two-wheelers are parked on the premises. For the convenience of all these people, we have approached the Nashik Zilla Parishad for giving us space at its stadium. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Stadium is just opposite the district court, and it will be feasible for the lawyers to park their vehicles there. The other option is to use the pay and park system at the district collectorate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/space-sought-for-parking-lawyers-vehicles-from-zp/articleshow/88625638.cms||---

Shruti was found hanging by the ceiling fan of her room at around 1.30pm on Thursday.

---||Shimla||No GST compensation from this year, tough time for HP||Shimla: Managing the finances will be a challenge for the Himachal Pradesh government from June 2022 onwards as the Centre would stop paying GST compensation which is effective only till June 2022. Himachal Pradesh had to get Rs 7,000 crore protected revenue from GST in this financial year and any shortfall in this amount was to be compensated by the Centre. The state’s GST collection is Rs 4,500 crore and remaining Rs 3,500 crore comes through compensation.If this was not enough, revenue deficit grant (RDG) will also be reduced in the coming years as per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, which will adversely affect the finances of the state government. Under the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, the amount of revenue deficit grant to the state was cut by around Rs 1,100 crore last year, while cut in 2022 is to be more than Rs 2,000 crore.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India’s report, for the year ending March 2020, tabled in state assembly during the winter session has revealed that public debt of the state government increased from Rs 27,910 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 40,572 crore in 2019-20, registering an increase of 45.37%.The burden of interest payment ranged from 9% to 10% of the revenue receipts. During 2015-20, 45.83% to 72.71% of debt receipts were used for discharging existing liabilities. However, from 2015-16 to 2019-20, while GSDP has grown at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 7.69%, the outstanding public debt has grown at a faster rate of 7.77%.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur during his meeting with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday had demanded the extension of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation facility for the next three years. He said that Himachal Pradesh was a hilly state having tough topographical conditions.The CM said that less allocation of revenue deficit grant under GST is resulting into huge loss to the state. He said the issue has been taken up with the Centre. He said that if Himachal Pradesh has to become self-reliant, major projects like proposed greenfield airport in Mandi district are required as it will not only boost tourism activity but will also generate employment.Border issueHimachal Pradesh has taken up the issue of boundary dispute with Ladakh with Centre and at Morni with Haryana government respectively. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that issue of encroachment by Ladakh at Sarhu and Shinkula is a matter of concern. He said that last year matter was raised in the regional council meeting held in Chandigarh and now after the elections of 5 states, regional council meeting would be held in Himachal where issue would be raised again. He said that Himachal Pradesh has interstate border dispute with Haryana at Morni hill and he took up the issue with Haryana government.

---||Shimla||Cabinet rejig likely in Himachal Pradesh after state polls||SHIMLA: A cabinet reshuffle is on the cards in Himachal Pradesh after election results of Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab are declared in 2022. According to sources, performance of ministers, beside the results of by-elections of Mandi parliamentary seat along with Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seats would also play a key role in the reshuffle. As the BJP is eyeing to win Himachal Pradesh again, it would not mind dropping few faces and inducting new faces, added the source. Besides the government, some changes are also expected in the state BJP unit ahead of the Assembly polls. Sources said that by making changes in the Cabinet and organisation level, a message would be given that performance of leaders would be the sole criteria to hold the key positions in the government and organisation. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Friday has not ruled out the changes as he said that some changes at the government and organisational level are expected after the assembly elections of 5 states. He said that these changes would take place only after a discussion at the party level. Jai Ram Thakur said that after the results of by-elections, party workers were feeling low but the recent rally of the PM at Mandi has boosted their morale as unprecedented rush of people had gathered at Paddal ground. “In the history of Himachal Pradesh, such a huge rally was never held as Paddal ground was packed to capacity while thousands of people were sitting infront of big screens at Seri Manch. Thousand could not reach the venue as they were stuck in jams,” the CM said. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mandi rally has given the message of hard work and BJP government and organisation both will strive to achieve the target of “Mission Repeat” in 2022. He said that Prime Minister’s rally in Mandi charged up the entire cadre. Commenting on the Congress party, Thakur said it is no threat as it struggling to survive. “The Congress is struggling for its survival. In 2022, the Congress in Himachal Pradesh will witness a lot of changes as many camps have cropped up within the party. The Congress is on the verge of division in Uttrakhand, while in Punjab, it is already divided,” the Himachal CM added Thakur also claimed that that BJP has a strong high command and after elections of 5 states, focus of PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda would shift towards Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/cabinet-rejig-likely-in-hp-after-state-polls/articleshow/88625668.cms||Anand Bodh

Police said M Kausalya, 23, and O Muthupandi, 30, have admitted to murdering the baby as they had two daughters and didn’t want to raise a third. Kausaluya had given birth to a girl child on December 21 at the Sedapatti primary health centre. However, a few days after the birth, the child died and the family secretly buried the body and left along with their two other daughters. The infant’s body was exhumed on Wednesday and postmortem examination revealed the cause of death as skull bone fracture and contusions on the right side of its head. “The parents confessed to murdering the baby by hitting its head against a wall. It appears they already had family disputes and with already two girl children, they couldn’t afford to raise another. Hence they committed the murder out of frustration,” said V Baskaran, superintendent of police.On Friday, Muthupandi and Kausalya were both arrested and remanded to judicial custody and the case against them was also altered to murder. The couple’s two other daughters are under the care of their maternal grandmother and may be sent to a children’s home if they are unable to take care of them. Madurai SP warned the public that strict action would be taken against anyone committing female infanticide, and urged to alert the police if they come to know of such a crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/absconding-parents-arrested-confess-to-killing-infant-girl/articleshow/88625672.cms||---

No visitors were allowed and this was very strictly followed,’’ she said.Health activist A Veronica Mary says the directorate of medical and rural health services, which gives permission to private hospitals, should also monitor them strictly during the pandemic.`` Hospitals should also be made to display their bed strength, occupation and number of Covid patients prominently on their notice boards and websites so that at least people visiting them would be cautious,’’ she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/crowded-lifts-and-maskless-faces-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/88625673.cms||---

PM Narendra Modi has ensured that the poor get all the benefits. The biggest thing done by Modi ji in UP is the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.” Shah said, “I can see an overwhelming crowd everywhere, and it indicates that we are again going to win over 300 seats in the coming assembly elections.” Shah targeted SP chief Akhilesh Yadav over the Ram temple issue, saying, “I would like to tell Akhilesh babu that the constructing the Ram temple has started and no one can stop us now.” Shah said due to the efforts of PM Modi, pollution in the Ganga has reduced and now the water of the river has become very clean, and that people of Bareilly should visit Kashi corridor and offer Ganga water in Baba Vishwanath temple.  “Now, UP has shifted from the path of corruption to the path of development.

---||Patna||Pre-budget meet: Deputy CM pitches for special central assistance to Bihar||PATNA: Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad has pressed on Centre for special assistance to the state, besides relaxation in the rules to help it raise money through market borrowings for carrying out developmental activities so as to sustain the high growth rate that has been achieved over the last 15 years. Prasad, who is also Bihar’s finance minister, made the two demands at the pre-budget consultative meet with the state finance ministers for the 2022-23 convened by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman at Delhi on Thursday. Bihar, at present, is faced with severe financial crunch, specifically from the 2021-22 financial year, Prasad pleaded. Prasad demanded that the Centre should relax the rules for the state under Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to have fiscal deficit up to 5% against the mandatory 3%, and also remove the conditions that arrest the efforts to raise money through market borrowings from financial institutions. The additional resources are required to maintain te state high growth rate, increased developmental expenditure and keep the momentum on the increased capital expenditure needed to create new assets, Prasad said. Presenting the state’s factual position, Prasad noted with concern that the Covid pandemic, along with the increased expenditure on the establishment cost and other committed expenditures (like pension, etc.), increased expenditures to meet the crisis created by flood and drought annually, besides the cuts in the funds made by the Centre itself on various centrally supported schemes since 2018-19, has presented “a serious financial challenge” for the state during the current and coming financial years. Despite the increase in Bihar’s own revenue receipts over the last 15 years, as much as over 50% of the total revenue receipts in any financial year comes from the central pool of taxes and other grants and also by way of the central funds pertaining to the centrally supported schemes, Prasad told the Union finance minister in a memorandum submitted to her. However, the cuts made by the Centre in the funds meant for the centrally supported schemes and the shedding of its share on these schemes have put an additional burden on the state, as the government has to meet the costs, like on Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, payment of salaries to university teachers as per the 7th Pay Commission, among others, from its own resources, Prasad said, adding that it has depleted the state resources for developmental activities and capital expenditure. Mentioning the Niti Aayog report in which Bihar’s performance has been put below national average and also not satisfactory compared to other states, Prasad said the state, indeed, has remained backward despite high growth rate and achievements made in the development of roads, power and other infrastructural activities and needed special central assistance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pre-budget-meet-dy-cm-pitches-for-spl-central-assistance-to-state/articleshow/88625680.cms||Abhay Singh

They have set up Covid wards and conducted exercises to verify the operation of oxygen plants and other equipment necessary for treating serious patients. According to sources, all 92 private hospitals in the district have also been asked to keep their beds reserved and equipped with proper oxygen supply system. They have been told to set aside separate beds for children. Patna civil surgeon (CS) Dr Vibha Kumari told this reporter on Friday, “Medical teams have been deputed at the 112-bed Patliputra Sports Complex, which is also serving as an isolation-cum-treatment Covid facility. All sub-divisional hospitals and community health centres have reserved 10 beds each.” She added, “There is no shortage of oxygen or medicines in any location.” Ruban, Paras, Mediversal, Medipark, Apollo, Udayan, and Sahyog are among the prominent private hospitals asked to establish Covid wards. “Private hospitals will be required to adhere to government directives and share information about Covid patients admitted for treatment,” the CS said. Meanwhile, Dr I S Thakur, the superintendent of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), said, “Although there is no Covid patient admitted here, 36 beds with oxygen supply are available at the hospital. A larger facility with 102 beds will open on Saturday afternoon.” In fact, the PMCH reportedly generates more oxygen than it requires for its beds through the plants installed by the state government. Besides, the entire mother and child health (MCH) building at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) has been designated as a Covid centre with 100 beds. Dr Binod Kumar Singh, the medical superintendent of the NMCH, stated that 25 of these beds were reserved for Omicron and the remaining 75 for Delta cases. “Two pressure swing adsorption oxygen generating plants and one liquid medical oxygen plant are fully operational here. All necessary medications, including Remdesivir, are available for the treatment of Covid patients,” he said and added, “There are 850 beds in total, including those in the MCH building.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pvt-govt-hosps-buckle-up-to-tackle-third-covid-wave/articleshow/88625684.cms||VK Tripathi

Total 44 flights would operate under the revised winter schedule against the existing 48 flights operating from the city airport at present. SpiceJet will launch a new flight (SEJ 3839/3840) on Kolkata-Patna-Kolkata route from January 5. SpicJet will operate total 11 flights from the city airport, against 13 operated by it till Friday. IndiGo will operate the highest number of 19 flights, one less than 20 operated by it till Friday. GoAir airlines will continue to operate nine flights. Air India will keep its five flights operational from the city airport, while Vistara has dropped a Bangalore flight from its schedule and will now operate a single flight from Patna to New Delhi in the evening. The operation of flights will start everyday from 9am. The last flight is scheduled to depart at 8:15pm. No flights are allowed to land at the airport normally before 9 or even 10am in winter season due to foggy conditions usually from mid-December. Thus, most airlines tweak their schedule by cancelling their morning flights and add flights in the afternoon under their respective winter schedule. Changes in timings are also made in the evening flights. The tweaked timing for flight operation usually continues till mid-February. “Dense foggy conditions are not being witnessed yet, but the airlines have tweaked their schedules in order to prevent major disruption in operations in the coming weeks. Moreover, we have got more space for passengers owing to the ongoing extension of the terminal building,” an airport official told TOI on the condition of anonymity. Much of the troubled flight operation at Patna airport has been linked to shorter length of runway, which aggravates the situation when the visibility is poor due to fog cover. Against the total runway length of 2,286m (7,500 feet), only 1,954m (6409 feet) remains available at the time of take-off because of location constraint of the airport. Accordingly, flights are allowed to take off or land here only when the visibility is 1000 metres or above. Nevertheless, the daily passenger footfall at Patna airport remains in the range of 9,000-12,000 at present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/4-flights-to-remain-suspended-from-today/articleshow/88625685.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The bank is looking at a new digital strategy that will provide customers a uniform experience across all digital and self-service channels. The bank has sought to hire someone who is technically qualified in information technology and has worked for at least 19 years in digital leadership roles in the financial sector, of which five years must be at the senior management level. Unlike in the past when the chief digital officer (CDO) had a technical role, the new position will have wider responsibility. This would involve driving the growth of customer acquisition and acquiring new-to-bank customers across various segments including retail, SME and commercial banking. The CDO will also have a business role to play in measuring the return on investment in digital projects. While the bank has not specified the compensation, it said that salary would not be a limiting factor for suitable candidates who will have perks on a par with the ones available for deputy managing director. In addition to CDO, the bank has hired nearly 500 executives laterally for information technology roles at lower levels. These include roles like developer, database administrator, cloud administrator, infrastructure engineer and forensics.

It will also invest 25 million pounds as growth capital in Faradion to accelerate a commercial rollout. RIL has been investing in new energy assets such as Norway’s REC Solar, India’s Sterling & Wilson Solar, Germany’s NexWafe, Denmark’s Stiesdal and US’s Ambri to build its portfolio as it looks to move away from fossil fuels. Based out of Sheffield and Oxford in the UK, Faradion has an intellectual property portfolio covering several aspects of sodium-ion technology. The technology has wide use applications from mobility to grid scale storage and backup power. The $74-billion RIL will use Faradion’s technology at its proposed energy storage factory in Jamnagar (Gujarat), it said. The Faradion investment is part of its strategy to enable and accelerate its transition to green energy as it aims to become a net-zero carbon company by 2035. In June, RIL had announced an investment of Rs 75,000 crore in clean energy. “The Faradion investment will further strengthen and build upon our ambition to create one of the most advanced and integrated new energy ecosystems,” RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said.

ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (I-Pru MF) on Friday said it was launching India’s first silver exchange traded fund (ETF), a new investment scheme for which markets regulator Sebi had given the green signal about two months ago. After the regulator announced the operational guidelines for silver ETFs in late November, several fund houses had filed a draft prospectus with Sebi to launch these schemes. I-Pru MF’s silver ETF is slotted to open on January 5 and close on January 19, the fund house said. According to I-Pru MF head (product & strategy) Chintan Haria, silver ETFs could become one of the preferred ways for investors to take exposure to the precious metal since the ETF route eliminates the need for buyers to ensure purity, quality or liquidity. “Silver is among the preferred options globally when it comes to investing in precious metals. This is because silver is considered as a store of value, a hedge against inflation and has very limited correlation with other asset classes,” Haria said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/i-pru-mf-to-launch-indias-first-silver-etf/articleshow/88624134.cms||---

According to the latest report by the Indian Foundation of Transport Research & Training (IFTRT), there has been a 15%-20% extra arrival of fresh fruits and vegetables into APMCs. “Factory output and exports have also remained brisk helping truckers to post robust revenue for last two quarters,” said SP Singh, senior fellow & coordinator, IFTRT. What has also helped improve transporters’ margins is the migration to CNG. “There has been large scale migration of 10-15.5 tonne medium and light commercial vehicles from diesel fuel to CNG which has further helped the fleet owners of this category make more money per tonne/km,” said Singh. Diesel price throughout December has stayed flat and the buoyancy in the overall economy in agri food business, trade commerce and industry including exports allowed the increase in truck rentals, said the report. Trunk routes like Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi, Delhi-Chennai-Delhi, Delhi-Hyderabad-Delhi and Delhi-Kolkata-Delhi have seen a 4% increase in rentals between November 1 to December 31. Routes like Delhi-Bangalore-Delhi is up 3%. In real terms it is an increase of Rs 5,000- Rs 6,000 per round trip.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/truck-rentals-go-up-3-4-in-december/articleshow/88623945.cms||---

The current account, which reflects the net position of trade in goods and services and international transfer of capital, was in surplus in the preceding quarter as well as the corresponding quarter last year. The deficit for the quarter ended September 2021 was $9.6 billion — 1.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP), the RBI said in a statement. A key reason for the deficit was petroleum imports of $39 billion, which led to an outgo of $23.5 billion during the quarter after adjusting for exports. Petroleum imports were $18.8 billion in the corresponding quarter last year and have been consistently rising this year, from $28 billion in January-March 2021 to $31 billion in April-June 2021. The current account position recorded a surplus of $6.5 billion (0.9% of GDP) in the quarter ended June 2021 and was $15.5 billion (2.4%) in Q2 of FY21.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/current-account-hits-9-6bn-deficit/articleshow/88624168.cms||---

He told the media here on Friday, that the Udupi handloom saris have a very good market potential, because of its demand. He said, “The state is facing a shortage of about 80% for saris. The production through professional hand weavers in the district meets just about 20% of the market demand of the nation. To promote handloom weaving, the government has plans to open a textile park on 20 acres in Karkala, and skill-development training for youth will be imparted there. The textile park will also promote the ready-made industry.” The minister lamented that traditional handloom weaving is on the verge of extinction, as the young generation is not interested in taking up the hereditary profession. “The senior members of the weaver community, whom I met today, are hopeful of future generations continuing the profession. The government has plans to impart skill-development training to members of families engaged in weaving handloom. The proposed textile park in Udupi will have a separate training centre for skill development in handloom for youth. The government will introduce schemes to attract youth towards the handloom industry,” he said. “The government has already decided to consider handloom weavers as farmers, and extend the benefits of various schemes to them. Monetary assistance is being credited to the bank accounts of handloom weavers, through the Karnataka Nekar Samman Yojana, and Rs 122 crore is reserved for subsidies to be given to them. The textile department has been employing more than 12 lakh people in powerloom, handloom and textile industries in the state,” he said. “A team of technical experts in the textile industry will be sent to Udupi to solve various issues pertaining to the traditional methods of handloom weaving. Based on their report, the government will take necessary steps to promote handloom weaving. Youth are not interested in the vocation, due to a lack of sufficient income. Hence, leaders of the weaver community will be invited for a meeting in Bengaluru, and plans will be chalked out to increase their income,” the minister said. State Ethanol PolicyHe said that a State Ethanol Policy will be introduced to increase ethanol production in the state. He said that ethanol can be produced using sugarcane, paddy and maize grown in the state. “A team of experts from the state will visit Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where ethanol is produced in large quantities. I will also hold a meeting with the central government in this regard. Those who produce ethanol will be given subsidy and government support. This will not only increase ethanol production, but also increase the profit of farmers. Sugar industries in the state will also profit through the move,” he said. The ethanol produced in Karnataka will be procured by the government, and the same will be sold to petroleum companies. All sugar factories in the state that applied for ethanol manufacture licence will be given permission, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/schemes-to-attract-youth-towards-handloom-industry-on-anvil/articleshow/88622483.cms||---

But it will also bring to mind times when the bull rally fizzled out as inflation rose in most major economies, prompting several central banks to stop the money flow by slowing their bond-purchase programme. The sensex scaled the 50k mark for the first time in January and rose steadily to break above the 60k mark later in the year as Reliance Industries as well as leading software and financial stocks rallied. Starting at 47,751 points, and despite the weakness that was seen in the last two months of the year, the sensex ended 2021 at 58,254 points, up 22%, while the Nifty on NSE rallied 24% from 13,982 to 17,354. The rally made investors richer by about Rs 81 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation closing the year at Rs 269 lakh crore. HDFC Securities MD & CEO Dhiraj Relli said the market cap-to-GDP ratio touched an all-time high globally and in India due to large liquidity flows, low interest rates, expectations of early return to normalcy and low returns from other asset classes. Among various things, the bull rally in the Indian market led to the emergence of tech-driven, consumer companies on the public market through the IPO route. Food delivery app Zomato was the first major one to show the path, which was quickly followed by online cosmetic retailer Nykaa, tech-enabled financial products retailer Policybazaar and digital payments solutions provider Paytm. While Zomato and Nykaa had blockbuster D-Street debuts, Policybazaar struggled and Paytm left many investors poorer. The relentless rally on D-Street also gave birth to a virtual race between Mukesh Ambani, the head of RIL, and Gautam Adani, the head of Adani Group, for the crown of Asia’s richest. While Ambani’s wealth grew at a steady pace, the growth of Adani’s total wealth leaped several notches to take him within a few billion dollars of the head of the most valued company in India. A strong stock market for most part of 2021 also attracted retail investors to open demat accounts in record numbers and start trading in equities. The rally also prompted risk-averse investors to take the mutual fund route with the November-end assets under management at a record Rs 37.3 lakh crore and monthly SIPs at just over the Rs 11,000-crore mark, AMFI data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-gains-22-in-2021-to-end-over-58k/articleshow/88624117.cms||---

The local administration has joined hands with social organisations to provide state-of-the-art tools under its pilot project, Udbhav, for the purpose. The partnership has led to the provision of 43-inch smart TV, Bluetooth speakers, high-speed internet, white boards and pen drives in the schools. State education department’s Diksha app will feed the content. “While the primary aim is to enhance learning outcomes in children, it also aims to boost their confidence. In addition, the relationship of smart class experience with school attendance will also be measured,” said joint magistrate, Barabanki, Sumit Yadav, who led the project. He added that it had been clubbed with ongoing Mission Kayakalp in which government schools are being upgraded with smart class facilities, playgrounds and libraries besides guaranteed basic amenities like safe drinking water and toilets. The first such school got functional at Purva Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Police Lines on Thursday. “It was great to see children all smiles the moment smart TV was switched on. Lessons learnt from Project Udbhav will be used to draft an upscale version for the district,” he said. Officials said the plan was to saturate all government schools of the district with such facilities in future.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/11-govt-run-schools-in-barabanki-to-get-smart-classes/articleshow/88624744.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The weather department expects the cold wave or cold-wave like conditions to persist for two more days, while the minimum temperatures may rise slightly from January 3. Track the pollution level in your cityThe pollution levels, however, may spike or remain in the same category due to the lower wind speeds, weather analysts said. An air quality index (AQI) of 321 was recorded on Friday as against 286 on Thursday and 267 a day before. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the New Year celebrations on the 31st night may increase emissions and worsen AQI, but the net effect is likely to keep it in the “very poor” category for the next three days. “Maximum temperature shows a tendency to increase slightly for the next three days,” it stated. While Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded a minimum temperature of 3.8 degrees Celsius, three notches below the season’s average, as against 3.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier, Narela recorded the lowest temperature at 3.5 degrees. The maximum temperature was 19.4 degrees Celsius, the season’s average. “The city may see rain by the end of the first week of January,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). The chances of fog formation is low. “By January 4, another strong western disturbance is likely to hit the region. This may spike the minimum temperature to 7-8 degrees Celsius by January 4,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures may hover around 20 and 4 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/city-shivers-at-3-8c-as-aqi-slips-into-very-poor-category/articleshow/88623812.cms||---

He has not been able to find regular work since the first lockdown began. After the second Covid-19 wave, Kumar could only find work for 6-7 days in a month. Now, once again, he is experiencing a sense of deja vu because of the construction work ban owing to air pollution and a probable third Covid-19 wave that would result in scarce employment. A cobbler Umer wonder how they will endure the third lockdownBefore the pandemic struck, Kumar’s daily earnings ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 800. The lockdown cut his earnings completely, but his expenses rose steadily. To cover medical expenses and his children’s school fees, he dived into his savings. But when the lockdown dragged on, he sent his family home to his village in Bihar to harvest the small agricultural land they owned. Their journey home took nearly 10 days on foot. Kumar stayed behind hoping to find work when the Covid restrictions eased. With a non-negotiable Rs 5,000 monthly rent and no steady income, he found himself taking loans once he ran out of his savings. This recurring trend was witnessed with many migrant workers who reeled from unemployment and found themselves wound up in a debt trap. Umer, a cobbler from Alwar in Rajasthan with a kiosk in Aurobindo market, lost his earnings because of Covid-19. He borrowed money to pay for rent and food. But with the third wave approaching, he may not be able to repay his lenders. He may also have to borrow more money to make his journey back home. Though Umer was grateful for getting free rations from Delhi government, he said, “I still have bills to pay without any income. The government promised to reduce my daughter’s fees, but nothing has been done. Where is the monetary help they promised?” The suffering of migrant labourers and the urgent need for the government’s support became even clearer when autorickshaw driver Babu Lal said, “If there is another lockdown, it will be our death. The government and God hold the same power now.” During the last lockdown, he completely ran out of funds and was grateful when a regular customer lent him some money. Now, he is wondering how he would be able to endure the third wave. Nadeem Quereshi, a daily wage labourer, had an extreme viewpoint and questioned whether a pandemic even existed. “There have been no deaths in my village. I feel it’s a ruse by the corrupt to make the poor suffer,” he alleged. He claimed that the lockdowns were useless and had lost faith in the government. Hopelessness, apprehension and submission to a greater power, be God or the government, was what most migrant workers were experiencing with the impending third wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/starvation-debt-trap-bigger-viruses-being-battled-by-migrants/articleshow/88624397.cms||Arundhati Jain

Officers may purchase devices and accessories, including desktop, laptop, i-Pad, i-Phone, smartphones, printer, scanner, UPS, webcam, sound system, storage devices, memory card readers, networking equipment, software services, etc. “The Goa government desires to grant reimbursement for IT devices to its executive officers, viz all officers belonging to Goa Civil Service (GCS) and Indian Administrative Service as well as those non-GCS administrative officers who are holding the post of HoDs. A reimbursement upto the ceiling of Rs 1 lakh once in five years will be granted to these officers,” stated Anju Kerkar, join secretary general administration. The department of information technology is rolling out various initiatives whereby G2C (government to citizen) and G2G (government to government) services are being provided through online portals. For a wider and smoother adoption of online portals, senior functionaries should be well-equipped and highly familiar with computer workstations, printers and other technology devices to carry out such tasks online. Senior government functionaries also need to promptly monitor and respond to online instructions being issued by chief minister’s office (CMO), chief secretary’s office through email or WhatsApp. These officers also need to attend an increasing number of meetings with other departments and the government of India through video conferences. Kerkar stated that NIC studios are limited to cater to all of such video conferences, especially done through non-NIC platforms (Webex/zoom/Vidyo). The CMO is also now implementing monitoring tools like Pragati. Additionally, inter-departmental coordination is possible through IT tools, like for example Pragati, Microsoft Teams/Slack and Google Drive. The IT department is also in the process of implementing e-Office and other online application modules. “Therefore, departmental heads and other key administrative functionaries should be equipped with technology devices for wider adoption of new initiatives. Senior functionaries such as HoDs should possess personalised devices such as tablets and laptops for seamless and uninterrupted adoption of such services,” Kerkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-to-shell-out-rs-60cr-on-tech-devices-for-6k-officers/articleshow/88639735.cms||TNN
---||Goa||Another rebellion within BJP as Priol unit opposes party ticket to Gaude||Panaji: After drawing flak from party workers in Saligao and Porvorim constituencies, BJP state unit is now at loggerheads with its workers in Priol over the induction of independent MLA from Priol and art and culture minister Govind Gaude into the party. Strongly opposing Gaude’s entry into the party, the Priol mandal threatened to field a local BJP worker as an independent candidate and get him elected, while BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade has firmly stated that if Gaude joins the party then he will be given a BJP ticket to contest the 2022 assembly elections. BJP Priol mandal has demanded party ticket to Sandip Nigalye. Last time BJP had represented Priol constituency in 2002. In 2007, MGP had won the seat, while in 2012 BJP supported MGP in Priol due to a pre-poll alliance, and in 2017, BJP supported Gaude to defeat MGP. “The Priol mandal wants a candidate to contest on party symbol, and if Gaude joins he will contest on the party symbol,” Tanavade said. “We have invited Gaude to join the party, but still he has not taken a decision and may be he will have to resign as MLA.” The BJP Priol mandal held a meeting with Tanavade to discuss who should be the candidate for Priol constituency. BJP Priol mandal president Mahesh Shilkar said that they will wait for two more days for the party decision on the candidate. The Priol mandal stated that during the last two assembly elections they followed the instructions of the party as they wanted BJP to form the government, but this time, they have decided not to obey their diktat. “We want a party worker to win 2022 assembly election, whether it is on party ticket or as an independent. Even if somebody comes from another political party or an independent candidate comes to BJP, the symbol will change, but his ideology and his thinking will not change,” he said. “If the party doesn’t give a ticket to a party worker then we will field the candidate as an independent.” Shilkar said that in the last three terms, candidates from outside the constituency have been elected as Priol MLA and the BJP mandal is working hard to get a local candidate elected. He said that the party organisation is strong in Priol and whoever BJP has supported in Priol as a candidate has gone on to win the assembly election. “This time BJP’s candidate will become Priol MLA and the party will support us,” he said. BJP’s Priol unit has started door-to-door campaigning and has covered around 6,000 houses. Shilkar said that earlier they used to think that MGP will benefit in case there is a fight between Gaude and BJP, since MGP forged an alliance with TMC, it is now clear that BJP will win the Priol seat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/another-rebellion-within-bjp-as-priol-unit-opposes-party-ticket-to-gaude/articleshow/88639725.cms||TNN
---||Goa||Goa teen death: After ruling out foul play, cops now register murder case||PANAJI: There’s a new twist in the case of the 19-year-old woman whose body had washed ashore on Calangute beach on August 13. After initially ruling out foul play into her death, Calangute police have now registered a case of murder against unknown persons. Police said that the investigation in the case was never closed, but with the registration of the murder case, “We will now investigate the reason behind the death”. TOI was first to report on the inconsistency between police and GMC statements in the aftermath of the case. On its August 21 edition, the newspaper reported that North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena said that police were open to further forensic investigations based on the woman’s preserved viscera, if the family demanded it. However, a forensic department official said that there wasn’t an iota of evidence that the teen had been murdered or sexually assaulted, due to which the viscera wasn’t preserved. “The police believed there was no foul play and that the manner of her death was suicidal. So where was the question of preserving the viscera?” he said. The postmortem report had cited her cause of death as asphyxia due to drowning. The teen’s family and neighbours have been demanding justice for a while now. Her body was discovered on a busy stretch of Calangute beach in a semi-nude condition, with her clothing nowhere in sight. Till date, police have not been able to locate her clothes. Family members demanded that a murder case be registered and investigated along those lines. Political parties too demanded that the case be registered as murder. Following a public uproar, police had launched an investigation into various angles, including murder, suicide and accidental death. The sister of the deceased had submitted details of call records and messages to the police for investigation. Based on these, police summoned several people to Calangute police station for inquiry. Police had said that even after questioning the people who had contacted the girl before her death through calls or messages, they have not been able to draw any inferences. Police had also examined the CCTV footage of beach shacks located near the area where the teen’s body was found but had not found anything useful.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/teen-death-after-ruling-out-foul-play-cops-now-register-murder-case/articleshow/88639746.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Akhilesh Yadav to EC: Aren’t IT raids on SP men violation of model code?||KANPUR: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Friday that income tax raids on SP functionaries were a result of the huge crowds that turn up for the Samajwadi Vijay yatra. Talking about the Income Tax searches at the residence of SP MLC and perfume trader Pushparaj Jain who launched the Samajwadi Perfume, on Friday, he said frequency of such targeted harassment of political leaders will increase as elections draw close. He said, "I will urge the Election Commission that if it comes within the purview of the model code of conduct, then these raids should be deferred till elections are over." Akhilesh said the raids are a result of the huge crowds that turn up for the Samajwadi Vijay yatra raths. "Look at the crowds that are coming for their (BJP) Rath Yatra. One can see more people standing around a roadside stall selling chowmein," he said. "This has rattled BJP." Responding to a media query on Union home minister Amit Shah's comment that Akhilesh cannot stop the construction of the temple no matter how hard he tries, the former UP CM said no institution or government in India can dare to stop the construction of the temple. "The Supreme Court has said that the temple should be built. No one in India can stop that. However, if wrong people are in control there will be irregularities in land procurement in the name of the temple," he said. He said if the Supreme Court decision on Ram Temple had come during the SP regime, the temple construction would have been completed within a year and there would be no irregularities in land procurement. "The company which has constructed the highway is involved in construction of the temple. If they (BJP) wanted, it would have been built in a year. Had it been in the SP government, we would have definitely built the temple in a year," Akhilesh said, adding that the BJP government does not want the temple to be built, they only want votes using the issue. He said in the SP regime Agra Lucknow Expressway was constructed in a record 22 months. Describing the recent appointment of the chief secretary as a result of a tug-of-war between the state and Centre, Akhilesh said: "Before the elections, Delhi (centre) wants to take control of the administration in the state so they have appointed a chief secretary two days before his retirement and given him an extension."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/akhilesh-to-ec-arent-it-raids-on-sp-men-violation-of-model-code/articleshow/88625696.cms||---

But among its many lows during the year, foremost was the ongoing strike by the professors regarding the 7th pay commission. The professors are on strike since September 3 and there is no response yet from the state government over their demands. H S Kingra, president of PAU Teachers Association went on indefinite fast unto death, which was broken by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu who assured action. Meanwhile, students are facing academic loss and their exams are postponed. Earlier, the professors agitated against giving extension to former VC Dhillon and three extensions of registrar RS Sidhu. The challenging year also saw the end of the term of vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon in July, who served the PAU as VC for 10 years. Anirudh Tewari, chief secretary, Punjab was given the additional charge as VC and presently, D K Tiwari, financial commissioner (development), agriculture and farmers’ welfare is holding the additional charge of VC .PAU also ranked second among the agricultural universities of the country in Indian Council of Agricultural Research rankings 2020. The university got the best award for excellence in agri food business incubators during Agri Food India Awards 2021. It also was awarded the first prize in the “green and clean campus” award contest notified last year by the National Agricultural Higher Education Project (NAHEP) of ICAR, New Delhi.

They alleged that Congress wants to gain political benefit and for that they are trying to divert the attention of public from development works to such issues.Meanwhile, senior Akali Dal leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “The police should investigate these cases properly because Congress only wants to come back to power at any cost. It can go to any level for its selfish motive.” Grewal said in the past too Congress could not do anything to resolve the previous sacrilege incidents and to cover it’s failure, more such things are being repeated. Grewal also hit out at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying that he should be more worried about situation in Delhi.The Akali Dal candidate from Atam Nagar constituency, Harish Rai Dhanda alleged the involvement of Lok Insaaf party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Bains, as the bomb blast occurred in the court complex on his hearing day. “He and his supporters left from there just a few minutes before the blast,” added Dhanda.Dhanda said he had also raised the matter of fake votes with election commission and the verification is going on. “Very shortly, truth will be unveiled,” he added. Meanwhile, Congress district president Ashwani Sharma said, “Akali Dal has lost its mental balance because they are going to taste defeat in the elections so they are raising such allegations.

And now they have started the work of regaining base among the voters by meeting them. Union minister and Punjab election in charge Gajendra Singh Shekhawat released toll-free number for people of Punjab to be members of ‘Nava Punjab Bhajpa de Naal’ movement started by party recently. The BJP had started the movement from Chandigarh recently and on Friday they issued a toll-free number 9227772222. Shekhawat said, “As it is not possible to reach out manually to people so this toll-free number has been given.” He said for the first time, BJP is contesting elections, taking a lead so there is enthusiasm among workers. Regarding seat sharing among BJP, Captain Amarinder Singh and Parminder Dhindsa, he said, “A committee has been formed to take a decision about it and they will come out with the final numbers.”However, Shekhawat applied brakes on speculations about joining of some MLAs and said, “Before taking anybody in the party, we need to get his or her background verified. Corrupt people have no place in BJP.” He said Rahul Gandhi is also aware of Congress losing its base in Punjab, so he cancelled his rally and left for Italy. He also questioned Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal for giving sanction to hike GST charges on garments and other things, as he is in the GST council. On Friday morning, the BJP state president Ashwani Sharma met morning walkers at chai pe charcha near Rakh Bagh. He said usually they make policies behind closed doors, but when they meet people from all walks of life they get feedback from them. He said people of Ludhiana gave him many suggestions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/post-repeal-of-farm-laws-bjp-trying-to-gain-base/articleshow/88625703.cms||---

In a meeting in Chandigarh on December 17, the representatives of Tata company had said that the MC has been inordinately delaying the due payments against invoices raised from July to November 2021. As of now, the outstanding amount is Rs 11.83 crore, including extra operational hours, they added.They raised the issue of non-payment for energy saving and for extra operational hours. “There is no SOP for payment realisation in spite of several requests to the authorities. The agency has made enormous investment for completion of the project. It continuous to suffer financial losses due to non-adherence to payment terms/ timelines of the contract. Despite repeated requests to the MC, there is no improvement and commitment for timely release of payment,” they added.The MC officials, however, pointed out that the civic body does not have sufficient funds at present to honour these liabilities.The principal secretary said, “No organisation should enter agreements or contracts it cannot uphold. Payment or processing delays on the part of a government body reflects badly on the government and mars its public image. Any financial repercussions arising out of contractual clauses/ litigation due to delayed/ non-payment would have to borne by the municipal corporation and officers concerned. It would be incumbent upon you to make provisions for discharging such recurring contractual payments timely and defining an SOP for processing of regular bills. It is unacceptable that the processing period of a bill exceed the period of the bill cycle.”For non-payment for energy saving and for extra operational hours, conduct an in-depth study of payments as per the contract and make an early decision, the principal secretary added.BJP former councillor Inder Aggarwal said, “The MC is intentionally harassing the firm so that it should stop work here and the civic body could hand over work to those contractors who were earlier working in connivance with officials. This had happened with A2Z waste management company too. If MC will not clear the outstanding dues, then how can they expect the company to work properly.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal could not be contacted for his comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/mc-pulled-up-for-not-clearing-tatas-dues/articleshow/88625711.cms||---

They were of the view that it would not only increase their cost of doing business, but also lead to a hike in the rates of products for end-users. The increase was to come into effect from January 1, but the GST council, in its meeting held on Friday, decided to defer it till its next meeting to be held in February.Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “If the decision was implemented from January 1, thousands of textile and garment unit owners and lakhs of their workers would have hit the roads. The 7% increase of GST is not only unjustified, but illogical too. Our association had decided to organise an indefinite bandh against the hike, but now as the implementation has been deferred, we have decided to call it off.”Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME Association who had taken up the matter with the Union ministers and senior bureaucrats, said, “The deferment is a big win of industrialists, and it was possible only due to the unity shown by the factory owners, who, irrespective of the size of their businesses, stood their ground. We would also like to thank ministries of textiles and of finance for taking note of our memorandums and forwarding these to the Union finance minister, who took the call to defer the hike.”Hemant Abbi, executive member of Moti Nagar United Factory Association, said, “We are thankful to the GST council for saving the industry, especially micro and small units, from being pushed into crisis. The 7% increase in GST would have not only increased the cost of doing business, but also hit our sales as rates of end products would have gone up. Though the decision has been deferred till the next meet and not cancelled, we are hopeful that it will be formally taken back soon.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/ny-gift-for-garment-textile-bizmen-7-gst-hike-deferred/articleshow/88625713.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh reports 251 fresh Covid cases in 24 hours, Noida tops with 61||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday urged the people to remain alert and cautious as UP reported 251 cases on Friday. He reiterated the importance of Covid-19 prevention protocol to check the spread of the virus. After inspecting Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences for pandemic preparedness, the CM said, “Coronavirus cannot harm those who strictly follow the prevention protocol. Though the state is ready to fight Covid-19 but it is the duty of every person to stay cautious.” Stating that preparedness on the part of the government was crucial, Yogi said: “Though the daily test positivity rate has been below 0.05% and the fact that over 85% of the state’s eligible population has taken at least one dose of the vaccine, there is the need to take all steps that help us in fighting the virus. This is the reason I came here to inspect the dedicated Covid-19 facility.” Of the total 251 cases, Gautam Budh Nagar (61), Lucknow (49), Ghaziabad (34), Mathura (13), Meerut (11) and Prayagraj recorded double digit entries, taking the total number of active cases to 862. An official spokesperson said out of total active cases, over 600 were under home isolation. He said door-to-door checking, aggressive testing and contact tracing were on to check the spread.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-reports-251-fresh-cases-in-24-hours-noida-tops-with-61/articleshow/88624753.cms||---
---||Goa||India to play Bahrain and Belarus in March||Panaji: The Indian football team will return to action in March when they take on the might of Bahrain and Belarus, both ranked below 100 in world football. The national team has been out of action since winning the SAFF Championship in October. According to sources, clubs had agreed to release players for international matches – SAFF Cup, Under-23 AFC qualifiers -- beyond the Fifa calendar, with an assurance that the players wouldn’t be needed for national duty during the Indian Super League (ISL). Since the ISL is being played inside a bio-secure bubble for the second consecutive year, quarantine rules, clubs said, make it difficult to release players. That perhaps explains why All India Football Federation (AIFF) will not use the Fifa window from January 24 to February 1. But once the ISL concludes on March 20, the Indian team will return to action with friendlies against Bahrain (ranked 91) and Belarus (ranked 94) in Manama. The two friendlies are expected to be played on March 23 and March 26. “These will be really good friendlies and help India prepare for the final round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers,” said a senior AIFF official. “With a change in the qualifying format and just three matches to be played, it’s important to have the best preparation against quality opponents.” The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has converted the final round of qualifiers from the conventional home and away format to a single round robin ties to be played in centralised venues. Rather than start on February 1, as earlier planned, the tournament will now be played in June, with just three matches in hand for teams to realise their qualification dream. “Obviously less matches are helpful to the weaker teams (in the group) to sneak something out,” coach Igor Stimac had previously told TOI. “We should be favourites in the group which will be nominated, but it won’t be an easy task.” Stimac is understood to be keen on starting preparations immediately after the ISL league phase is over. Players whose teams are involved with the playoffs will join at a later stage. The AFC has said that the final round matches will be held on June 8, June 11 and June 14. India, ranked 104, are expected to be in Pot 1 when the groupings are made and will know their opponents next month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/india-to-play-bahrain-and-belarus-in-march/articleshow/88639306.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The contractor will construct the road again with better quality materials or else MC will not make the payment. Superintending engineer of bridges and road department Rahul Gagneja said, “We have scraped the road off, as it was not up to the mark. The contractor will have to construct it properly again.” The residents had complained that the road was constructed at night time and since the temperature was low, the road started getting damaged. When vehicles started moving on it, bitumen started getting damaged already. The road was left in pathetic condition for the last three years and after repeated complaints the officials agreed to construct the road.

His son, Janed Hafeez who too is an accused in the case, managed to flee.Constable Parnam Singh, posted in Ludhiana Police traffic wing, said in his complaint, “I was on duty at Gill Road along with a recovery van to tow away vehicles parked in the middle of the road and in no-parking zone. As a car was wrongly parked on the road, I asked the recovery van to tow it away. When the van was about to tow it away, its owners Abdul and Janed started arguing with me. They misbehaved with me and tore my uniform.”The cop managed to nab Abdul, but his son ran away. The police have impounded their car. ASI Dalveer Singh from Division 6 police station said a case has been registered under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of his public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

---||Ludhiana||Initial surge may have started in dist: CMCH study||Ludhiana: As more Covid cases are being reported in Ludhiana, a CMCH finding shows that the initial surge may have started in Punjab and Ludhiana. The CMCH’s preventive and social medicine department makes the projection on the basis of available data.A doctor involved in the mathematical calculations said, “The cases remained around and below 50-mark in Punjab for a long time. But now the daily cases have started to increase by around 45% to 50% and are coming from major districts, including Ludhiana. This indicates that the surge has already started in the state. There is likely to be an increase in cases in the coming week.”“In the wake of the Omicron variant and festivities, mathematical projections had suggested the surge to start from January 6. But it has advanced by more than a week. Now, cases are increasing in states by 20% to 25% daily. The first week of January will indicate whether things will get worse immediately or it will take some time before peak is reached,” said the expert.“However, given the fact that Omicron has more transmissibility, peak may reach in the state, including Ludhiana, in four to six weeks after the surge. But calculations indicate that unlike two peaks of second wave—first peak lasted from March-end to April 13 (because of UK variant) and second peak (due to delta variant) from April 13 to May 15-20—third wave peak may last for a few weeks. The baseline for peak in Ludhiana is 130 cases a day,” he added. The doctor said the data from South Africa suggested that the Omicron virus mainly affected those below six years of age and above 60 years. They are communicating to the state government about the initial surge having started, he added.Meanwhile, a specialist at CMCH said it is expected that a lot of people will get infected. “A lot of people may get infected even as they may have mild symptoms. Those who are prone to getting sick and have complications should be careful, especially those with comorbidities, allergies, on steroid medications, among others. Since Omicron is air-borne, one needs to follow two-metre distance,” said Dr Clarence Samuel, head of the department of preventive and social medicine.The expert said they cannot say with certainty whether it is Omicron which is causing the surge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/initial-surge-may-have-started-in-dist-cmch-study/articleshow/88625717.cms||---

---||Pune||From Deep Despair Springs Recovery||Pune: At the end of two calendar years of the pandemic, and the start of a third one, a collective loss of normalcy still hangs in the air. But, the light at the end of the tunnel shines bright as we start 2022 with some knowledge of the coronavirus rather than the blank slate it was in 2021.Citizens have found ways to cope and make dealing with isolation, anxiety, grief and loss, less intense. A spectrum of people who shared their stories with TEAM TOI said Covid-19 has changed their lives, but they are moving forward with some creativity, and resilience. From fitness regimes, gratitude journalling, finding a new love for the movies, volunteering at vaccination sites to putting the house in order, picking up more responsibilities, and connecting with the community, people shared what helped them get by and stay well. Jyothi K, a second-year B Com student said she was scared when she caught the virus. “Even after a quick recovery, I needed days to get over the fear and trauma. Now, I adhere to all Covid-19 protocols and hygiene practices. I am more careful and watchful with myself and my family when we are in a public space. The situation is nowhere near what it was in the pre-pandemic days, but the vaccines give us hope,” she added.Pranav Patil from Erandwane took the opportunity to learn a new language, explore regional cinema, and Marathi cuisine that kept his spirits high during the pandemic.An alumnus of B J Medical College, Patil went to Chennai for a postgraduate degree in ophthalmology at Sankara Nethralaya in the early phase of the pandemic."Since the pandemic was already in full swing, we had to join our hospital at very short notice. Two cancelled flights and a 12-hour journey later, I finally landed in Chennai. Finding a place to quarantine was a huge challenge, compounded by our complete lack of Tamil language. Ever since, life in Chennai has been a roller coaster. With masked faces and a huge language barrier, residency has been quite challenging. Watching Tamil movies has helped me develop a newfound love for this cinema and I am learning the language," he said.Deep grief enveloped Meera K (name changed on request) as she struggled with the loss of her brother in December 2020. “Both of us have been estranged from our extended family for decades, but they all came during this difficult hour. Their words of solace and my neighbours’ kindness turned me to gratitude journalling,” she said.The exercise made her remember a good event, an experience, a person or an idea and enjoy the emotions that came with it. “I saw the good things as gifts and thinking of them guards against taking them for granted, and I began savouring them,” she added. It also helped her heal.Autorickshaw driver Suryakant Limbore’s closeness to a customer who he helped during Covid-19 gave him the direction to connect with his village. “This customer was a bachelor and I would drop him to Kharadi every day before the pandemic. He fell ill and I took him to a private hospital. He was diagnosed with Covid and he passed away a few days later. His relatives who were abroad cleared out his belongings and handed over three of his smartphones that I gave away in my village in Solapur. It helps children study,” he said. He now requests others to give him gadgets that he can pass on to needy students. Bipin Manani, a resident of Sangvi, went from provider to caregiver almost overnight. In the space of three days, he lost his mother and his wife to the virus and along with the grief, he had to take care of his young son.“My mother got her first dose of the vaccine on April 5, but she tested positive for Covid-19 on April 15. We admitted her to the district hospital in Aundh. All of us also tested positive. Except for my wife, the rest were asymptomatic. We admitted her to a private hospital. But my mother passed away on May 2 and my wife died on May 5. It was devastating. We have told my son that both are in hospital,” Manani said.After two months, Manani set aside his sorrow and began to care for his son and father. “I am now the primary caregiver. We don’t know how much more damage the virus will cause. It is up to us to follow all precautions. Vaccines will give us durable protection,” he said.Pharma executive Amit Sahani, who has been working from home for nearly two years, grew tired of the monotony after six months. “My father was diagnosed with cancer. When he was discharged, I booked a ticket to Leh. The next afternoon I was sipping Himalayan tea at a street stall travelling towards Nubra valley on a bike. For seven days I travelled to offbeat places in Ladakh, stayed with villagers, helped them on their farms. I stayed in a monastery where the early morning prayers and the openness of the monks were soothing. I came back knowing that happiness can be found with the basic minimum.” Work from home in the initial days gave bank employee Sulochana Bhide some extra time to put papers and documents in order. “I had the time to draw up my will. The experience was fulfilling,” she said.Vegetable farmer Sandeep Kolekar from Khed said his entire family was in quarantine, and his relatives and acquaintances helped them get better. “Our harvest did not get a good price in the market. But the ground situation has vastly improved now. Vaccination, masks, distancing and hygiene have become a part of our lives in the rural areas,” he added.A search on the internet took two brothers to the vaccination site at KEM Hospital. “We were looking for ways to help this effort to inoculate people. This is perhaps the biggest pandemic we may ever face, and we wanted to help in any small way. We got in touch with an NGO which needed volunteers to streamline paperwork and guide vaccine recipients. For four Saturdays, it broke our monotony of staying at home ,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/from-deep-despair-springs-recovery/articleshow/88625720.cms||Team TOI Plus
---||Pune||Buzz missing, thinner crowds ring in 2022||Pune: If an awareness campaign could be faulted for being mistimed, one by a non-government de-addiction centre trying to convince a thinner-than-usual crowd of New Year’s eve revellers on Friday at Goodluck Chowk on Fergusson College Road ‘not to drink alcohol, but milk instead’ would certainly take the cake.Less than a stone’s throw away, serpentine queues formed outside a liquor shop. It was 9:45 pm. While the usually buzzing Jangli Maharaj Road and Fergusson College Road did have a sizeable number of people out for a meal, or to just lounge around on the wide pavements with the cheap thrills, and the occasional balloons and vanity glasses, the Omicron variant did cast somewhat of a shadow. The crowd was certainly thinner, with restaurants and smaller eateries being the only draw. The usually choc-a-bloc public parking spaces thinned out, as night wore on. The vuvuzelas rang out less frequently, and balloons sold slowly. Even though it was slightly better than the New Years’ eve last year, when most of the stretches were cordoned off, an air of disappointment hung around.“There are not too many people out. More families come here usually. But the only ones out now are groups of youngsters with motorcycles,” said Ali Asghar, selling balloons, Santa hats, and other knick-knacks near the Deccan intersection.A lesser number of people, however, did not necessarily translate to a greater level of discipline. Masks came off liberally among groups of people taking pictures, while others carried them in their hands, earning uncharitable looks from those masked.There was also a lesser police presence, with some patrolling the pavements with fibre batons, a team being posted at the Goodluck chowk, and its public announcement system-enabled vehicles warning people off streets, reminding them of night curbs and threats of legal action.However, the police were not willing to go hammer and tongs to enforce the curbs, even well past the 9pm deadline. “Of course, we have been given the power to enforce the curbs using force, but we do not want to do that. We wish to see people wearing masks, maintaining physical distancing, and leaving the area as soon as possible. We also do not want to close the area to traffic entirely, unlike what we did last year. People may have places to go to for emergency, and it would not be right to stop them or make them take long detours,” said a policeman on duty.Eateries on the stretch enjoyed brisk business, with some even going over and above government restrictions to impose their own curbs. “We have planned to keep our restaurant open till 11pm, and ensured restrictions of our own, with only masked and fully-vaccinated patrons allowed entry. The fact that we can take advantage of the New Year eve business, which we were not able to do last year, is a welcome change,” said the manager of a restaurant on JM Road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/buzz-missing-thinner-crowds-ring-in-2022/articleshow/88625722.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Moderately strong winds likely to bring chill to the New Year||Pune: Chill factor has gone up in the city as day temperatures have dropped below 30C during the last two-three days.On Thursday, day temperatures in the city were in the range of 24-25C, which rose slightly to 24-26C. However, lower than normal maximum temperatures continued to lend a chill to the air.As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the chill will continue through the first day of 2022, with maximum temperatures remaining below 30C and minimums below 15C. Chilly winds have also been blowing during the day in Pune, causing a drop in city’s real feel temperature.Senior IMD scientist and head of Surface Instruments Division (SID) at the Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune, K S Hosalikar, told TOI, “IMD’s extended range forecast has also indicated maximum temperatures to be slightly lower than normal in parts of Central India, including Maharashtra, during the next couple of weeks. However, as per the forecast, minimum temperatures are expected to be slightly higher than normal during this period. Minimum temperatures are expected to show a slightly higher anomaly from next Thursday.”Hosalikar said that some parts of Pune district, such as Shirur, NDA area, among other places on the outskirts, did record single-digit minimum temperatures in the last couple of days. “Shivaji Nagar did not record very low night temperatures during the past few days. On the contrary, maximum temperatures have been significantly below normal (negative departures ranging from 2-5C) in parts of Maharashtra, including Jalgaon, Pune, Nashik Mahabaleshwar, among other places,” he added.He said that the skies over Pune have been partly cloudy. “Cloudy skies are usually accompanied with lower than normal maximum temperatures during daytime and higher than normal minimum temperatures during night time. There is a drop in maximum temperature during cloudy sky conditions because of less sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface,” he said.Hosalikar, however, said that no significant change in temperature is expected in Pune in the next few days. “Maximum temperatures, however, are going to be lower than normal, while moderately strong winds are likely to bring a chill to the new year in Pune. When moderately strong winds blow, they add to the chill factor -- a combination of winds and actual temperature. When winds are relatively strong, the real feel temperature also feels lower than the actual temperature. There is also a biological aspect to this, with weather conditions appearing more chilly to some than others,” Hosalikar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/moderately-strong-winds-likely-to-bring-chill-to-the-new-year/articleshow/88625724.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Almost 62% patients with Covid cases show mild, no symptoms||PUNE: An analysis of about 11,492 active cases of Covid-19 in Maharashtra till December 28 has revealed that almost 62% or 7,112 patients were either asymptomatic or exhibiting only mild symptoms. Experts said the prevailing trend was significant considering a 63% rise in week-on-week Covid cases, with hospitals also confirming no major spike in admissions.State health department data revealed that the rate of mild /asymptomatic patients had increased from 48% (of 7,068 active cases) around December 19 to 62% (of 11,492 active Covid cases) till December 28. The proportion of severe Covid cases among active cases dropped to 12.62% by December 28, from 18.46% in the week ending December 19. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra had nearly 615 patients in ICUs till December 19, which slightly rose to 645 by December 28. A senior health department official said, "Though a clearer picture would emerge after a week, hospitalization in Maharashtra is not increasing at the pace at which the daily new cases have been rising so far. Even in Mumbai, the speed at which new cases are emerging, the same pace is not apparent in terms of hospital admissions. We should, however, wait till January 7-8 to accurately understand the disease severity and hospitalization trends after the recent surge in Covid cases." Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI, "We still have a small number of Covid beds occupied in hospitals, indicating a lower incidence of hospital admissions. Having said that, usually hospitalizations lag by two weeks after increase in cases. Considering that the cases in Maharashtra (primarily Mumbai) began increasing in large numbers after December 20, it will be prudent to wait till January 10 to make any assumptions on hospitalization trends." Dr Om Srivastav, infectious diseases expert from Mumbai and a member of the state's Covid task force, said, "We have seen only a marginal rise in Covid admission in the hospital, and most of the cases are mild. So much so, that I am not recommending hospitalization to a majority of patients. Most are doing good with home care." Dr Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, and Symbiosis University Hospital & Research Centre, a dedicated Covid hospital in Pune, said, "We have so far not seen a rise in admission at the hospital. Currently, there are just two patients admitted to the Covid ward of the hospital. Their disease seems mild and could also be managed in home isolation." Despite a rise in Covid cases, she said, a chunk of the patients was likely to exhibit mild symptoms because of high vaccination rate now. "Either people have suffered from Covid or/and have been vaccinated, leading to a fair amount of immunity. This could be a reason why hospitals have so far not recorded a major spike in admission despite a rise in cases. When cases had started going up in March 2021, it was soon followed by a rise in hospital admissions. So, there is no need to panic."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/almost-62-maha-cases-show-mild-no-symptoms/articleshow/88625725.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Maharashtra property revenue, registrations maximum in December this year||PUNE: After a slight dip in property registrations and revenue collection in November, Maharashtra witnessed a surge in the real estate sector in December with the last month of 2021 not only recording the highest registration of documents (3,31,460) for the 2021-2022 financial year but also mopping up the maximum revenue at Rs3,790.05 crore. High-value property registrations have helped the state registration department garner this financial year’s highest revenue collection after October’s Rs3,220.61 crore, state property registration officials said on Friday. State Inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR) Shravan Hardikar said, "We had limited working days in November, but we had generated Rs2,672 crore in the month. But December garnered the maximum revenue though there was no sops. This reflects well on the real estate sector," He said, "After Dasara, there has been a steady rise in registrations with the concentration more on high-value property registrations in the middle- and high-income-group segments and land deals. This has continued." Besides the encouraging revenue collection, there has also been a 30% rise in terms of registrations in December from the month before. "Last year, the collection had touched Rs4,000-Rs 6,000 crore due to the stamp duty waiver scheme. But there was no sop this financial year. The collection in December 2021 could well be by far the highest for a month, where there are no sops announced by the state government," Hardikar said. The maximum number of registrations was seen in the Mumbai and Pune metropolitan regions. Districts such as Raigad, Thane and Nashik also witnessed increased registrations, Hardikar said. State Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) president Sunil Furde told TOI that there was a consistent increase in registrations in the past few months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maha-property-revenue-regns-max-in-dec-this-yr/articleshow/88625727.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Friday issued a new circular stating that the sites would be available across all 15 zones in the civic limits. On Thursday, the civic body had said the vaccine would be offered to the beneficiaries in this category at five vaccination sites. A press statement from the PMC said the online vaccination slot booking for the group would start from January 1. PCMC’s additional commissioner, Vikas Dhakane, said they would offer the vaccine to the 15-18 years age group across seven sites. The Pune ZP CEO, Ayush Prasad, said they would offer the vaccine across the schools and colleges through special camp sessions. The authorities of the district’s dedicated Covaxin site — District Hospital Aundh — said they would be creating the sessions from January 1 till January 8 at their site, and accordingly increase the number of daily doses on offer. Previous rules from the state family welfare department had asked the civic authorities to start separate vaccination sites for the immunisation of 15-18-years old. The state has around 60 lakh beneficiaries in this category, while the district has around five lakh such beneficiaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-set-to-offer-shots-to-15-18-year-olds-at-40-sites/articleshow/88625729.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Centre tells state to ramp up testing, calls for strategic job||Pune: The Centre on Thursday directed the state to scale up Covid testing after registering a 34% dip in the last two weeks of December as compared to that during the second wave in May-June.“The need for enhanced testing is even greater today keeping in mind the increased transmissibility of Omicron and the larger preponderance of asymptomatic cases. Ramping up testing in the initial days itself will help to ensure that the infected individual does not spread the virus to others,” stated the letter of the additional secretary of health, Arti Ahuja, to the state.The Centre called for comprehensive, adequate and smart testing as per the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines in Maharashtra, second to Delhi in registering Omicron cases.

Replicating the state order on December 30, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and the Pune district collector, in their orders on December 31, said that only 50 people will be allowed at weddings, while for all social, cultural, political, and religious gatherings, only 50 people will be allowed. Only 20 people have been allowed for last rites.The district collector’s order further stated that considering the possibility of crowding at tourist spots, the incident commander and sub-divisional officers can impose section 144.Patil told TOI, “We are mandating vaccination for entry in the respective sectors for the fact that Covid cases are rising and we want to contain them at the initial stage. The fatality rate across the globe is less and vaccination can play a vital role.”Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “How to follow these orders is the biggest challenge. Inspection of vaccination certificates is an ardent task, especially in schools and colleges, and this will be a challenge for larger establishments.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pcmc-orders-no-vaccine-no-entry/articleshow/88625732.cms||---

Though Omicron might cause less severe disease, a small percentage of a huge number was still very large and could overwhelm the health systems, she said.While districts are expected to upgrade or establish new infrastructure in terms of beds and also make provision for oxygen, a recent assessment of districts across Maharashtra showed that there are still gaps to be filled, Dr Vyas stated in his letter.“No district has achieved complete infrastructure preparedness according to the Centre’s guidelines,” said Dr Vyas.The assessment reflected that 17 districts were in the yellow category, while 16 in the red category, with Pune district failing to provide the desired information. Dr Vyas said for each of the district the area of concern has been cited and expected corrective measures too have been mentioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/districts-told-to-upgrade-health-infra-by-january-15/articleshow/88625733.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Private hospitals and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have criticised the government’s move stating that it would inconvenience their doctors/staffers, resulting in wastage of their precious time. It will eventually affect patient-care services at private hospitals, nursing homes, laboratories and clinics, they stressed.The precaution dose for healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 years of age will be rolled out from January 10. Only those with a 39-week gap (nine months) following their second dose would be eligible for it.Dr J Jayalal, immediate past national president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said, “This is a sadistic move towards Covid warriors across the country. IMA demands the government should review and revoke the decision and allow the healthcare professionals to take vaccine for free in government facilities and by paying the fees in the private hubs.”Several private hospitals have unused doses with them. “When the healthcare staffers need the third dose, it is better these vaccine doses are used for them, along with general citizens. As every vaccination is done through CoWIN portal, there will not be an issue,” Dr Jayalal said.Maharashtra’s chief immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai said, “The entire Covid vaccination programme is run by the Union government with the help of CoWIN portal. Hence, we have to follow the instructions. The precaution dose for healthcare workers — private as well as public sector — will be offered only at government or municipal corporation-run vaccination centres.”Another government official, requesting anonymity, said, “When the vaccine was made available only to healthcare workers in the early phase, many people having influences got the shot under the healthcare workers’ category. The government wants to stop such misuse of doses this time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ima-flays-vax-rider-for-pvt-doctors-healthcare-staffers/articleshow/88625735.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He also alluded to the history of the Rupee Bank, including its association with figures like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.According to sources involved, the Saraswat Bank has placed the proposal with the board of administrators of the Rupee Bank, and has also sent the proposal to the RBI, which is currently assessing resolution processes for the Rupee Bank. Sources at the Saraswat Bank said the interest of depositors will be looked after, with some help also required from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. The license of the Rupee bank will be used largely in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra to keep the bank local. The RBI is also examining a proposal by the Mehsana Urban Cooperative Bank, based in Gujarat, to take over the Rupee Bank. It had earlier denied a similar proposal made by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank. Administrators of the Rupee Bank have also met FM Nirmala Sitharaman, seeking a resolution for the long-troubled bank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/saraswat-bank-elicits-rupee-bank-takeover-intent/articleshow/88625736.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Police said the woman threatened the victim with making their private chat messages public and sought Rs20 lakh to settle the matter. The man reported the matter to the police. Assistant inspector Santosh Patil and his team from the Wakad police laid a trap and arrested her while she came to collect the money at Shivar chowk in Rahatni on Thursday.

A toll-free helpline would be dedicated to help doctors and patients access the drug, stated the company’s statement released on Friday. The ability to treat Covid-19 with an oral pill instead of an injection or infusion meant more people could be treated faster, experts said.Earlier the city-based firm had entered into a licensing agreement with Merck Sharpe Dohme to manufacture and supply Molnupiravir to India and over 100 low- and middle-income countries. Molnupiravir is an oral anti-viral drug that inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-firm-set-to-launch-oral-covid-19-drug/articleshow/88625738.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Pharmacy, MCA & MBA courses on the upswing||PUNE: With just 8% of seats vacant at the end of all admission rounds, undergraduate pharmacy courses in the state seem to be the most in-demand from students. The interest in pharmaceutical fields due to Covid 19, willingness among multinational companies to employ students with a degree in pharmacy are some of the reasons for this change, teachers of pharmacy colleges said. The response to Masters in Computer Applications, Masters in Business Administration too has been good this year with the vacancy being just about 6% and 10% respectively. While vacancies in engineering UG courses have come down from 44% last year to 36% this year, those in hotel management UG courses and architecture have increased to 53% and 45% compared to 41% and 31% last year. Sathiyanarayanan L, vice principal at Bharati Vidyapeeth University Poona College of Pharmacy said that the trend of opting for pharmacy began about five years ago, but there has been a drastic shift since the pandemic started.  “The Covid 19 and the resultant hunt for vaccines brought awareness about the field and parents also wanted their kids to do something in the health sector. Now medical seats are fewer, expensive and it takes a long time to finish the course. But in the case of pharmacy, it is a four-year course and not very expensive. Moreover, with many multinational and other regulatory, pharmacovigilance related companies coming in, placements are also good. Hence, there is a rush for pharmacy seats,” said Sathiyanarayanan. Engineering colleges are witnessing the best ever placement season in the recent past. Some colleges have also made their mechanical and civil engineering students well versed by offering them courses in programming language,” Sandip Meshram, associate professor at College of Engineering Pune said. Sharvey Dhongde, academic coordinator and professor at Dr Bhanuben Nanavati College of Architecture For Women, Pune said, “The centralised admission process began late while the private universities had already completed their admissions 3-4 months ago. Secondly, it is a five-year-long course and also costly to some extent. It takes a little time to mature in the profession.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pharmacy-mca-mba-courses-on-the-upswing/articleshow/88625739.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Garment traders say uniform 5% rate needed for inputs||Pune: Garment and footwear traders have welcomed the GST Council’s decision to maintain the 5% goods and services tax (GST) rate on textiles as well as shoes and maintained that a uniform rate of 5% was also needed to be enacted on inputs to the industry.Many state governments, including Maharashtra, as well as traders’ bodies, urged the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who also chairs the GST Council, to keep the status quo and not enact the tax increase to 12%. Their main contention was the country’s economic health and exports, with some projecting thousands of job losses and factory closures. “It’s encouraging to see that good sense has prevailed, and the rate has not been hiked to 12%, especially with the industry still struggling due to the pandemic, and consumption to be affected again due to the new variant of the virus,” said an industry observer based in Pune.However, traders’ bodies said uniformity in rates for its inputs also needs to be enacted, and brought to the 5% slab. “The decision has now been deferred to a couple of months later, and what will happen then is anyone’s guess. However, we had demanded that the inputs to the industry must also be brought under the 5% slab, as many of them are still under the 12% and 18% slabs. That way, customers will be benefited in terms of lower prices on finished goods,” said Milind Shalgar, secretary of the United Retail Trade and Garment Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/garment-traders-say-uniform-5-rate-needed-for-inputs/articleshow/88625740.cms||---

He said the policemen at the chowkey had told the victim to visit a doctor, as he had suffered injuries in the assault. The victim, however, did not see a doctor.  “After some time he was found lying on the road. The police took him to a nearby doctor, where it was found that his blood pressure was low. He has immediately suggested the treatment in a hospital,” Lagad said.

PCB officials said that of these 60 to 70 connections were “closed” over the years. However, they were still getting bills for these connections from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which supplies water to the cantonment. “We have approached the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) to carry out the water audit. This is the first time that a third-party agency will check the water connections in the cantonment,” said PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar. “Our first and foremost priority is to address the differences over the water bills and fix the water charges as per the water connections,” he said. “This would help us to manage our expenses and reduce the charges as well,” added Kumar. A senior official from the MJP said that it would take at least two months to complete the water audit. “We will have to float a tender for the work once the PCB pays the charges for it,” added the official. “We will hold a meeting with cantonment officials next month to decide our strategy. Whether they want to carry out door-to-door checking for each connection in their areas will be finalised or decided at the meeting,” he said. The cantonment authorities said they want to check each water connection in civil and military areas. “In some places, the cantonment board has set up a borewell and does not use PMC water connection. But still, we are getting bills. Likewise, there are other issues also. This exercise will help us to address these concerns in the coming days,” said an official from the engineering section of the cantonment. PMC officials said that the water audit was an apt decision taken by the cantonment and it would help both the agencies/ authorities to resolve the deadlock over the pending water bills.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pcb-to-carry-out-water-audit-of-all-394-connections/articleshow/88625743.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Pune||Pune: Virtual friend’s gift bait costs 39-year-old bank employee Rs 6.93 lakh||PUNE: A 29-year-old public sector bank employee fell for the age-old trick of a brand new online acquaintance promising to send her a gift and lost Rs 6.93 lakh to fraudsters. The incident occurred between May 20 and May 24 this year. The woman had filed a complaint application with the cyber cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police following a verification process. After the preliminary probe, a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information and Technology (IT) Act has been registered with the Dighi police this Thursday. Senior police inspector (SPI) Dilip Shinde of the Dighi police said the complainant received a friend request on May 20 from an unknown man on social media. “Before accepting, she checked his profile and noticed one woman from Wakad in the friend list,” Shinde said. The complainant then messaged the woman from Wakad for a verification about the man. Shinde said, “The woman claimed she was in the US but told the complainant that she knew the man very well. Following this, the complainant accepted his friend request. After getting acquainted virtually, he told the complainant that he was from Poland and working with the UK Navy. He asked for her address to send some gifts and also claimed he would be coming to India.” On May 24, the complainant received a message from some other person saying a parcel sent to her was stuck at Delhi Airport customs. She was told that to to release it, she had to transfer Rs28,500. “She did the needful, but got another call saying that after scanning the parcel, foreign currency was found in it,” added Shinde. When the complainant asked the man why he had sent her money, he reassured her that it was legal. He told her to transfer Rs1.85 lakh to an account for a ‘money laundering certificate’, which she did. Once again, she got a call, asking for Rs4.80 lakh for insurance to convert the Great Britain pounds into Indian rupees. Shinde said, “She was initially reluctant, but the suspect and acquaintance then threatened her and said her family members may face legal action. Terrified, she paid up. But immediately thereafter, they demanded Rs6.80 lakh more ‘revenue tax’. “The woman then realised she had been duped. She stopped responding and approached the police,” Shinde said. The police have traced the IP addresses of the suspects and found that they are based in an African country. “Our probe is on,” Shinde said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/virtual-friends-gift-bait-costs-39-yr-old-bank-employee-6-93l/articleshow/88625745.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Rents on rise, but Omicron can derail market: NoBroker||Pune: Online home rental and purchasing platform NoBroker in its annual 2021 review said that home rents rose by around 3% in Pune, but the surge in Omicron cases can put the market back to square one.NoBroker added that the rent “inflation” in Pune was lower than other cities, with the average rent in high-demand categories, such as two-bedroom flats, lower than that of cities like Mumbai, or the National Capital Region. The firm added that despite the increase in rent, reflecting an increase in demand, a rethink on return to offices, due to the ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases, may help correct the market again.“The increase in rent in Pune is lower than that of other cities, particularly due to the IT sector still largely working from home. However, since some employees have returned to offices, rents have started increasing, and 46% of landlords we surveyed have started increasing rents, and people are moving houses as a result. But, if there is a third wave of the pandemic in India, and if it is as ferocious as the second wave, it has the potential to affect the market again, particularly if offices decide to put off a full return to offices,” Saurabh Garg, co-founder and chief business officer of NoBroker, told TOI. Garg added that Baner and Vimannagar have seen the most traction in terms of rents.“The student flow to the city has been lower over the past year, but some of them have been returning after Diwali. But if educational institutions have a rethink on offline teaching and go back to online sessions, it can again have an effect on the market. The next two weeks to a month will be crucial to figure out the trends and characteristics of the Omicron variant,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rents-on-rise-but-omicron-can-derail-market-nobroker/articleshow/88625746.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

There are 1.6 lakh ASHA workers and 7,000 ASHA sanginis in the state. Addressing a programme to felicitate ASHA workers for their exemplary work in Covid-19 management and to distribute smartphones to 80,000 of them, the CM said: “ASHA workers shoulder the responsibility of public health and contribute immensely for the creation of a healthy society which forms the base of a productive state.” Under the present system, ASHA workers get Rs 2,750 as basic honorarium of which Rs 2,000 comes from the Centre while the remaining Rs 750 is contributed by the state. Besides the fixed allowance, ASHA workers and sanginis get incentives for various tasks, activities and health campaigns. Depending on their performance, they may earn up to Rs 5,300. Doubling the state’s share from Rs 750 to Rs 1,500 would increase their total earnings to over Rs 6,000 per month. The CM also announced an additional performance bonus of Rs 500 to ASHA workers for exemplary work in Covid-19 management between April 2020 and March 31, 2022. The state government also announced an additional incentive of Rs 10,000 each to contractual ANM workers who were engaged in Covid-19 vaccination for a minimum of 60 days. At least 15,000 ANMs are enrolled in UP and contractual ANMs get a consolidated amount of Rs 10,000 per month. The decision brought smiles to the faces of health workers who have been demanding revision of incentives. “The network of medical colleges, testing labs, oxygen facilities, health sub-centres and referral units will eventually serve public interest which has been the priority of the BJP government since the beginning,” he said. Health minister Jai Pratap Singh said smartphones were being provided to ASHA workers which will simplify their work and help in better coordination between them and the department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-raises-its-share-of-pay-to-asha-workers-assts-by-100/articleshow/88624758.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||Delhi University uses digilocker to verify more than 1 lakh documents||NEW DELHI: The government’s push for digitization in the recent years has come in handy to deliver quick services in 2020 and 2021, the two Covid-hit years. While Delhi University carried out verification of 1.1 lakh documents digitally, which were submitted by students, Karnataka too completed verification of certificates for police recruitment digitally. The state transport departments also issued nearly 21 lakh learner’s licences online and completed transfer of ownership of over one lakh vehicles through Aadhaar-based digital services. According to government officials, the DigiLocker interface came to the rescue of DU students in a year when getting physical documents would have been a tough task due to pandemic restrictions. “They were able to access CBSE class X and XII results for 2020 within two hours of publication. The same day they received their digital mark sheets and passing certificates as well. These could be stored in DigiLocker and the digital certificates have aided students in getting admission to universities and international institutions,” an official said. DigiLocker is a secure cloud based platform for storage, sharing and verification of documents and certificates. The documents stored in the DigiLocker system are deemed to be equivalent to original physical documents as per law.  These documents can be validated in real-time using the DigiLocker Scanner, which is included with the DigiLocker Android App, or online using verification Application Programming Interface (API), a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. The official said the National Academic Depository, a 24X7 online storehouse of all certificates, diplomas, degrees and mark-sheets duly digitised and lodged by academic institutions, has made APIs available for verifying academic qualifications.  The APIs give machine-readable data and can be used to validate applicants’ paper certificates.  “During the pandemic period, the DU was a pioneer in using API-based certificate verification. Over 1.1 lakh document verifications occurred during 2020-21 admissions cycle, resulting in the admissions process being more straightforward, secure, and resilient,” he added. Similarly, Karnataka Police created its certificate verification software, which utilises DigiLocker to get access to academic certificates and other certifications for police recruiting. This reduced the time taken for the entire recruitment process by 50%. “This process directly impacted almost a million individuals who have applied,” said the official. According to BPR&D figures, the total number of persons recruited in 2019 was around 1.35 lakh and if it’s assumed that an average of seven documents verification per applicant using DigiLocker, then this interface can cater to nearly 10 lakh documents only for the police force. “The possibilities are endless, if it is applied across other departments for recruitments,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-university-uses-digilocker-to-verify-more-than-1-lakh-documents/articleshow/88624412.cms||---

This move comes as a relief for NGOs and associations that have applied for renewal of their registration under the Act but are still awaiting a decision. The extension has been given until March 31, 2022 or till the disposal of their application, whichever is earlier. The ministry, however, clarified that the FCRA licences of NGOs whose renewal plea has already been turned down, shall not be eligible for the extension. This essentially means that the Missionaries of Charity, an NGO founded by Mother Teresa, became ineligible for receiving any fresh foreign contributions or utilising foreign funds received by it, right from the day — December 25, 2021 — the MHA rejected its FCRA renewal application due to “adverse inputs”. All NGOs are required to apply for renewal of their FCRA registration before expiry of the five-year validity of their respective licences, in accordance with Rule 12 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011. While applying online for renewal, the NGOs are required to furnish the details of their FCRA account in SBI’s New Delhi branch and affidavits of office bearers furnishing details like their Aadhaar number, besides paying a Rs 5,000 renewal fee. This is the third time that the MHA has extended the validity of FCRA registration certificates of NGOs who had applied for their renewal after September 29, 2020. The original deadline of May 31, 2021 was extended to September 30, 2021. Thereafter, it was further extended to December 31, 2021. The home ministry on Friday made it clear that only those NGOs who had already applied for renewal of their FCRA licence expiring between September 29, 2020 and March 31, 2022, and were awaiting disposal of their application, would benefit from its decision to extend the validity of their FCRA registration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fcra-deadline-extended-but-no-relief-for-moc/articleshow/88625768.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Nod to land rights for slum dwellers in 5 municipal bodies||BHUBANESWAR: The state cabinet on Friday cleared an ordinance, paving way for an amendment of the Odisha Municipal Corporation Act, 2003, that will help confer land rights to slum households in five municipal corporations. The land rights in corporation areas — Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Rourkela — will be given in line with the land rights conferred upon slum dwellers in 109 smaller towns (municipalities and NACs) under the Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2017, under the Jaga Mission. The move assumes significance in view of the forthcoming urban local body polls, scheduled next year. “Under the Jaga Mission, we have so far provided land rights to nearly 1.75 lakh slum dwellers living in 109 municipalities and NACs. We are going to provide similar land rights to the slum dwellers in municipal corporations with necessary amendment in the law,” said state housing and urban development minister Pratap Jena. “Nearly nine lakh people, part of over 1.90 lakh households, living in 938 slums in the five municipal corporations will benefit because of this decision,” said Jena. “Promulgation of the ordinance will not only ensure land rights to slum dwellers but also make the households eligible to avail benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U). We will take steps to provide land rights to the slum dwellers in the next six months,” said the minister. The ordinance also has provision that wherever it is possible to provide property rights (low-cost houses), the municipal corporations will grant it. But if it is not possible, the corporations will have the flexibility of granting land rights to slum households in situ, over a land up to an extent of 45 square metres with certain conditions. Though the government had in 2017 amended the municipal corporation act to provide property rights to slum dwellers in corporation areas, no significant progress could be made regarding conferment of property rights owing to various reasons. The cabinet also approved a proposal to waive interest payable on delayed payment of premium to the tune of Rs 14.71 crore to Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) and Odisha State Housing Board (OSHB) on government land allotted for development of residential and commercial projects. The initiative will benefit 5,235 allottees (3,984 in respect of OSHB and 1,251 relating to BDA) of 16 projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/nod-to-land-rights-for-slum-dwellers-in-5-municipal-bodies/articleshow/88625772.cms||---

The city being the hub of activities, Bhubaneswar bore the maximum brunt in the two Covid waves. Hence, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has geared up to tackle the fresh challenge. It has reactivated the Covid control room, re-engaged doctors and recalled call centre executives. It has also planned to increase strength of rapid response teams (RRTs) to track and trace contacts, monitor home isolation cases and shift patients needing hospitalisation. “Our people are fully adept at handling the unprecedented scenario emerging out of a possible third wave. However, vaccination, contact tracing and enforcement will go aggressively along with containment and medical care,” said BMC commissioner Sanjay Kumar Singh. In the second wave alone, the capital city reported 88,000 cases, more than double in the first wave (35,000 cases). It had reported more than 700 deaths in the second wave with cumulative fatalities rising to 1097 till Thursday. The city has so far witnessed 1,23,602 cases since the outbreak. Suvendu Sahu, BMC deputy commissioner in charge of Covid management, said 16 RRT teams are active now besides 20 doctors being deployed at the control room. “We also have six personnel, including doctors, manning the 1929 call centre. We are going to augment the Omicron isolation ward at Sum hospital. We already have a 45-bed isolation facility at Chandrasekharpur,” Sahu said. After detection of Omicron variant, the city authorities have stepped up enforcement activities. On Friday, the BMC squads escorted by city police visited crowded places and markets and asked shopkeepers and vendors to close shops at 9 pm in view of possible crowding on New Year’s eve.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/bmc-in-fight-mode-to-tackle-o-threat/articleshow/88625774.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Punjab: Farm unions slam move to politicise front||BATHINDA: Farm unionist Balbir Singh Rajewal and other farm leaders’ decision to form a political front, Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), has come under sharp criticism from fellow unionists and support from unions has also fallen. SSM has been formed by a group of farm leaders on the lines of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the farmers’ front which spearheaded the year-long agitation against the now-repealed farm laws. However, many senior leaders of SKM have criticized the move to form the political front. SKM senior leader Darshan Pal, who turned out to be a key negotiator during the agitation, called the decision to form the political group as "height of lust for power, especially among those who till some time ago, were using choicest words for politicians and political parties". Pal said some farm groups had unmasked their desire of grabbing power by using the name of SKM. "It seems they will soon get irrelevant. Farm groups have developed this wrong notion that they have become demi gods. This decision has downgraded the goodwill generated by our victory. Taking political plunge by part of SKM is against constitution of SKM and farm groups may have to repent the decision," he said. Pal said these were the same leaders who wanted longer punishment for Haryana-based farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni for talking politics, but now they were treading on the same path. "The mass base struggling groups are not part of it," he said. The first fallout of the SKM’s formation has been seen in the lack of support extended to the front. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) distanced itself from SSM. Soon, other bigger farmer groups BKU (Ekta Sidhupur), Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, BKU (Krantikari), Krantikari Kisan Union and half a dozen other outfits also announced that they had nothing to do with the political front formed by farm groups. The other big farmer outfits — BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) and BKU (Lakhowal), Kirti Kisan Union led by Nirbhai Singh Dhudike, and All Indian Kisan Sabha, associated with CPI (M), took some days in announcing their decision of distancing from SSM. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan echoed sentiments similar to to those expressed by Pal. He said those who had decided to take the political path ware digging a pit for themselves and would fall from grace. "We have never expected any good from politics. What we have achieved is only by indulging in struggles and mass protests. We will continue with it," he added. BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) president Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said they might not be able to achieve by indulging in politics what they can achieve by protests. Unnerved by the annoyance of fellow unionists, SSM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said traditional parties had been looting Punjab and mistreating Punjabis and the wrongs needed to be corrected for future generations and to save the resources of Punjab from being looted. "Punjab need a sincere and honest dispensation which could take it back to its pristine glory," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/farm-unions-slam-move-to-politicise-front/articleshow/88625778.cms||Neel Kamal

Thus the BJP is behind this naked attempt to take over control of the religious body, they said.Terming Sirsa’s move to become president of the DSGMC after he put in his papers and joined the BJP as “immoral”, the senior SAD leaders said, “Sikh panth will not tolerate this at any cost.” Akali leaders said the move was also illegal and unconstitutional. They said Sirsa had resigned from the old committee which will itself cease once the new committee is formed. “The constitution of the new committee, to which elections were held a few months back, is already delayed. Now instead of forming the new committee, Sirsa is being thrust on the DSGMC with the tacit support of the BJP,” said the SAD leadership.“In fact, the move will alienate the Sikh community from the party. BJP must immediately stop all efforts to take over the management of the DSGMC through proxies like Sirsa,” they alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/akali-dal-says-bjp-trying-to-interfere-in-dsgmc-affairs/articleshow/88625783.cms||---

In these riots, a leader of his own party was involved, who is also the main accused in the riots,” he claimed. Instead of taking action against the leader, Kejriwal kept on patronising him, alleged Sharma. The Delhi high court has also reprimanded the Delhi government many times in this matter, he claimed. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader added that under Kejriwal’s rule, there has been a 40% increase in riots in the national capital region (NCR). The Delhi Police, however, is not managed by the Delhi governmen, which is governed by the Aam Aadmi Party , but by the Centre, where the incumbent is Sharma’s BJP. “You are not able to handle national capital Delhi and you are taking out a peace march in Punjab, which is anyway a quiet province.

He said that even after ten days, the weak state government could not nab the mastermind behind Golden temple Sacrilege though it had promised to nab the conspirators within 48 hours. While recalling the Maur bomb blast before 2017 assembly elections and sacrilege at Bargari in 2015, the Kejriwal said that attempts are being made again to disturb the peace and tranquility in Punjab as it was done earlier.  Kejriwal, who was here to lead the peace march in Patiala, said, “The mastermind behind the Bargari sacrilege case is yet to be nabbed. Had the culprits of Bargari sacrilege been given stringent punishment, none would have ever attempted for another sacrilege.” He added, “The incumbent Channi government in Punjab is too weak and unable to restore peace in the state. The leaders here are not worried about the betterment of Punjab but are busy fighting for the CM’s chair.”  He added that assembly elections are going to be held in Punjab in next few days and some people have started their dirty deeds. “An attempt of desecration was made at Golden Temple in Amritsar and a bomb exploded in Ludhiana. Such attempts are being made to break the communal harmony of Punjab and disturb the peace and tranquility here. People of Punjab had no faith in these (Congress, Captain, Badal, BJP) parties as only ordinary people could save Punjab. And for this, three crore Punjabis must come together”. He also launched an attack on the Congress over the Golden Temple incident. “The announcement of the Congress government to crack the case in 48 hours has not been fulfilled yet. The conspirators who tried to break the communal harmony of Punjab have not been caught. Why the desecration of Sri Guru Granth Sahib and other religious scriptures and places, bomb blasts and terrorist activities started just before the elections. That is why Punjabis need to be extremely vigilant and united.” Several AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, state president Bhagwant Mann and Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema paid obeisance at the historic Gurdwara Sri Dukh Niwaran Sahib and Sri Kali Mata Mandir and prayed for communal harmony in Punjab.

BJP former leader Sheetal Angural was declared party candidate on Tuesday, a day after he joined AAP in Mohali.“There were eight surveys of ticket aspirants from the constituency and now party leadership should tell when was the survey about Angural conducted, as he was given the ticket just 17 hours after being inducted in the party. Let the party disclose if it found anything wrong with my track record on the ‘three Cs’ (corruption, criminal record and character) criteria and also explain the record of the fellow on this criteria who has been picked up for the ticket. Let everything be put in public domain,” said Dr Mali while speaking to TOI on Friday. A dermatologist and a former government doctor who resigned from the post of senior medical officer before joining AAP in 2016, Mali said he was the only AAP leader in the state who had been running a mohalla clinic. “In this mohalla clinic, I have around 30,000 registered patients and I provide them medicines from my pocket. I want senior leadership who took decision on the ticket to compare my credentials with the person they have picked; they should put everything in public domain,” he said. Dr Mali claimed that he was serving as SMO when then AAP observer from Delhi pursued him in 2015 to join the party while stating they wanted him to contest elections from Jalandhar West constituency in 2017. 0“I would have become civil surgeon in a few months and could have even become director of health, Punjab, but they pursued me so strongly that I applied for retirement. When I put in my papers, my gross salary was Rs 2.75 lakh. When I was still in the notice period of three months, they made me to deposit salary of a month and half and to quickly join the party in the beginning of 2016. However, later, I was not given ticket. I still remained loyal to the party despite disappointment. Then I was given the hint that I would be fielded in 2019 parliamentary elections. Accordingly, I worked in the area but then Justice Jora Singh was brought and he lost. Now, they have brought a leader from another party,” he said.“How can people trust leadership if volunteers can be betrayed so brazenly?” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-leader-raises-questions-over-ticket-to-bjp-turncoat/articleshow/88625790.cms||IP Singh

There was a fall of 23.74% in vehicle registration in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown and a 3.72% decrease in 2019. In 2018, the city registered an increase of 9.83% in vehicle registration.Altogether 72,521 new vehicles were registered at the district transport office, Guwahati, in 2020, while 95,096 were added in 2019, 98,773 in 2018 and 89,932 in 2017.Assam witnessed around 12% increase in vehicle registration compared to last year. Out of the 33 districts, Kamrup (Metropolitan) topped the list with 82,767 vehicles registered followed by Nagaon (26,476), Dibrugarh (22,583), Sonitpur (22,286) and Jorhat (19,429).“The capital of Assam was shifted from Shillong to Dispur in 1972. The city then had a population of just around 2 lakh. This has increased to around 13 lakh in 2021. The increase in population can be attributed to the migration of people from villages to the city. Most of them have settled here. But the city has remained unplanned. If the previous governments had done some planning, the city would not have experienced severe traffic congestion, worsening flooding, drinking water crisis and encroachment,” said Hemen Lahkar, a conservationist who has studied the problems associated with lack of planning. The state government has started constructing flyovers to mitigate the worsening traffic condition. Two more flyovers — one from Maligaon to Kamakhya Gate and the other connecting Sarabhati Chariali with Nepali Mandir — are being constructed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/14-rise-in-vehicle-registration-in-city-in-2021/articleshow/88625796.cms||Mukut Das

Senior DU officials said the decision was taken after a few students approached the university’s examination department requesting for another chance to take the OBE. Speaking to TOI, D S Rawat, DU’s dean of examinations, said: “We received representations from six to seven students who could not appear for the examinations. While some said that they could not take the exam as they were down with Covid, another group of students said that due to an internet shutdown in Rajasthan for a day, they were unable to appear for the exams.” While a datesheet has not been prepared yet, officials said the OBE would be held in January itself. “Initially, there were discussions around whether we should allow only these students who have approached us to take the examination again. However, that will not be justified for the othersas there may be several students who have been unable to approach us. So, we decided to hold another round of examinations for only those who have valid reasons,” Rawat said. The interested students will be required to either produce certificates or relevant documents to prove that they missed their examinations due to a valid reason. These documents are to be submitted to the respective colleges. “Once the documents are submitted, the colleges will share the relevant data on the number of students wanting to take the exams. Depending on the data, a datesheet will be prepared and shared with the students,” Rawat said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/du-to-conduct-another-round-of-obe-in-jan/articleshow/88624419.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Many private hospitals in Madurai, which have multi specialities, are yet to restrict entry of visitors to visit inpatients, The hospitals continue to be crowded from morning till night. ``I went to a hospital near Uthangudi and was shocked to see patients, attenders and hospital staff except doctors using the common lift, that too in a packed condition,’’ said T Thiagarajan, who went to visit a friend but decided to take four flights of stairs. Many people sometimes accompany a patient. ``What is more scary is that even masks are not been stressed in many hospitals,’’ said S Shanmugam, an engineer who was concerned on seeing large crowds at a hospital in K K Nagar. N Venkadeswari, who had been an attendant to a patient at a hospital in Chennai, says the precautions taken in the hospital where she stayed was exemplary. ``They allowed only one person to stay with the patient throughout the hospitalisation and he or she was also asked to take RT-PCR test. No visitors were allowed and this was very strictly followed,’’ she said. Health activist A Veronica Mary says the directorate of medical and rural health services, which gives permission to private hospitals, should also monitor them strictly during the pandemic.`` Hospitals should also be made to display their bed strength, occupation and number of Covid patients prominently on their notice boards and websites so that at least people visiting them would be cautious,’’ she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/crowded-lifts-and-maskless-faces-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/88624418.cms||---

Initially, the number of testings will be double, which could be tripled after a week. At present, around 300 RT-PCR tests are being done at government facilities. These will be increased to 1,200 soon. Rekhawar said, "We have decided to increase the testing as it will help in early detection of the Covid infection. Currently, the Delta variant is dominant but the chances of emergence of more Omicron cases are likely. This variant spreads fast and hence, early testing and tracing will help us manage oxygen requirement, beds and health staff for the possible third wave.”Rekhawar said that the directions have been given to set up more quarantine centres so that home isolation which can cause the further spread of the virus can be stopped. In Satara, three persons who arrived from Uganda tested positive for Omicron and were in home isolation, however, soon their family members also tested positive. In such circumstances, home isolation may turn out to be threatening to close relatives. So the positive patients could be kept at quarantine facilities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/covid-testing-to-be-tripled-in-kolhapur-dist/articleshow/88625801.cms||---

Many appreciated Hope Fest as a beginning in the right direction wherein the festival tried to address some challenges that performing artists, in general and those in the theatre field in particular, are facing in the backdrop of Covid.“Covid has thrown up multiple challenges to theatre persons. At the primary level, the pandemic pushed most of them into severe financial distress. At another level, they also face a creative challenge in locating what should be the form and content of theatre during the uncertain days,” said K V Ganesh of the theatre collective ‘Rangachethana’.Interestingly, several items showcased were solo performances or productions featuring two performers. Director Abheesh Sasidharan, who presented his play ‘Bhranthu’ (Madness), said the pandemic imposes curbs on the audience watching the play. “Artistic performances involve a multi-dimensional ‘give and take’ between the audience and all those involved in their creations. Festivals like Hope Fest create positive vibes among all of them,” he said. “There were several limitations, but we were excited because we were seeing the stage and what is on stage after almost two years,” said Neema, a theatre actor from Valanchery. However, a section of theatre activists allege that the academy officials failed to adopt a transparent and democratic approach in organizing the event.‘Once upon a Clown Time’, a clown show conceived and performed by Monica Santos Zamorano from Spain was an interesting treat.Higher education minister R Bindu inaugurated the concluding session.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hope-fest-ends-on-mixed-emotions/articleshow/88625807.cms||T Ramavarman

Maharashtra’s textile commissioner Shital Teli-Ugale has written to the finance head of the power supply undertaking - Mahavitaran- to stop issuing power supply bills by deducting the subsidy portion. As per the textile policy, the government provides subsidy and every year over Rs 150 crore of power bills are waived by means of subsidy. The government had suspicion that the power provided to the looms is used for non-textile purposes. A surprise bid by the textile commissionerate had revealed this. Accordingly, the government in June 2020, made it mandatory for the powerlooms with connections of 27 horsepower and more to submit declaration, submit documents regarding the establishment, ownership power consumed, power supply bills online. The decision had upset powerloom operators. Vinay Mahajan, president of Yantramag Dharak Sanghatana of Ichalkaranji, said, “The government has already increased the power charges by Rs 1.20 per unit, which we are demanding to cancel. Finance minister Ajit Pawar had assured to cut down Rs 75 paise from the power rates two years ago but it had not yet been implemented.” According to the letter from Teli-Ugale, only 970 mills, mostly the cotton mills and processing units have submitted their details online. “For online submission, the textile department demanded from us to upload the invoices for the looms we have bought several years and sometimes several decades ago. How we will furnish such documents? If the government want to put us through another difficulty we will resist,” said Mahajan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/power-looms-fail-to-file-for-govt-subsidy/articleshow/88625808.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The 22-year-old accused had gone missing soon after the murder and was tracked down on Thursday. On Friday, the woman was taken to the house in North Paravur for evidence collection and the sleuths recovered a knife she used to stab her sister before setting her on fire. Although the woman had a history of mental health issues, police said that the woman appeared stable and admitted in detail how she committed the crime. The police lookout notice had stated that the young woman had been facing mental health issues. According to police, she had gone missing twice in the past. Police had found her both times and lodged her in a shelter home after being produced before the magistrate. However, the parents later brought her home. “We are not making any presumptions about her psychological condition. Our investigation findings, including her mental health history, are being recorded and will be submitted before the court. The court will take a call on the actions. As evidence, we collected the dress she wore while committing the crime and the knife used to stab the victim,” said a senior officer with North Paravur police. The women had an argument during which the younger one brandished a knife, said police. “After stabbing the victim, the woman poured kerosene on her and set her afire. She also hit her with a piece of wood. We have booked her under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC,” said an officer. Police said that the woman was produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody. Whenever the parents went out, they restricted the younger woman’s movements by tying her up or locking her in a room; she was confined to the house on Tuesday too, said police. “The bathroom was outside the house. The family used to unlock her room to let her use it.

Satheesan told reporters in Kochi on Friday that the DPR of the proposed project recommends to increase the third class and second-class AC ticket fair of existing trains and it also recommends to increase the toll rates on the highways across the state, aiming to make the K-Rail a profitable project. “The project is only for the benefit of high-class people and it is totally against the interest of the common people,” he said, adding that the stubborn stand of the LDF government in support of the project was evidence for the strong influence of corporates on the CPM-led government.Satheesan criticized that leaders in CPM who have reservations about the project are not bold enough to express their opinion. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/k-rail-dpr-exposes-anti-people-stand/articleshow/88625810.cms||---

KMRL has also received permission from LSGD for the maintenance of the existing walkway in Panampilly Nagar for 10 more years. As per the order issued by the secretary of LSGD, Biju Prabhakar, the sanction is subject to the MoU with GCDA and Kochi corporation that should specify the terms and conditions, including that on who should bear the financial liability.  The walkway along the Shihab Thangal Road near Panampilly Nagar was launched by KMRL in 2016. In a short span of time, the walkway became one of the most active open places in the city .The proposal was to develop a walkway through Canal Road which links Panampilly Nagar and Giri Nagar. But the project was delayed indefinitely for several years. It is learnt that as KMRL has received sanction for the extension, it will start a tender process for the one-km-long work of the proposed walkway soon. Meanwhile, councilors of Panampilly Nagar, Kadavanthra and Girinagar divisions of the corporation are yet to receive any official information regarding the sanction for the extension of the walkway and the maintenance period. Malini Kurupp, councilor of Girinagar division where the Kadavanthra Metro station is located, said that it would be a good move if the walkway extends to Kadavanthra as hundreds of people are using the existing walkway. Member of Panampilly Nagar division Anjana said that the extension would be a blessing to people. Lack of funds for the maintenance of the walkway was a major issue for the corporation. But the extension of KMRL’s right for maintenance of the walkway for another 10 more years is expected to resolve the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/streetscape-to-be-extended-to-kadavanthra-metro-stn/articleshow/88625811.cms||---

The crew under Air India Express Employees Union (AIXEU) had organized a national-level protest on Dec 14 raising various demands over the alleged ‘gross injustice’ meted out by the management. They alleged discrimination from the management as the period of employment contract was curtailed from 5 years to 1 year only for cabin crew. They also demanded that the existing salary-cut, implemented in the wake of pandemic impact, be revoked. AIXEU (BMS) president KK Vijayakumar said a notice on the strike was sent to AIE CEO. He said that reducing cabin crew’s contract period, whilst according five-year contracts to other staff and new recruits was unjust.“We met the management nine times along with central labour commissioner, but got no positive response. Our members constitute nearly 70% of AIE cabin crew and an indefinite strike will affect flight operations,” he said. Sources confirmed that the CEO got the notice. As AIE’s disinvestment is in the final stage and a new management is to take charge, it’s unclear how the airline will respond to the protest.

The board has even got permission from the social forestry department to fell 417 trees.  But according to KSEB officials, there was no space to set up rooftop panels as the plant and the old staff quarters on the premises are in bad condition. “The trees will be felled for setting up ground-mounted solar panels. As the quarters are in bad condition and the equipment is still inside the plant, there is no facility to set up roof-mounted solar panels. The solar panels will be set up in four sites to generate 2.5MW from one site,” said a KSEB official. The project is coming along with another one in Palakkad. Another KSEB official said the policy of the KSEB was to generate solar energy without felling trees. “For the project in Palakkad, no trees were felled. The board’s policy is to generate renewable energy without felling trees. It is not sure why the board has taken up the project at Brahmapuram plant, which has thick green cover, by felling trees,” said another official. The diesel plant has been remaining unused for quite a long time after it was found not viable to operate. Experts also noted that the move of KSEB was absurd. “The board could have dismantled the plant and used the site for setting up solar panels. The current move is a dangerous one. They can hijack the objection by easily saying that plants will be planted for every tree they fell. But what is the use of planting saplings somewhere else after felling trees in other places,” said C Jayaraman, certified energy auditor in Ernakulam. He was also the first state coordinator of Petroleum conservation research association. He said the move of the board itself was to stall the state’s move to tap renewable energy resources. “Many complaints regarding the solar projects of KSEB have surfaced. KSEB had even written to the state planning board against tapping solar energy years ago,” he said. While environmentalist Sreedhar Radhakrishnan, convener of Kerala Parishithi Aikya Vedhi, feels the felling of trees for the solar project was a madness. “Kerala has good potential where rooftop solar panels can be installed to generate solar energy. For bulk production, they could utilize floating solar panels in reservoirs,” Radhakrishnan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/417-trees-to-be-cut-for-solar-project/articleshow/88625814.cms||T C Sreemol

Criticising Congress as well as the SP for not supporting government action against terrorists, the BJP leader said that “when terrorists had attacked Uri and Pulwama, they had forgotten that ‘mouni baba’ (Manmohan Singh) was not the PM.

The forest department has decided to count the number of migratory birds visiting Wadhwana lake on January 7. After getting Ramsar site recognition, this is the first bird census to be conducted at the lake and adjacent sites.“It will be an elaborate census wherein birds flying in from different parts of the country as well as other countries will be counted. Our teams will conduct the census in two parts — one in the morning and another in the evening. We will then collate the figures,” said H D Raolji, assistant conservator of forests, Vadodara.The forest department has divided the lake, small water bodies and surrounding sites in 13 zones and one team will be deployed for each zone. Eight zones are for the lake and five outside the lake area. Majority of the birds are spotted flying over the lake or perched on the mounds in the water body. In the last census, the forest department had adopted a new counting system by roping in two scientists from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).In the bird count organized in January 2021, over 64,000 birds of 133 species were spotted in and around the Wadhwana lake. The number was much less than the 2020 bird census when the lake hosted 83,000 birds and 200 species. Forest officials said that the lake was brimming with water in January 2021 and hence many birds roosted in adjacent fields or marshy lands.When asked if they are expecting a higher number of birds in this census, Raolji told TOI, “We had conducted a census with an NGO a fortnight ago and counted about 60,000 birds. The water levels are now going down in the lake so we hope to see more birds in our official census.”A detailed report including the total count of birds along with the variety of the winged guests will be prepared by the forest department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/wadhwana-to-count-its-winged-visitors-on-jan-7/articleshow/88625821.cms||Tushar Tere

---||India||Ludhiana court blast: NIA books SFJ activist but no clarity on his detention yet||NEW DELHI: The agencies investigating the Ludhiana court blast suspect that the RDX used in the improvised explosive device (IED) was possibly transported via drone sent across the border into Punjab by Pakistan-based handlers. It is believed that the bomber Gagandeep was radicalised and roped in by masterminds based abroad, including in Pakistan, who fuel pro-Khalistan sentiments and Sikh radicalism among vulnerable youths in Punjab, to carry out a terror attack in Punjab. He was, in fact, taking instructions on his phone on assembling the bomb at the Ludhiana court complex toilet, when it accidentally went off, killing him on the spot. An officer said the instructing voice on the other side may hold vital clues to the involvement of foreign-based elements in the terror conspiracy. Meanwhile, there is no clarity on the purported arrest or detention of Jaswinder Singh Multani, the Germany-based operative of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), an outlawed outfit under the UAPA, in Germany. An NIA source told TOI that the agency has no knowledge of the detention of Multani, who is being linked to the Ludhiana blast, in Germany. Enquiries with the Central intelligence agencies too drew the same response. Another officer of the Central security establishment told TOI that Multani was not under arrest in Germany. Even so, NIA on Thursday registered a case under Section 120B and 121A of IPC and various sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 against Multani. The case relates to an alleged criminal conspiracy hatched by him with other pro-Khalistan elements based abroad for radicalising, motivating and recruiting youths in Punjab on ground and online through social media platforms to propagate their ideology with the aim to secede Punjab from the Union of India. NIA said Multani and his associates have been involved in raising funds to procure arms, ammunition and explosives by using smuggling networks in Punjab to revive terrorism. Multani, NIA said, has been in touch with ISI operatives to carry out a terror attack in Mumbai and elsewhere in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nia-books-sfj-activist-but-no-clarity-on-his-detention-yet/articleshow/88625834.cms||Bharti Jain
