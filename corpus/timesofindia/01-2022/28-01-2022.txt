This includes students enrolled for one-year degrees. The latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show that the number of first-year Chinese students fell 5%, from 104,240 in 2019/2020 to 99,160 in 2020/2021. In contrast the number of new students from India soared by 27%, from 41,815 in 2019/2020 to 53,015 in 2020/21, the highest number on record. Indians represent 19% of all non-EU enrolments in 2020/21. This is the first time since HESA started collecting data in the early 1990s that the number of students from China has fallen. There are currently 143,820 Chinese students across all years studying at British universities, making them the largest number of international students. Students from India, of which there are now 84,555 across all years, are the second-largest group. The number of Indians coming to Britain to study has risen sharply since 2018/2018 when there were 18,305 first-year students. “UK is a chosen destination by students from India,” said Indian National Student Association UK president Amit Tiwari. “The factors driving this are quality of education, recognition of the qualification and, of course, the English language. Indian students also appreciate the fact that they get a chance to apply experience to their studies due to the post-study work visa. We can only see the trend increasing of Indian students coming to the UK.” The two-year post-study work visa, known as the graduate route, opened for applications on July 1, 2021. It is not known whether the drop in Chinese students is due to Covid-19 and Chinese students being unable to travel or worried about having to spend a year in the UK studying online due to the pandemic, or whether it is due to the deteriorating relationship between Britain and China. “It’s wonderful to see rising international student numbers in the UK but we need our universities to diversify recruitment,” said Jo Johnson, former universities minister, who is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s brother. He told TOI: “To have one in three international students from outside the EU coming from China represents a material risk to the financial resilience of the UK higher education system and wider knowledge economy.” Sanam Arora, founder and chair of National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK, said: “We have long believed that India is the most natural partner for the UK on the international education front, and that the UK can significantly increase its intake of Indian students if it is able to provide a compelling offer. Post-study work rights are critical to that offer, and the results of that are already being seen in the doubling of numbers from India and I do think this increase will continue. I am excited to see what comes out of the FTA negotiations.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/appetite-for-a-uk-education-soars-in-india-decreases-in-china/articleshow/89165771.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||'Long overdue': Biden vows to nominate 1st Black woman Justice at SC by February end||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday said he plans by the end of February to nominate a Black woman to replace retiring US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a historic first that he called "long overdue". Biden appeared with Breyer, whom he has known since the 1970s, at the White House after the 83-year-old justice formally announced his retirement in a letter to the President. Breyer wrote that he plans to depart at the conclusion of the court's current term, typically at the end of June, assuming his successor has been confirmed by the US Senate. Biden, who won the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination in large part because of strong support from Black voters, noted that he committed during that campaign to name a Black woman to a lifetime post on the high court and would keep his promise. "Our process is going to be rigorous. I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence and decency," Biden said, calling the selection of a Supreme Court justice one of a president's most serious constitutional responsibilities. "While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity - and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court. It's long overdue, in my view," Biden said. Potential nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former Breyer law clerk confirmed by the Senate last June to serve on an influential US appellate court, and Leondra Kruger who serves on the California Supreme Court. Another potential contender is Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina who Biden already has nominated to the US appeals court in Washington. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden believes that being a sitting judge is not prerequisite for his nominee and that whether a candidate could draw support from Republicans is not an influencing factor. Biden said he wants the Senate, which his fellow Democrats control by a razor-thin margin, to "move promptly" once he chooses his nominee. Democrats can confirm a nominee without a single Republican vote because Republicans in 2017 changed the Senate rules to no longer require 60 of the 100 senators to allow Supreme Court nominations to move forward. While Breyer's retirement after 27 years gives Biden his first chance to fill a vacancy on the nine-member court, it will not change its ideological balance. The court's 6-3 conservative majority has shown a growing willingness to reshape the law on contentious issues, including abortion and gun rights. Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump appointed three justices during his single four-year term in office. Breyer, the court's oldest justice often found himself in dissent on a court that has moved ever rightward. He spoke at the White House of the importance of a diverse nation like the United States resolving its deep divisions by adhering to the rule of law. "People have come to accept this Constitution and they have come to accept the importance of the rule of law," Breyer said, holding a copy of the 18th century foundational document in his hand. Accelerated pushDemocrats aim to quickly confirm Biden's nominee in a time frame similar to the one-month process that the chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, used in 2020 to approve Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, according to a source familiar with planning. Republicans are seeking to regain control of the Senate in the Nov. 8 congressional elections, underscoring the need for speed from the perspective of Democrats. McConnell has indicated he would block any Biden nominations to the court if his party regains the Senate majority. McConnell said in a statement: "The president must not outsource this important decision to the radical left. The American people deserve a nominee with demonstrated reverence for the written text of our laws and our Constitution." Trump's three conservative appointees who McConnell pushed through the Senate came from a shortlist prepared with the input of outside conservative legal activists associated with the Federalist Society. Biden said he was expressing the nation's gratitude to Breyer for his "remarkable career in public service" and noted past rulings the justice authored upholding abortion rights, voting rights, environmental measures and religious liberty. "This is a bittersweet day for me," Biden said. "I think he's a model public servant in a time of great division in this country." Democratic lawmakers and liberal activists have praised Breyer's retirement decision, which allows Biden to install a younger justice who could serve for decades just as Trump's three appointees can.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/long-overdue-biden-vows-to-nominate-1st-black-woman-justice-at-sc-by-february-end/articleshow/89165832.cms||---

Three Army soldiers were wounded in a gunfight with the terrorists on Wednesday. An official said that a joint team of police, Army and CRPF had launched a Cordon and Search Operation (CASO) on specific information about the presence of terrorists in the area on Wednesday evening. He said that as the joint team of forces approached the suspected spot, the hiding terrorists fired upon them, which was retaliated, triggering a gunfight. Two soldiers suffered bullet wounds in the initial burst of fire from automatic weapons, while a colleague was wounded later. They were taken to the Army’s 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar and two of them were said to be “critical”. The soldiers are Somveer Kumar, Mayank Singh and Sunil Kumar. However, terrorists escaped from the spot later on Thursday taking advantage of darkness. The security forces conducted searches in the locality, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/terrorists-escape-encounter-site-in-shopian-3-jawans-injured/articleshow/89165807.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Taking to his official handle, the PM shared a collage of four photos under the caption “Glimpses of India’s Vibrant Culture”, in which the local artistes performing “Dhediya” also featured.  Two dance troupes from the state were selected for Vande Bharatam Nritya Utsav to perform at the Republic Day parade, where one of them, led by Supriya Singh Rawat, gave a 12-minute performance.  An elated Supriya told TOI from Delhi, “It was a proud moment for all the 11 artists of the troupe, when the Prime Minister shared the photo of the Sangam City’s traditional folk dance from his Twitter handle”  “It’s like a dream come true. Our hard work has paid off,” she added.  The dance group left for Delhi on January 8 and were trained by renowned choreographers for the Republic Day celebrations.  The ministry of culture had launched ‘Vande Bharatam Nritya Utsav’, an all-India dance competition, as part of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav to select top talents for performing during the cultural programme at the R-Day parade.  Supriya said a total of 36 teams of dancers were selected through a nationwide competition. “It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s wish to have such a competition to showcase the unity and integrity of the country.”  The city-based dance group, selected under the folk dance category, also included Anushree Dubey, Madhurima Shree, Kritika Agarwal, Vartika Dubey, Saumya Chandra, Shehi, Prakriti Maurya and Kanishka Jaiswal.  With her performance, Supriya, said the Prayagraj’s traditional folk dance has been recognised across the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prayagrajs-dhediya-folk-dance-grabs-national-attention-as-pm-tweets-picture-of-r-day-performance/articleshow/89165773.cms||Kapil Dixit

They embarked on a Republic Day trail that saw a series of rides take place. To add to the spirit of the event, they also got dressed up keeping in mind the tricolour theme. At a time when the restrictions still on, the cycling trail was a socially-distant way to participate in some fun. ‘We cyclists gave out the message that we have an equal right to share the road’There was a huge turnout for the event with participants from different areas. The event took off early and if you stepped out in the cold morning, chances are you would have seen the groups whizz past you. Talking about the event, Firoza Suresh, Mumbai bicycle mayor, says, “It was after long that we had a ride for a special day and it was like a carpet of cyclists across Mumbai. There were rides in multiple wards with cyclists following the dress code – saffron, white and green. What was also very nice, was that many kids came in with their parents to join us for the Republic-Day celebrations. All the rides culminated in the new 1.8 km track at Lower Parel.” She adds that the day was special to them for a reason. “Republic Day is about the Constitution of India and we as cyclists wanted to say that we also have an equal right to share the roads. On days like these, when a large number of cyclists come out on the roads, it makes for a collective silent voice that we are here and we want to ride even more in our city.” Cold winter outside, warm spirit withinThe 12 bicycle councillors led their ride from different wards in the city, some taking off as early at 5.30 am. Samir Jhaveri, businessman and councillor from M-West, shares, “Our group had a mix of doctors, advocates, corporate folks, students, homemakers and children. We rode from Chembur to NCPA, then Gateway of India and then hosted a flag-hoisting ceremony near CSMT. The message from our ride was, ‘Keep pedalling, keep healthy’.” It was a special ride for those from K-East Ward. Melvin Rodrigues, a tutor and bicycle counsellor, reveals, “Our route was from Marol in Andheri East to Lower Parel. The ride was certainly special because for us from our starting location to the end point and back, it made for exactly 73 kms on India’s 73rd Republic Day. Everyone also followed dress code and we had a round of picture session too. It was such a wonderful experience and a day that we will not forget.” Husain Mamuwala, second-year college student and bicycle councillor from South Mumbai shares that they rode from NCPA to the new track at Lower Parel. “Most of our ride was by the sea and we stopped for pictures enroute. We would like more Mumbaikars to join us in the future.” More Mumbaikars are now seeing cycling as a carbon-free commuteSuresh says that more people are welcoming the idea of cycling and that there is an increasing awareness towards cycling now. She says, “More Mumbaikars are seeing cycles as a way of staying fit, a way to commute and as a tool for being environment-conscious as we all know how a cycle can reduce pollution and the carbon footprint. It’s a welcoming change now to also see three cycle tracks in Mumbai – at Lower Parel, Mahalaxmi Race Course and the third at BKC. We are hoping to have more cycle tracks in the city and our next proposal is for more cycling activities to take place at G-South ward (Worli).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclists-celebrate-republic-day-with-a-trail-across-the-city/articleshow/89164617.cms||Ismat Tahseen

Regional security with focus on Afghanistan, along with connectivity, dominated the summit that saw Modi emphasising that the Central Asian region was central to India’s vision of an integrated and stable "extended neighbourhood". The 2 sides agreed to form separate joint working groups to address the Afghanistan situation and encourage connectivity through the Chabahar port with the land-locked region comprising 5 countries - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The presidents of all 5 countries participated in the summit. While China was not really the focus of attention in the virtual meeting, both sides agreed, according to a joint declaration, that connectivity initiatives had to be based on the principles of transparency, broad participation, local priorities, financial sustainability and "respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries". The India-Central Asia summit came only 2 days after Chinese President Xi Jinping's own summit meeting with the Central Asian leaders in which he offered $ 500 million as aid to the 5 countries. Modi said India and Central Asia had same concerns and objectives on regional security. "We are all concerned about the developments in Afghanistan. In this context also, our mutual cooperation has become even more important for regional security and stability," said the PM in his opening remarks, adding that cooperation between India and Central Asia was essential for regional security and prosperity. Three Central Asian countries - Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - share border with Afghanistan. In keeping with the consensus reached last year at the Delhi Security Dialogue on Afghanistan, the summit called for formation of a truly representative and inclusive government, combating terrorism and drug trafficking, central role of the UN, providing immediate humanitarian assistance for the people of Afghanistan and "preserving the rights of women, children and other national ethnic groups and minorities". The leaders reiterated strong support for a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan while emphasizing the respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and non-interference in its internal affairs, according to the declaration. "They also discussed the current humanitarian situation and decided to continue to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan," it said. According to the declaration, the leaders also reaffirmed the importance of UNSC Resolution 2593, passed last year under India's presidency, which unequivocally demanded that Afghan territory not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts and called for concerted action against all terrorist groups, including those sanctioned by the UNSC. A proposal for joint counter-terrorism exercise was also discussed with the leaders condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. They reiterated that "providing support, using terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism, terror financing, arms and drugs trafficking, dissemination of a radical ideology and abuse of cyber space to spread disinformation and incite violence, goes against the basic principles of humanity and international relations". Modi said that apart from regional security and establishment of a framework of regular interactions, the third objective of the summit was to create an ambitious roadmap for our cooperation. "Through this, we will be able to adopt an integrated approach for regional connectivity and cooperation for the next 30 years," he said. The government said that there was an agreement to institutionalize the summit mechanism by holding it every 2 years. "They also agreed on regular meetings of Foreign Ministers, Trade Ministers, Culture Ministers and Secretaries of the Security Council to prepare the groundwork for the Summit meetings. An India-Central Asia Secretariat in New Delhi would be set up to support the new mechanism," said the government in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/share-concerns-with-central-asia-on-afghanistan-terrorism-says-pm-modi/articleshow/89166324.cms||Sachin Parashar

They pointed out that protests erupted in parts of Bihar and UP which have high concentration of coaching institutes. They said the coaching institutes would be keen on more applicants qualifying after the first round as that would directly help their business. “Since the people running these coaching centres are more aware and have better understanding of the laid-down norms, they should have made applicants understand why 7.05 lakh candidates were shortlisted for 35,281 vacancies. They were also very much aware that one applicant could find his/ her name for more than one category of jobs. So, they should have helped the applicants understand the entire process,” said an official.

As a result, as Asia opened deep in the red, the sensex opened weak and was down over 1,400 points in mid-session, but bargain hunting in late trades helped it close with a loss of 581 points, or 1%, at 57,277. IT stocks, along with Reliance Industries, contributed the most to the day’s slide while buying in banking stocks cushioned the fall to some extent, BSE data showed. Along with stocks, bonds and rupee too were hit as a result of the US Fed statement. India government bonds too witnessed a sell-off with benchmark yield almost hitting the 6.75% level, a two-year peak, while the rupee weakened below the 75-to-the-dollar mark as fears about foreign fund withdrawal from the stock market grew. Data from BSE showed that on Thursday, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 6,267 crore. Since talk about a US Fed withdrawal of its bond buying programme has been going on for a while, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been taking money out of India, market players say. As a result, so far in the month, net selling by foreign funds from the stock market is almost Rs 29,000 crore (nearly $3.9 billion), combined data from BSE and CDSL showed. This is the highest monthly net withdrawal by FPIs from equities since March 2020, when at the start of the Covid pandemic, the sensex had tanked over 40% in less than three weeks. According to S Ranganathan, head of research, LKP Securities, even as the US Fed left key interest rates near zero, its hawkish commentary quickly washed away gains in global markets, leading to a gap-down opening in indices back home. “As FPI continued to book profits from Indian (stocks), value stocks made a comeback with the PSU Bank Index rallying over 5% (Thursday afternoon), supported by auto stocks, to stage a smart recovery,” Ranganathan wrote in a post-market note. The day’s slide also left investors poorer by about Rs 2.8 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 263.2 lakh crore, official data showed. In the government bond market, the yield on the 10-year benchmark hit almost 6.75%. In this backdrop, bond dealers said that the government’s planned Rs 24,000-crore bond auction on Friday will be interesting to watch out for. On the one hand, bond buyers would prefer to buy bonds at a lower price (that would push up yields), while RBI may be more inclined to keep yields under check. In the forex market, the rupee slid 29 paise to close below the 75-per-dollar mark again, at 75.07.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-581-points-as-federal-reserve-signals-rate-hike/articleshow/89166416.cms||---

Welcome to Air India’s future’||NEW DELHI: Air India’s Maharaja opened his eyes to a whole new world on Thursday, with the Tata Group reacquiring its old airline along with AI Express and a 50% stake in ground handler AI-SATS. Pilots on all AI flights of Friday will greet guests with the line, “This is your Captain speaking... Welcome to the future of Air India”. And Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran promised employees of the airline that “the golden age lies ahead”. The divestment was completed on Thursday — exactly two years after the preliminary information memorandum was issued. The government transferred 100% shares in AI to Tata's wholly owned subsidiary Talace Pvt Ltd along with management control.

In the purported video, Shah appears to be referring to the meeting he earlier had with the members of the community. “I said our bond goes back 650 years.

Sources in BJP refused to comment on the video clip, emphasising that Shah’s interaction with the Jat “influencers” was an in-camera affair and it is difficult for others to comment on the authenticity of the clip. “We have to be sure whether the comment was indeed made, whether what is being circulated has been doctored or plucked out of context,” said a party functionary on the condition of anonymity.

In the purported video, Shah appears to be referring to the meeting he earlier had with the members of the community. “I said our bond goes back 650 years. After the meeting, a few asked me to explain the remark, pointing out that BJP is not even 50 years-old. I said that you fought Mughals, we are also fighting.” Read AlsoAmit Shah woos west UP Jat leaders ahead of assembly electionsAnxious to assuage the sullenness of sections of the Jat community in Western UP, Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday wooed a group of community influencers by stressing similarity of “nationalist” outlook, recalling communal riots of 2013 and promising resolution of their grievances andThe alleged comment drew applause from Jat representatives who turned up for the meeting organised at the residence of Delhi MP Parvesh Varma as part of an outreach to the members of the community, crucial for the outcome in many constituencies of Western UP, which remains annoyed with BJP over the now-repealed three farm reform laws. Sources in BJP refused to comment on the video clip, emphasising that Shah’s interaction with the Jat “influencers” was an in-camera affair and it is difficult for others to comment on the authenticity of the clip. “We have to be sure whether the comment was indeed made, whether what is being circulated has been doctored or plucked out of context,” said a party functionary on the condition of anonymity.

This observation from a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice A S Bopanna came prior to its order protecting Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia from arrest till Monday in a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had rejected Majithia’s anticipatory bail plea in the FIR lodged against him on December 20 and had given him three days to move the SC, a deadline which was to expire on Thursday. Appearing for Majithia, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told the bench that the Congress government led by Charanjit Singh Channi is wreaking vengeance against Majithia only because he belonged to a rival political party. Majithia has fully cooperated with the investigating officer and yet the police want to arrest him. “It is the election fever when political opponents are targeted,” Rohatgi said. CJI Ramana said, “We do not know. You are the best person to understand why states go after their political opponents just before elections. It is not election fever. It is the election virus which makes all opponents of ruling parties run to the court for protection from arrest.” Finding senior advocate P Chidambram appearing for the Punjab government, the bench asked, “In all fairness, is it proper to do this (to Majithia on election-eve)?” Chidambaram accused Majithia of non-cooperation with investigations in the serious charges of drug being circulated with the help of the official machinery and said that he has been absconding for the past three days. The bench said, “Chidamabaram, you are appearing for the state government. You tell the government not to take any coercive step till Monday when we will hear the petition (by Majitha seeking anticipatory bail in the NDPS case).” Chidambaram requested the bench not to record this in the order and assured that he would convey the SC’s views to the Channi government. On January 24, the Punjab and Haryana HC’s Justice Lisa Gill had rejected Majithia’s anticipatory bail while agreeing with the state government that it was a serious offence, which brooked no delay in registration of FIR and prompt investigations into all aspects of the case. “Grave allegations of a serious nature of intentional use of government machinery including vehicles, security personnel and other government facilities for assisting, facilitating and abetting drug trafficking and other related illegal activities as well as receipt of illegal proceeds from such trafficking have been raised against the petitioner,” the judge had said. “In my considered opinion, there is indeed no embargo or bar upon the state government for proceeding to register FIR against the petitioner in case it has found that there is sufficient material to proceed against him,” the HC said, adding, “It cannot be denied that the petitioner indeed was at the helm of affairs at the time of occurrence of alleged offence(s). He was admittedly a cabinet minister for some part of the time and was admittedly closely related to then deputy chief minister of the state, besides, a member of Parliament... Merely on the ground that no action was taken by the state government for these long years, the petitioner is not entitled to relief in this petition”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/election-virus-causes-targeting-of-rivals-says-supreme-court/articleshow/89166514.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Of the Covid-19 jabs, the two Chinese vaccines — Sinovac and Sinopharm — cornered the largest volume shares at 21% and 19% (2.3 billion and 2.1 billion doses) respectively, while the share of India’s Serum Institute of India (SII) stood at 13% or 1.5 billion doses, according to UNICEF’s year in review. In India alone, the use of SII-manufactured Covishield is around 1.4 billion doses till now. As against this, in the pre-Covid era, the vaccine market for poliovirus vaccine — the largest global vaccine market (by volume) in 2019 — stood at 1.5 billion doses, whereas for seasonal influenza, it stood at 0.5 billion doses. Further, the 5.5 billion vaccines used for routine immunization included 85 different vaccines for different illnesses. The data highlights the inequity marked by the highly uneven global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. High-income countries received close to 200 doses per 100 inhabitants compared to less than 20 doses per 100 inhabitants in low-income countries. Even though the World Health Organization called for a moratorium on Covid-19 booster jabs until the end of 2021, their administration in rich nations increased drastically at the end of the year to fight the Omicron variant. Looking ahead, the focus for new vaccine supply agreements will be on pediatric, boosters and/or new variant-specific vaccines, it adds. Earlier, 115 countries entered into 515 supply agreements for 17.8 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines secured in addition to 5.3 billion optional doses. The rich nations had already managed to secure large volumes of doses by the end of 2020, whereas upper-middle income countries entered into supply agreements with a few months’ lag time and at significantly lower volumes. Lower-middle income countries were only able to secure an increasing number of doses via bilateral agreements from the second quarter of 2021 onwards, with the majority of those doses going to only a few countries. In less than a year since the first Covid-19 vaccines were introduced in the market, 33 different jabs have been approved for use by at least one national regulatory authority, the data said. The five vaccine producers — Sinovac, Sinopharm, Pfizer/BioNTech, SII and AstraZeneca — together comprised 80% of the total Covid vaccine market (by volume). Pfizer/BioNTech’s messenger RNA vaccine’s share stood at 18% (2 billion doses) and AstraZeneca’s at 8% (0.9 billion) in the global tally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-hit-world-doubled-vaccine-delivery-to-11-billion-in-2021-sii-produced-13-of-shots/articleshow/89166535.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

His critical remarks at a virtual panel discussion on Wednesday, even as India celebrated its 73rd republic Day, drew flak from BJP, VHP and BSP. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the “madness of bashing PM Narendra Modi has turned into conspiracy for India bashing”. “In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interpose a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism.... It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity,” PTI reported Ansari as saying. The discussion was organised by the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC), an organisation which has tried to get India blacklisted by the US, IANS reported quoting a DisinfoLab report. Actor Swara Bhaskar too participated in the IAMC event, it said. IAMC was booked under UAPA last year for spreading fake news to incite communal violence and reinforcing the narrative of minority plight in India. “As the Indian government continues to target practices of minority faiths, it creates an atmosphere where discrimination and violence can take root...,” the PTI report quoted Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who has a history of taking anti-India stands, as saying. The three other Congressmen who spoke — Jim McGovern, Andy Levin and Jamie Raskin — have traditionally taken anti-India stands irrespective of the governments in office in New Delhi. India has rejected criticism by foreign governments and human rights groups on allegations that civil liberties have eroded in the country. The government has emphasised that the Indian Constitution provides for adequate safeguards for ensuring the protection of human rights. The former vice-president’s remarks drew criticism from a range of organisations. Naqvi said that on a day when the country was celebrating Republic Day and the “tricolour was unfurled at Srinagar’s Lal Chowk, at the same time, someone who occupied a constitutional post criticised our country, speaking at a platform provided by an organisation that has worked against India and conspired to tarnish its image”. He said the “people who used to exploit minority votes are now anxious about the positive atmosphere in the country”. Naqvi claimed the IAMC “has links with ISI”. "The statement that Muslim society is insecure due to Hindu nationalism, is extremely unfortunate and condemnable. Despite being a dignitary like the vice-president of India in the past, he has tried to provoke the Muslim society of India,” VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said. BSP national spokesman Sudhindra Bhadoria too expressed disagreement with Ansari’s statement and said the people of India believe in ‘Sarvadharma Sambhav’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hamid-ansari-faces-flak-for-critical-remarks-on-nationalism/articleshow/89166614.cms||---

Many states, including Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, are also seeing rise in the number of infections as well as case-positivity rates. “Early indication of a plateau in cases are being reported in certain geographies. The trend needs to be observed and required precautions need to be continued,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. “Top 10 states in terms of active cases contribute to more than 77% of the total active cases in the country,” he added. As on Thursday morning, the total active caseload in the country stood at over 22 lakh. An average of 3.07 lakh fresh cases were recorded daily over the past one week. The weekly case positivity was recorded at 17.75%. While 11 states recorded more than 50,000 active cases each, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala have over three lakh active cases each. Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh also have over one lakh cases each. Among the districts of concern that are reporting a surge in cases and rise in positivity are Pune and Nagpur in Maharashtra; Ernakulum, Thiruvananthpuram and Kozikhode in Kerala; and Ahmedabad in Gujarat. Asked if the third wave of Covid has already peaked, Agarwal said though certain geographies in the country have noted plateauing of cases to an extent and the infection spread rate has also reduced in some areas, there are also areas where infection spread and the number of cases are rising. The overall picture is yet to emerge, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-cases-plateauing-in-some-states-rising-in-others-centre/articleshow/89166630.cms||---

The IFF’s January 3 RTI followed confirmation that over 2,000 digital news media publishers had furnished information to the I&B ministry following two notices issued by the government, first on May 26 last year and another on September 9. A senior government official told TOI: “What has been stayed by the courts is a small section of the IT Rules. The whole rules are not under litigation. In any case, if anyone has issues, they can go to court and the ministry will answer in court.” There are at least 10 petitions against the applicability of the IT Rules, 2021, pending in the Supreme Court and the HCs of Delhi, Madras, Bombay and Kerala, challenging the constitutional validity of the Rules. Part III of IT Rules 2021 pertains to digital news media publishers and prescribes they furnish information about their entities to the I&B ministry. This is part of the IT Rules’ three-tier structure and Code of Ethics. However, the Bombay HC on August 14 and the Madras HC on September 16 stayed the operation of the three-tier structure and the Code of Ethics. The IFF RTI had sought to know from the ministry whether it had issued the notices, the authority under which this was done, and to which publishers. The ministry’s response on January 14 said over 2,100 publishers of news media and OTT platforms have already furnished their details to the MIB. The ministry did not say how many of these publishers furnished their details after the Bombay HC passed its order, and said, according to IFF, that this “information does not exist at all”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-sought-info-from-media-companies-under-new-it-rules-stayed-by-hc/articleshow/89166655.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Covaxin, Covishield get regular market nod, with some riders||NEW DELHI: Drug regulator DCGI on Thursday granted regular marketing authorisation to the two commonly used Covid vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — for use in adults with certain conditions. However, the vaccines will be available only under “programmatic setting” and all vaccinations have to be recorded on CoWIN. This means though the vaccines will continue to be available at both public and private centres that are registered under government’s CoWIN, the jabs cannot be bought in retail at a pharmacy or chemist. The makers of both vaccines would have to submit data of overseas ongoing clinical trials of their formulations with due analysis every six months or earlier if available. So far, the two vaccines were under emergency use authorisation. While the vaccines were given approval based on limited data from ongoing clinical trials, the manufacturers had to submit safety and adverse events data to the regulator every 15 days. With the regular approval in place, manufactures can now submit such data once in six months. While the government has not shared details on the pricing of the two vaccines yet, the regular market authorisation may also enable the government to bring them under price regulation, sources said. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation had recommended for status upgrade for the vaccines from restricted use in emergency situations to grant of new drug permission with conditions in the adult population on January 19, 2022. “The latest approval accorded by DCGI... indicates the promptness and timeliness with which the public response strategy and decision-making apparatus of the country has responded to the emerging needs during the pandemic,” the health ministry said in its statement. “Conditional Market Authorisation” is a new category of market authorisation that has emerged during the current pandemic. The approval pathways through this route are fast-tracked with certain conditions to enhance the access to certain pharmaceuticals for meeting the emerging needs of drugs or vaccines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-covishield-get-regular-market-nod-with-some-riders/articleshow/89166694.cms||---

Not just this, they can also bring home some of the produces grown in the “fields of Baba Nanak” with them as prasad.This as the Project Management Unit (PMU) of Kartarpur Corridor on Thursday began organic cultivation of vegetables and other crops in the “fields of Guru Nanak” for the langar service of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.A total of 64 acres of land, which Sikh’s first master Guru Nanak Dev used to till, will be used for growing organic and chemical-free vegetables and other farm produces. The farming process began on Thursday with the chanting of ardas, said the chief executive officer (CEO), PMU, Muhammad Latif.“For now we have planted vegetables, which will be followed by sunflower, paddy and wheat. Seasonal vegetables will be a permanent feature for the langar of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. The Sangat would also be allowed to take the produce of Baba Nanak’s fields with them as prashad,” he said.The CEO also said that a dedicated fruit tree garden was also being planned, for which the PMU had begun preparations like levelling of fields.Latif further said that they had also begun preparations for the Jashan-e-Baharan, first spring festival since the opening of the Kartapur Corridor.The Kartapur Corridor was inaugurated on November 9, 2019, for day-long pilgrimage for the Indian devotees but was temporarily closed due to coronavirus outbreak on March 16, 2020. It was reopened on November 17, 2021. Sikh’s first master Guru Nanak Dev had spent around 18 years of his life till death here and used to till the land.

A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh also reduced the costs imposed by a single judge on Chawla from Rs 20 Lakh to Rs 2 lakh, agreeing with her stand that she did not take up the 5G issue in a “frivolous and casual manner”. The bench, however, indicated to Chawla that a litigant must use his or her own intelligence while filing documents in court. It allowed her appeal against a single judge order of last year where the suit filed by her and two others was dismissed with the observations that it was “defective”, “abuse of process of law”, and filed for “gaining publicity”. Chawla volunteered to work with Delhi State Legal Services Authority and feature in programmes for empowering the marginalized section of the society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-expunges-remarks-against-juhi-in-5g-case-cuts-fine-to-rs-2-lakh/articleshow/89166713.cms||---
---||World||Michigan school shooting suspect to pursue insanity defence||SOUTHFIELD: A teenager charged with killing four students at a Michigan high school will pursue an insanity defence, his lawyers said in a notice filed Thursday as he, his parents and school officials faced a new lawsuit over the attack at Oxford High School.  The notice, listed in a summary of case filings, should lead to mental health exams of the 15-year-old who is charged as an adult with murder and other crimes for the shooting, which also wounded six other students and a teacher. Experts will consider whether the teen understood the wrongfulness of his conduct on the day of the shooting.  The lawsuit, meanwhile, was announced on behalf of the parents of Tate Myre who was slain November 30, and other students who witnessed the shootings. It alleges negligence by school officials and Crumbley's parents over the attack.  "We're sad and heartbroken - our lives forever changed," William Myre said at a news conference. "Our family will never be the same. We're not doing good. All we do is walk around the house and think about Tate. We think about him every day. We sit in his room. We listen to his playlist off Spotify. We're not doing good, but we're going to find a way to get through it together."  The lawsuit, which seeks at least $25,000, names Oxford High School's dean of students, two counselors and three teachers as defendants. The accused and his parents also are named as defendants. The suspect's parents are accused of intentional, reckless and negligent conduct that led to the mass shooting. The Oxford High School staff and teachers are accused of gross negligence that led to the shooting by not removing the shooter from the school building earlier.  The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Oakland County Circuit Court on behalf of Tate Myre's parents, William and Sheri. Also named as plaintiffs are Chad and Meghan Gregory, whose son, Keegan, was hiding in a school bathroom with Justin Shilling when the latter was fatally shot.  The lawsuit also was filed on behalf of Lauren Aliano, whose daughters, Sophia Kempen and Grace Kempen, were hiding in classrooms during the shooting.  The suspect is being held in the Oakland County Jail.  The notice filed Thursday by his attorneys will lead to exams by the state Center for Forensic Psychiatry and experts retained by the defence and the prosecutor's office. Judge Kwame Rowe could also order an exam by another expert.  "This is absolutely appropriate to do. I doubt anyone is surprised by it," said Margaret Raben, a Detroit-area defence attorney not involved in the case. "All of this is going to take time. The forensic center is jammed, jammed, jammed with work."  After the reports are in, it will be up to the judge to decide if an insanity defence can go forward, Raben said.  Under Michigan law, if someone is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they don't walk free. They must be referred to a state psychiatric centre for custody and further evaluation.  Someone who is found guilty but mentally ill still would be sentenced to prison but with recommendations that they get treatment. School officials became concerned about the teen a day before the shooting, when a teacher saw him searching for ammunition on his phone. His mother was contacted and subsequently told her son in a text message: "Lol. I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught", according to Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald.  The day of the shooting, a teacher found a note on Ethan's desk and took a photo. It was a drawing of a gun pointing at the words, "The thoughts won't stop. Help me", McDonald said in December.  The drawing also featured a person who appeared to have been shot twice and is bleeding. "My life is useless" and "The world is dead", were written.  The gun used in the shooting was bought days before by the teen's father and he had full access to it, according to authorities.  McDonald has said that the parents committed "egregious" acts, from buying a gun on Black Friday and making it available to the boy to resisting his removal from school when they were summoned a few hours before the shooting.  They later were charged with involuntary manslaughter.  Detroit-area attorney Ven Johnson, who is representing the parents in the lawsuit filed Thursday, said the teen knew what he was doing and "clearly he was disturbed", but his parents did nothing.  Chad Gregory recounted during Thursday's news conference what his son witnessed during the shooting.  Keegan Gregory was texting his family from a bathroom stall where he and Shilling were hiding.  "He was in that bathroom for five minutes," Chad Gregory said. "He was in there with a shooter who had just killed, wounded, injured." Two months later, Keegan remains traumatized, Meghan Gregory said.  "He's nowhere near going back to class, let alone functioning like a normal 15-year-old child," she said. "We have to check doors. We have to check under beds."  The school, in Oakland County, is about 30 miles (50 km) north of Detroit. It reopened Monday with its interior renovated since the shooting.  In December, Jeffrey and Brandi Franz filed a pair of lawsuits in federal court and county circuit court seeking $100 million each against the district. Their 17-year-old daughter, Riley, was shot in the neck. Her 14-year-old sister, Bella, a ninth grader, was next to her at the time she was shot.  Their lawsuit says school officials and high school staff didn't do enough to prevent the shooting and protect students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michigan-school-shooting-suspect-to-pursue-insanity-defence/articleshow/89166740.cms||---

He added that Delta also continues to have a significant presence in some states like Odisha, West Bengal and Maharashtra. “It is not true that we are seeing only the Omicron variant. Delta is still present in the country. Clinical severity is also due to Delta. Cases coming to hospitals should not be considered as Omicron and therefore of low severity,” Singh said. In January, 9,672 samples were sequenced as Omicron infected cases, up from 1,292 in December. On the other hand, the proportion of samples detected with Delta infection was much higher in December at 17,272 compared with merely 4,789 such samples in January.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-omicron-found-in-75-of-positive-samples-in-january/articleshow/89166748.cms||Sushmi Dey

Over 4.43 crore doses were have been given to them till Thursday 10pm. A total of 7.40 crore youngsters are estimated in this age-group. The government on Thursday clarified to states and Union territories that those attaining the age of 15 years as on January 2023 are eligible for the vaccine dose for the 15-17 age group. It has been clarified that those born in years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are eligible in category fixed for 15-17 year age group. The government said precaution dose will continue to be given to healthcare workers and the elderly above 60 years with comorbidities as per the vaccine technical group’s recommendation. “...Whichever vaccine has been launched in India was based on evidence submitted to the relevant technical group and there should be no doubt about it,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. Over one crore precaution doses have been administered to healthcare and frontline workers and those above 60 years till Thursday, according to the ministry data.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/60-of-kids-in-15-17-group-get-first-dose-of-vaccine-in-first-25-days/articleshow/89166775.cms||---

However, there are concerns about a general lack of awareness among people about reporting AEFI. Experts said while anxiety or underlying conditions could lead to unusual health events post vaccination, each one of them must be promptly reported for a thorough investigation. A case in point is that of a 16-year-old Sangli boy who had three intermittent episodes of vomiting blood, days after he took the Covid jab at his school. The family got the boy hospitalised and spent Rs 30,000-35,000 on tests, but didn’t think of reporting the unusual episodes of vomiting to any district health or school officials. The boy was down with body ache post vaccination, but the episodes of vomiting started on the third day. The boy’s uncle admitted that it never occurred to them to inform the authorities, till he had a second episode. “We did not know whom to approach to report the case. We have now reported it to the district officials,” said the uncle. Dr Vivek Patil from Sangli's public health department said the boy has been diagnosed with hiatus hernia, which can lead to blood vomiting in some cases. “It is not related to the vaccine,” Patil said, adding that no severe side-effects have been reported with Covaxin, but cases as such should be reported on time. Two weeks ago, the death of a teenage girl in the city four days after vaccination spurred rumours that it was linked to immunisation. While the district AEFI committee ruled out the role of vaccination in her death, the fact remains that neither the doctor who certified the death nor her parents informed the health authorities. Dr Mukesh Agrawal, who heads Mumbai’s AEFI committee, said it was imperative that parents or teachers report anything out of place. “Covaxin is no doubt a safe vaccine and we haven’t found a single severe side effect. But, it is the job of an expert committee to rule out whether or not an adverse effect is related to vaccination,” he said. Across the state, most drives are happening in schools and colleges. Dr Sachin Desai, who heads the state’s immunisation department, said AEFI rate among the 15-17 years age-group is negligible at 0.004%. “Teachers have been told to keep an eye and inform district officials,” he said, adding that 120 AEFIs were reported out of 25 lakh doses administered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-vaccine-aefi-cases-in-teens-almost-negligible/articleshow/89166788.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Also, Home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to states and UTs, saying that the current positivity rate of over 10% in 407 districts across the country is a matter of concern and required exercise of caution and vigilance. “...Active cases have increased to over 22 lakh. Though a majority of active cases are recovering fast...it is still a matter of concern that 407 districts in 34 states & UTs are reporting a positivity rate of more than 10%. Therefore there is a need to exercise caution...,” Bhalla told state chief secretaries and UT administrators. He said based on the normative framework issued by the health ministry on December 21, 2021 and their assessment of the Covid situation, the local or district administration should continue to take appropriate containment measures. Bhalla reiterated the need to continue following the five-fold strategy of “test-track-treat-vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-exercise-caution-mha-tells-states-extends-curbs/articleshow/89166811.cms||---
---||India||TMC may move Rajya Sabha against Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress is likely to move a motion in the Rajya Sabha against Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in the coming budget session. The move may not yield any result — the Trinamool has only 13 MPs in the Rajya Sabha — but party seniors say they want the issue of “Raj Bhavan behaving like BJP headquarters” to be discussed nationally. The party will also strongly oppose any proposed amendment to all-India service rules. Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray on Thursday said the party bring a “substantive motion” against the governor in Parliament. This motion allowed an issue to be debated in the Rajya Sabha and also had a provision for being put to vote, Trinamool seniors said. Ray’s proposal came during a hybrid meet convened by party chief and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday. If Trinamool goes ahead with its decision, it would be only the second time in the last several decades that a Bengal governor has faced such a move. CPI Rajya Sabha MP Bhupesh Gupta had brought a similar motion against then governor Dharma Vira after the turmoil over the dismissal of Ajoy Mukherjee-led United Front government in 1967. Dhankhar assumed charge in Raj Bhavan in July 2019. He has had a rocky relationship with Trinamool, repeatedly accusing it of “misrule”; and the Trinamool has constantly accused him of behaving more like a BJP leader than a governor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-may-move-rajya-sabha-against-bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar/articleshow/89166838.cms||---

Shah addressed a gathering of voters and party workers in the district, where he said that only BJP can keep the country and its borders “safe” because it “prioritised internal and external security.” “Uttar Pradesh shares its border with Nepal and therefore the law and order situation in the state should be up to the mark,” he said, adding that opposition parties had “neither the capabilities nor the resolve to provide a safe and secure atmosphere” to the people of the state. “India cannot progress until UP, with a population of over 200 million people, develops,” he said, adding that the state elections “will decide India’s destiny.” Shah distributed pamphlets in support of the BJP candidate from the Govardhan assembly constituency Thakur Meghshyam Singh. Other BJP candidates fielded from the district (out of the five assembly constituencies) include two cabinet ministers who are sitting MLAs, Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary from Chhata and Srikant Sharma from Mathura. The two others are sitting MLA from Baldeo Pooran Prakash Singh and Rajesh Chaudhary from Maant. Shah later offered prayers at the Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan and said that the former CM and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav should be “ashamed of raising questions over the law and order situation in the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-in-up-will-decide-indias-destiny-says-amit-shah-on-hustings/articleshow/89166862.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||World||Honduras inaugurates first female president, Harris vows closer US ties||TEGUCIGALPA: Xiomara Castro was sworn in as Honduras' first woman president on Thursday, with United States Vice President Kamala Harris in attendance, as her government faces tests over a sharply divided Congress, rising debt and relations with China.  Castro, flanked by her husband, former President Manuel Zelaya, and their children, was sworn in at a packed open-air soccer stadium, her supporters dancing and shouting. She smiled broadly as the blue and white presidential sash was draped across her chest.  "The economic catastrophe that I'm inheriting is unparalleled in the history of our country," a somber Castro said in her inaugural address, denouncing a sevenfold jump in debt under her two conservative predecessors.  She said it was "practically impossible" to make current debt payments without a restructuring.  The country's total debt stands at $15.5 billion, or nearly 60% of gross domestic product, an economic problem Castro frequently highlighted on the campaign trail ahead of her landslide election win in November.  "My government will not continue the maelstrom of looting that has condemned generations of young people to pay the debt they incurred behind their back," she added to thunderous applause.  She also vowed to give more than 1 million poor Hondurans free electricity, with bigger consumers subsidising the cost.  Minutes earlier, the crowd roared its approval after Harris, who has been tasked by President Joe Biden to lead the US policy in Central America's impoverished Northern Triangle of countries, was introduced. "Our relationship with Honduras is an important one," Harris wrote on Twitter earlier, adding that she would hold talks with Castro.  Harris' attendance is notable, as lower-ranking officials typically lead such US delegations. The US officials want to work with Castro to curb illegal immigration from Central America and shore up international support for Taiwan as part of its efforts to stem China's influence. Honduras is one of the few countries maintaining diplomatic ties with Taipei instead of Beijing.  Castro assumes office embroiled in a dispute with dissidents in her own party. Rival candidates have declared themselves head of Congress, undermining her ability to pass legislation.  Taiwanese Vice President William Lai was also attending the inauguration in a bid to bolster ties with Honduras under Castro who during her election campaign threatened to switch allegiance to Beijing if elected president.  Harris greeted Lai during the inauguration, a White House official said. Luis Leon, director of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy in Central America, said Harris' arrival is a boost for Castro in the dispute over control of Congress and in addressing Honduras' weak economy.  The US government acknowledges Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of its territory though it does not endorse this stance. The United States does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Harris has been tasked with addressing the "root causes" of Central America migration, but her trip comes as Biden's popularity at home has waned and his immigration strategy stalled.  During her meeting with Castro, Harris will discuss economic opportunity, the fight against corruption and managing migration, US officials said.  "We do very much want and intend to do what we can to support this new president," said one administration official.  Castro, who describes herself as a democratic socialist, has vowed to tackle corruption, poverty and violence, chronic problems that have helped fuel waves of US-bound migrants, and on Thursday appointed several key Cabinet members.  But her legislative programme has been jeopardised by renegade politicians from her leftist Libre party, who over the weekend allied with the conservative opposition National Party to vote for one of its members to head Congress.  That has created a rival legislature and breached a pact that Libre had made with its main electoral ally, the Salvador Party founded by her first vice president, to appoint one of the latter's members to lead Congress.  Castro and the rest of her party have recognised a Salvador lawmaker as Congress' legitimate leader.  Castro's inauguration ends the eight-year rule of the conservative National Party's Juan Orlando Hernandez, who has been accused in the US courts of corruption and links to drug traffickers, allegations he has repeatedly denied.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/honduras-inaugurates-first-female-president-harris-vows-closer-us-ties/articleshow/89166970.cms||---
---||World||Florida boat capsize: Coast Guard recovers 4 more migrants, likely to suspend search||MIAMI BEACH: The Coast Guard said Thursday that it had found four additional bodies in its search for dozens of migrants lost at sea off Florida but would suspend its rescue operations at sunset if it doesn't receive any new information. Homeland Security Investigations officials said they were actively investigating the case as a human smuggling operation.  Authorities have now found a total of five bodies, leaving 34 missing, five days after the vessel capsized on the way to Florida from Bimini, a chain of islands in the Bahamas about 55 miles (88 km) east of Miami.  Coast Guard Capt. Jo-Ann F. Burdian said the decision to suspend the search at sunset Thursday, pending any new discoveries, was not an easy one.  "We have saturated the area over and over again," she told a news conference. "We've had good visibility. ... We've overflown the vessel a number of times. ...It does mean we don't think it's likely that anyone else has survived."  The Miami office of Homeland Security Investigations has launched an inquiry, saying the migrants' journey was most certainly part of a human smuggling operation. Under federal law, a smuggler convicted of causing a death is eligible for execution.  "The goal of this investigation is to identify, arrest and prosecute any criminal or criminal organization that organized, facilitated or profited from this doomed venture," said HSI Miami Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury.  Salisbury declined to give any information on the nationalities of the boat passengers but said investigators consider the lone survivor "a victim right now," not a suspect. Salisbury appealed to the public for tips to help identify who organized the boat crossing.  "Please help us bring criminals who prey on and victimize the vulnerable migrant community to justice," he said. "We don't want anybody doing this again. ... This is dangerous stuff."  The lone survivor was found hanging onto the 25-foot (7-m) vessel about 40 miles (64 km) off Fort Pierce, Florida. He told a good Samaritan and authorities that the boat capsized late Saturday after he and 39 others had set out for Florida from Bimini.  Authorities said the boat was found about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of where it capsized, apparently pushed by the Gulf Stream, a warm, swift current that wraps around the Florida peninsula and flows along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. No one was wearing a life jacket, the rescued man told authorities.  The Gulf Stream can be treacherous even on a calm, sunny day. Throw in an overloaded boat, inexperienced mariners, stormy weather and the dark of night, and they can become deadly.  A small craft advisory had been issued on Saturday and Sunday as a severe cold front with winds up to 23 mph (37 kph) blew through the dangerous passage, creating swells up to 9 feet (3 m).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/florida-boat-capsize-coast-guard-recovers-4-more-migrants-likely-to-suspend-search/articleshow/89166974.cms||---

Both Channi ji and Sidhu ji told me that the biggest question in Punjab is who would lead Punjab from Congress,” Rahul said. “Both of them assured me that the decision (taken by the party) would be acceptable to all, and I was very happy.” The former Congress president said he also drew comfort from the duo’s assurance that after the party picked the one who would lead, “the other would support him with all his might”. Rahul urged Congress workers to help pick “the right person to take Punjab ahead” and make sure everyone “fights like a team”. The Congress leadership has been under pressure from both Channi and Sidhu to name the party’s CM face, more so with challenger AAP having already declared its candidate in Bhagwant Mann. “Normally, we don’t have this practice (to announce a CM candidate), but as it is a demand from the state, we shall do it,” Rahul said. Before Rahul spoke, Sidhu had mentioned this in his speech while highlighting Punjab's battle against “mafia raj” and the “huge debt trap” the state had landed in.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/congress-will-go-to-punjab-polls-with-cm-face-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/89166990.cms||IP Singh

---||World||Oklahoma carries out first US execution of 2022||WASHINGTON: A man convicted of carrying out a double murder was put to death by lethal injection Thursday in Oklahoma, becoming the first prisoner executed in the United States this year.  The southern state's execution of Donald Grant "was carried out with zero complications at 10:16 this morning (1616 GMT)," Oklahoma attorney general John O'Connor's office said in a statement.  The 46-year-old's last words were barely intelligible.  In 2001, Grant, then aged 25, robbed a hotel to steal bail money for his imprisoned girlfriend.  During the robbery, he opened fire on two hotel employees. One died instantly, and the other Grant finished off with a knife, according to court documents.  He was sentenced to death in 2005.  He filed numerous appeals during his imprisonment to have his sentence overturned, citing intellectual deficiencies in particular. In an online petition, his defenders claimed that he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and brain trauma caused by violent abuse in his childhood from his alcoholic father.  His last appeal, concerning the method of execution used by the southern US state of Oklahoma, was rejected Wednesday by the US Supreme Court.  Grant received an injection of three lethal substances at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.  The deadly cocktail is suspected of causing excruciating pain for the condemned, which is forbidden by the US Constitution. In late October, an inmate suffered from convulsions and vomited several times after the first injection.  Nothing of the sort occurred during Grant's execution.  The number of executions carried out annually in the United States has been declining in recent years.  Capital punishment has been abolished in 23 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have observed a moratorium on its use.  A series of botched executions in Oklahoma led to a temporary moratorium on capital punishment in the state in 2015, but the moratorium was lifted in 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oklahoma-carries-out-first-us-execution-of-2022/articleshow/89167043.cms||---

As per the latest report released by the UP cane department, 119 sugar mills in UP have so far purchased 465.3 lakh tonnes of sugarcane from farmers since the new crushing season began in early November last year, but only 69.9% (Rs 9,157 crore) of the dues have been paid so far despite the government's directions to mills to pay the dues within 14 days of procurement. Notably, almost a dozen sugar mills in west UP still owe close to Rs 1,500 crore from the previous crushing season. UP cane minister Suresh Rana, a sitting MLA from Shamli’s Thanabhawan constituency, too, like a few other candidates from the ruling party has been facing resistance in his own constituency despite his claims of making full payment of cane dues in the last five years. Recently, Rana was shown black flags in Nonangli village and at Palthedi village. Rana said, “I have said this earlier as well -- that compared to previous regimes, the BJP government has made record payment of more than Rs 1,55,900 crore of cane dues to farmers in the past five years. This includes those that had been pending for years from previous regimes. Cent per cent dues of the previous years, including 2018-19 and 2019-20, have been paid. Even for 2020-21, we have paid 96% of the dues, and the remaining will be paid soon. I am committed to the welfare of farmers. There is no opposition anywhere.” Rana is not alone to face villagers' ire. Recently, BJP MLA from Khatauli Vikram Saini faced opposition in his home constituency in Muzaffarnagar. Also, ruling party candidate Maninder Singh's motorcade was attacked in Churr village in Meerut. BJP alleged RLD was behind the attack and filed a police complaint in this regard. Speaking to TOI, a Thanabhawan-based farmer leader, Umesh Bhainswal, said, “Timely payment to a farmer is his right and should never be portrayed as the government’s act of kindness. Even now, farmers are not getting their dues on time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-netas-face-bitterness-over-dues-in-up-sugarcane-belt/articleshow/89167069.cms||Sandeep Rai

Even for 2020-21, we have paid 96% of the dues, and the remaining will be paid soon. I am committed to the welfare of farmers. There is no opposition anywhere.” Rana is not alone to face villagers' ire. Recently, BJP MLA from Khatauli Vikram Saini faced opposition in his home constituency in Muzaffarnagar. Also, ruling party candidate Maninder Singh's motorcade was attacked in Churr village in Meerut. BJP alleged RLD was behind the attack and filed a police complaint in this regard. Speaking to TOI, a Thanabhawan-based farmer leader, Umesh Bhainswal, said, “Timely payment to a farmer is his right and should never be portrayed as the government’s act of kindness. Even now, farmers are not getting their dues on time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-netas-face-bitterness-over-dues-in-up-sugarcane-belt/articleshow/89167068.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||---||Mathura wants mandir, but without violence||AGRA: With an almost 80% population of Hindus, the holy town of Mathura has become an often-repeated theme for BJP in the run-up to polls in UP this time, amid renewed calls for construction of the Krishna Janambhoomi temple. In and around the “Krishna circuit of Mathura and Vrindavan, all BJP leaders, big and small, have been saying that after the “success in Ayodhya and Kashi”, it’s time now for a grand temple in Mathura. On the ground nobody, of course, opposes it. While there is some concern among minorities in the region that the “Polarising issue” will only go on to help BJP, many people from the community TOI spoke to said they have “no problem” if peace isn't compromised. Mohammad Riazuddin Raju, 45, president of Sankalp Welfare Society, an NGO, said that though the issue is “all over”, the people of Mathura know how “precious communal harmony is”. Majority of people in this religious town are convinced that the issue of Krishna temple is political. But at the same time they believe that if the temple comes up, the town could see unprecedented economic development on lines of Ayodhya, where the construction of the Ram Temple has now become a means of economic revival for the city. Manish Jindal, 33, who owns a brick kiln business, admitted that recent statements by senior BJP leaders have revived hopes for the mandir. “We know there is politics being played around this emotive issue but the BJP did fulfil its promise of a Ram mandir in Ayodhya. A Krishna temple could be a reality and revive this city, which has been dying a slow death... the region could become even more attractive as pilgrimage destination.” Owner of a chain of stores, Manish Chaudhary, 28, said, “Of course we want a Krishna temple. But it has to be without violence and bloodshed. Communal tension is no good for any city.” Tushar Agarwal, 40, a businessman in Mathura city, had a somewhat different view, “We’ve been here for several years but no one, except the politicians, has ever talked about a separate temple. Many of us are happy with the Krishna mandir we have right now.” BJP MP from Mathura, Hema Malini, told TOI: “A Krishna temple is already here but the contentious issue of the idgah and the Janambhoomi should be resolved with everyone on board, keeping in mind the sentiments of crores of Hindus. No one wants the peace in the city to be disturbed though.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/mathura-wants-mandir-but-without-violence/articleshow/89167098.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||---||At 94, Badal will be oldest to contest polls in India||BATHINDA: Five-time Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, 94, whose candidature was announced by SAD president Aukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday, will be the oldest contestant in any election in the country. Earlier, this record was held by former Kerala chief minister VS Achuthanandan who had contested assembly election in 2016 at the age of 92 years. For the last over five decades, SAD patron Badal had been an integral part of the party’s election campaign and a source of strength for it. Such is his charisma that even at 94 years of age, SAD feels the need for his presence in the electoral fight. He was reluctant earlier but agreed to contest to restore the party’s prestige. SAD faced its worst drubbing in the 2017 assembly elections when it could barely win 15 seats and lost the tag of the main opposition party, which was grabbed by new entrant Aam Aadmi Party by winning 20 seats. SAD does not want to take any risks this time and is banking on senior Badal’s name to get its core vote bank in rural Punjab back with the party. Insiders claim that though Badal may be restricted to campaigning in his constituency, Lambi, his presence on the electoral scene will be a big boost for the party. Since the 1969 assembly polls, the senior Badal had always been at the helm of affairs in both parliamentary and assembly polls. On the personal front, he has never lost any election, registering 10 consecutive victories. The first five from 1969 to 1985 from the Gidderbaha assembly constituency and the next five from 1997 to 2017 from the Lambi assembly seat. He won his first election from the Malout seat in 1957 and then had narrowly lost to Harcharan Singh Brar from Gidderbaha in 1967.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/punjab/news/at-94-badal-will-be-oldest-to-contest-polls-in-india/articleshow/89167154.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Gurgaon||Factory accidents under-reported: Survey||Gurgaon: Factory accidents are heavily underreported in Haryana, says the third part of the ‘CRUSHED’ series of reports published by Safe in India Foundation, which has been studying shop floor mishaps that leave workers maimed in the automobile manufacturing sector in the state, particularly the Gurgaon-Faridabad region, for several years.The foundation’s surveys of injured workers estimate the number of factory accidents that take place annually in Gurgaon and Faridabad in the range of 300 to 500 between 2017 and 2021. State data, however, shows 50-60 such accidents annually. It cites auditing gaps in the supply chains of large automobile companies, unavailability of ESI (employee state insurance) cards at the time of accidents and fewer inspections by the labour department as the reasons for under-reporting.The CRUSHED report, which has this time expanded its scope to Neemrana in Rajasthan and Rudrapur in Uttarakhand, says more than 2,500 factory workers were injured in auto-component manufacturing factories in the last five years. Around 92% of them were migrant workers and 70% held contract jobs. More than half (60%) were below 30 years.The report once again highlights the perils of the power press, which continues to be one of the most dangerous machines, causing over 50% of the total injuries. A bulk of the injured workers in Gurgaon (93%) and Faridabad (75%) were employed by suppliers one or all of three large automobile firms in the region.“As many as 70% of injured workers had not received their ESIC e-Pehchaan Card on the day of joining their jobs, as ESIC regulations require. And almost half (47%) of the injured workers SII interviewed said that they worked in shifts of 12 hours or longer, with the average duration for all injured workers at 10.8 hours,” the report says.The SII has urged industry bodies and regulatory authorities to come together to fix policy gaps for contractual and deeper supply chain workers. The report, while calling for a reliable accident and injury reporting system, suggests a joint industry-level task force to map the deeper supply chain starting and conduct periodic safety assessments.“We hope that the auto industry and the government listen to the 100 workers who joined us today (during the release of the report) to discuss their experiences of poor working practices that result in many of them losing their hands or fingers every year. We all know what needs to be done. It’s neither too difficult, nor too expensive,” said Sandeep Sachdeva, co-founder & CEO, SII.Auto industry sources said the SII findings had led to changes for the better over the years, and while they don’t have direct financial control over ancillaries in supply chains, they had been emphasising safety audits while bringing companies on board.“The Industry is completely committed to sensitising this safety aspect amongst the entire supply chain, especially tier 3 and 4, and we strive to spread this awareness on a continuous basis,” Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) director-general Rajesh Menon told TOI.“It’s a great initiative by the SII. It presents the picture before big players as well as smaller ones that contribute about 70% to 80% of the automobile ecosystem in the country,” Vinnie Mehta, director-general, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) told TOI. “It is already encouraging many players to put in place a model supplier code of conduct for safety. ACMA too supports this initiative and advocates best safety practices.”Mehta added, “While this should initiate the right perspective and discussions, there’s also a need to be cautious that it doesn’t promote an inspection raj-like regime. Awareness among workers about safety norms and among suppliers for establishing robust safety codes is the key.”A spokesperson for Hero MotoCorp, which has among the largest manufacturing bases in the region, told TOI, “We regularly organise safety training workshops for all our supply chain partners with the objective of sensitizing them on safety protocols and establishing a structured safety management system. As part of our commitment, we also proactively conduct safety assessments of our supply chain partners through external certified auditors.”Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s largest carmaker with its base in the region, said it follows the ‘Zero Incident-Zero Human Injury and Zero Fire’ vision. The company said that in 2019, based on inputs from SII, it undertook a project to improve safety “deep into our supply chain” and that 85% of its tier 1 vendors had their own dedicated training centres for workers.“Our supplier assessment model incorporates regular measurement and audit of safety practices and award of business has been made contingent to their meeting the requisite safety standards,” Rahul Bharti, executive director (corporate affairs), MSIL, told TOI. “Maruti Suzuki found that most accidents were happening at small suppliers and tier 2s contributed to 70% of accidents. Maruti Suzuki took immediate action to correct this, and in Phase 1, improved shop floor conditions of 85% of press and molding machines at tier 2 suppliers. In NCR, in Phase 1, we covered 280 Tier 2 vendors in which 4,366 press machines and 1,981 molding machines were equipped and modified with adequate safety measures,” he added. A senior officer at the Industry Safety and Health (ISH) wing of the Haryana government’s labour department, tasked with ensure workers’ safety, questioned the data gathering mechanism of SII. “we do acknowledge the need to step up efforts for workers’ safety in factories. But many of the accidents reported by SII are either from the unorganised sector or ones that happened outside the factory and have been wrongly assumed to be factory accidents,” said the officer.The SII, however, said all its findings were sent to the labour department a month in advance to assess the findings and suggest corrections. “In any case, we trace these workers through ESIC data that relies on accident reports prepared by the factories itself,” said Chitra Khanna, Head (safety initiative), SII.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/factory-accidents-under-reported-survey/articleshow/89167214.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||In common area row with pvt firm, FIR filed against RWA||Gurgaon: Police have booked a few RWA members of NBCC Heights, a highrise society in Sector 89, in the wake of a complaint from a private company alleging threats by the residents’ body. The RWA has denied the allegation and written to the Haryana CM seeking his intervention.Residents claim that the state-run NBCC auctioned a three-storey building inside the condominium that was meant for a nursery school, to this private company in 2020. Soon after taking possession of the building last month, this company started encroaching on the common area of the society. Apart from filing a complaint with the police, the residents also moved the district court on December 24.Though the police subsequently stopped the construction activity on the court’s direction, they also filed an FIR against some of the RWA members on charges of rioting and unlawful assembly, based on the private company’s complaint that the residents’ body had threatened its executives and did not allow them to do their job.RS Redhu, RWA president of the society, said, “The private company started encroaching on the common area adjoining the building by blocking the access to the green area. The company also constructed a lift shaft on the common area and installed a permanent roof shade beyond the external wall surface. When we resisted, they filed a frivolous police complaint against the RWA.”“Even, the district court directed the private company to maintain the status quo, instead police filed an FIR based on the false allegation. Most of us are senior citizens and working for the welfare of society but they levelled serious charges such as rioting against us,” said Atam Prakash Madan, vice-president of the society.However, a representative of the private company said the area in question “is not a common area”. “It falls within the boundary wall of the school building. Authorities have clearly said that an open area around a school building belongs to the school and when we started doing the interiors and some modification work, the RWA members stopped us from doing so, they even threatened us,” Jaspal Singh, a supervisor.Naveen Kumar, SHO of Sector 10A police station, said, “We have filed the FIR based on the complaint and the matter is being investigated.” The senior town planner of DTCP, Sanjeev Mann said, “As per the rule, the nursery school building requires 0.2 acres of land in the licenced colony. The developer only sold the building area and not the open area surrounding it. We have written to Chandigarh against the developer and told them to rectify the sales deed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/in-common-area-row-with-pvt-firm-fir-filed-against-rwa/articleshow/89167215.cms||Akanksha Gupta

In an order issued on Wednesday, however, the state government has allowed malls and markets to operate till 7pm, instead of 6pm as directed earlier. Shops selling essential items can stay open without restrictions. “We were hoping that relaxation would be given to the cinema industry by the Haryana government, but they are yet to take a decision. Business has been badly affected due to the curbs imposed. We hope for positive news soon as the situation is now improving in terms of Covid cases,” said Sanjay Barjatya, regional head, Miraj Cinema. While extending the restrictions imposed under ‘Mahamari Alert Surakshit Haryana’ till 5am on February 10, the government has continued night curfew from 11pm and 5am and banned large gatherings. Market associations have welcomed the decision, but appealed to the government to allow them to operate till 8pm. “As cases are witnessing a downward trend, we urge the government to allow us to operate till 8pm at the least as most people come to markets after work. When liquor shops are allowed till 10pm, why not us?” asked Tej Singh, president of the Vyapar Kendra Market Association. Meanwhile, the number of attendees at funerals and weddings has been capped at 50 and 100 people, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mall-timings-extended-cinemas-to-stay-shut/articleshow/89167223.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The Sector 28 resident rejoined work this week but is unable to look at the laptop for extended periods of time due to fatigue and fever, even 10 days after completing the mandated week’s home isolation period.“I still feel tired and feverish. I don’t have any breathing distress but I fell muscle pain and headaches on and off. I am not able to go jogging. My eyes feel tired and sometimes my neck and back hurts. It is a constant reminder that I had Covid. Doctors told me that many people are facing similar issues after recovering from Covid and prescribed multivitamin supplements,” Nisha, who is fully vaccinated, said.Anish Narang (30), a private firm employee, tested positive on January 6 and still hasn't been able to resume work even two weeks after finishing his home isolation period. He can’t take the stairs or lift things due to severe muscle pain and chronic weakness. “I do not have any comorbid conditions. My dad and I started showing Covid symptoms the same day. While he is fine now, I am still feeling the effects of the virus,” said Sharma, a resident of Sector 48. He too is fully vaccinated.Chronic fatigue, muscle pain, headaches and a lingering cough — doctors in the city are seeing many patients who have recovered from Covid report back with complaints of prolonged effects of the infection, similar to the first and the second waves. Some patients who had mild fever or a cough when they tested positive during the current wave are also taking longer to recover than the mandated seven days of home isolation.Doctors are also seeing patients who tested positive before the third wave return to Covid clinics with various post-viral syndromes. Apart from prescribing usual medicines on a case-to-case basis, doctors are advising adequate hydration, high-protein diet, proper sleep, psychological support, and regular follow-up with a physician.They cautioned against dismissing the current surge as mild, saying both the Delta and the Omicron variants are in circulation and the intensity of an infection is determined by several factors like low immunity and comorbidities. “It is not only Omicron. People are also getting infected by the Delta variant and are thus experiencing symptoms for a longer period. There is no need to panic. Symptoms like muscle pain and severe tiredness are not life-threatening. People can expect to recover in two to three weeks,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav said.He said every individual has a different response towards any kind of infection. “People with low immunity or comorbidities usually take a longer time to recover not only from Covid, but from all kinds of infection. It is advised that one should have a diet high in proteins and other nutrients and keep themselves well hydrated for early recovery,” Yadav added.According to doctors, after recovery from Covid, approximately 50-60% of patients have persistent symptoms for three weeks, sometimes longer. Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director (internal medicine) and medical advisor at Max Hospital, said: “Long Covid includes a persistent inflammatory response in some patients. In others, an autoimmune process is triggered by the virus. Long Covid syndrome is amenable to treatment. We have cured many patients and the outcome is much better with a multidisciplinary approach.”Doctors also said long Covid is not always related to comorbidities and muscle pain and weakness are the most common symptoms in any viral infection. “Post-viral symptoms can’t lead to serious illness. We are advising such patients to improve their diet and stay hydrated as much as possible,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/covid-effect-lasting-weeks-in-many-even-if-symptoms-mild/articleshow/89167225.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Haryana: In Nuh, maulanas, teachers help govt ramp up vax drive for teens||NUH: Health workers in the district who are involved in the vaccination process for those in the age group of 15-17 years are finding it tough to convince some of the youngsters to get vaccinated. The district administration has therefore formed the village vaccination monitoring committees, comprising local maulana, ASHA workers, ANMs and even teachers in villages in Nuh to ensure that the teenagers come out and get vaccinated. The ASHA workers, who are tasked with the door-to-door vaccination, had earlier said that the locals were resisting the vaccination drive for teenagers and would show the statement of the Centre where it has been stated that no one will be vaccinated without their consent. “They say, when the Central government has itself said that vaccination cannot be forced, then why are you forcing us? We are even told that their teenage sons will become impotent after vaccination and it is a ploy by the government,” said Sabita Jain, an ASHA facilitator. The district administration is using data from the local schools to reach out to eligible students. Those who are not enrolled in any school are being persuaded by the religious head of the local mosques. A few days ago, a man from Pipaka village was booked for showing a false Covid-19 certificate. The authorities issued a notice outlining the consequences for people displaying forged vaccination certificates.  According to the chief medical officer Surender Yadav, despite the difficulties on the ground, they are able to administer 1,200-1,500 vaccinations to those between 15-17 years per day. He declined the claims made by ASHA workers regarding the challenges. “We have a population of 89,000 teenagers, of which we have administered the first dose of vaccination to nearly 29,000 – which is a good figure. We have been able to dispel all the rumours and locals have now been forthcoming,” said Yadav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/in-nuh-maulanas-teachers-help-govt-ramp-up-vax-drive-for-teens/articleshow/89167229.cms||Sagrika Kissu

In both cases, the drivers were briefly detained for questioning after they could not produce any documents related to the money, they said. ACP (Noida 2) Rajneesh Verma said the income tax department officials have been alerted about the seizure and a probe was also initiated to ascertain if the money was linked to the upcoming state assembly polls. Three constituencies in Noida will cast the ballot on February 10. In the last 10 days, the GB Nagar police has seized unaccounted cash worth around Rs 2 crore, including Rs 99 lakh seized from an SUV near Noida Stadium in Sector 24 on January 18. On Wednesday, the Porsche car was stopped during a routine check by the Sector 58 police and Static Surveillance Team near Sector 60 police post. “During a search, Rs 21.2 lakh in cash was recovered from the car. The driver, Sector 19-resident Rohit Awana, claimed that he runs a petrol pump and was returning home from Gaur City in Greater Noida West with the money earned in the last three-four days. He, however, could not provide any documents to substantiate his claims following which the cash was seized. We have informed income tax officials to probe into the matter,” the ACP said. While Awana was released after brief questioning, the police officer said a case will be registered against him if any irregularities in connection with the seized money were noted. The cops also seized over Rs 3 lakh from a WagonR car at Sector 60 checkpoint. “The driver, Gopal Swarup, claimed to be a Noida-based businessman but was unable to answer any questions regarding the cash,” Verma said, adding that the money has been seized by cops. Police are probing if the money was meant to be distributed during the upcoming state elections. Over the last few days, the police have stepped up security and checking, especially in the district’s borders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/rs-24-lakh-cash-in-a-porsche-another-car-seized-in-noida/articleshow/89167232.cms||---
---||Noida||Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav threw UP into ditches for 20 years, says Amit Shah||NOIDA: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday pitched the upcoming assembly elections as a mandate “for the future of Uttar Pradesh for the next 20 years” that goes well beyond picking the next MLA or CM, saying the state had been thrown into the ditches by the “Bua-Bhatija” governments before BJP came to office in 2017. Speaking at a ‘key voters’ dialogue’ in Greater Noida, Shah said, “The governments of Bua-Bhatija ruled the state for 20 years and threw the state into the ditches. There were four scourges – casteism, dynasty politics, corruption and appeasement – which flourished during their governments. There was mafia rule and an era of open extortion.” Shah was referring to the Mayawati and Samajwadi Party regimes (the last of which from 2012-17 was led by Akhilesh Yadav) of the last two decades as he commended his party’s government led by Yogi Adityanath for “changing the situation a lot in the last five years”. Shah had arrived for the Greater Noida event, at Sharda University, after a hectic day of canvassing with door-to-door campaigns in Mathura and Dadri. In his audience at the university were over 250 ‘key voters’, comprising BJP supporters, farmers, professionals, and homebuyers. During the 35-minute speech, most of Shah’s jibes were directed towards SP national president Akhilesh, seen as BJP’s main challenger in these elections, whom Shah referred to as “Akhilesh babu” throughout his address. Shah alleged that during Akhilesh’s tenure, no legal action was taken against the mafia if they belonged to a particular community, but Yogi Adityanath had “fixed” law and order in the state. “Be it Azam Khan, Ateeq Ahmed or Mukhtar Ansari – all of them are in jail. There are so many cases registered against them that even notebooks have run out of pages… The Yogi Adityanath government has reclaimed encroached land worth Rs 2,000 crore from the mafia and made houses for the poor, medical colleges and schools on those properties,” he added. The home minister also took a swipe at the SP over recent raids by tax agencies on the premises of businessmen in UP, which led to the recovery of crores in cash. “Why does it pain Akhilesh Babu?” he asked, as the audience cheered. Akhilesh, Shah said, would have to answer to the people on the riots that took place during his tenure. “Thousands of people were charged and put behind bars. The victims became accused and the accused became victims. Nowhere has an investigation been done the way it was done here (western UP) after the 2013 riots,” he claimed. Shah, however, said he was seeking votes for BJP candidates, not by highlighting the ills of the previous SP-BSP governments but on basis of the good work done in the past five years. Even Rahul Gandhi, “who makes irresponsible statements”, and Akhilesh cannot accuse the Yogi Adityanath government of corruption, said Shah, aiming a barb at the Congress leader as well. Shah also raked up Article 370 (special status to Jammu and Kashmir) as well as the surgical strike to club India with the US and Israel, which do not tolerate border invasions. “Nobody in Parliament believed Article 370 and 35A can be repealed, but we did it. The SP, BSP and Congress all opposed, when it was proposed,” he said, adding, “Why did they oppose it? Is vote-bank politics above the nation? Bua-Bhatija, keep doing all the vote-bank politics you want to do but we are not afraid of it. Modi ji removed Article 370 with an iron hand. The party does not get scared by some oppositions,” Shah said. In an election matrix where caste has been a dominant theme, Shah said though rivals keep talking about working for backward sections, it was under the Modi government that the National Commission for Backward Classes got constitutional status. He added that the PM conferred the Padma Vibhushan to former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, a backward caste leader from the Lodhi community, who passed away last year. “He was the first CM who tried to root out mafia raj from UP,” Shah said, adding, “It was BJP government that started reservation in competitive exams for medical and engineering students, but I do not know why SP, BSP continued to support Congress.” Shah went on to list infrastructure initiatives of the BJP government, at the foremost of which is the Noida International Airport that in under construction at Jewar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/bua-bhatija-threw-up-into-ditches-for-20-yrs-/articleshow/89167234.cms||Aditya Dev

All the seven builders have failed to deliver the units to their buyers within the stipulated deadlines. While four have projects in Noida, two are from Ghaziabad and one is based in Meerut.TOI has learnt that UP-Rera chairman, along with the secretary and its three members, held a meeting on January 24 to review the status of its orders. At the meeting, they noticed that some developers, despite seeking additional time from the regulator to fulfil the obligations, failed to comply with the directions.

Cops say most of them were murdered and then thrown on secluded roads. These bodies were found in Dankaur, Bisrakh, Surajpur, Knowledge Park and Kasna police station areas. On Thursday, the body of a woman aged around 36 years was found in a jungle under the Dankaur police station area. A senior police officer said that the body bore severe injuries on the head. “It seems that her head was smashed with a heavy object and then the body was dumped here,” he said. Similarly, on Wednesday night, an unidentified body of a man aged around 50 years was found along the road near LG Chowk in Surajpur. Initial investigation has suggested that the man was strangled to death by miscreants. “We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area to identify the accused. The body has been sent for an autopsy,” a senior officer at Surajpur police station said. Under the Bisrakh police station area, two bodies were found from different spots on Sunday. “The body of a man aged around 30 years was found from a stalled residential project site in Greater Noida (west). The deceased, who appeared to be a daily wager, had no visible injury marks on the body. A probe has been ordered and efforts are on to identify the body,” a senior officer at the police station said. The body of another man, aged around 55 years, was also found from behind Shankar Colony in Chipyana village. His viscera samples were collected and sent for a forensic test after the post-mortem. In another gruesome crime which came to light on January 14, the headless torso of a woman was found stuffed in a box near the Sector 146 metro station under the Knowledge Park police station jurisdiction. The woman’s head, arms and legs were chopped off while her clothes were found in another bag near her body. Police also searched the other missing body parts of the body but they were not found. An autopsy of the body confirmed the murder by “causing grievous hurt”. Police said that the body was dumped here but she was killed somewhere else. Two days later, the Kasna police found the body of another woman in a drain in Fajayalpur village with multiple injury marks. A senior officer at the police headquarters, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that “teams are working to identify the bodies and make breakthroughs in the cases”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/6-bodies-found-in-14-days-in-gr-noida/articleshow/89167239.cms||Advitya Bahl

On Wednesday, the district had logged 727 fresh infections while two persons, including a teenager and a septuagenarian, had succumbed due to the infection. A 20-year-old woman had died due to the disease on Tuesday. So far, 475 people have succumbed to the disease since the outbreak of the pandemic. According to district health officials, the fatalities recorded during the current wave of the pandemic were mostly due to comorbidities in the patients. However, they said, the district has recorded fewer than 1,000 cases since January 22, except on January 25 when it added 1,373 patients, which could be indicative of an early plateau in the number of cases. On Thursday, a 61-year-old man, who had comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart ailments, succumbed to the disease while undergoing treatment at GIMS. The patient, doctors said, died due to comorbidity and Covid-related complications. A 70-year-old man, who was undergoing treatment at a private hospital for heart-related ailments for the last 13 days, and had tested positive for the viral infection succumbed due to comorbidities. He also had diabetes, doctors said. In Ghaziabad, a 74-year-old man, who was admitted at Santosh Medical College since January 25 following complaints of breathlessness, succumbed on Thursday. The patient had taken the first dose of the vaccine but had comorbid conditions like heart ailment and diabetes, officials said. This is the 10th Covid-related fatality in the district this year. So, far 470 deaths due to the infection have been recorded in the district since March 2020. The district also saw 588 new cases on the day. “Most of the Covid-related deaths recorded this year are because of comorbidities in the patients. We have a standard practice of testing all patients being admitted to hospital for the infection,” Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr Rakesh Gupta told TOI. Of the 10 Covid-related deaths reported in Ghaziabad this month, most were men aged between 60 and 81 years with chronic liver disease, respiratory disorder, diabetes, and heart ailments.

The court expressed its dissatisfaction after BBMP submitted a compliance report that claimed that 1,314km of Bengaluru's 1,344km major roads and 12,046km of 12,527km zonal roads have been cleared of potholes. With this, the counsel for BBMP said, a majority of the city roads have been repaired. The bench hearing a 2015 petition on the condition of city roads was surprised and wanted to know whether the BBMP counsel lives in Bengaluru city. "Everyone using the road is aware of the quality. We are not satisfied. There is no compliance. This (report) is totally a sham," said a division bench headed by Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, directing BBMP's chief engineer to appear before the court on February 7. The BBMP counsel said an increase in population and frequent digging by several civic agencies have resulted in bad roads as they do not complete the task within the prescribed time. The bench asked the counsel: "Why (do) you permit them? Any FIRs registered against them? What penalty imposed? We'll direct registration of FIRs against your officers. We will not allow you to work this way." The BBMP counsel said they follow the guidelines and Indian Road Congress standards. The bench said in its order: "The BBMP counsel has not been able to satisfy as to what action has been taken against those agencies which were permitted to cut the road and have not completed the work in the prescribed period. The counsel has not been able to show as to what procedure and technology adopted to carry out the pothole repair work. It is very much clear that after every rain, roads develop potholes." The bench said there was no indication of any policy or coordination measures between BBMP and other civic agencies over cutting of roads. "We are not satisfied with the status report submitted by BBMP. BBMP shall inform (the court) on the technology adopted for the repair of roads and whether it has engaged experts or outside agencies. The procedure adopted by BBMP shall be brought on record," the bench said. The court is hearing a PIL filed in 2015 in which petitioners Vijayan Menon and others have sought directives on action taken by BBMP to fill potholes and for providing a mechanism for citizens to file complaints about poor condition of streets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmps-pothole-report-a-total-sham-says-hc/articleshow/89167262.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Curbs hit star campaigner helicopter||Mumbai: No election campaign in Uttar Pradesh is deemed complete without the spectacle of a helicopter descending onto a rally ground in a whirr of noise and dust. For many years now, the chopper has been the star campaigner in the state. This time around though, with the third wave of the pandemic, that isn’t the case.With the election commission’s ban on polls rallies till January-end, the 20-odd helicopters of about 10 charter operators booked by political parties over two months ago have largely been left grounded, say charter operators. “There is a certain amount of disappointment among helicopter charter operators,” said Capt Uday Gelli, western region president of the Rotary Wing Society of India. The disappointment is acute since it’s polls in UP, the state where the chopper is a bigger star than in any other state, that has been hit. “Uttar Pradesh has a voracious appetite for helicopters. The beauty of the state’s elections is that they use helicopters even to travel small distances of 20 to 30km. The helicopter itself is a campaigner and it pulls more crowd than local leaders. About 80% of the crowd mills around the helipad than the podium,” said Mandar Bharde of MAB Aviation Pvt Ltd.Parties ensure the choppers play to the gallery. “They ask pilots to do two-three rounds of low-flying over a village. A candidate landing in a helicopter exudes a certain power and pelf, which voters in those parts of the country find agreeable in a leader. For the past three assembly elections, helicopter use began 60 days before D-Day,” Bharde said, adding that national parties block about 6-7 helicopters each. The current top gun is the AgustaWestland-139, the multi-engine chopper that can carry 14-16 passengers, but in ‘VVIP configuration’ it carries only six passengers. Let out at Rs 4.5 lakh per hour, with a minimum 100-hour booking for two months, it fetches the operator about Rs 4 to 5 crore per election, he said. Then there are the single-engines, such as the Bell 407 and A-130 which go for Rs 1.3 lakh per hour. Rahul Jain of Universal Airways, a charter operator, said: “UP is a large state. As the election phases get going, the helicopter base moves from Lucknow to Varanasi. Helicopters are an essential arsenal in fighting polls.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/curbs-hit-star-campaigner-helicopter/articleshow/89167263.cms||---

When the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik said it was “very disturbed” at stoppage of a “very basic” service, Kumbhakoni explained it was to control the spread of the virus through gatherings, but an alternative ‘take home ration’ scheme was introduced. Now with the pandemic having ebbed, the scheme was being restored since males heads would be found to consume most ration, said the AG.Sane, however, quickly intervened in the videoconference hearing, stating “tribal families and males do not behave like that. In fact, the cooked food scheme should be extended to all tribals as they migrate to ensure they can bring food to the table”.The state submitted Dorje’s report which stated that it was introducing a test to detect early pregnancies as because at present, most are known after three months causing delay in benefitting from the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme. Kumbhakoni said the state has also developed a software application to track migration of tribals after monsoon due to water scarcity rendering irrigation unviable. They go to work in brick kilns or sugarcane farms and can be tracked and given the benefits.The HC asked advocate Uday Warunjikar, appearing for the petitioner, to also inform whether the short-term plan is being translated into action.“Since the state is taking action to safeguard tribals and Sane has said there is decline in malnutrition death rate, instead of fortnightly monitoring we will go for a monthly monitoring,” said the HC, adding that future steps should be taken with sensitivity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/draw-up-long-term-solution-to-prevent-tribal-migration-for-jobs-hc-tells-state/articleshow/89167270.cms||Swati Deshpande

But as fate would have it, he first got kidnapped and roughed up by his rival group members and then landed straight into cops’ net. When Chocolate visited the area to meet his girlfriend, he had no inkling he would be kidnapped. The matter came to light when his girlfriend approached the police. Investigators rescued Chocolate within three hours from Reay Road, where he was confined and beaten up. “He had come to meet his girlfriend, who stays in the railway compound in Matunga, at around 7.30pm on Sunday. Four men arrived in a car, assaulted Chocolate and forcibly pushed him into the car. The woman tried her best to save Chocolate but the kidnappers sped away,” said a police officer. The 19-year-old woman then approached the Matunga police, informing them that she didn’t know who the kidnappers were, and subsequently an FIR was registered against unidentified persons. Police teams were formed under the supervision of DCP Vijay Patil. Investigators inspector Subhash Shingare, PSIs Sandeep Ahirrao, Bharat Gurav and the police teams swung into action and began collecting details from their sources. Through their sources, cops learnt that Chocolate was taken to a deserted cement godown at Reay Road seven km from Dadar. When a police team arrived on the spot, they found an injured Chocolate and one of the kidnappers, Praful Patkar (24). “Our teams rescued Chocolate and arrested Patkar. The accused had assaulted Chocolate black and blue with a belt and baton. There were several cigarette burn injuries all over Chocolate’s body. He was taken to Sion Hospital for treatment,” said an officer. During probe, cops learnt that Chocolate had abused and threatened one of Patkar’s associates, said police. Senior inspector Deepak Chavan of the Matunga police said that while they were checking Chocolate’s scooter, they found a big knife. A case under the Arms Act has been registered against Chocolate.

Bishnoi, whose custody was taken from the Delhi Police, has been remanded to police custody till January 31. Meanwhile, Aumkareshwar Thakur (25), who created Sulli Deals app, and Odisha-resident Neeraj Singh (34) were sent to judicial custody on Thursday. During Bishnoi’s interrogation, cyber police learnt that he made a group named “High IQ Bruh”. To show that its members — Vishal Kumar Jha (21), Shweta Singh (18), and Mayank Rawat (21) — are from the Sikh community, he made them change their Twitter handle names. All three are now arrested. “While Jha changed his handle name to “Khalasa Supremacist” from ‘Atriya’, Shweta changed hers to @jattkhalsa7 from @infinitude7. Similarly, Rawat changed his handle name to @khalsarajj and @jatindarsinghbhullar from @copingmeme while Neeraj changed his to @Harpalsingh (@Sikh_khalsa11) from Uday-@daydreamerr234),” said a cyber police officer. The officer said Bishnoi had sent the Bulli Bai app’s link to Rohin Kapoor (@learningshakta), Chhatrapajeet Shabu (@mahapajeet) and a few other Twitter handles, asking them to make it viral. The app was hosted through the GitHub platform on January 1. “The arrested locations were tracked after we got details from Twitter’s nodal officer that the Twitter handles — @bullibai, @sageox11, @hmmachaniceoki, @jattkhalsa7, @wannabesigmaf — were created from Bengaluru, Uttarakhand, Assam, Indore, and Odisha, respectively,” said the cyber police. It was Bishnoi who created the app and named it Khalsa Sikh Force to show it was created by the Sikh community. He used it to upload photographs of 102 Muslim women and put them on auction online with objectionable captions and contents.

The estranged woman has been engaged in a cross-continent battle for custody of her two daughters, who were taken from US to India by their father on the guise of visiting the country for a fortnight, was told by a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli that “there is little we can do as the children are not willing to go with the mother.” This remark came from the bench after it interacted with the two girls, one over 18 years of age and the other 16 years, through video-conferencing without the presence of counsel for the estranged couple - senior advocate Sidharth Luthra for the mother and senior advocate Sidharth Bhatnagar for the father, for a considerable time. “We interacted with the children for quite some time, though we are not 100% satisfied with the connectivity. The sum and substance of the interaction is that the children are not willing to go with the mother. You (the mother) try your luck before the trial court,” the bench said. In its order, the bench said, “Taking into consideration the fact that the scope in petition seeking writ of habeas corpus is very limited and taking note of the consideration made by the (Bombay) High Court, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the HC dismissing the writ petition filed by the petitioner herein.” “Further, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we grant liberty to the parties to avail the remedies available to them in accordance with law before an appropriate court...,” the CJI-led bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-custody-battle-daughters-pick-dad-over-us-based-mom/articleshow/89167289.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||‘Unjust to not consider Pandey for DGP’s post’||Mumbai: The state on Thursday defended acting Director General of Police Sanjay Pandey and said it will be grave injustice to him, an officer who served efficiently for over 30 years, if he is not considered as the head of the state police. The state said it amounts to depriving it from “even considering a deserving candidate in larger public interest.” In its written submissions, the state said the empanelment process that has kept out one of its seniormost police officer “by ex-facie manifestly arbitrary and complete incorrect application of Department of Personnel and Training guidelines” amounts to not following in letter and spirit the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case that set out how a DGP must be appointed. The state said it is also “grave injustice’’ to Sanjay Pandey, its own officer who served efficiently for over 30 years. It said a case is made out to at least direct UPSC to decide if Pandey’s name is to be included or not.The HC is hearing a PIL seeking appointment of DGP as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) had shortlisted three names: Hemant Nagrale, Rajnish Seth and K Venkatesham.Pandey in his written note said he was excluded from the November 1, 2021 shortlist of officers only because one ACR of ‘7’ was treated as ‘good,’ not ‘very good’ contrary to DOPT rules and thus is non-compliance of SC order that requires the state to consider its seniormost, ‘v good’ IPS officers for the highest post. He said “ironically” the PIL solely relies on the SC ruling and “the inherent flaw and fatal contradiction in the petitioner’s case surely cannot have escaped the attention of the court.” His case is that merely because the CS signed the selection, it does not take away that SC guidelines are not followed.The PIL alleges the state is acting at his instance and misusing powers with malicious intent. He said thus Pandey becomes a necessary party and must be joined and allowed to file an affidavit, failing which the petition requires to be dismissed on that ground alone. “Preposition that selection panel members after signing minutes, especially without recording any dissent, cannot express any reservation about selection so made, cannot be absolute. This is because panel member Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte on November 8, wrote to UPSC to reconsider after pointing to grading error, also on behalf of the state,” said the note, adding it “certainly does not amount to an attempt to renege the selection made.” Pandey too said the version of CS “remains uncontroverted by UPSC or other members.” He also said his preexisting objection to a 2012-13 grade pending since October 5, 2021 was decided and upgraded to 8, on November 8. The state received the UPSC decision on November 18 and reminded it on January 10, too, to reconsider, he said.The state’s note, submitted by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, said it was “not delaying the appointment of the permanent DGP” as alleged in the PIL filed by advocate Datta Mane. The delay is due to “indecisive approach of the UPSC.”The DGP’s post fell vacant due to mid-term transfer of DGP Subodh Jaiswal and Pandey was appointed as acting DGP last April.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/unjust-to-not-consider-pandey-for-dgps-post/articleshow/89167292.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had probed the case initially before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over. Advocate J P Mishra, a defence lawyer, contended that these officers were not authorised to attend the trial. As per the law, the NIA can take the help of another agency during investigation but not during trial, the defence said. When Judge P R Sitre questioned them, the duo said they were sent by ATS chief Vineet Agarwal upon verbal instructions from Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil. The NIA lawyer said it had not received any intimation in this regard. The ATS officials would file an application (for permission to attend) at the next hearing, they told the judge before leaving. Taking note of several prosecution witnesses turning hostile in the case, the minister had last week said ATS officials would attend the trial.

---||Mumbai||At 99, ex-staffer revisits defence manufacturing hub at Ambarnath on Republic Day||MUMBAI: The first time Joseph Rodrigues stepped into the Ordnance Factory at Ambarnath to start a job, India was under British rule. So Rodrigues' arrival at his former workplace 75 years later, on Wednesday, had special significance. The nonagenarian who has lived through multiple wars, a famine and a pandemic was the oldest surviving ex-employee at the unit that manufactures ammunition for the country's defence forces. He was honoured at their Republic Day event on Wednesday. Rodrigues was born into poverty in Karnataka's Byndoor. He lost his father before he turned five and with increasing pressure to support his mother and sisters, left home at the age of 10 to look for work. His family says he walked most of the journey from Karnataka to Goa where he took up a job as a househelp for a Goan family. "He has good memories from his time there as his employer looked after him well," his son, Raymond, said. When he was 22, Rodrigues moved to Mumbai where he started working as a waiter at military camps in Ulhasnagar for the British. It was in 1947, just before India got Independance, that he joined the Ordnance Factory in Ambarnath. "He was a labourer and had basic formal education. But he wanted to do better and gave an exam to become a crane operator," Raymond says. Around this time, Rodrigues got engaged. The family recounts how he asked his fiancee, Magdalene's, father for permission to take her out on a movie date before they had tied the knot, and was promptly turned down. "In anger, he sold off the film tickets in black," laughs his daughter, Anita. The couple had seven sons and three daughters. "After the Second World War, rations became dear. Basic supplies like rice and sugar were not easily available. But my parents always kept extra food at home in case someone turned up in need of it," Anita said. Rodrigues has vivid memories of digging up trenches outside the house, during the India-Pakistan war, to hide in case there was an attack. "It was a terrifying experience..." he said, adding that workload had also increased at the Ordnance Factory. His service also won him awards at the arms manufacturing unit. The Ordnance Factory at Ambarnath tweeted from its Twitter handle on Wednesday how motivating Rodrigues' presence among them was. Rodrigues' only regret is not having Magdalene by his side when he turns 100 in February. The couple was together for 48 years till Magdalene passed away in 1998. The family recollects how a collage of her photographs and obituaries that they had put together in her memory upset him so much that it had to be removed from his room. Until recently, the nonagenarian would cook for himself and has never needed a wheelchair. What is the secret to his fitness? "Work with your hands, have all your meals on time and watch your portions," he says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-99-ex-staffer-revisits-defence-mfg-hub-on-r-day/articleshow/89167296.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Declare October 15 as National Aviation Day after JRD’s 1932 flight, pilots urge PM||MUMBAI: A group representing Indian pilots has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare October 15 as ‘National Aviation Day’. It was on this historic day in 1932 that JRD Tata operated Tata Air Services’ inaugural flight carrying airmail from Karachi to Mumbai, marking the birth of commercial air transport in India. The pilots’ group also asked for the next major airport in India to be named as JRD Tata International Airport. India’s first commercial airline, Tata Air Services, was later renamed Tata Airlines. In 1946, when it became a public limited company, it was renamed Air India. The airline, which became a government-owned carrier in 1953, flew back into the ownership of its parent company on Thursday. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), in a letter sent this week to the PM, said: “India is now known as the fastest growing aviation market in the entire world. As we march towards the leading position it is only appropriate that we also display our commitment to the cause of aviation.” In the US, August 19 is celebrated as theNational Aviation Day. The day “happens to be the birthday of Orville Wright, the first person to accomplish powered flight, and it is only in the fitness of things that they have decided to celebrate his date of birth as the National Aviation Day,” said the letter sent by Capt Surinder Mehta, president, FIP. “We too have a rich aviation heritage of which we are justifiably proud and now it is time that India too starts celebrating our own National Aviation Day... Tata is considered the father of civil aviation in India,” the letter said, adding that it would be appropriate to declare it this year as India will be celebrating the 90th anniversary of Tata’s historic flight. On naming an airport, the pilots said it is common practice to name airports after aviators. The letter listed 15 such airports, including Wilbur Wright Field, Dayton, US; Amelia Earhart Airport, Atchison, Kansas, named after the first lady pilot to cross the Atlantic solo; O’Hare Airport, Chicago, named after Lt Cdr Edward O’Hare, naval aviator and US Navy’s first Ace.  Meanwhile, a petition on change.org pushing for the Navi Mumbai airport to be named after JRD Tata has so far garnered more than 95,700 votes. It may be recalled that in 1962, JRD Tata flew the historic Karachi-Mumbai route again to commemorate 30 years of commercial aviation in India. He flew another vintage aircraft, refurbished in 1982, when the then 78-year old JRD once again re-enacted the flight, this time to celebrate Air India’s 50th anniversary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/declare-oct-15-as-natl-aviation-day-after-jrds-1932-flight-pilots-urge-pm/articleshow/89167316.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Aged with comorbidities make up 84% of Mumbai’s January Covid-19 toll||MUMBAI: Many people are testing positive for Covid in the third wave prompted by the highly transmissible Omicron variant but the rate of deaths is significantly lower than in the second wave, said a senior state official. “A CFR (case fatality rate) of 0.07% is the lowest we have seen till now in the pandemic. It plainly bears out that out of over 9 lakh infections in the state, 661 people have died, and even among them, deaths have been mainly among the aged people with one or more underlying health problems,” the official said, adding that the CFR (the ratio of deaths among persons testing positive) was manifold higher in the second wave. During the peak of the second wave in April, there were 17.9 lakh positive cases and 29,562 deaths in the state. The CFR was 1.7%. Even as cases dropped to 11.6 lakh in May, deaths remained high at 28,683 with the CFR further increasing to 2.5%. “We are nowhere close to seeing that kind of deaths or critical cases in the third wave,” said the official. Dr Rakesh Bhadade, in-charge of B Y L Nair Hospital’s ICU, said the scenes of patients gasping for breath or waiting on stretchers to find a bed were not seen in the third wave. “Our bed occupancy was barely 20-25%,” he said, adding that among ICU patients, the share of incidental Covid was high. Incidental Covid is when a person comes for treatment of some other illness but tests positive for the coronavirus. “A review of our deaths showed that up to 70% were unrelated to Covid and were due to pre-existing illnesses of heart, kidney,” he said. Dr Sushant Meshram, head of pulmonary medicine at GMC in Nagpur said that there have been negligible deaths among healthy youngsters this time. Data from Mumbai showed that 84% deaths in January were among senior citizens. Among the deceased, 86% had comorbidities. Physician Dr Gautam Bhansali said 30%-40% Covid ICU beds in most private hospitals are unoccupied. “We have seven ICU patients but most are there because of age-related comorbidities,” he said. He, however, cautioned that elderly people who are immune-compromised must continue masking and avoiding crowded places. “Anyone who has persistent fever for more than three days must consult a doctor,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/aged-with-comorbidities-make-up-84-of-citys-jan-covid-toll/articleshow/89167318.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Covid cases continue slide, Maharashtra tally falls on fewer tests||MUMBAI: The state’s daily Covid cases dropped 29% to 25,425 cases on Thursday from 35,756 on Wednesday. The daily toll, too, almost halved from 79 to 42. A senior doctor said the drop could be the result of fewer tests conducted since Wednesday was the Republic Day holiday. While 1.8 lakh tests were run on Tuesday, only 1.5 lakh were done on Wednesday. However, in Mumbai, the daily caseload dropped by 26% without any drop in daily tests (around 42,000 on Wednesday and Thursday). The tally went down to 1,384 on Thursday from 1,858 registered on Wednesday. The daily toll increased by one to 13 on Thursday. The drop in cases in the city and the state prompted the state cabinet to hold a discussion on whether it’s time to think about life beyond Covid and exit restrictions like most countries in Europe. “The decline is apparent in Mumbai as cases dropped from 20,000 around 20 days ago to less than 2,000 cases now,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC will review the situation in the next few days to ponder easing of restrictions. In Mumbai, the changes between January 15 and 27 tell the story: while 7,191 beds were occupied on January 15, the occupancy dropped to 3,170 on January 27. The number of patients on oxygen support dropped from 2,650 to 1,299 in the same period while home quarantine figures dropped from 9 lakh to 5.7 lakh. Mumbai’s weekly positivity rate was 8.5%, down from 16% last week. Pune and Nagpur reported a 25% and 82% rise in fresh cases, respectively, over the last one week while Mumbai reported a 64% drop. Pune added over 89,000 fresh cases between January 20 and 26 against 71,000 cases added earlier. Mumbai’s weekly tally dropped to 22,364 against 61,712 in the previous week. There was a discussion in the state cabinet on Thursday regarding the relaxations given by other countries like the UK. State health minister Rajesh Tope said he’s had talks with the task force to discuss a possible exit from Covid curbs, similar to how countries in Europe were announcing easing of restrictions. “How long can we keep putting restrictions on people? We have to come up with a way forward, on how to live with Covid and discipline ourselves,” said the minister, adding that he plans to hold talks with the central task force as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-continue-slide-state-tally-falls-on-fewer-tests/articleshow/89167319.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Promptly flag any adverse vaccination event in teens, say experts||MUMBAI: Nearly a month into the vaccination of adolescents, reported instances of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) have been negligible and much lower than in adults. There, though, are concerns about a general lack of awareness about reporting adverse events. Experts say that while anxiety or underlying conditions could lead to unusual health events post vaccination, each one of them must be promptly reported for a thorough investigation.  A case in point is that of a 16-year-old Sangli teen who had three intermittent episodes of vomiting blood, days after he took the Covid jab at his school. The family got the boy hospitalised and spent Rs 30,000-35,000 on tests, but didn’t think of reporting the unusual episodes of vomiting to any district health or school officials. The boy was down with body ache post vaccination, but the episodes of vomiting started on the third day.  The boy’s uncle, Dhyananjay Madwanna, admitted it never occurred to them to inform the authorities, till he had a second episode. “We did not know whom to approach to report the case. We have now reported it to the district officials,” said the uncle. Dr Vivek Patil from Sangli's public health department said the boy has been diagnosed with hiatus hernia, which can lead to blood vomiting in some cases. “It is not related to the vaccine,” Patil said, adding no severe side-effects have been reported with Covaxin, but cases as such should be reported on time.  Two weeks ago, the death of a teenage girl in Mumbai four days after vaccination spurred rumours that it was linked to immunisation. While the district AEFI committee investigated and ruled out the role of vaccination in her death, the fact remains that neither the doctor who certified the death nor her parents informed the health authorities.  Dr Mukesh Agrawal, who heads Mumbai’s AEFI commi ttee, said it was imperative that parents or teachers report anything out of place. “Covaxin is no doubt a safe vaccine and we haven’t found a single severe side-effect. Having said that, it is the job of an expert committee to rule out whether or not an adverse effect is related to vaccination and to do that cases should at least reach us,” he said. “Without detailed reporting, we are often handicapped in determining causality,” he said. In Mumbai, a printed slip with numbers and names of people to contact is handed out. Still, in the teen girl’s case, no one made that call.  Across the state, most drives are happening in schools and college premises. Dr Sachin Desai, who heads the state’s immunisation department, said the AEFI rate in the 15-17 age group is negligible at 0.004%. “Teachers have been told to keep an eye and inform district officials,” he said, adding 120 AEFIs were reported out of 25 lakh doses given.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/promptly-flag-any-adverse-vax-event-in-teens-experts/articleshow/89167322.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Mumbai||Chandra likely to chair new AI board||Mumbai/New Delhi: A new Air India (AI) board led by Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran will be formed soon even as several group executives from TCS, AirAsia India and Tata Steel are expected to move to the ailing carrier to revive operations. Chandrasekaran, who is awaiting security clearance from the Centre to lead the Air India board, will bring in an expat CEO to pilot the carrier. This will be his second expat CEO hire after German citizen Puneet Chhatwal for Taj hotels. Going by the Tata Group’s current board format, Ratan Tata is expected to be chairman emeritus of AI, which will mark his return to the carrier after years (Ratan Tata, who holds a pilot licence for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, was the AI chairman in the mid-1980s). Since AI is a public company, rules require it to have a minimum of three and a maximum of 15 directors on its board, said shareholder advisory firm InGovern’s founder Shriram Subramanian. “Ideally, it should have a minimum of six directors for enough diversity.” AI until now had seven members on its board. On Thursday, two government nominee directors — S K Mishra and V A Patwardhan — and its chairman & MD Vikram Dev Dutt resigned from the board after the Tata Group formally took charge of AI from the Centre. AI was originally launched by former Tata Group chairman J R D Tata in 1932 as the nation’s first carrier. AI’s four functional directors — Vinod Hejmadi (finance), R S Sandhu (operations), Meenakshi Mallik (commercial) and Amrita Sharan (personnel) —will continue on the board of the carrier. “Security clearance of directors chosen by the Tata Group will take time. And so, functional departments can’t be left headless,” said an official in the know of matters. Several Tata Group executives will be transferred to AI (with some being shifted to handle specific projects — they will have to return to their original employers after completion of the tasks), said a source. Already, many of them had worked on the due-diligence of AI before the conglomerate had put in its bid for the carrier. Chances are high that AI’s new chief technology/digital officer and the chief HR officer will be from TCS and Tata Steel, said the same person. TCS will be managing AI’s IT and digital operations. While, Tata Steel, which is the first Indian company to have an HR department in 1947, will handle issues relating to AI’s multiple unions. AI comes with a highly unionised workforce with a history of disrupting schedules for demands. Likewise, people from Tata Motors and TajSats will assist the carrier’s ground fleet and in-flight meal catering operations, the person said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/chandra-likely-to-chair-new-ai-board/articleshow/89167327.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Mumbai||Cricket Board defers decision on the fate of Ranji Trophy||Mumbai: Will the Ranji Trophy be held or not? The million dollar question was deferred to another day after a meeting of the BCCI’s office-bearers on Thursday, held specifically to decide on the fate of the traditional tournament, failed to reach a conclusion. The BCCI had initially postponed the Ranji Trophy for the 2021-22 season due to a covid surge in the country.“We need some time to take a final decision on this matter. The number of cases in the country is still high,” a top BCCI official told TOI. “The fact that a meeting with this agenda was held means that the BCCI, particularly its president, Sourav Ganguly, is still hopeful of organizing at least the league stage of the tournament. If it was to be cancelled, it wouldn’t have taken so long for the BCCI to announce it. The office-bearers are likely to meet on Monday to take a final call,” said a reliable source. Coming out strongly in favour of holding the Ranji Trophy this season, former Mumbai captain and current Baroda Cricket Association CEO Shishir Hattangadi told TOI: “There are two categories of players. One is the guy who plays in the Ranji Trophy, the ‘wooden spoon’ cricketer, and the other plays in the IPL. Two seasons mean a lot to a player who plays in the Ranji Trophy, and doesn’t figure in the IPL. To make it worse, there are no jobs for cricketers these days, unlike in the good old days when they had full time jobs in banks and public sector companies. It’s not about compensation also. It’s about furthering your career as well. Cricket is about your aspirations also.”“My heart goes to those players who could miss out on two seasons of the Ranji Trophy. It was the Ranji Trophy that brought him into prominence. He did well in his debut season in 1987-88, and by 1989, he was playing for India. Just imagine what would happen to those aspiring Tendulkars if there was no Ranji Trophy for the second consecutive year. I just feel for all those players who might miss out again. Two years is a long time. It can make or break careers,” he rued. The office-bearers’ meeting was also prompted by the fact that many state associations are keen that the Ranji Trophy goes ahead, or there’s at least clarity on this regard. “If the Ranji is cancelled, many of the state units are looking to organize their T20 leagues in this window. This suspense and secrecy around the tournament must end soon,” said a BCCI member. Apart from the issue of players’ health, the big problem confronting the tournament is the short time period available before the forthcoming IPL. “The players would need to undergo a six-day quarantine before the IPL, and then a short camp with the respective franchises. How do you fit everything in such a short time,” wondered another BCCI member.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cricket-board-defers-decision-on-the-fate-of-ranji-trophy/articleshow/89167328.cms||---

---||India||MVA, BJP spar over bid to name Mumbai garden after Tipu Sultan||MUMBAI: Amid BJP’s opposition to the alleged move of “naming” a renovated garden here after Tipu Sultan, Maharashtra Congress on Thursday claimed that even President Ram Nath Kovind had praised the 18th century Mysore ruler in the Karnataka Assembly in 2017. The BJP had on Wednesday held protests, alleging that the renovated garden has been named after Tipu Sultan. It objected to the name, claiming that Sultan had persecuted Hindus and hence his name was unacceptable for a public facility. However, Maharashtra minister Aslam Shaikh who inaugurated new facilities at the garden in suburban Malvani, had said that it always bore the name of Tipu Sultan, and that there was no fresh nomenclature. Countering BJP’s allegations, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said,“...It is BJP’s deformed politics to bring religion to portray historical figures and to spew venom of hatred and polarisation.” “Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, whose hologram was inaugurated by PM, had called Tipu as a martyr and his Mysore tiger was made part of his Azad Hind Sena's flag as well as figured on its uniform,” Sawant said. NCP chief spokesperson and state cabinet minister Nawab Malik said, “Tipu Sultan never surrendered before the British and he martyred in the battle against the invaders...” All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and party’s Lok Sabha member from Aurangabad, Imtiaz Jaleel, said the name of Tipu Sultan was being opposed as he was a Muslim.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mva-bjp-spar-over-bid-to-name-mumbai-garden-after-tipu-sultan/articleshow/89167331.cms||---
---||Chennai||More than 50% of frontline staff in Tamil Nadu yet to get two doses of Covid-19 vaccine||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has made a big push for Covid vaccination, but more than half its own 9.7 lakh frontline workers have not taken both doses. Worse, nearly 1.7 lakh or 18% of these workers, who include policemen, revenue officials and local body staff, have not taken even a single dose of the Covid vaccine. The vaccination drive opened for frontline workers in February 2021, but data from the immunisation wing under the directorate of public health show only 4.4 lakh have taken two doses. Among healthcare providers — doctors, nurses, paramedics and other hospital staff — only 64% have taken two doses though 97% of them have taken the first dose. Of the 5.6 lakh people in this category, 3.6 lakh are double vaccinated. "We encourage everyone to take the vaccine. They are available in all government hospitals and PHCs," said director of public health Dr T S Selva Vinayagam. "Last week, the Centre told the Supreme Court that it has not made vaccinations mandatory. Following the Centre's guideline, we have not made vaccination mandatory," he said.Selva Vinayagam said, "But we have said that to enter workplaces, managers must ensure staff and eligible family members are double vaccinated. For entry to public spaces such as malls, double vaccination is a must."In addition to healthcare and frontline workers, nearly half the number of people above 60 years are not double vaccinated, increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death. Over the past two weeks more than 80% of the deaths have been among people above the age of 60 years. Overall in the state, nearly 89% of people above 15 years have taken one dose and 63% have taken both doses. Several experts across the state have warned that the slow pace of vaccination will increase public health risks by giving viruses the chances to transmit and mutate rapidly. "Vaccination must be done on a war footing at least now. Delays will increase risk of hospitalizations and deaths," said Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John. The medical experts panel, which met chief minister M K Stalin on Thursday to discuss prevention and management of Covid-19 also asked the state health department to offer booster doses as early as possible to healthcare providers, frontline workers, and senior citizens. Legal experts say while the centre has made a submission before the apex courts, states are free to make their own mandates. "Health is a state subject. To ensure the safety of its citizens there is no harm in making vaccination compulsory. The state must strictly enforce its decision not to permit people without double vaccines in any public or workspaces," said retired high court judge Justice N Kirubakaran.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/more-than-50-of-frontline-staff-in-state-yet-to-get-two-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine/articleshow/89167333.cms||Pushpa Narayan

GrabTaxi and Yandex Go took the first and second spots respectively, while Uber took third place. GrabTaxi, which is headquartered in Singapore and Indonesia, collects almost ten times more data than the least data-hungry app Rapido – 27 out of 32 possible data points. The report said the app also shares some of its collected data like product interaction, name, email, phone number, and user ID with third parties.Moscow-based Yandex Go collects data such as purchase and search history, precise and course locations, all users’ contact information and identifiers such as user ID and device ID. Yandex Go also has access to their users’ photos, videos, and audio data. Uber has access to its users’ videos, photos, texts and emails. Ola is said to be collecting some 18 data points.On the other hand, Rapido is seen to deliver the same service using only its user’s name, phone number, and location. The report said that ride-hailing apps, on average, collect 14 data points per user and 30% of them use this data for third-party advertising. Most apps usually share the device and user ID, product interaction information, and precise location with third parties.Surfshark’s CEO Vytautas Kaziukonis said, “Many people today are willing to trade privacy for comfort and share their personal information in exchange for a service.

---||Bengaluru||Indian Football loses a star all-rounder||Bengaluru: A dependable defender, penalty expert, noted coach and an able administrator. These were some of the hats successfully worn by former India player AD Nagendra who passed away on Wednesday after a brief illness. Nagendra hailed from a family of footballers in Tumakuru, with three of the five brothers — AD Srinivas and AD Devaraj being the other two — donning the state and national colours. After turning out for Mysore University, Nagendra joined CIL as a guest player before moving to Jupiters SC and Jawahar Union. He first played in the state team in 1963.The stopper back was soon selected to the Mysore team that won the Santosh Trophy in 1967-68 and in 1968-69. His performance got him a national call-up. He was part of the India squad that figured in 1969 Merdeka Cup. Nagendra was also in the Mysore team that played Russia during that period. “At Jupiters he played a big part in lifting the club from B Division to the top tier. He never missed a penalty and I remember watching his game in the newsreel at the Vijayalakshmi theatre near Chickpet. Such was his skill that he used to take the ball from goalline to goalline and give the pass,” Nagendra’s neighbour and former ITI player R Ramakrishna told TOI. Later, Nagendra joined State Bank of Mysore and played in inter-bank tournaments. After his playing career, he excelled as a coach. “He got his NIS diploma and then went to Germany for a diploma. He was then in charge of spotting and nurturing talent in Karnataka,” a former state association official said. Nagendra was named the India U-16 coach and then trained the U-19 team at the Asian Youth Championships in Delhi in 1996. He also excelled as the coach of HAL for a long period. In between, he was also in charge of ITI. The last rites were performed on Thursday. Nagendra is survived by his wife, son Suresh, an AFC C license coach, and a daughter. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has mourned his death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/indian-football-loses-a-star-all-rounder/articleshow/89167342.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Accident victim with pelvic organ injury gets higher relief||BENGALURU: Coming to the rescue of an accident victim who suffered permanent disability to his pelvic organ at the age of 14, the high court’s Dharwad bench recently awarded him a higher compensation of Rs 17.6 lakh. Out of this amount, Rs 10 lakh is for loss of amenities and enjoyment of life and Rs 3,62,880 towards loss of future prospects and six per cent interest from the date of the award till actual payment. In September 2011, Basavaraj, a resident of Ranebennur in Haveri district, was hit by a truck. A teenager then, he suffered 40 per cent permanent disability around his pelvic region. Basavaraj claimed Rs 11,75,000 as compensation. However, on August 4, 2016, a Ranebennur court awarded him Rs 3,73,988. Basavaraj, who is in his mid-20s now, challenged the award, claiming he was a student and also working as a hotel supplier. He argued that he had suffered a fracture of pubic rami, ruptured urethra, pelvic fracture and fracture of inferior ramus of the right hip bone, resulting in permanent disability. Claiming that the compensation awarded by the Ranebennur court was on the lower side, Basavaraj’s counsel argued that the petitioner’s marriage prospects have been severely jeopardised and he cannot have a family, owing to the permanent disability he suffered. On the other hand, counsel for the insurance company claimed that the compensation awarded by the Ranebennur court is just and fair, and further contended that the claimant was not a student as claimed by him and the award of Rs 35,000 towards loss of education is unjustified. A division bench comprising justices SG Pandit and Anant Ramanath Hegde, after going through the materials placed before the Ranebennur court, said it can be safely concluded that the claimant has suffered permanent disability in respect of his sexual organ as well as around the hip, and the doctor has opined that the situation is irreversible. The bench noted that the claimant who is deprived of marriage prospects and pleasure of marital life and having children, cannot be adequately compensated in terms of money. Nevertheless, to mitigate his pain and agony, monetary compensation has to be awarded and there should be some logical and rational nexus between the compensation awarded and the pain suffered by the claimant. “The very object of awarding compensation under non-pecuniary heads in a case relating to death or permanent disability is to restore, as far as possible, the position of the victim, to the situation that existed before the accident. In case of death or permanent disability, though the attempt is to restore the position of the claimant before the accident, no amount of compensation would restore the things as they stood before the accident. Tribunals and courts are entrusted with the task of awarding compensation to mitigate suffering to the best possible extent. However, the object of awarding compensation is not to confer a windfall on the claimant. The court/tribunal has to balance the conflicting claim of the victim and the tortfeasor,” the division bench further observed, while modifying the compensation awarded by the Ranebennur court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/accident-victim-with-pelvic-organ-injury-gets-higher-relief/articleshow/89167343.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Is new peetha a game of political one-upmanship?||Bengaluru: The decision of a section of seers and people to establish another peetha, a religious centre for Panchamasalis, has kicked off a political row besides exposing an alleged nexus between politicians and swamijis, sources said. The new and the third peetha of Panchamasalis will be formally inaugurated on February 14 at Alaguru village in Jamakhandi taluk of Bagalkot district, and Mahadeva Shivacharya Swamiji of Bruhan Mutt, Babaleshwar, has been selected as the new head. There are already two peethas — one at Kudala Sangama headed by Jaya Mruthyunjay Swamiji and another at Harihar led by Vachananand Swamiji. The reason put forth for establishing the third peetha is that the current heads of two peethas are not able to cater to religious needs of the Panchamasalis, the largest sect among Lingayats. “It is a practice among Panchamasalis to invite swamijis to grace weddings and perform last rites. Since the community is spread across more than 10 districts, the two swamijis are not able to attend such programmes. Therefore, it was decided to have another peetha,” said Sanganabasava Shivacharya Swamiji of Managuli Hiremath in Vijayapura district. But Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami dismissed the argument and cited political reasons. “The role of peethas is to propagate religion and not to attend family functions. The new peetha is being formed to divide the community. The selfish motives of some politicians have also played a role. But there will be no relation between us and the new peetha,” he said, while indirectly pointing fingers at Murugesh Nirani. Many people in the community believe the differences that cropped up between Nirani and former Union minister and BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal during the padayatra led by Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami to press for reservation for Panchamasalis under 2A category led to the formation of the new peetha. “Nirani was unhappy with the swamiji’s decision to side with Yatnal and former Congress MLA Vijayanand Kashappanavar during and after the padayatra. He extended support from the backdoor for floating a new peetha. Neither Panchamasalis demanded for it nor is it being set up for the welfare of the community,” said a Lingayat leader from Belagavi. It is being said that Nirani, who was making desperate attempts to get into the cabinet of then CM BS Yediyurappa, was a key player in planning the padayatra. But when he was made minister a month prior to the padayatra, he not only distanced himself from it but also tried to stop the yata to avoid embarrassment to the government. Angered by this, the seer and Yatnal completed their padayatra from Kudala Sangama to Bengaluru and criticised Nirani. “The success of the padayatra led Nirani to feel threatened politically. For his political growth, he has floated this new peetha. It has no support of the Panchamasalis,” said Kashappanavar.  Nirani dismissed the allegations and claimed he had no role in the establishment of the new peetha. “It is purely the decision of the swamijis. Neither have they consulted me nor have I spoken to them in this regard. The allegations against me are baseless,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/is-new-peetha-a-game-of-political-one-upmanship/articleshow/89167344.cms||---

The list of prisoners will now be sent to the governor for approval, following which they will be released. Usually, the exercise coincides with Republic Day celebrations, but this year it was delayed, home department officials said. In 2014, the government evolved new guidelines for the premature release of certain categories of prisoners who have been sentenced to life but completed 14 years of jail with good track record. The guidelines would apply to eligible persons subject to conditions, including that their cases do not fall under section 435 of criminal procedure code and that they execute bonds of surety. They should have a record of good behaviour during parole and, as a result of their release, there should be no disturbance to law and order and no threat to themselves or the families of victims. A committee headed by the principal secretary, home department, reviews the proposals on a case-by-case basis and makes recommendations to the cabinet. The list is finally taken to the governor for approval.

Hariprasad, a backward classes leader identified with the DK Shivakumar camp, was chosen over Ibrahim, who was with the Siddaramaiah camp. “Shivakumar and Hariprasad are on good terms, so it may help them coordinate better,” said Ibrahim, who joined Congress in 2008 from JD(S) along with Siddaramaiah. He alleged there is a lack of political understanding with Shivakumar and a loss of confidence in Siddaramaiah in the party. On his future plans, Ibrahim said: “AICC has given me a Sankranti gift. Sonia Gandhi has lessened my burden and I am now free to take decisions. I have been getting calls from JD(S), SP and TMC, and I’ll decide in 8-10 days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/mlc-ibrahim-threatens-to-quit-congress/articleshow/89167346.cms||---

A cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the decision and decided to convene the legislature session from February 14-25. Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot will address the joint sitting on the first day. Bommai said the budget session will be convened in the first week of March, but did not disclose when he will present the budget. The CM is expected to present a populist budget laced with welfare programmes with assembly elections just 14 months away. The budget will be his last opportunity to spell out the government’s policies and woo voters. He is expected to announce major allocation for irrigation projects to take the sting out of Congress’ campaign that the government has neglected the sector.  The Congress wants to make this an election issue and has lined up programmes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bommai-to-present-maiden-budget-in-march-first-week/articleshow/89167347.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC: Display on bank’s notice board not ‘wide circulation’||Bengaluru: Mere pasting of a notice or circular on reduction of interest rate by a bank on its notice board cannot be treated as “wide circulation”, the high court said on Thursday.A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi made this observation while dismissing a writ appeal filed by a nationalised bank against a customer who had availed home loan.Canara Bank (formerly Syndicate Bank) had challenged the July 29, 2021 order of a single bench directing it to give benefit of the circular dated June 30, 2010 to BS Shekar and collect interest at the rate of 8.25 percent with effect from the date of the said 2010 circular.However, the bank claimed the notice on reduction in interest rate was pasted on the bank’s notice board and the petitioner hadn’t availed it at that time. Earlier, the single bench noted the bank had reduced rate of interest from 11.75% to 8.25% with effect from January 24, 2017, when Shekar submitted an application for switchover to the new scheme. “It is a housing loan. The stand taken by the bank that the petitioner did not request earlier to switch over to a lesser rate of interest is untenable. The bank is owned by the central government and change in rate of interest from time to time should be made applicable uniformly,” the single bench said. It also directed the bank to extend the benefit of reduced interest from June 30, 2010, the date of the RBI circular.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-display-on-banks-notice-board-not-wide-circulation/articleshow/89167348.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Project cost up 4-fold before work starts||BENGALURU: The multi-crore Varthur village elevated corridor project, which was supposed to ease traffic on the stretch that connects Sarjapur Road/Electronics City and Whitefield/Kempegowda International Airport, remains on the drawing board because of alleged political interference and multiple plan revisions. The project, mooted by Karnataka Road Development Corporation, envisaged a 1.3km-long, 60ft-wide elevated road from Varthur tank bund to Varthur police station. Incidentally, the state cabinet on Thursday extended the corridor length to 1.9km. The project was formally proposed on May 20, 2019, and supposed to be completed by June 2024. KRDCL chief engineer R Prasad said: “This elevated road will cover Varthur village and ease traffic flow in the tech corridor.” Though the corridor is much required, what has raised the red flag is the timing. It is being proposed in the run-up to the civic polls and comes at a time when the image of elected representatives has taken a beating because of poor road infrastructure. With most tech firms getting ready to start work-from-office after the third wave of Covid subsides, traffic obstructions are bound to increase frustration levels among vehicle users. “The elevated corridor should have been completed five years ago, but they are thinking about it now. When will they start work and when will it be completed?” asked the office-bearers of resident welfare associations dotting the road even as officials maintained the initial pile load testing work is under way. Though sceptical about the project completion time, residents are enthused about the elevated corridor. “Varthur has many educational institutions and tech parks surrounding it. An elevated corridor will ease traffic congestion,” said Chaitanya Prabhu, a resident. Gunjur resident Hemanth Kumar said: “The current traffic flow is high and with increasing population, Varthur is likely to become a major choke point.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/project-cost-up-4-fold-before-work-starts/articleshow/89167349.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 2 women, 2 flowerpots, 2 days of police action||BENGALURU: Two women sent police into a tizzy for two days with a complaint and later its withdrawal. While one alleged that a car-borne woman robbed her of two flowerpots, the culprit, when caught, sheepishly apologised stating she picked up the pots as she liked them. Police, who usually dismiss complaints where the value of the goods lost or stolen is low, swung into action after the complainant described the incident as ‘robbery’ in her tweet and tagged cops. The drama unfolded on Tuesday when Navya (name changed), a private company employee from RMV II Stage, tweeted: ‘Day light robbery in RMV 2nd stage! Vehicle no: KA0XNXXXX help identify the criminals@Karnatakapolice @blrcitytraffic @BlrCityPolice’. The words ‘daylight robbery’ set Sanjaynagar police in action mode and they rushed to the spot. Navya showed police CCTV footage, where a middle-aged woman could be seen stealing two flowerpots and said: ‘Did you see the daylight robbery?’ The police team didn’t say anything but left the place, asking Navya to file a complaint so that they could investigate. Accordingly, Navya filed a complaint and police booked a non-cognizable report (NCR) against the unknown woman. By then, the tweet with the CCTV footage had gone viral. The footage shows a red car stopping in the middle of the road and a woman, sitting next to the driver’s seat, getting off and rushing towards the main gate of a house located towards the right side. She quickly grabs two medium-sized pots, places them in the rear of the car and disappears. Navya’s tweet had the licence plate of the red car, which helped police trace the vehicle and the woman. “By Wednesday morning, we identified the woman as Divya (name changed), a resident of Electronics City. With the help of Regional Transport Office officials, we managed to get Divya’s number and one of our woman staffers called her. Shocked on receiving a call from the police station, Divya confessed saying she had indeed lifted the pots, but not with an intention to steal them,” said police, who then directed her to visit them on Thursday. Meanwhile, cops contacted Navya, saying they had traced the woman, to which she replied: I’m aware of her.” On Thursday, Divya, instead of going to the station, went to Navya’s house, returned the two flowerpots and apologised. A little later, Navya called Sanjaynagar police to say she wanted to close the case. “The woman has returned the pots. She said she liked the flowers and so took them. We have settled the issue amicably. I don’t want to continue the case,” police quoted her as saying. “We upped surveillance after coming across the tweet describing a daylight robbery. Then we explained to Navya that it was not a case of robbery but theft. We are glad that the episode ended on a happy note. Just that our time was wasted, ” said police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/2-women-2-flowerpots-2-days-of-police-action/articleshow/89167350.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The wires, hidden in his luggage, were coated with rhodium to avoid detection. According to airport sources, the smuggling attempt unfolded in the early hours of the day after the Sharjah flight landed at KIA. Earlier, the Bengaluru unit of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence received a tip-off about the suspect. The information was passed on to the Customs team and officials checked the passengers who’d carried disembarked. They soon intercepted the suspect, who was unable to give convincing answers about his Gulf trip and return to Bengaluru.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Poor-quality helmets? Many ask if cops wear any better||BENGALURU: A video clip showing traffic police getting several helmets crushed under the wheels of a truck on grounds that they were of substandard quality has sparked a debate on social media, with a section of citizens pointing to policemen using similar helmets. The clip, shared on Tuesday by DCP (traffic-west) Kuldeep Kumar R Jain, shows a police officer destroying ‘weak’ helmets while himself wearing a substandard one. The video has invited sarcastic barbs from some road users. A few even wondered if the lives of policemen weren’t as precious as those of other road users. Finding themselves in a tight spot, traffic police head honchos have now decided to set their house in order by directing the ground staff not to wear half-helmets and, instead, don only those that meet ISI standards. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda told TOI that no one was above the law and the helmet regulation was same for all. “We have instructed our men to wear proper helmets conforming to ISI standards. Till now, we fined more than 1,600 policemen for wearing substandard helmets,” he said. Policemen buy helmets for official use from designated ‘police stores’, which can be found in places such as BVK Iyengar Road, Shivajinagar and Wilson Garden. “We pay for helmets on our own. Half-helmets with a police logo on them and with an ISI mark costs about Rs 350, while full-face helmets with similar features cost about Rs 800,” a constable said. On reimbursing helmet costs, Gowda said the department only pays fuel bills. Those patrolling on two-wheelers must buy their own headgear, he added. Cops say they are forced to shell out money from their own pocket for a new helmet. Jain, whose tweet led to the current round of discussions on social media, said his own team will start using standard helmets from now on. “As we kick off a public campaign, we will first enforce it within our department,” he added. Substandard helmets and accidentsTraffic police data show the number of two-wheeler riders and pillions wearing helmets and still meeting with fatal accidents is three times that of those without helmets. The reason, police say, is either the helmets worn are substandard, or they aren’t strapped properly. As per the data, about 1,300 riders and pillions died in road accidents between 2019 and 2021. Of them, 947 had helmets, while 353 did not wear one. “This is why we have started a special drive against substandard helmets and those that aren’t worn properly,” said Gowda. “We have now launched a driver and are letting off motorists with a warning. By February-end, we will start collecting fine. Using a substandard helmet for the sake of obeying law won’t save lives in case of accidents,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/poor-quality-helmets-many-ask-if-cops-wear-any-better/articleshow/89167352.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: DGCA team probes mid-air scare at Kempegowda International Airport||BENGALURU: A Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) team has commenced probe into the mid-air collision scare involving two IndiGo flights that were allowed to take off at the same time and in the same direction from Kempegowda International Airport’s parallel runways on January 7. Senior officers connected to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) were questioned as part of the investigation. Local authorities had allegedly tried to hush up the incident by not reporting it to DGCA, possibly to avoid a probe and punishment. Over 380 flyers onboard the two aircraft had a miraculous escape after a radar controller noticed the potentially grave error and at the nick of time, instructed the two pilots to diverge. TOI was the first to report the incident, which resulted in DGCA initiating action against those at fault. On January 21, exactly two weeks after the mid-air scare, a DGCA team from Delhi arrived at Bengaluru airport and carried out investigation into the incident. According to DGCA sources, the team quizzed the ATC, including the ones on duty on the morning of the incident, and notably the version of the senior-most officer in the ATC tower at the time was recorded. The investigators returned to Delhi the next day and is expected to submit a report on the incident in mid-February, said sources. Meanwhile, the Air Traffic Management at Bengaluru airport is said to be conducting an internal probe to ascertain who was at fault for the incident and under whose guidance the matter was covered up, possibly to save officials posted at KIA. Further, a team from the Aviation Investigation Bureau of the ministry of civil aviation also visited Bengaluru airport this week and collected evidence related to the incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dgca-team-probes-mid-air-scare-at-kia/articleshow/89167353.cms||Petlee Peter

Auto drivers assembled in front of the transport department office at Shantinagar and demanded action against Rapido bike-taxis. They said their earnings have fallen because of bike-taxis and the Covid-19 pandemic. “Whiteboard two-wheelers, without paying any taxes, are operating as bike-taxis. Our income is already affected by lockdowns and these bike-taxis are further denting it. If they are permitting whiteboard bike-taxis, they should also allow us to operate with whiteboards,” said K Manjunath, an auto driver. The drivers booked two rides through the Rapido app and seized the two-wheelers when they arrived for pickup. Later, police intervened and released them after issuing a warning. Aravind Sanka, co-founder of Rapido, said: “The company has received assurances from the high court that no coercive measures will be used against it until a policy is in place. Operating and convincing regulators of the workings and benefits of bike- taxis is a continuous process. We are also in touch with the department, seeking its help in understanding the legal framework, and are hoping to hear from them soon.” Transport officials said they can’t take action against bike-taxis as the case is pending in court. Rapido has been operating non-electric bike taxis since 2016.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/auto-drivers-stage-protest-against-bike-taxis-seize-2/articleshow/89167354.cms||---

Even as the Dental Council of India had set November 20 as the last date for admission to MDS courses, Karnataka conducted counselling only in December.

Around 220 grams of charas, worth Rs 7.5 lakh, was seized from them. The accused are Ashish Jain, 30, and Pratik Jain, 27, both residents of Fraser Town. They had come under police scanner during an investigation into drug consumption in Arakere, where three persons were taken into custody on January 21.

On January 25, TOI published a report, ‘103/100? BCom result baffles BU students’, on students securing more than the maximum marks in their theory paper — travel agency and tour operator organisation. While maximum marks for the written exam was 70 and that of internal assessment was 30, many students were awarded more than 72. The issue arose after the same question paper was set for both regular and other students who were writing it as a one-time measure. While regular students were to attempt only three sections in the question paper, they went on to attempt the remaining sections too, taking their total to beyond the maximum marks. According to a senior BU professor, the carelessness occurred due to internal problems between the BoE chairperson and registrar (evaluation). “Is it difficult to make another set of question papers for other students? When we work for the university, caring for students matters. In this case, it is unfortunate to see their internal problems leading to tarnishing the university’s image. We are doing digital evaluation, but in such cases, we would have evaluated papers manually. The registrar (evaluation) knows the exam pattern and he should have taken a call when his subordinate was on the wrong path,” the professor said. Registrar (evaluation) JT Devaraj said: “We’ve issued a notice to the BoE chairperson. I had informed the vice-chancellor about the issue and redirected to re-evaluate the answer papers. It will take a few days to complete the evaluation. However, we are waiting for a reply from the officer concerned.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/notice-to-exam-board-chief-over-evaluation-error-in-bu/articleshow/89167360.cms||P Pavan

He was speaking on Thursday at a virtual ceremony organised by the consulate heneral of Israel to South India to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The ceremony saw the participation of heads of diplomatic missions and clergy from various religious communities, who lit a candle in memory of Holocaust victims.  “The lighting of candles with members of the diplomatic community in south India and leaders of religious communities sends a strong message, emphasising the responsibility of everyone to ensure such atrocities never happen again,” Zadka said. Each year, the United Nations builds a theme around which the commemoration is focused. The theme for 2022 was “memory, dignity and justice”. It encompasses safeguarding the historical record, remembering the victims, and challenging distortion of history expressed in contemporary antisemitism. Friedrich Birgelen, deputy consul general of the Federal Republic of Germany, said words do not do justice to the Holocaust atrocities. Archbishop of Bengaluru Peter Machado, who delivered an address on behalf of religious leaders, said to forget the Holocaust is to kill twice. He urged the global community to take lessons from the past and prepare future generations with positive ideas of peace and harmony. “We must give our future generation a sense of understanding of the importance of life, freedom, peace, harmony, tolerance, and co-existence,” he said. Judith Ravin Consul General at the US Consulate General in Chennai added the global community must also speak up against Holocaust denial and distortion, antisemitism, and all forms of racism and discrimination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/world-should-ensure-atrocities-like-holocaust-never-recur/articleshow/89167361.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Chennai||Covid curbs off: Tamil Nadu schools, colleges to reopen on February 1||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday allowed reopening of schools, colleges and places of worship from February 1, and revoked night curfew from Friday (January 28). The complete lockdown on Sundays too stands withdrawn. The announcement came after chief minister M K Stalin chaired a meeting with health experts and officials on relaxing the Covid-19 restrictions. "Though some districts are climbing towards the peak, the active and fresh cases have come down and hospitalisations remain low. Only about 5% of active cases require hospitalisation and more than 80% of the hospital beds are vacant," a health official said. Starting February 1, in-person classes have been allowed for all students from Class I to Class XII. Colleges, except those being used as Covid care centres, are also allowed to function from February 1 following Covid protocols, an order said. "To enable people to return to normalcy and in the interest of students' future, employment and economy, the state government is issuing the new Covid-19 guidelines," a press release announcing the relaxations said. Since the beginning of the month, places of worship had been closed on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Now, the restriction has been lifted. However, the government has retained the ban on political meetings, cultural and social gatherings from February 1 to 15. It also urged everyone to follow Covid-19 protocols released by the State Election Commission while conducting polls for urban local bodies.Marriage functions will be allowed with just 100 people while funerals will be allowed with 50 people. The ban on play schools and nursery schools would continue and trade fairs, cultural festivals by government and private people also will not be allowed, the government release said. The state government, in its continuing efforts to curb the Covid-19 cases, retained the curbs such as allowing hotels, bakeries, theatres, multiplexes, music events, conferences, gyms, beauty parlours, salons to function with just 50% occupancy. There is no ban on usual practices and sports events will be allowed with 50% occupancy in indoor stadiums. All amusement parks and entertainment parks (except water sports) will be allowed to function with Covid-19 protocols and 50% capacity. "Except for the above restrictions, all Covid-19 curbs have been withdrawn," CM Stalin said in the statement. However, he said, test, track, treat, vaccination and Covid-19 appropriate behaviours will be followed strictly. He also urged the district collectors and local bodies to draw up the micro-level containment zones to prevent the spread of the disease. In the containment zones, emergency medical services and essential services alone should be allowed, he said. Stalin asked the people to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, maintain social distance and get vaccinated. He also asked them to extend full cooperation to the government's efforts to protect the people from infections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/covid-curbs-off-tn-schools-colleges-to-reopen-on-feb-1/articleshow/89167363.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Hyderabad||Two Hyderabad slum boys wade through tough times to sail with Navy||HYDERABAD: Adding another feather to its cap, the Yacht Club of Hyderabad (YCH) has transformed the lives of two economically backward students from the city as they have been officially inducted into the Indian Navy as sailors. The two students – Erra Durga Prasad (20) and Gowtham Kankatla (21) — from the Rasoolpura slum realised their dreams after a stint with YCH. Prasad's father Lingam works at a photocopying shop, while his mother is a sweeper at a motorbike showroom. Gowtham's mother Vijayalakshmi faced the worst from her abusive and alcoholic husband. She did whatever odd jobs she could get to earn a living for her family after her husband passed away due to liver cirrhosis in 2007. Prasad and Gowtham struggled to adapt in the early stages of sailing with the yacht club. In Prasad's case, a storm capsized his boat and required lifeguards to rescue him during his first attempt at Pawna lake in Maharashtra. Prasad bagged a bronze medal at the India International Regatta in 2017, which catapulted him to the No.1 position in India in the junior category. Prasad tried for the junior fleet of the Navy in 2016 and got selected. Finally, he joined his senior fleet in 2021. Gowtham too struggled to keep his feet firmly on the boat in Hussainsagar. After much resilience, he managed to win his first national gold medal in 2016. Vijayalakshmi did not have much hope when Gowtham sought to participate in water sports and eventually gave in to his demand. When he was 10, Gowtham joined YCH. "I had never agreed to his demand first because he was just a kid. He came to me asking that he wants to do dangerous stuff in the waters. We never expected that he would get through. But Gowtham surprised us all," Vijayalakshmi told TOI. Prasad and Gowtham completed their training in Odisha and have received their first official posting in Mumbai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/two-city-slum-boys-wade-through-tough-times-to-sail-with-navy/articleshow/89167378.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: I prefer action over words, says CM MK Stalin||CHENNAI: The announcement of the urban local body election by the state election commission has set the ball rolling in the political arena in Tamil Nadu. If not all political parties, at least the ruling DMK and the PMK, which recently distanced itself from the alliance led by the opposition party AIADMK, have started gearing up for the election. Chief minister and DMK president M K Stalin while speaking at the wedding ceremony of the daughter of DMK Rajya Sabha MP T K S Elangovan in Chennai on Thursday said people must talk less and focus on actions. "That's what I am doing now," he said. Stalin said the state has reserved 50% of the seats in local bodies for women. He said women who enjoy equal rights and opportunities in the local body polls must get equal importance in personal affairs too. Later in the evening, Stalin chaired a virtual meeting with the MPs, MLAs and district functionaries to discuss the strategies to face the urban local body polls successfully. A senior DMK district secretary said after the two hours online meeting, Stalin patiently listened to the views of all representatives. Senior DMK leader and minister S Duraimurugan, known for his wit and humour, said if the meeting was held at the party office, it would have concluded in an hour. But the virtual meeting went on for two hours, he said.  "Stalin patiently listened to the participants and advised them. He appealed to one and all to finalise good candidates. He directed all to visit every household and patiently listen to people’s problems," said a senior leader. Stalin insisted that the party representatives must not earn a bad name. "Listen to the grievances of the people. The DMK representatives and candidates must patiently listen to the problems of people and resolve the issues through government machinery. Remember, we have earned the goodwill of the people for the past eight months and people will definitely vote for us. We will win like we did in 2021 rural local body elections in the nine districts," Stalin said.  PMK did not lag behind. PMK founder leader S Ramadoss said the party will hold a virtual meet on Friday with the state office bearers and district secretaries to chalk out plans to re-establish the party's position in the state without the support of the two Dravidian majors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/i-prefer-action-over-words-says-stalin/articleshow/89167383.cms||---

A police team nabbed the man Vijayakumar, 43 of Ambathur and his wife Yasodha, 43, when they came to receive the money from the MLA in Tiruttani. Based on a complaint from Tiruttani MLA S Chandran on Wednesday that a man claiming to be a ‘DSP’ told him that he had received a complaint from a person from his constituency and promised to settle the issue without any case if the legislator agreed to pay ₹25 lakh. "Without detailing the complaint further, the man told the MLA that his curiosity to know more about the complaint and the complainant would land the MLA in further trouble," said Tiruvallur district superintendent of police Varun Kumar. The man told the MLA not to discuss the complaint with anyone else and claimed to have sorted out a complaint for Vilathikulam MLA recently. Disbeliving the claims, Tiruttani MLA Chandran checked with his Vilathikulam counterpart V Markandayan, who told him that he had indeed received a call from a man, but he ignored it. Chandran then chose to lodge a complaint with Tiruttani police, who laid a trap for the culprit. On Thursday, the man again called the MLA. The MLA then asked the blackmailer to come near a hotel in Tiruttani. Police arranged a bag containing white papers with a layer of currency at the top. While the MLA handed over the cash, a police team surrounded the black Santro car in which two accused — Vijayakumar, 43 of Ambathur and his wife Yasodha, 43 — were travelling. They seized ₹10,000 and identity cards from the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/couple-try-to-blackmail-2-mlas-held-in-tiruttani/articleshow/89167384.cms||---

The need for hiring more talent should be in tune with the growth of the economy and the ever-growing population, he said. “In the case of Tamil Nadu, we have hundreds of (statutory) boards, besides various departments. But we have just around 300 IAS officials to administer them,” Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said, while addressing the 12th edition of The India Finance Forum - "Beyond Resilience: Turnaround & Transformation" – organized by the CII to discuss the post-Covid scenario of the economy and its ability to bounce back. There is an urgent need to hire a think-tank to support the government’s decision making, he added. Citing the instance of large fiscal incentive package announced by the Union government in the aftermath of the impact of the Covid pandemic, Thiaga Rajan said several bank managers in tier 2 towns and cities in Tamil Nadu are not even aware of the incentives and schemes announced by the Centre for the MSME sector affected by the pandemic. “There is a huge gap between our intent and ability to execute the same. This is where cooperative federalism should come into play with the Centre, all state governments and the local bodies being on the same line to implement such decisions. It is easy to reach the corporates at the top of the pyramid, but it is difficult to reach the middle and the bottom of the pyramid,” Thiaga Rajan said. According to him, there is an urgent need to change the way the GST system, which is the backbone of the country’s revenue stream, is functioning, with most officials working as part-timers. “The GST Council is headed by the revenue secretary, which already is a full-time job. So is the case with several other secretaries that are part of the Council. We need officials who will focus on the GST system full time,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/need-to-improve-administrative-mechanism-ptr/articleshow/89167386.cms||---

RBI said in a statement the song was sung on the occasion of the Republic Day on Wednesday as a "mark of deference for the Tamil culture and language." "However, subsequently, in the commotion that ensued, certain unnecessary statements concerning the song had been made, which were uncalled for and regrettable. “We are aware that Tamil Thaai Vazhthu is the State Song of Tamil Nadu. We wish to reiterate that, as a regulatory body, we respect the customs and practices followed in each region of the country," the central bank said. agencies||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/respect-customs-of-each-region-of-country-rbi/articleshow/89167387.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Residents block ECR as govt retrieves encroached land||CHENNAI: Traffic on a stretch of ECR was disrupted for about four hours on Thursday evening as 500 residents of Bethel Nagar at Injambakkam resorted to a flash road roko protesting against their eviction from the encroached parts of the marshland. The Chennai district administration had begun retrieval of 164 acres of wetland after the Madras high court had warned revenue and district officials of punishment for wilful disobedience of its order. The action began in the morning as revenue department officials started razing compound walls of vacant plots and erected boards warning of encroachment in more than 100 plots. This triggered tension in the locality where several residents have been on a relay protest for the past one week against the eviction. The residents, who had built houses that have electricity connections, wanted know to why the authorities had failed to act at the time of registration about two decades ago. About 5,000 people in Bethel Nagar would be affected by the eviction drive. With several protesters sitting on the road, vehicles coming from Puducherrry to Thiruvanmiyur were stranded for a couple of hours, while traffic towards Puducherry remained normal. With vehicles moving bumper-to-bumper near Thiruvanmiyur and Injambakkam, police diverted some vehicles near Sholinganallur junction.  Chennai collector Dr J Vijaya Rani said the area is a marshland and none of the plots has a patta. “We started off by disconnecting power supply for commercial establishments and placed warning boards in more than 100 vacant plots,” she said. The encroachments are scattered across 164 acres.  On January 24, the first bench of the Madras high court comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu had censured the revenue and district administration for failing to remove the encroachments and warned officials that they would be punished for wilful disobedience of its order. “We will put the officers behind the bars,” the bench observed. As the authorities sought three days time to show progress in the eviction proceedings, the court adjourned the hearing to January 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/residents-block-ecr-as-govt-retrieves-encroached-land/articleshow/89167390.cms||---

Chellammal, 55, of Kokkilmedu village boarded the MTC bus on route 515 (Tambaram to Mamallapuram) carrying a load of fish and crab. She sells the fish in Padappai, Tambaram, and Vandalur. The conductor, who entered the bus, asked her to alight immediately. When Chellammal said it was unfair on his part and that she would approach police, he started abusing her and forcibly got her to leave the bus. “He usually tells me to not enter the bus, but this time he abused me verbally. I pleaded with him about the fish going bad, but he did not listen,” she said. Noticing the commotion, a few passersby recorded the incident and shared it on social media. “Each time this conductor comes on duty, I suffer losses worth ₹4,000-₹5,000. I have to take the first bus to sell my fish early. He has no right to question us, but we continue to be on the receiving end. I can’t afford to take an auto every day,” Chellammal said, adding that action should be taken against the conductor. A senior transport official said that action would be initiated if the allegations against the conductor were found to be true.  It may be recalled that Selvamary, a fishmonger hailing from Kanyakumari, was forced to deboard the bus last month. Out of frustration, she had started screaming and crying out loud at the bus station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/elderly-fish-vendor-forced-off-mtc-bus-due-to-odour/articleshow/89167391.cms||---

There are cases where some of the houses in some streets are either left out or added to wards that are far away. People had sent petitions to the Tambaram corporation to rectify these anomalies soon after a map comprising zones and wards were published. The new corporation has around 70 wards as against the 200 wards under town panchayats and municipalities. M Govindarajan, president, Federation of Residents Welfare Associations of Tambaram, the local body is yet to announce in detail the streets and neighbourhoods that come under each zone or wards after feedback was given to the authorities following the delimitation. S Chandrasekhar, secretary, Chitlapakkam Anna Nagar West Residents Welfare Association, who submitted suggestions for changes regarding inclusion of streets in wards at the public hearing, said "They should have informed the details to the people who took part in the meeting. The notification shows details of houses and streets in wards but no intimation about the changes made as per the suggestions from the people."V Santhanam, a social activist, said, "It is welcome that an election is going to be held after many years.

The census, chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj said, is aimed at finding the number of species and the number of birds migrating to the state in winter. It will also be used to obtaining a baseline data on the approximate waterbird population in the state that can be used to compare the population trends during different years. This is the first time a census on wetland birds close to coastal areas including Pulicat in Tiruvallur district, Pallikaranai in Chennai and Kovalam creek in Chengalpet is being done. The guidelines for the census say there is no restriction in the number of teams of volunteers participating, with each team having 3-7 members. One member will note down the count and another will photograph congregation of birds and their diversity. There will be no additional time for photography as they have to cover a large area. The third team member will note down the coordinates, using GPS, at the start and end of each day. The first phase is for coastal wetlands and the second for inland terrestrial birds for which dates will be announced soon, Shekhar said.  A surveying team encountering a large flock will need to make an initial approximation quickly as the birds may anytime move to the next site. It will need to note the occurrence of different species, before taking the actual count.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/2-day-bird-survey-on-tn-coast-to-begin-today/articleshow/89167396.cms||P Oppili

One particular road costing ₹30 lakh was being laid at Natarajan Garden First Street, Second Street and Third Street at 1.30am on Wednesday.The contractor’s representative who was present at the site on the day told TOI that the MLA, accompanied by four other men, reached the spot and asked them to stop the work. When the assistant engineer of Greater Chennai Corporation intervened to resolve the issue, he was beaten by MLA K P Shankar and his accomplices. The engineer’s assistant was also beaten up. Thirteen lorries of road mix, kept ready at the site, were sent back by force.Scared and stressed out, the corporation assistant engineer went on leave on Thursday. “I was at the spot. The MLA was angry that the work was being carried out despite him informing the contractor not to do so. As soon as he reached the spot, he and his men beat up all of us. We didn’t know what to do and informed our senior officials. The MLA called me over phone later and apologized. He also agreed to allow the work,” he said.When asked about the incident, Thiruvottiyur MLA Shankar told TOI that he and his men didn’t beat up anyone. “It is true that my men visited the spot and stopped the work. That was because they did not do milling of the road. The road-laying process was not as per norms. Nothing else happened. I don’t know what happened between the contractor and some of my men. I was not there,” he said. He added that the allegations about the bribe and commissions were untrue.The regional deputy commissioner, North zone, M Sivaguru Prabhakaran told TOI that he was informed that there was an issue and an oral complaint was given to him. “I am not aware that our engineer was beaten up. I will conduct an inquiry and take appropriate action,” he said.A representative of the contractor-firm, when asked why he didn’t file a police complaint, said he was afraid that his future work prospects would be muddled and also that the corporation itself was silent on the issue. “Their employee was beaten so they should only file a complaint,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dmk-mla-aides-beat-up-corpn-engineer/articleshow/89167397.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: National Investigation Agency books five for funding Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam||CHENNAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has booked five persons for using fake documents to withdraw money for furthering the activities of the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). One among them was Letchumanan Mary Franciska, a 50-year-old woman, who was arrested from Chennai Airport last year for holding a fake Indian passport. Franciska, a Sri Lankan national, arrived in Chennai in December 2019 on a tourist visa, which was valid for one year. However, she stayed back in India citing Covid-19 spread, according to an FIR filed by Tamil Nadu police. She rented a home at Shakthi Colony in Anna Nagar by hiding her nationality. Franciska managed to get an LPG gas connection using the rent lease agreement, which is recognised as a valid address proof by most government agencies. Using this loophole, she got an Indian passport from the Chennai regional office and a voter ID. But the Chennai Immigration Bureau received a tipoff from one of its sources and arrested Franciska, when she attempted to take a flight to Bengaluru from Chennai. She was handed over to the Q-Branch of Crime Investigation Department (CID), Chennai city, in October 2021. Further investigation revealed that she was in touch with the then active cadres of the LTTE. Hence, the case was transferred to the NIA. Along with Franciska, four others came under the NIA's scanner — Kenniston Fernando, K Baskaran, Johnson Samuel and L Sellamuthu. According to an FIR filed by the NIA in January, the accused persons withdrew money from Indian Overseas Bank's Mumbai Fort branch to further the activities of the LTTE. Hence, they have been booked under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967, Passports Act of 1967 and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). This is the second case booked by the NIA with regard to LTTE's activities in the past 10 months. Last October, the NIA arrested Satkunam alias Sabesna, a former intelligence officer of the LTTE in connection with its probe on an arms smuggling racket. The NIA suspected that Sabesan could have played a crucial role in taking steps for the revival of the LTTE.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/nia-books-five-for-funding-ltte/articleshow/89167401.cms||Ram Sundaram

Rajesh and Elumazhai died at Tambaram on January 19. Dravida Kathiravan died at Thoraipakkam on January 15.In total, 55 manual scavengers have died in Tamil Nadu in the past three years, according to data compiled by Safai Karamchari Andolan, an NGO. D Velanganni Samuel, State Convenor of SKA, said more such deaths could have gone unreported.Manual Scavenging Prohibition Act 2013 outlaws manual scavenging, and it is an atrocity under SC/ST Act. Though more than 3,000 people had submitted declarations to the State government saying that they were engaged in manual scavenging, the government in 2018-19 enumerated only 264 as manual scavengers.If the government had verified and validated all these declarations, these 55 deaths could have been prevented, said Deepthi Sukumar, a core member of SKA. Even in cases in which FIRs are filed, the police have not submitted the chargesheets. Hence, the zero-conviction rate under these Acts continues in Tamil Nadu, she said.The government claims that compensation has been paid to the kin of all victims since 2013. However, Aadhi Lakshmi, who lost her husband in 2007, is still made to run from pillar to post to get 10 lakh compensation.K Nagamma, another widower, said, "No amount of money is equal to a lost life.

The valuation of the company is $100 million and TVS’ acquisition cost right now is $75 million in an all-cash deal done through TVS Motor’s Singapore subsidiary, TVS Motor (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The deal was funded through debt and internal accruals. TVS will acquire the remaining stake next year. This is the second European e-bike company that TVS has snapped up. Just four months ago, it bought 80% stake in another Swiss e-mobility company EGO Movement for $18 million. With this acquisition, the e-bike component of the company’s electric mobility business will go over $100 million by the end of this year.“The increasing global focus on the environment and personal well-being is rapidly accelerating demand for newer mobility solutions and TVS Motor is investing to drive this change,” said Venu Srinivasan, chairman, TVS Motor Company.

Through brands like Norton Motorcycles, EGO Movement and now SEMG apart from its electric-focussed partnership with BMW “TVS is planning a focused e-mobility play in industrialised markets,” he said. Europe is at the centre of the e-mobility market with Switzerland being on top of the e-bike game. The e-bikes segment is a $25 billion market globally and so TVS is focusing on global markets beyond India for the e-bikes business. However, the SEMG brands will be launched in India before the second half of the fiscal, said Venu. TVS, he said, will further invest to grow the SEMG business and expand the range with new products.With 20% share of the Swiss e-bike market, SEMG has a strong presence in Germany and Austria apart from Switzerland with brands like Cilo, Simpel, Allegro, and Zenith. It has an extensive network with two online platforms and 31 physical stores.Speaking on the occasion, Sir Ralf Speth, chairman designate, TVS Motor Company, said, “SEMG complements our acquisitions of Norton Motorcycles and EGO Movement.” For SEMG, having TVS as majority shareholder “offers untapped potential in quality assurance and procurement in the global supply chain, but also lays the foundation for future expansion beyond national borders,” said Rainer Fröhlich, founder and managing partner, Constellation Capital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tvs-acquires-75-in-swiss-e-mobility-grp/articleshow/89167408.cms||---

Both in terms of PM2.5 and PM10 pollution, Visakhapatnam is first and Hyderabad second among most major cities in south India. The report released on Thursday covers 10 cities in south India including Hyderabad in Telangana and Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam in AP. The report said while the annual PM10 levels in Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad exceeded the prescribed WHO guidelines of 15 micrograms per cubic metre by six to seven times, Vijayawada exceeded the limit by three to four times. The Greenpeace report said the high level of pollution despite relatively lower economic activity and vehicular emissions between November 20, 2020, and November 20, 2021, is a much-needed reminder that air pollution is a public health crisis that is not confined to cities only in north India. To arrive at the pollution levels, Greenpeace India analysed the air pollution data of the Central Pollution Control Board comparing it with that of the national ambient air quality index and WHO air quality guidelines. The cities studied apart from those in Telugu states are Bengaluru, Chennai, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Coimbatore, Kochi and Puducherry. Track the pollution level in your cityThe analysis showed that the pandemic-induced lockdowns and subsequent reduction in economic activities notwithstanding, the annual average values of PM2.5 and PM10 exceeded the WHO revised standards by several times. Vijayawada saw annual PM2.5 levels exceed the WHO guidelines of 5 micrograms per cubic metre by 6 to 7 times. On the other hand, the annual PM10 levels in Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad exceeded the prescribed WHO guidelines by 6 to 7 times. The Greenpeace report blamed the worsening air quality on fossil fuel powered infrastructural development, industries, transport, waste burning and construction. It warned that "long term exposure to air pollution increases the likelihood of asthma, low birth weight, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes, stroke, lung cancer and premature deaths". Avinash Chanchal, campaign manager of Greenpeace India, said lockdown is not a solution to air pollution. "Relatively lesser economic activity and vehicles are also putting us in a dangerous position," Avinash said. He said that past source apportionment studies by CPCB indicated that the main contributor of PM2.5 and PM10 in Hyderabad is vehicular pollution. It contributes around 50% of total pollution from all sources in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/vizag-hyd-pollution-hotspots-in-south/articleshow/89167421.cms||Syed Akbar

Of all the four districts, Dharwad had suffered maximum loss followed by Gadag, Haveri and Belagavi. As per preliminary estimates, crops worth Rs 300 crore were damaged in the region. The report says cotton and red chilli crops have suffered severe damage, followed by Bengal gram, maize, jowar and paddy. Cotton growers continue to face the brunt of rains as BT cotton grown in parts of Dharwad, Navalgund, Kundgol, Mulgund, Mundargi, Nargund taluks have lost golden yield. Bengal gram too has been lost in 40,000 hectares. In Athani, grape plantations in 500 hectare too have been damaged. Farmers rued that so far only a small percentage of farmers have received compensation while for nearly 95% of farmers, particularly in Gadag district, the relief has been elusive. In Dharwad district, Rs 74.4 crore compensation has been disbursed to 93,401 farmers who have incurred crop damage. This is thanks to the interest evinced by sugar and textile minister Shankar Patil Munenakopp who was the minister in-charge of Dharwad district. But the same enthusiasm is not seen from other ministers and legislators in Gadag district. Nearly 99% of farmers who suffered crop loss due to heavy rains in the district are yet to get compensation for kharif season 2021, said Somanagouda Patil of Ron taluk. “We lost agricultural crops like groundnut and maize and horticulture crops chilli and onion. The government has fixed compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare for agricultural crops. Revenue officials say they have done their job by uploading the information regarding the extent of loss suffered by farmers as per the recommendation of agriculture and horticulture officials. But till date, only 2% of farmers have received compensation and that too not more than Rs 500 each,” said Somanagouda. The situation is similar in other taluks of Gadag district. Farmers from Gadag, Mundargi, Shirahatti and Nargund taluks echoed the same complaint and blamed elected representatives for not bothering about farmers. “Our elected representatives, irrespective of their political affiliation, are busy fighting for their own cause and have neglected the electorate,” said Basanagouda of Itagi village in Ron taluk. Now, agriculture minister BC Patil has been appointed as district minister of Gadag and it is to be seen if he will come to rescue of farmers. The farmers, who had insured against crop loss, said the crop insurance has become a mirage as there is no one to listen to their woes. Allegations are loud that elected representatives are hand in glove with insurance companies and together they are cheating farmers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/gadag-farmers-continue-to-wait-for-crop-compensation/articleshow/89165733.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The exclusive society has already been registered and it will consist of a governing committee and an executive committee. The 13-member governing committee will have elected representatives, ministers and corporators and the district minister will be its chairman. The deputy commissioner is the chairman of the nine-member executive committee and representatives of government departments will be its members. HDSCL’s MD is its member secretary. Smart City officials decided to form the society to ensure proper maintenance and operations of the assets created and renewed under Smart City Project. They then began legal measures and then got the society registered a few days ago. HDSCL MD CW Shakeel Ahemad said, “Once the assets created and developed under SCP are thrown open for public use, it is very important to maintain and them operate properly for the desired period. We realised that there is a need of an exclusive society which can monitor them. If successful, our initiative will be followed everywhere. The assets created are maintained on perpetual basis from their own revenue.” “The Society will monitor MG Park, Tolankere, Nehru Stadium sports complex along with Bengeri shaniwar sante. The society will take appropriate decisions on the expenses for maintenance from the revenue generated,” he said. Mohan C, a social activist, appreciated the idea of forming an exclusive society to take care of the assets developed under Smart City Project. “It was a matter of concern on whether the projects developed under SCP will be maintained properly after a few years. HDSCL officials have formed the society for this purpose and we should wait to see how it works,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/society-registered-to-oversee-smart-city-projects-in-hubballi-dharwad/articleshow/89165657.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Business||Chandra likely to chair new AI board||Reeba Zachariah & Saurabh Sinha | TNN Mumbai/New Delhi: A new Air India (AI) board led by Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran will be formed soon even as several group executives from TCS, AirAsia India and Tata Steel are expected to move to the ailing carrier to revive operations. Chandrasekaran, who is awaiting security clearance from the Centre to lead the Air India board, will bring in an expat CEO to pilot the carrier. This will be his second expat CEO hire after German citizen Puneet Chhatwal for Taj hotels. Going by the Tata Group’s current board format, Ratan Tata is expected to be chairman emeritus of AI, which will mark his return to the carrier after years (Ratan Tata, who holds a pilot licence for fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, was the AI chairman in the mid-1980s). Since AI is a public company, rules require it to have a minimum of three and a maximum of 15 directors on its board, said shareholder advisory firm InGovern’s founder Shriram Subramanian. “Ideally, it should have a minimum of six directors for enough diversity.” AI until now had seven members on its board. On Thursday, two government nominee directors — S K Mishra and V A Patwardhan — and its chairman & MD Vikram Dev Dutt resigned from the board after the Tata Group formally took charge of AI from the Centre. AI was originally launched by former Tata Group chairman J R D Tata in 1932 as the nation’s first carrier, flying mail between Karachi and Bombay and, on Thursday, the conglomerate regained control of the carrier after nearly 70 years. AI’s four functional directors — Vinod Hejmadi (finance), R S Sandhu (operations), Meenakshi Mallik (commercial) and Amrita Sharan (personnel) —will continue on the board of the carrier. “Security clearance of directors chosen by the Tata Group will take time. And so, functional departments can’t be left headless,” said an official in the know of matters. Several Tata Group executives will be transferred to AI (with some being shifted to handle specific projects — they will have to return to their original employers after completion of the tasks), said a source. Already, many of them had worked on the due-diligence of AI before the conglomerate had put in its bid for the carrier. Chances are high that AI’s new chief technology/digital officer and the chief HR officer will be from TCS and Tata Steel, said the same person. TCS will be managing AI’s IT and digital operations. While, Tata Steel, which is the first Indian company to have an HR department in 1947, will handle issues relating to AI’s multiple unions. AI comes with a highly unionised workforce with a history of disrupting schedules for demands. Likewise, people from Tata Motors and TajSats will assist the carrier’s ground fleet and in-flight meal catering operations, the person said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chandra-likely-to-chair-new-ai-board/articleshow/89166132.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The company’s revenue from operations rose 3% to Rs 5,054, however, profits grew at a faster rate as net interest margin widened to 2.42% from 2.36%, following a decline in cost of funds. Total disbursements in the quarter stood at Rs 17,770 crore as against Rs 16,857 crore in the year-ago period, an increase of 5%. Out of this, disbursement in the individual home loan segment registered a growth of 6% to Rs 15,341 crore from Rs 14,511 crore, whereas project loans were Rs 293 crore as compared with Rs 852 crore for the same quarter in the previous year. At the end of the quarter, the individual loan portfolio stood at Rs 2,29,321 crore as against Rs 2,04,444 crore, a growth of 12%. Project loan portfolio stood at Rs 14,091 crore as of December 31, 2021, as against Rs 15,753 crore as of December 31, 2020. The total outstanding portfolio grew at 11% to Rs 2,43,412 crore from Rs 2,20,197 crore. Speaking to TOI, Y Viswanatha Gowd, MD & CEO, LIC Housing Finance, said, “We have seen good demand for home loans from tier-3 and -4 towns. We expect the demand for home loans to grow as there is a trend, even among young people, for asset-creation rather than paying rent.” Gowd said that he did not expect loans that were restructured during Covid to slip into non-performing assets (NPAs) as the loans were fully secured. “We have seen an improvement in our collection efficiency. Our recovery team is also able to do a good follow-up”. He added that he expected slippages to decline. “The gross NPAs will only improve going forward as the worst is behind us.” On growth targets, Gowd said that he was sure of achieving double-digit growth for the current year. “With the easing of the pandemic, it is expected that growth and asset quality will continue to improve,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cheaper-funds-boost-lic-hf-margins-lift-q3-profits-by-6/articleshow/89166073.cms||Mayur Shetty

Generali is the first player among international insurers to step-up to a majority stake in both its Indian insurance joint venture companies since the new foreign ownership cap came into effect. “With an expected double-digit annual growth rate, India’s insurance market offers considerable opportunities, and we look forward to deepening our presence in this geography, becoming lifetime partners to an increasing share of Indian customers,” said Jaime Anchustegui Melgarejo, CEO International, Generali Group. “FEL has received offers from potential buyers for its remaining 24.91% interest in FGIICL. It is also exploring options for the sale of its 33.3% interest in the life insurance JV and expects to complete the exit of its holding in the insurance joint ventures in a time-bound manner,” FEL said. It added that the funds would be used to meet its commitment under one-time restructuring plan for covid hit companies. In 2021 the government had increased FDI in insurance to 73% from 49%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/generali-1st-foreign-insurer-to-take-majority-stake-in-both-jvs/articleshow/89166110.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Ahmedabad||Nearly half of Dingucha village in Gujarat have migrated abroad||DINGUCHA (GANDHINAGAR): An NRI status is the mark of success in Dingucha – the last village in Gandhinagar district on the way to Mehsana. This is very clear the moment you step into the settlement: posters advertising ‘student’s visa to Canada and USA’ are visible anywhere you turn in the village, which recently gathered infamy after four of its residents froze to death while being smuggled from Canada into the US. Of its 7,000-strong population, nearly half are settled in countries like the US, the UK or Canada. According to the village panchayat records, 3,200 of its residents live abroad. Locals admit the village has two options for youngsters: either get a US citizenship or become an agent, gain expertise in international travel and turn into a tool of earning in Dingucha and other nearby villages. Kanu Patel, an agriculturist from the village, said that his parents, elder brother, sister-in-law along with their two kids settled in the US state of Pennsylvania around 6 years ago. “We have a population of around 7,000 and half of the people are either in the US, Canada or the UK. There are international travel agents in every lane of the village. They have links with bigger agents in Delhi, Mumbai as well as people in countries like the US and Canada.” Seeking anonymity, a resident, who works as an agent in Kalol, said his family visited the US about 10 years ago. “I understood the entire system and began helping the others to settle in the US. I later began working as an agent. I will continue working till I get enough money to settle abroad,” he said. Village talati Jayesh Chaudhary said that the moment a boy or girl passes primary school, s/he begins preparations to fly to the US or Canada. “Due to this desperation, half of the population is either in the US or Canada or even in Australia. The NRIs sometimes fly back here during winter. They contribute towards the development of the village,” said Chaudhary. Patel added, “The village seems deserted most of the time. However, it has the look of a developed city with pucca roads, two big schools, hospitals, community halls and banks. This has been possible because those who left for foreign shores have constantly contributed to the village’s development.” On being questioned about illegal immigration facilitated by agents, the talati said he was unaware of any such practice in the village. Village sarpanch Mathurji Thakor was not available for his comment on this issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/nearly-half-of-dingucha-village-in-guj-have-migrated-abroad/articleshow/89166096.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Keep 80% of health budget to strengthen primary health care and not on building tertiary care hospitals. Abandon insurance based healthcare delivery system as only private sector and insurance companies profit from it. Instead strengthen government health sector. Pandemic has shown that government health system is still the most reliable. Spend more to have more quality doctors, nurses and paramedics. Production of medical equipment and consumables should be promoted.Dr Ravi Wankhedkar | treasurer of world medical associationThe private healthcare sector is going through a very bad phase. Government is directly trying to cap per bed per day income even when investment and expenses are increasing exponentially. If government desires to cap the rates, there should be subsidy either in loan, land, building, direct and indirect taxation etc. Only those hospitals which take benefit of subsidy should be forced to provide healthcare at subsidised rates. At least 5% of GDP should be spent on healthcare.Dr Anoop Marar | convener of vidarbha hospitals associationIncrease expenditure on halthcare, which is very less even after the pandemic. More focus should be on strengthening small clinics in cities and villages, and on doctors serving in rural areas. Instead of spending on expensive, ultra modern equipment, ensure that basic goods and medicines are available at government facilities in rural as well as in urban areas. Private Doctors should get incentives to start services in rural and tribal areas to bridge the urban-rural doctor-patient ratio.Dr Sanjay Deotale | ima president, nagpurIn this pandemic, we felt shortage of diagnostic facilities in the country, especially RT-PCR testing and molecular and genetic testing labs. There should be increased allocation of funds to establish these facilities up to district places. Allocate more funds to train healthcare workers in using ventilators and likewise medical instruments. Also, increase allocation for research in vaccine manufacturing and epidemiology. Allocate funds to include genetic diseases like thalassemia and sickle cell under public insurance schemes.Dr Vinky Rughwani | vie-pesident of maharashtra mdical cuncilThere should be more tax deduction for pharmaceutical sector for in-house research and development of drugs. To prepare for future pandemic-like situations, focus on building production-linked incentive schemes for indigenous medical instrumentation production. Creation of separate directorate of pharmacyis pending since long for want of funds. Its creation will provide solution against shortage of drugs faced during the pandemic. Our pharma sector has potential to develop country as world’s pharma hub.Kailas Tandale | president of maharashtra practising pharmacists assnLast year’s budget was totally Covid driven. After second wave, this year’s budget too focuses on economic recovery, resilience and growth. India needs a renewed approach to gender-responsive budgeting. Free and compulsory cervical cancer vaccination for adolescents before age of 14 or before the first sexual act must be included in national immunization policy. Also, provide free cancer screening for vulnerable age groups. Impose a heavy tax on junk food items as it’s responsible for obesity, hypertension, PCOS etc. By focusing on women, the budget can play an instrumental role in building a more inclusive and sustainable economy.

While Dakshina Kannada has 5,325 active cases as on Wednesday, more than 4,000 are from Mangaluru taluk. Meanwhile, nearly 50% of the district’s active cases are reported in 60 wards of the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC). Since more than 2,500 active cases are in home isolation in the Mangaluru city limits, the city corporation has directed ward level nodal officers to be more vigilant. District surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh told TOI that the number of active cases is very less in Bantwal, Puttur, Belthangady and Sullia taluks, compared to Mangaluru. “We have a large number of cases in Mangaluru city, followed by rural areas in Mangaluru. More than 90% of the active cases in Dakshina Kannada are in home isolation, and Covid Care Centres, since a majority of the cases are asymptomatic,” he said. Since the majority of the active cases are in Mangaluru city, the MCC has taken up additional measures to check the spread of the virus. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that more cases are found in clusters in educational institutions in the city. “We have appointed nodal officers in all the 60 wards. Similarly, nodal officers are appointed in each of the 10 urban PHCs in the city. Those nodal officers have been given the responsibility of monitoring those who are undergoing treatment in home isolation, and for contact tracing. Officials from the MCC and health department have also been conducting door-to-door visits to identify unvaccinated people in the city. Nearly 50% of the unvaccinated people are in Mangaluru city. We have been no facing issues due to hesitancy from a section of beneficiaries. Initiatives are being taken to vaccinate all the people who are unvaccinated in the city,” Sridhar said.

With his arrest, the mystery of the character “Nepali”, who was the backup shooter in the Rohini Courts Complex shootout in which gangster Jitender Gogi was killed, has been solved. DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said the 31-year-old accused had a reward of Rs 50,000 on him. “Bhanja is involved in cases of murder, extortion and under MCOCA and Arms Act,” he added. He was being tracked by a team led by ACP Sanjay Dutt for the last several months. A manhunt was launched after he was found involved in Gogi’s murder in September 2021. The team got a tip-off that Bhanja would come to meet an associate in a Honda City car on Muzaffarnagar-Meerut Road. Cops spotted the car (registration number 0558) near a toll plaza on the intervening night of January 22 and 23. “When the team signalled the occupant to stop the car, he tried to take a U-turn. However, police vehicles blocked the path. The suspect tried to flee on foot, but was soon overpowered and nabbed,” said Yadav. During interrogation, Bhanja disclosed that he joined the Neeraj Bawania gang in 2011 as a sharpshooter. In 2014, Bawania and he shot dead their rival, Pradeep Dahiya, who had taken over the reins of Neetu Dabodia’s gang after his death in a police encounter. Gangster Sunil Rathi from Baghpat in UP had asked Bawania to get his deputy Amit Bhura released from police custody in 2014. Bhanja and others freed Bhura while he was going for a court appearance. After jumping parole, Bhanja remained in Nepal, so his associates began calling him Nepali. The investigation in the Rohini court shootout revealed that a third shooter was also present there as a backup. One of the accused arrested by cops told them about a Nepali shooter, but nobody could figure out who he was. NEW DELHIBhanja was planning to target rival gangster Ashok Pradhan, who is currently lodged in Bhondsi Jail, while being taken tocourt for hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gangster-who-jumped-parole-2-yrs-ago-held-had-key-role-in-rohini-shootout/articleshow/89166725.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||DK schools gear up for SSLC exam amidst pandemic||Mangaluru: Schools in Dakshina Kannada (DK) are gearing up for the SSLC examination, amidst the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. All the schools have completed their syllabus, which had been reduced by 80%, due to the pandemic. The state government said that the SSLC examination will be held as usual, like before the pandemic, without any relaxations. With this, schools in the district are now preparing for the examination with zeal, even though many students and teachers have Covid-19. Shamanth V M, nodal officer for the SSLC examination, DK district, told TOI that at the moment, all the schools in the district have completed their syllabus. DK is planning for an exclusive examination for SSLC students, with question papers framed by teachers. The examination is called a practice paper. It is formed with 80% of the syllabus, so that students are aware and prepared to face questions that appear in the final examination. The practice paper, which is a liberal examination to familiarise students on the current syllabus, will be held from Monday. The common preparatory examination held across the state is scheduled on February 21. School teachers in the district, fearing a lockdown being imposed and closure of schools that could hamper studies, had slogged to complete the syllabus well in advance. Shambhu Shankar, coordinator, block resource centre, Belthangady, said that though there are rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district, and many students and teachers have been infected by the SARS CoV-2 virus, it has not stopped the learning process in the schools. Schools are continuing as usual, except in institutions with five or more cases of Covid-19, that had to be shut down for a week. The only issue that schools face is chronic absenteeism. A department of public instruction official said that about 5% of SSLC students continue to remain absent from classes every day. The numbers are slightly high this time, since attendance was not strict due to the pandemic. “However, high school teachers are trying their best to trace these children and bring them to school,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-schools-gear-up-for-sslc-exam-amidst-pandemic/articleshow/89164903.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Skyroot takes that technical strength to the next level, with its innovative and cost-effective space launch capability, disrupting the status quo in the global launch market,” said Ram Shriram, one of the first investors and board members of Google, and billionaire founder of Sherpalo Ventures that invests in promising new disruptive technologies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/skyroot-raises-4-5m-led-by-google-investor-ram-shriram/articleshow/89167448.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Some appears to be mild, but at least five out of 10 are turning out to be Covid-19 cases,” said a senior health department official.Touching upon the recently carried out door-to-door fever survey at some places in Hyderabad, old city residents questioned why GHMC and health officials are not making similar fever surveys in the old city as well. The GHMC on the other hand said they many old city areas are known Omicron and Delta hotspots, so they decided to concentrate on other areas.“The government of Telangana undertake fever survey to figure out the number of cases related to Covid-19 variants at some places. But why not such initiatives are taken here to deal with viral fever, which is apparently spreading in several old city localities. The constant ignorance towards public health and lack of medical camps, awareness programme is only helping the infection to spread further,” Mohammed Khasim, a resident of Khilwat area.Another resident Abrar Pasha from Hussainialam told TOI that poor health infrastructure in public health centers has also become a matter of concern, which force them to visit private clinics.

---||Hyderabad||Reconsider hike in property registration charges, realty industry requests Telangana government||HYDERABAD: Amid a raging third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, representatives of the real estate industry, on Thursday, appealed to the state government of Telangana to defer its plan to increase property registration charges, expected to be rolled out on February 1. Reportedly, the Telangana government is mulling hiking registration charges – by 20% to 50% depending on the nature of the property – beginning next month. Earlier in July 2021, the state had revised the registration costs apart from increasing the stamp duty from 6% to 7.5%. “Two revisions within such a short span will be difficult to withstand, especially given the current Covid-19 situation. Also, with most realty-related offices being affected because of the third wave we have not been able to complete our pending transactions. We hope the government reconsiders its decision and puts it off for later,” said P Ramakrishna Rao, president, Credai – Hyderabad. “The fact that the cost of raw material, particularly steel, has shot up drastically, has only added to our worries,” he added. According to market estimates, steel has seen an over 5,000 per tonne increase in cost over the last one month. It’s current price: 65,000 per tonne (approx.) Rao’s concern was shared by members of the Telangana Real Estate Developers Association, who jointly made the appeal to the state. R Chalapathi Rao, president of the group said, “If this happens, within a matter of months the market value of properties will see an increase of almost 100%. How is this fair to the industry or the customers?” He added, “We would not have objected to the increase in registration charges if the government had not revised all other fees – like stamp duty and NALA (land conversion tax) – as well. This, with the UDS menace, Covid-19 impact and higher raw material values, is going to hit the sector hard.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/reconsider-hike-in-charges-realty-industry-requests-t/articleshow/89167451.cms||---

Social media was abuzz this Republic Day with the national anthem of the provisional government of Azad Hind. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who founded the INA, declared on October 21, 1943, the formation of the provisional government of free India. The national anthem of the INA government in exile, ‘Shubh Sukh Chain’, was the Hindustani translation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s ‘Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata’ written in Bangla. Incidentally, Jana Gana Mana, the Hindi translation of Bharoto Bhagya Bidhata was adopted as India’s national anthem post-Independence. The Hindustani version was translated by Hyderabad’s Abid Hasan Safrani. Interestingly, both Hindustani and Hindi versions of Tagore’s rendition are set to the same tune. Tagore also wrote his English version of Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata when he was in AP’s Madanapalle. The Hindustani version went viral on social media on the Republic Day. But what many did not know was its connection with Hyderabad. According to city historian and heritage expert Amarbir Singh, the task of translation was entrusted in1943 to INA officer Safrani, who was also a scholar of Urdu and Persian poetry. Safrani was one of the four INA officers to be inducted in the Indian Foreign Service after Independence and he served in Denmark and Egypt. “Safrani was born in Hyderabad in 1911, the same year Jana Gana Mana was penned by Tagore. His translation was titled ‘Shubh Sukh Chain’ with the first line reading ‘Shubh Sukh Chain ki Barkha Barse, Bharat Bhaag Hai Jaaga’ (rains of auspicious happiness fall, India has awakened,” Amarbir told TOI. He said during a visit to the Woods National College in Madanapalle (now Besant Theosophical College), an English version of the same was also penned by Tagore in 1919 and named ‘The Morning Song of India.’ According to Amarbir, Jana Gana Mana in its original form, Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata, was first sung by the great bard himself on December 27, 1911, at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. “The Hindi version of the first stanza of this epic poem was adopted as the national anthem of India by the constituent assembly headed by Dr Rajendra Prasad on January 24, 1950, just two days before India became a republic,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/tagores-anthem-and-the-hyderabadi-touch/articleshow/89167453.cms||Syed Akbar

As the state witnesses an average of 3,000 to 5,000 daily Covid cases, Gandhi Hospital has been flooded with a significant number of patients waiting at their outpatient department (OPD) and a gradual surge in patients being admitted for contracting the virus. Currently, a total of 167 patients are receiving treatment for the virus in the hospital out of which 155 of them are found to be with the Omicron variant. Doctors exude confidence that the majority of them have mild symptoms but got admitted due to comorbidities and are kept under observation. Officials said that they set up 600 beds equipped with oxygen support after anticipating the third wave after New Year. Out of these beds, 74 of them are occupied by Covid patients while the majority of them are non-Covid patients.

Installed in the first week of December last year, the boxes are still empty. One box is for the SCB CEO and the other for the president of cantonment board.The boxes meant to be opened every week have so far failed to yield anything even after almost two months, rue officials. The SCB is perhaps the first among the 62 cantonment boards to have installed complaint boxes. There are two boxes in SCB office and five in each circle office. Officials had launched it hoping that people would be filling up the boxes with the usual grievances on civic issues and corruption related to key wings including engineering, water supply, health and sanitation, and taxes. However, the initiative by SCB president Brigadier Abhijit Chandra has failed to enthuse residents. SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy told TOI that the effort has not resulted in what the officials had expected in terms of response. With boxes lying empty, officials would soon take a decision on continuing the initiative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-takers-for-scb-complaint-boxes/articleshow/89167457.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Swachh auto tippers to collect garbage from SCB residents||Secunderabad: Taking a cue from their counterparts in GHMC, domestic waste disposal will now become easy in the Secunderabad Cantonment as well. Smart tippers will come and procure waste from the doorsteps. With an aim to make Secunderabad Cantonment free from garbage, authorities launched a new fleet of 15 ‘swachh auto tippers’ (SATs) on Thursday, at the Cantonment playground. As a pilot project, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board officials have chosen Bowenpally in SCB ward no-I and will extend it to the remaining SCB wards in a phased manner. “Out of 15 SATs, 14 will be utilized for the domestic sector and one for the commercial sector,” SCB senior superintendent, M Devender told TOI. “We have asked the households in Bowenpally (circle-I) to buy two bins – one bin for wet waste and second one for dry waste. The garbage collector will visit the house and collect two bins and dump them in two separate chambers at the SAT vehicle. For this, the household need not pay money,” the SCB official added.The collected waste would be transported through these SATs to the garbage transit point at Trimulgherry. The waste collection will start at 6.30 am daily and will continue up to 3 pm. “ In the newly-launched system, distance to be travelled by SAT drivers will be reduced and thereby the collection efficiency in those respective areas will increase,” said Devender. Many RWAs have promised to make their localities free from garbage,” said J Maheshwar Reddy, SCB former member.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/swachh-auto-tippers-to-collect-garbage-from-scb-residents/articleshow/89167459.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: K Chandrasekhar Rao to galvanise cadre for 2023 polls||HYDERABAD: TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao has shifted his focus onto party affairs with an intention to retain power in 2023 assembly elections. Sources said though the party is organisationally strong when compared to other parties, KCR wants to strengthen the party further. Wednesday’s appointment of party chiefs for all 33 districts by KCR was a step in that direction, sources said. KCR is also likely to announce the party state committee in a week’s time. KCR, in fact, started the preparations for the next elections by rolling out schemes like Dalit Bandhu and reduction of pension age from 60 years to 57 years, etc. With political climate in the state heating up and both opposition parties, BJP and Congress, also joining the rat race, KCR felt time has come for strengthening the party from the grassroots level — in villages — as party workers need to take the government welfare schemes and programmes to the people’s doorstep. “Our party president will focus on party affairs along with the administration for the next two months, including touring districts, appointing the state committee, holding meetings with district presidents and MLAs for greater coordination and training important workers to take the schemes to the people’s notice,” a party general secretary said. The TRS, which completed two decades of its formation, conducted the party plenary in October2020. Before that, it had completed the membership drive and appointment of mandal and municipal-level committees. KCR was supposed to go on district tours for inauguration of party offices at the district headquarters. But, it got delayed due to his Delhi tours and the pandemic. He is expected to begin his district tours from February first week. “Party workers’ training programme will be conducted after March. This is mainly to train the party workers to take the schemes to people’s doorstep,” a newly-elected party president from north Telangana said. Party working president KT Rama Rao had already announced that they would study the organisational structure of the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu. The party is planning to send a delegation to TN to meet DMK leaders in the next couple of months. The pink party also has plans to hold a public meeting, which was supposed to be conducted in November. It got postponed due to Covid-19 and model code because of MLC elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kcr-to-galvanise-cadre-for-2023-polls/articleshow/89167460.cms||Koride Mahesh

Deputy municipal commissioner (SWM) Dr Gajendra Mahalle said that of the 1,100MT garbage generated in the city per day, AG Enviro and BVG India are now dumping around 548.28MT of wet waste and 194.26MT of dry waste. “Only 138.57MT of mixed waste was dumped on January 23,” Dr Mahalle said. NMC has disallowed vehicles of both the firms to dump mixed garbage in Bhandewadi and have issued an ultimatum to this effect, Dr Mahalle added. Sources from Bhandewadi dumping yard told TOI that on January 23, SWM department had refused to allow loaded trucks with over 200MT of mixed garbage. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had given an ultimatum to both the firms last year to lift only segregated waste from source from December 15 onwards. However, both the firms had failed as they did not get any cooperation from the citizens at large. As per the data obtained from SWM department, BVG India has improved its collection of segregated waste more, as compared to AG Enviro. BVG India has dumped around 250.84MT of wet waste and 125.02MT of dry waste in Bhandewadi yard. It is collecting 100% segregated waste from Gandhibagh zone, the data of January 23 revealed. Many residents from the Nehru Nagar zone were still handing over mixed garbage to ‘Swachhata Doots’ of AG Enviro, the report of the department said. Of the 14 mixed trips, six were from the Nehru Nagar zone. Of the total garbage of 534.92MT collected through door-to-door collection, AG Enviro has dumped 297.44MT wet waste, 69.24MT dry waste and 97.85MT mixed garbage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/post-nmc-warning-70-segregated-garbage-being-dumped-at-bhandewadi/articleshow/89166284.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Dehradun||Be passionate, don’t lose focus: 3 Padma recipients from U’khand||Dehradun: On the eve of Republic Day, names of three women from the hill state -- artist and folk singer Madhuri Barthwal, 69, environmentalist Basanti Devi, 66, and hockey player Vandana Katariya, 30 – were announced for Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award of the country. While Madhuri was born in Pauri Garhwal and later went on to become a music teacher, Basanti hails from Pithoragarh and Vandana Haridwar. The trio rose to prominence due to their sheer dedication and discipline throughout their professional lives. Speaking to TOI, they stressed the need to follow one's passion and not to lose focus. Barthwal is the first woman to be a music composer in All India Radio and the first female Garhwali musician, who became a music teacher. Music was in her blood as her father was also a singer. Madhuri Barthwal, the folk singer, expressed happiness for conferment of this prestigious award. She said, “Today, all my hard work and efforts to conserve traditional Uttarakhandi songs have borne fruit.” While Basanti Devi, who spent her entire life at Laxmi Ashram, a Gandhian ashram for young girls in Kausani, Almora, is known for the works she did as a member of the ashram. At a very young age, she lost her husband. It was Basanti’s father who brought her to the ashram, where she got the real-life exposure and learnt about nature and environment conservation. She participated in various environment conservation drives. An Indian field hockey player and first Indian woman to score a hat-trick at the Olympics, Vandana Katariya is also the brand ambassador of department of women empowerment and child development of Uttarakhand state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/be-passionate-dont-lose-focus-3-padma-recipients-from-ukhand/articleshow/89165778.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Goa||On Goa’s lateritic plateaus, researchers discover a new species of flowering plant||Old Goa: For a long time now, environmentalists have been calling for preservation of plateaus in Goa for their relatively uncelebrated biodiversity. Now, there’s proof of the richness of the biodiversity on plateaus, as researchers have discovered a new flowering plant species in the state. Eriocaulon goaense, a new species of the family Eriocaulaceae, has been found on Goa’s lateritic plateaus by Rutuja Kolte (Prabhukhanolkar), Indu Yadav and M K Janarthanam of Goa University’s department of botany. Phytotaxa, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, details that the Eriocaulon goaense plant is found in lateritic plateaus of Goa and differs from earlier known plants in the family. It is different in its floral bracts (modified leaf associated with a flower), sepals and petals of female flowers. Eriocaulon goaense has so far been found in shallow seasonal ponds of low-lying lateritic plateaus in the state. As of now, the researchers have found its distribution at the Goa University campus, on the Socorro plateau, at the IIT campus at Farmagudi and at Loliem. “Eriocaulon goaense is a habitat-specific species, which can only be found during rainy seasons. Nevertheless, more research needs to be done to understand its ecological significance, its uses, its role in the environment, etc. Currently, the only threat to this species is habitat destruction caused by development,” said Kolte. She said that the lateritic plateaus of the state are a rich source of endemic biodiversity, yet remain largely unexplored. “People often have the misconception that lateritic plateaus are barren land, but, in fact, many new species have been found on the plateaus. In habitats where many species have been noted to have narrow distributional range, it is important to preserve them,” she said. This species, she said, was collected by Indu Yadav, a student at the department of botany at GU in 2010. She had noted its uniqueness but she was unable to carry out further research. “I was later able to find it in 2017-18, and it took us 3-4 years to finish detailed work and publish it,” said Kolte, who is currently a lecturer in the PG department of botany at Govindram Seksaria Science College in Belagavi. She began working on her PhD in 2015, under the guidance of Janarthanam at Goa University. Kolte has previously discovered two new species from the flowering part group — Canscora shrirangiana (Gentianaceae family) and Cuscuta janarthanamii (Convolvulaceae family). Both these species are endemic and found on lateritic plateaus of Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/on-goas-lateritic-plateaus-researchers-discover-a-new-species-of-flowering-plant/articleshow/89188726.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS & BJP in letter war, exchange over 12 in 2 mths||Hyderabad: An ongoing letter war just about sums up the growing friction between the ruling TRS and BJP in the state and also strained relations between the state government and the Centre. More than a dozen letters have been exchanged between the pink and saffron parties in just last two months. The letters dashed off by the TRS and BJP pertained to a range of issues like paddy procurement, fertiliser prices, pending projects and poor budget allocations. Ever since the Centre had refused to enhance the quota of procurement of boiled rice from Telangana, the TRS government had gone on the offensive. Chief minister and TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao first wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi to fix the target for paddy procurement for the rabi season. Later, he wrote another strongly-worded letter on the proposed hike in fertiliser prices and on Monday, he wrote another letter opposing the proposed amendment to the AIS cadre service rules. Finance minister T Harish Rao had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking release of pending grants from the Centre on IGST arrears, backward areas development funds and Finance Commission funds. State Planning Board vice-chairman Vinod Kumar also wrote letters to the Centre, alleging that the Centre was doing injustice to India’s youngest state in awarding new railway projects and also in completing the existing projects.Countering Vinod’s allegations, Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy said the railway projects were delayed as the state government was not releasing its share from the funds and also not providing land. Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar too had written open letters to KCR on issues like GO 317 on transfer of teachers and government employees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-bjp-in-letter-war-exchange-over-12-in-2-mths/articleshow/89167461.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||UP poll results to alter political equations in Telangana||HYDERABAD: All eyes are on elections to Uttar Pradesh state assembly as it has the potential to change the political equations in Telangana. Political observers said performance of BJP in UP is likely to have an impact on growth of saffron party in Telangana. They said the steam with which the BJP is going against the ruling TRS in Telangana will slow down if the party does not perform well in UP. In case BJP romps home with a huge majority in UP, the central leadership of the party will shift its focus on Telangana and there would be no stopping saffron party from consolidating its ground in the state and polarising voters in the run-up to 2023 Telangana assembly polls, analysts said. Political analyst professor K Nageshwar said there is a scope for the UP election result having an impact on political mood in Telangana. Even the strategy of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao against BJP and Congress will change based on UP poll results, observers said. Congress is hoping to get a fresh lease of life as likely exodus of its leaders to BJP will stop or slow down if the saffron party fails to put up an impressive show. BJP MLA M Raghunandan Rao said party will storm back to power with a huge majority in UP. AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan admitted that outcome of UP polls may have a bearing on Telangana but saffron party’s dreams of replacing Congress as an alternative to TRS will not happen as Congress has scope of emerging a winner in UP due to interventions made by Priyanka Gandhi against the misrule of the BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/up-poll-results-to-alter-political-equations-in-t/articleshow/89167462.cms||Roushan Ali

Following the dismissal of their pleas for a stay on the summons, they preferred an appeal against the dismissal order. But in the meantime, they appeared before the ED authorities who issued them summons under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Their statements too were recorded. But the appeal they had preferred was pending before the court. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili which took up the case said that nothing remained in these pleas to be adjudicated as the two had already appeared before the ED and their statements too were recorded. The bench conveyed its intent to close the pleas. However, N Naveen Kumar, counsel for the Dalmias, urged the bench to grant them some time to enable a senior counsel to put forward their case. The bench wondered whether anything remained to be heard. “You challenged the summons but later appeared before the ED. Nothing remained here,” the bench said. Naveen said the ED has not yet filed its chargesheet in the case and his clients were not made accused in the ED’s money laundering case till now. The bench, however, made it clear that it cannot expand the scope of this petition that way and closed the pleas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-closes-2-pleas-of-dalmia-cements/articleshow/89167463.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The three accused are Karusala Venkat Subba Rao, Tejesh K Kodali and Kadiyala Venkateswara Rao. Tejesh was earlier arrested by the FBI in the US for his role in an immigration fraud. The ED initiated investigation on the basis of information received from the office of development commissioner, Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone, that 3K Technologies had reported abnormal exports. The ED investigation revealed that 3K Technologies had transferred foreign exchange to the tune of Rs 5.2 crore to 3K Technologies Inc. in the US in 2010 under the guise of overseas direct investment (ODI). 3K Technologies Inc., US, was incorporated in 2007 and Tejesh served as director of the US company. It is learnt that 3K Technologies Inc. was dissolved on January 28, 2011, within three months after receipt of the final ODI tranche.No shares were issued by the US company and no annual reports were filed with the Reserve Bank of India. After transfer of the funds, Subba Rao, Tejesh and Venkateswara Rao left India and resided in the US and did not respond to the summons of the ED.The ED said Rs 5.2 crore was still being held outside India in contravention of section 4 of FEMA. It was gathered that Tejash started working in the US. A news article reported arrest of Tejesh by FBI sleuths in New Jersey for orchestrating an immigration fraud. He was fraudulently maintaining immigration status and obtaining work authorisations for foreign clients through a bogus ‘pay to stay’ in a New Jersey college.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-seizes-trios-assets-under-fema/articleshow/89167464.cms||---

ED probe has revealed that fund trail investigation has shown that the borrowed funds were transferred to other group companies, particularly to Karvy Realty (India) Limited and to the shell companies floated by the group. The PMLA special court MSJ Hyderabad had remanded Parthasarathy and CFO of Karvy group G Krishna Hari to four days of ED custody from January 27 to 30. The ED arrested Parthasarathy and Hari under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act recently. The accused allegedly pledged securities with banks and NBFCs for seeking loans and defaulted on loan repayment. The ED booked a money laundering case based on an FIR filed by HDFC Bank with CCS Hyderabad police. “We have uncovered the complex web of transactions designed by the senior management of the Karvy group to misuse the securities of their clients and to raise loans fraudulently. The accused routed the money to multiple companies and diverted it. The shares of clients who did not owe any funds to Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) were also transferred to the margin or pool account and were pledged with the banks and NBFCs. A power of attorney given by clients to KSBL to facilitate exchange settlements was grossly misused on the directions of the Karvy CMD and senior executives,” alleged ED. It named Parthasarathy and Hari as the main conspirators who gave instructions to others. The ED probe also found that KSBL availed loans from NBFCs to the tune of Rs 400 crore in the name of five shell companies by pledging shares of clients of KSBL after illegally transferring these shares to their account. The fraudulently availed loans were used to clear pending loans of related companies and do massive stock transactions which have allegedly turned into complete losses, it said. The money was also diverted to personally held family companies. The ED had earlier frozen shareholding of Parthasarathy worth around Rs 700 crore. The ED is also investigating the money trail to trace the proceeds of crime which is close to Rs 2,000 crore. Parthasarathy and Hari were lodged in Central Jail, Bengaluru, and on a production warrant of ED court, they were produced before the PMLA court here. The ED has also recorded statement of senior employees of Karvy group and conducted searches at nine locations in September last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-grills-karvy-cmd-over-fund-diversion-14-shell-cos/articleshow/89167469.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||USFDA raps Aurobindo Pharma for lapses at API unit in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The US drug regulator, US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA), has issued a warning letter to Hyderabad-based pharma major Aurobindo Pharma for significant violations of current good manufacturing practices (CGMP). The violations were found at unit-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) manufacturing facility at Doultabad in Telangana. The warning letter pertains to the USFDA inspection from August 2 to 12, 2021. “Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 USC 351(a)(2)(B),” the letter said. Pointing out that its inspectors had found repeat CGMP deviations at the facility, the US regulator warned that if Aurobindo does not correct the deviations, it may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing the company as a drug manufacturer until deviations are addressed. “In a previous regulatory meeting held July 29, 2019, FDA cited similar CGMP deviations. You proposed specific remediation for these deviations in your response. Repeated failures demonstrate that executive management oversight and control over the manufacture of drugs is inadequate,” the letter said.  USFDA rapped the company for its failure to evaluate the potential effect that changes (like increasing the acceptable limit in the API starting material) may have on the quality of its intermediates and API. The warning letter slammed the company for the failure of its quality unit to ensure critical deviations from CGMP are investigated and resolved. The regulator said the company was responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any deviations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of deviations and recommended engaging a qualified consultant to evaluate the plant’s operations and assist in meeting the unit’s CGMP requirements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/usfda-raps-aurobindo-for-lapses-at-api-unit-in-t/articleshow/89167476.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Crooks used ‘hi-tech tools’ to hack Mahesh bank server||HYDERABAD: Cyber fraudsters who siphoned off 12 crore from AP Mahesh Co-Operative Urban Bank have used sophisticated hacking tools and even compromised the cell phone security of three account holders, believe investigators. Of the three account holders, police managed to lay their hands on one customer, Vinod Kumar, who claimed he was unaware the fraudsters used his bank account as a launchpad to transfer siphoned off funds to multiple bank accounts across the country. The investigators now believe that the fraudsters who gained access to the server of the bank strategically on a non-working day, have somehow managed to gain access to the three customer accounts. “In The Telangana State Cooperative Apex Bank Limited (TSCAB) hacking case, the Nigerian fraudsters lured three account holders to provide their bank account access details for money transfer through IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) channel by offering commission. In this case so far, the customer collusion has not come forth and if so, we suspect that the fraudsters might have somehow managed to compromise the mobile phones of the customers and gained access to their online banking accounts,” said a police officer.  In TSCAB case, the fraudsters executed the money transfer scheme on non-working days and managed to withdraw most of the money before the bank officials realized about the fraud. Meanwhile, Hyderabad CP CV Anand said that it is the responsibility of the banks to provide adequate cyber security and if any violation is noticed in that regard, appropriate legal action will be taken against those concerned. Talking about the fraud, Anand said that there is some progress in the investigation. “From the stolen amount, we have managed to freeze about 3 crore in various banks. We are verifying whether the hacking originated in Delhi or some other place abroad. We have observed negligence from banks also. When they are providing online banking services they have to also provide adequate cyber security. We are going to call a meeting with bankers and let them know about this in writing. They are doing business with public money and it is their responsibility to safeguard public money by providing adequate cyber security. Otherwise we have to take legal action against them too,” the police commissioner said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/crooks-used-hi-tech-tools-to-hack-mahesh-bank-server/articleshow/89167478.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Kolkata||Trinamool Congress likely to move motion in Rajya Sabha against Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar||KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress is likely to move a motion in the Rajya Sabha against Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in the coming budget session. The move may not yield any result — the Trinamool has only 13 MPs in the Rajya Sabha — but party seniors say they want the issue of “Raj Bhavan behaving like BJP headquarters” to be discussed nationally. The party will also strongly oppose any proposed amendment to all-India service rules. Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray proposed on Thursday that the party bring a “substantive motion” against the governor in Parliament. This specific motion allowed an issue to be formally debated in the Rajya Sabha and also had a provision for being put to vote, Trinamool seniors said. Ray’s proposal came during a hybrid meet convened by party chief and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday. If the Trinamool goes ahead with its decision, it would be only the second time in the last several decades that a Bengal governor has faced such a move. CPI Rajya Sabha MP Bhupesh Gupta had brought a similar motion against then governor Dharma Vira after the political turmoil over the dismissal of the Ajoy Mukherjee-led United Front government in 1967. Dhankhar assumed charge in Raj Bhavan in July 2019. He has had a rocky relationship with the Trinamool government, repeatedly accusing it of “misrule”; and the Trinamool has constantly accused him of behaving more like a BJP leader than a governor. Trinamool Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said the “governor’s needless meddling” had reached dangerous proportions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-likely-to-move-motion-in-rs-against-guv-dhankhar/articleshow/89167481.cms||---

The Vikas Bhavan building has emerged as the biggest cluster among the government offices. It started with two index cases in Vikas Bhavan building on January 10 and in the next two weeks random scattered distribution was reported in the building with various directorates reporting 10 to 30 cases each. Agriculture directorate and college education directorate have reported 35 cases each while economics and statistics department have so far reported 27 cases. Unlike the first two weeks, other institution clusters are outnumbering health care clusters and educational clusters. The district now has 72 active clusters of which 55% has been reported from other institutions; mostly government offices. About 30 clusters have so far been contained in the district. Even while clusters have been decreasing among schools and colleges, the rapid pace of virus spread in schools has been alarming. Cotton Hill Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Vazhuthacaud, had seven index cases on January 13. Till date, the cumulative cases from the school are 121 of which 100 cases are categorised as active. Despite stringent directions issued to staff of the government offices, clusters are being reported from many workplaces. Forest headquarters, Vazhuthacaud, has reported 78 cases so far with cases being reported from divisional forest office, administration wing, and fair copy and development wing. Central prison here has been another major cluster with 234 cases. Regional Institute of Ophthalmology is the new active cluster in the health sector. About 63 cases are active here which include nine students and 54 staff. The government central press at Thampanoor has also reported 40 active cases so far. Officials said that the spike in the number of clusters in government offices is a clear indication of breach of protocol and the community spread is also a reason. “Even if some staff are not symptomatic, there are chances that they happen to be primary contact in many families with one or more positive cases. They continue to report for work because they may not be symptomatic. This may lead to spread of infection,” an official said. Care home and old age homes are also reporting clusters in the city. About 11 cases have been reported from Sree Chithra poor home and the destitute home at Kalladimugham has reported 22 cases. The destitute home has a total of 43 inmates and 18 staff. The police force has also been badly hit. In addition to clusters at Museum, Poonthura and Karamana stations, clusters have been reported from SAP camp, AR camp and Traffic enforcement unit. The total cases reported at SAP camp, Peroorkada, so far are 92. Nine index cases were confirmed on January 15. Many of those who returned after Sabarimala duty had tested positive. As per the cluster report, they stayed in the camp and others got infected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/total-covid-clusters-in-the-district-now-crosses-100/articleshow/89165788.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||---||In a first, BJP fields 12 Catholic candidates for Goa 2022 polls||PANAJI: BJP, which is contesting all 40 seats for the first time in Goa, has fielded 12 candidates, or 30%, from the Catholic community. This is double the number it had fielded ten years ago in the 2012 election, when all six Catholic candidates emerged victorious. In the 2017 election, it fielded seven Catholics, all of whom became MLAs. The party has 3.5 lakh members in the state, 18% of whom are Christian. While Hindus comprise over 66% of Goa’s population, the state has around 25% Christians and 8% Muslims, among others. “BJP is not a communal party. We want to give representation to all sections of society, and accordingly, we have given candidature to 12 members from the minority community,” BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade told TOI. BJP, however, has not fielded any candidate from the Muslim community. BJP’s strategy of fielding Catholics started in 2012, when former chief minister and BJP’s master strategist Manohar Parrikar had devised the strategy of ‘Mission Salcete’, by supporting independents and non-Congress candidates in the taluka’s constituencies, trading it off with their support for forming a BJP-led government. That year, its Catholic candidates in Aldona, Mapusa, Calangute, Cortalim, Vasco and Curchorem all won. In the next election too, in 2017, seven seats were won by Catholic BJP candidates. Former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza was the party face among the community, and had convinced many Catholics to join BJP to contest the assembly election. Parrikar and D’Souza died around a month apart in 2019. Now, for the 2022 election, chief minister Pramod Sawant said, “There is no need for any Mission Salcete this time”. Political observer Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said that BJP has not given tickets based on the religion of the candidates, but it’s the circumstances which have forced the party to give 12 tickets to candidates from the Catholic community. “BJP is a cadre-based party and the karyakartas normally accept the party line. In a situation like that, a minority candidate with substantial following is a winnable candidate even for BJP,” he said. BJP’s Catholic candidates for the February 14 election are Glen Ticlo (Aldona), Joshua D’Souza (Mapusa), Joseph Sequeira (Calangute), Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate (Panaji), Jennifer Monserrate (Taleigao), Antonio Fernandes (Santa Cruz), Francisco Silveira (St Andre), Mauvin Godinho (Dabolim), Clafasio Dias (Cuncolim), Savio Rodrigues (Velim), Nilesh Cabral (Curchorem) and Anthony Barbosa (Curtorim). After ten Congress MLAs joined BJP in 2019, the number of Catholic MLAs in BJP increased to 15, which was more than half the total number of MLAs. On the eve of the assembly election, five Catholic MLAs quit BJP and joined various other parties. Former ministers Michael Lobo and Filipe Nery Rodrigues joined Congress and NCP respectively, while former MLA Alina Saldanha joined AAP.  Former Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida joined Congress and former Nuvem MLA Wilfried D’Sa has decided to contest as an independent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/in-a-first-bjp-fields-12-catholic-candidates-for-2022-polls/articleshow/89196910.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee cracks the whip on motormouths||KOLKATA: In the backdrop of several party leaders stirring controversy with public statements, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday made it clear she would devote more time to the party organisation in Bengal. Banerjee was quoted as saying to her party MPs: “I have a lot of work. But from now, I also have to look after some organisational work. If you face any problem, please contact me.” The CM also asked party MPs to consult Sudip Bandyopadhyay and party MLAs to consult Partha Chatterjee and Subrata Bakshi for any party-related matters. According to sources, Banerjee urged leaders not to speak on any party-related issue or against any party leader in public. Banerjee also made her displeasure clear to the party’s Arambagh MP, Aparoopa Poddar, for speaking out against MP Kalyan Banerjee even after Chatterjee, the party secretary-general, urged leaders to stop issuing public statements. Chatterjee had intervened after Kalyan openly questioned party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, prompting strong reactions first from Kunal Ghosh, later from Poddar and Madan Mitra. Banerjee’s statement also comes ahead of the February 2 party polls, which is likely to reappoint her as the party chairperson. The party will also have to finalise all its committees by March 31. The organisation polls come amid ongoing intra-party discussions on the one-person-one-post formula, which may lead to senior leaders holding multiple posts leaving some to pave way for new inductees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mamata-cracks-the-whip-on-motormouths/articleshow/89167484.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Realty sector seeks tax ease in Budget||Kolkata: The real estate sector is urging the Centre to provide an economic booster so that it can grow and generate employment. The president of Credai, West Bengal, Sushil Mohta, said that home purchase is currently on the priority list of many people. “While banking institutions have made the deal sweeter by reducing home loan interest rates, a few more incentives in the budget could make the deal irresistible and ensure faster recovery of the sector. As of now, the interest rates on home loans are in the range of 6.5-7% per year. However, this benefit is not passed on to the buyers who are looking to avail a loan of over Rs 30 lakh, as they cannot claim deduction against the entire interest paid in the initial years due to a cap of Rs 2 lakh per annum against interest rate deduction under Section 24(b) of the Act. We request the government to enhance the tax rebate on housing loan from to Rs 5 lakh as this could trigger healthier demand for housing,” he said. Mohta also feels that long-term capital gain tax on sale of house property should be charged at 10%, and individual tax should be rationalised at 25%. Ketan Sengupta, CEO of Bengal Peerless Housing Development Co, said: “The current situation calls for additional funds to be provided to the sector in order to create pathways for successful delivery of projects. The government can introduce a separate section under 80C for the deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh from home loan principal repayments. To increase demand, exemption on interest of housing loan to be increased under section 24(B) of budget.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/realty-sector-seeks-tax-ease-in-budget/articleshow/89167485.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Now, BJP’s Kolkata unit gets a jolt, no respite in districts||KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP cracking the whip on two former state vice-presidents has hardly been able to stem the rising dissent within its party ranks. BJP old guard Sunita Jhawar — a five-time councillor from Kolkata’s ward 42 till she was recently defeated — on Thursday wrote to the party’s North Kolkata district president Kalyan Chowbey, declining the vice-president’s post minutes after the new committee was announced. Jhawar said she was “unable to work” as district vice-president and was “resigning” from the post. She, however, made it clear that she would be available for party activities as an “ordinary worker”. Meanwhile in Jhargram, BJP workers aggrieved with the formation of the new district committee there put the party office under lock and key, and launched a vocal protest. Adding to the party’s embarrassment was the BJP’s new Alipurduar leadership, which named a person as district vice-president when he had left the party six months ago. Suspended BJP leader Ritesh Tiwari tagged the development on his Twitter handle to take a dig at “Virtual Chakraborty and Twitter Malviya”, without naming BJP state (organisation) secretary Amitava Chakraborty and the party’s point-person for Bengal Amit Malviya. The face-saver was no dissent in Contai, the turf of leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari. According to Contai organisational district president Sudam Pandit, the party inducted the MLA’s younger brother Soumendu as district general secretary. The Jhargram situation garnered extra attention after BJP candidate from Binpur assembly seat Palhan Soren joined the agitation. “BJP workers have realised that the party here has no spine, given the manner in which the district committee has been reconstituted. It is up to the district- and state-level leaders to decide whether they will allow this. Our former district president, Sukhamoy Satpathi, has sought five days to resolve the problem. We will chart our course of action after that,” Soren said. In Alipurduar, vice-president-designate Bhaskar De told the media he had quit the BJP. “. I quit the party on June 22 (last year) and had informed Dilip Ghosh,” De said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/now-bjps-kolkata-unit-gets-a-jolt-no-respite-in-districts/articleshow/89167487.cms||---

It took some time for him to realise that it was a leopard and out came a frail shout. Like Sarkar, several morning walkers spotted the leopard in Ward 3 of the town on Thursday. Later, hundreds of people came out of their homes to catch a glimpse of the animal. Rattled by the hue and cry, the leopard took to running on the streets before entering a local’s house. Cops reached the spot along with a team of foresters from Cooch Behar division. Forest officials locked the room from outside and made a hole in the door. The animal was darted through the hole and then taken to Jaldapara National Park. None is sure where the animal entered the town from. Officials suspect it might have come out from Jaldapara, around 35km away. The leopard did not harm anyone, said officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/leopard-strays-into-cooch-behar-rescued/articleshow/89167488.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

This was the fourth after the picnics at Gopalnagar in Bongaon on January 17, Gobardanga on January 23 and Chakdah on January 26. The Bengal BJP has given the Matua leader a long rope though it suspended two former state office-bearers for joining the Union minister in a meeting.“There are no political overtones in picnics. The weather is nice and it is a good time to go for picnics,” said Samik Bhattacharya, spokesperson of the Bengal BJP.“Thakur is on a mass contact programme as his responsibility is going to increase after the Citizenship act is implemented. There are people who have been demanding this and the BJP recognized their demand. No other government has addressed concerns of these groups of people. He has been given the responsibility to carry out mass contact programmes and he is doing that,” Bhattacharya said.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari, on other hand, held a meeting with 10 BJP MLAs at his Salt Lake GC Block residence on Thursday evening to put the party back on the agitation path that could unify the ranks and curb the growing organizational dissent.“I often hold meetings with BJP members in the standing committees of the West Bengal Assembly,” Adhikari said.

---||Kolkata||Enhanced traffic fines in place, 227 helmetless bikers cough up 1k each||Kolkata: On Wednesday and Thursday, 227 bikers were fined Rs 1,000 each for not wearing helmets. That is the enhanced rate as per the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019. From Friday, sergeants will begin collecting enhanced fines for dangerous driving as well. This will include jumping signals or speaking on the cellphone while driving.Kolkata Traffic Police will implement the enhanced fines in other offences in a phased manner and accordingly, cops are updating the app used for prosecution.Sergeants said the initial reaction of bikers, when asked to cough up the steep fine, was shock and confusion. “Most of the bikers had little clue. For citation cases, they could have hardly reacted. But during spot fines, they kept seeking clarifications,” said a sergeant from Bhowanipore guard. There was confusion among sergeants too. A Tollygunge traffic guard sergeant said, “The amended MV act 194D, which pertains to the bikers not wearing helmets also states that we are to suspend the their license for three months. We aren't yet sure how to implement this.” A biker, who was fined near Exide crossing, said that cops should have publicised the enhanced fine more extensively, though he admitted that he should not have broken the rule. An officer said priority was being given to traffic violations that can lead to serious accidents like not wearing helmets, dangerous driving and drink-driving. “We are updating our citation app based on two things — seriousness of the traffic rule that was violated and whether further clarification is required. The changes on road are actually amendments to the MV Act. For certain offences, we have to slap the old prosecutions. In others, we can use the new provisions. Therefore, sergeants and officers will need to study the laws and understand the legal clarifications before they can begin pushing for the complete implementation of the amendments,” he said.The lesser fines against buses and taxis for violating stoppage rules or illegal blocking of lanes will be notified in due course after clarifications arrive from the transport department and legal cell of Lalbazar. Meanwhile, all 25 guards, especially the bigger ones like East, Jorabagan, Ultadanga, Southeast and South, have been asked to hold special awareness drives about the enhanced fines so that every motorists is aware of the same. “We will be holding such campaigns at all important crossings. On Thursday, we organised such an awareness camp at Girish Park. We also distributed leaflets,” said a Jorabagan traffic guard officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/enhanced-traffic-fines-in-place-227-helmetless-bikers-cough-up-1k-each/articleshow/89167496.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||KP campaign for e-storing traffic docus||Kolkata: Traffic cops have started a campaign to popularize DigiLockers and mParivahan apps among people a month after transport department gave its nod for the use of both the apps to store digital driving licence and other key automobile documents. “From now, it will no longer be necessary to carry driving licence and other documents in physical format,” said cops during special camps held at important crossings of the city and across social media platforms. Cops said the campaign was necessary since many people were not aware of the notification. “We are still getting 30-40 mails daily from people asking why we are not accepting Digilocker. Cops from all 25 traffic guards have been told to accept the digital documents stored in these apps,” said a senior officer at the traffic headquarters, adding that DigiLocker will make the process contactless in Covid times and ease the introduction of e-challan system.

---||Kolkata||KMC suspends pension payout||Kolkata: In an unprecedented move, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation pension cell on Thursday issued a notice suspending disbursement of pension from February onwards. An acute funds crunch has compelled the civic brass to take such a drastic step, said a KMC official posted at the finance department.According to sources in the KMC finance department, the civic body had decided to withhold pension for those who have just retired or are due to retire. With revenues taking a major hit due to the pandemic, the civic top brass felt it was untenable for the organization to continue to pay out Rs 50 crore by way of pension every month. The KMC finance department needs to disburse Rs 150 crore every month to pay salaries.According to a KMC official, revenues from property tax have fallen drastically in the past two years, prompting the civic authority to take mop-up measures. Recently, the civic authority has told the assessment department to ensure that all unassessed properties are brought into the taxation fold at the earliest. “We had to take such a drastic step as we had no other options,” said a KMC senior official in administration department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-suspends-pension-payout/articleshow/89167499.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||18-yr-old held from S 24 Pgns for Salt Lake robbery attempt||Kolkata: One of the burglars — who had attempted to barge into multiple houses in a Salt Lake neighbourhood last Monday and fled the spot after injuring two cops following an alarm raised by some neighbours — has been arrested by Bidhannagar Police. Cops said the arrested burglar, Taslim Piyada (18), a resident of Laxminarayanpur in Dhola, South 24 Parganas, was a habitual criminal whom cops of several police districts had been looking for multiple theft and robbery cases. He was produced in a Salt Lake court on Thursday and remanded in a week’s police custody. Cops said they would grill him further to know about his other associates.“The arrest of one of the accused is a relief for the residents. We hope cops will arrest rest of the accused soon. We were all scared, thinking if the robbers would target other houses in the area. We have been requesting cops to beef up security arrangements in our area,” said Professor Pranabesh Jana of AH 193, from where the burglars had stolen a laptop and a cellphone but left them behind on being chased by the cops. On January 24, a group of burglars had targeted four houses at AH block in Salt Lake but a third-year engineering student, Sujay Goswami, who was studying till late in the night, first spotted the men aiming torch lights at multiple houses. He alerted his father, Sumit, who in turn alerted other neighbours and cops. Two of the burglars came out of a house and came in front of the police. One of the them had bitten a constable’s hand while the other had flung open an iron gate, injuring a sub-inspector. They crossed the boundary wall of another house and fled the spot.

---||Kolkata||Flyers, agents seek more int’l routes, better services from revamped AI||Kolkata: The return of flights on international routes out of Kolkata; better connectivity across domestic sectors; revival of world-class in-flight service; reliable and on-time performance: these are among multiple expectations flyers and travel agents have from the revamped Air India under the Tata group.Corporate executive and frequent flyer Shankho Chowdhury, who has travelled AI in its heyday and witnessed its decline, believes Tatas will be able to engineer a turnaround because there are emotions involved. “I believe there will be an extra effort to revive the airline’s glory. I look forward to better connectivity and service, perhaps a direct flight from Kolkata to Germany, or France in continental Europe, regularisation of the London flight and an onward connection to the US,” he said, pointing to the service excellence in the hospitality sector with its Taj Hotels chain.Corporate advisor Soumitra Ghatak felt the Maharaja that had lost its sheen over the past three-four decades could gradually regain it if it improved reliability and service orientation. “Reliability is a hygiene factor. That’s why so many people prefer IndiGo. The erstwhile Jet Airways had a feel-good factor. If AI is able to offer them both, it will be an airline to reckon with,” he said. Travel agent B T Ramnani of Vensimal World Travel became emotional speaking about the airline. After all, the company that his grandfather Vensimal Ramnani had set up in 1928 with offices in Mumbai and Karachi had supported AI when the Tatas started it in 1932. The Kolkata office was set up in 1933. “Until the 1970s, AI had flights to London, Tokyo, and Yangon. There is a lot of scope for revival of some of these flights and introduction of flights on new routes,” he said.Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi hopes the airline will improve domestic connectivity with at least four daily flights to Delhi, three daily flights to Mumbai and Chennai, two daily flights to Pune, Bengaluru and Goa, and a daily flight to Cochin and Ahmedabad. Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni, though, warned that expectations are so high that managing them could pose a challenge. “There will be incremental improvements. But we must remember that the former glorious AI operated in an environment when there was no competition and only the rich and famous travelled,” said Soni.Recounting how Singapore and Hong Kong had taken cues from AI to shape Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific into world-class carriers, travel agent Manoj Saraf said the troika of AI, Vistara and AirAsia India could set new benchmarks in the Indian market.“One area where we definitely hope to see improvement is aircraft utilization. While IndiGo uses an aircraft to operate seven-eight flights a day, there were only five-six AI flights. We travel agents were frustrated with AI. During the pandemic, the refund took a year-and-a-half when all other airlines gave it in six months,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/flyers-agents-seek-more-intl-routes-better-services-from-revamped-ai/articleshow/89167502.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Many critically ill Covid patients at private hospitals are not jabbed||KOLKATA: A significant number of critically ill Covid patients now under treatment at private hospital ICUs are unvaccinated and had chosen to skip the inoculation fearing side-effects, say doctors and hospitals. Some could not get the vaccine since they are confined to bed and couldn’t travel to a vaccination centre. Experts believe these patients — mostly senior citizens with comorbidities — could have been less severely affected had they taken the shot. Several such patients have died over the last four weeks since the Omicron wave struck Kolkata and Bengal, it has been pointed out. Around 35%-40% of patients admitted at the ITU of RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) are either unvaccinated or have just received a single dose. Almost 60% of these patients, doctors say, have not received a single shot. “We currently have 30 patients in Covid critical care . Out of this, eight have not got vaccinated at all. Three of them have taken one dose and the remaining 19 have had both the doses. The three patients with single dose got infected with Covid before their due date for second dose. Most of the eight patients with no doses have preferred to skip the vaccination due to various reasons,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. “This clearly points at the fact that those without vaccination are more prone to a severe disease. In fact, the majority of Covid ITU patients now are unvaccinated,” said RTIICS intensivist Sauren Panja. He, however, added that a small percentage of the unvaccinated Covid patients have more severe comorbidities. Almost 30% of critical care patients at Woodlands Hospital are not vaccinated by choice. Four of the 15 patients at Woodland’s Covid ICU have not taken even one dose of the vaccine. “These patients have remained unvaccinated by choice. The other eleven patients currently in the ICU have taken both doses. Those without vaccine are more severely affected,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. Around 5% of severely ill Covid patients at Peerless Hospital have been unvaccinated over the last one month. Of the six ITU patients now admitted, one has not received any vaccine. “We have had unvaccinated patients quite consistently over the last one month. Though their number has been low, they have all been severely affected and required ITU admission. Nearly a half of them have died,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. A significantly higher percentage of those with severe Covid are unvaccinated than their vaccinated counterparts, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. The two major reasons behind skipping the vaccine have been an uncertainty about its effects and efficacy and immobility of the patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/many-critically-ill-cov-patients-at-private-hosps-are-not-jabbed/articleshow/89167503.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Podcast weds tradition & innovation, gets blessings of Ma Saraswati||Kolkata: The Covid pandemic taught educators across the world to quickly adapt to the integral role of technology in teaching. While this transition from classroom teaching to online education was initially difficult for some, for others, technology opened up various opportunities in teaching modes, allowing creative outlets of pedagogy, including podcasts. As Kolkata gears up for Saraswati Puja amid the pandemic for the second time, students and teachers share their ideas about possible innovations in e-learning and the growth of educational podcasts. A content writer at an ed-tech company said podcasts helped him come up with ideas for his PhD research proposal. “As a literature student, one is constantly searching new perspectives. I find it enjoyable to get ideas by listening to podcasts.” Assistant professor at Centre for Distance and Online Education, Rabindra Bharati University, Aritra Basu shared his ambitions of starting a podcast soon: “I have a Youtube channel, on which I started making academic videos in April 2021. I have also created various WhatsApp and Facebook groups to promote academic awareness. I love to explore different online platforms to engage with educationists. I have ambitions of making podcasts. But the student base of Kolkata is very poorly accustomed to podcasts. There is hardly any Kolkata-based podcast maker. I would definitely want to be involved in developing the community.” “Podcasts are influencing the education scene today with it being an effective supplement in the form of audiobooks. A major contribution in the form of motivational speeches and news feeds are utilised for various educational references. But academic podcasts are relatively limited and can prove to be monotonous, especially if used for a long period of time. We make use of podcasts in the form of audiobooks and as secondary reference materials. Podcasts are used effectively for our leadership classes, lifeskill classes and meditation breaks,” said Delhi Public School New Town principal Sonali Sen.But some pointed out the cons of podcasts. Supratim Sarkar, research scholar at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, said, “I support the transition to digital platforms, but there is one disadvantage. Sometimes, educational content creators and podcast makers ask for a paid subscription. I believe education should be free for all.” Ramit Samaddar, associate professor in the English department at Jadavpur University, pointed out the digital divide, which still posed difficulty for complete transition to online learning. “E-learning has the huge advantage of being flexible for students as well as teachers. Students can revisit lectures, and professors can edit or remake videos, if necessary. But as a professor, I miss the traditional style of teaching. But one has to adapt to the times since there is no other way to survive.”“We need to embrace the new learning modes, including podcasts, keeping with the demands of changing times. Podcasts are student friendly as they can be stored, and can be listened to whenever necessary. But not all sections may benefit, especially students from remote areas,” said New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/podcast-weds-tradition-innovation-gets-blessings-of-ma-saraswati/articleshow/89167505.cms||---

The state government has, however, issued a tender for 4.5 crore paracetamol tablets keeping any possible shortage and sudden jump in price in mind.According to Swasthya Bhavan sources, nearly 4.5 crore paracetamol tablets will be procured for government-run hospitals and pharmacies. Apart from a spike in demand due to rapid spread of Covid-19, demands for medicines like paracetamol increase during the change of season. Vendors for the state government are finding it difficult to supply as bulk drug import is constrained due to logistics issues.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-tender-for-4-5-crore-paracetamols/articleshow/89167507.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Music greats irked over Padma award ‘insult’ to Sandhya Mukherjee||KOLKATA: Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma, Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia and Arati Mukhopadhyay have strongly reacted to the Padma controversy. Geetasri Sandhya Mukherjee and Pt Anindo Chatterjee on Tuesday had turned down the offer to confer Padma Shri on them. On Thursday, Chaurasia told TOI, “There is no need to give an award if one can’t give due respect to Sandhya Mukherjee. An artist of her calibre can’t be insulted this way.” Chatterjee, he insisted, should have been conferred a Padma Bhushan. “Even those junior to him have got the Padma Shri years ago while he has been ignored. He is a veteran tabla player who has played the world over. He has played with me as well as with so many stalwarts,” Chaurasia said. On Thursday, the santoor maestro told TOI: “Anindo Chatterjee is one of the finest tabla players of our country. In his long career, I think he has done a great job of spreading this knowledge, teaching so many students in India and abroad. He has accompanied most of the senior vocalists, instrumentalists and dancers. I have had a long association with him. We have played in India and abroad too. In my personal opinion, I feel he definitely deserved a Padma Bhushan considering his calibre and contribution. There are few tabla players who can match Anindo’s calibre of playing, whether in accompaniment or tabla solo. He should have been given a Padma Bhushan.” Mukhopadhyay said this entire nomination process smacks of a “terrible bias” and “complete illiteracy of decision-makers”. “It is time India instituted awards in Sandhya di’s name Her insult is a humiliation for our nation. She is like a banyan tree for us. The decision makers have no musical inclination or education. A singer’s body of work, and not his or her acquaintances, should be the only criterion for being an awardee. But most awards are now being heaped on mediocre artists,” she said. The ‘Masoom’ singer insisted that such nominations are not to be confused with stray incidents of ignorance alone. “They are a handiwork of a cartel at play in the music industry. I have faced politics in Mumbai’s music world and have suffered in silence when so-called stalwarts have often got music directors to drop me from songs. Famous artists can go to any limit to bag a song. They are the ones who have always controlled the narrative and have ensured that true greats are ignored and insulted this way. All recognition goes to only a handful while the likes of Sandhya di get insulted,” she said. Despite her own contribution to music, Mukherjee is not yet a Padma recipient. “But Anuradha Paudwal and Usha Uthup have been conferred the Padma Shri in 2017 and 2011 respectively. I shudder to think if I am nominated for a Padma Shri next year fearing that I might not live long. We don’t need awards at this stage in our life. Just spare us the insult,” she added. Meanwhile, sarod maestro Ustad Aashish Khan, who has worked with the 90-year-old for various recordings, has reacted from California, saying this Padma controversy is a “great shame”. “Sandhya Mukherjee is India’s pride. She is also a very serious classical singer and performed at many music conferences too. An artist like her should be awarded the Bharat Ratna. She is no less than Lata Mangeshkar or any other awardee. Both these artists have recorded songs composed by my father, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. She is a very down-to-earth human being. I wish her a long and healthy life,” he said. All these reactions came a day after singer Kabir Suman, painter Shuvaprasanna, author Abul Bashar and director Sudeshna Roy held a press conference on Wednesday about this controversy. While Suman pointed out that the decision was a “rude jolt” to the 90-year-old icon who has been an inspiration to singers of different generations, Shuvaprasanna described it as “a deep-rooted conspiracy against Bengalis”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/music-greats-irked-over-award-insult-to-sandhya/articleshow/89167508.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Kolkata||Wajid Ali Shah’s great grandson passes away||Kolkata: Sahebzada Wasif Mirza, son of Prince Ghazanfar Mirza and great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, passed away on January 25 at his Park Circus residence. He was the president of the Awadh Royal Family Association that was set up to look after the interest of the descendants. He was 87 and is survived by his two sons and two daughters.On May 13, 1856, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, who was deposed by the British, came to plead his case with Governor General Lord Charles Canning, only to be imprisoned at Fort William as the East India Company feared that he may be a threat to its rule. After being freed two years later, Wajid Ali Shah decided to live in Metiabruz. “My father, along with other family members, persuaded KMC to rename the most important road in Metiaburz after Wajid Ali Shah. The road was renamed in 2004. Subrata Mukherjee was the then mayor,” said Shahenshah Mirza, a civil servant and a history buff.Many recalled how Sahebzada had actively pursued the case of enhancement of the political pensions fixed in 1887 for Wajid Ali Shah’s descendants and had even written to Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi regarding this. “Before his demise, he was eager that the government consider this demand favourably and enhance the pension to a respectable amount,” he added.Sahebzada had inherited his love for music from Wajid Ali Shah. He would often play gramophone records and listen to the popular thumri ‘Babul Mora Naihar Chooto Jai’ that was penned by Wajid Ali Shah. An ardent Mohammedan Sporting supporter, he never missed a single match of his favourite team. There are stories of Sahebzada and his friends walking from Maidan to Nizam’s to celebrate their team’s victory and then walking to Park Circus. “He was full of life and was very conscious about his health. He was buried at the Shia Kabristan where other family members are also interred,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/wajid-ali-shahs-great-grandson-passes-away/articleshow/89167511.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Parks to stay open for one more hour in the evening||KOLKATA: Under fire from citizens’ groups for closing down parks when the notification issued by the state government announcing Covid restrictions on January 2, 2022, at the beginning of the third wave had specifically mentioned closure of entertainment parks, KMC officials extended the evening timing at city parks by an hour while claiming they were keen to revert to pre-Covid hours at the earliest. Since the beginning of this week, parks are being opened twice a day — once from 6am to 9am and again from 3pm to 6pm. There are 750 KMC parks across 144 wards in the city. “We are all for reopening parks from 6am to 9pm like they used to be before March 2020. We are planning to extend the evening timing by an hour with immediate effect. We will then extend it further in the morning and open it in the afternoon once we get the nod from the state government,” a senior parks department official said. Debashis Kumar, MMiC overseeing the KMC parks department, said his department was not in favour of placing curbs on citizens’ right to enter public parks at any time of the day. “We are keeping tabs on the Covid situation and are in touch with the government before we can revert to pre-Covid timings,” Kumar said. However, Supreme Court advocate Shruti Agarwal questioned why the parks had been shut in the first place when the notification did not specify it. “It was shocking that while the Covid restriction notification issued by the state government on January 2, 2022 and signed by the chief secretary stated that entertainment parks are to be shut, KMC and KMDA went ahead and closed public parks,” she said. Doctors and scientists have also repeatedly pointed out that the risk of infection spread is lowest in an open-air space. Calling for immediate reopening of parks as per pre-Covid schedule, green advocacy group PUBLIC founder Bonani Kakkar said: “Public parks are not a discretionary service being rendered by KMC. They are an essential service, as much as water and street lights. Using Covid as a pretext to deny citizens this essential service is tantamount to failure to performing a statutory duty.” Lawyer Ankit Agarwal, who used to exercise between 7pm and 9pm prior to Covid, said it was essential to return to the earlier regimen for those unable to wake up early as well as those who are busy whole day. “People with professional commitments in the morning need to have flexibility. Ditto with old people who can get much needed fresh air, greenery, and the afternoon sun in these gloomy and wintry days,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/parks-to-stay-open-for-one-more-hour-in-the-evening/articleshow/89167513.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Counselling, fee waiver: Colleges extend help to students in distress||Kolkata: Fearing that the Covid wave might have led to a mental health crisis among students grappling with a prolonged period of online learning, isolation and financial difficulties, several colleges and universities have decided to prioritise mental health. They are initiating steps to address the distressed students and mitigate the crisis through professional help. Some are conducting group counselling for their students while others — Like Scottish Church College — have waived off semester fee of those who have lost one or both parents to the pandemic. In some colleges, heads are directly speaking to students showing signs of distress while in others special cells have been created to address the issue. Lady Brabourne College and Bethune College have started counselling cells for their students.According to teachers and counsellors, remote learning, loss of peer interactions, social isolation, and less interaction with other supportive adults like teachers is leading to anxiety and depression among students. At St Xavier’s College, Fathers along with professional counsellors are addressing the students reaching out to them for help. “Many students write to us and call on helplines. Fathers and professional counsellors listen to them patiently and resolve their issues,” said Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College. Last week, IIT-Kharagpur conducted a three-day online counselling session for students. “The pandemic has created uncertainty for everybody, which has led to anxiety and depression among people. We want to reach out to our students in these testing times and help them out,” said Tamal Nath, registrar of IIT-Kharagpur. “I was so depressed when I heard of the closure on January 2 this year. I have not been to the campus even once. I don’t know how the college looks like, never had a welcome party and have never interacted with my classmates. If colleges reopen after a few weeks, I will be in third year,” said Diksha Bhattacharya, a student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/counselling-fee-waiver-colleges-extend-help-to-students-in-distress/articleshow/89167517.cms||Zeeshan Javed

As the district has been listed under ‘C’ category, shoppers and patrons have been staying away, hurting the businesses which were slowly getting back into shape. Most of the institutions had undergone renovations at a huge cost. The restaurant owners said that they are not even getting half of the income they used to get. As the government has brought in more restrictions, most of the bookings for wedding halls have been either cancelled or postponed. As there are only a few people attending the wedding, the clients are also asking for discounts. “When we get a confirmed hall booking with advance payment, we will also book other necessities, including food and generator facilities. Those companies will not give us a refund for cancellation. According to the government’s rule we have to refund the advance paid by our clients. We are taking loans to repay them. Auditorium owners are making calls to us asking whether we are interested in buying their buildings,” said Ricky N Chandran, manager of Al Saj Convention Centre. Even before the onset of third wave, bookings had dwindled. “Now it seems bookings will pick up only after a decision is made on the current situation. People are also confused about whether they should postpone or continue with their wedding plans,” said Rarith R R, managing director of RDR Convention Centre. The Paragon restaurant which has been providing food and accommodation to their employees all these days has not been getting half of the profit it used to earn. “People used to book their tables before they come for dining, now all the seats are lying vacant. Our only hopes rest on takeaways and deliveries,” said Abhilash V S, general manager of Paragon. Not only restaurants and auditoriums, other small scale and large-scale businesses including shopping malls have also been hit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/revival-plans-of-eateries-hit-a-wall/articleshow/89165822.cms||---
---||Delhi||Traders Happy To Be Back At Full Strength||New Delhi: Almost a month after the odd-even formula for opening shops was imposed, traders heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday after Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued an order for lifting the weekend curfew and odd-even restrictions. The agitated traders had opposed the move right from the start, blaming the administration for taking such steps without taking them into confidence. They also wrote to LG Anil Baijal for considering not implementing the move and some traders’ associations had even cautioned about carrying out a major protest if no relief was given this time. Confederation of Trade & Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal said the eyes of 20 lakh traders were fixed on DDMA’s meeting. “With the withdrawal of the odd-even system and weekend curfew, business conditions in Delhi will normalise to a great extent. There has been a 60% loss in business in the past 29 days. Raising the limit of people for hotels and restaurants from 20 to 200 or 50% will also save the livelihood of lakhs of people,” he added. Traders claimed to be struggling to break even with the weekend curfew and the odd-even rule. A few were even contemplating taking loans to meet the rising expenses. “Our winter stock, especially garments purchased last year, could not be sold as shops were open for barely two days a week. In our market, many restrictions were imposed by the administration due to heavy crowds and some shops were sealed for violating norms. This automatically reduced footfall even before odd-even was imposed. Now, the peak winter is almost over, but we expect an increase in visitors, especially those coming for wedding shopping,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Traders’ Association. The traders’ associations assured to take all precautionary measures to ensure that cases didn’t rise. They have requested the government to take decisions after involving them in the future. “It’s not just shopkeepers and their families affected by such decisions, but also lakhs of people employed or associated with the shops,” said Paramjit Singh Pamma, vice-chairman of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association. The members of the federation distributed sweets in the market after the decision.

Banking on the anti-incumbency factor, Bahadur, son of Kiran Pal Valmiki, former chairman of state Safai Karamchari Aayog, is leaving no stone unturned in his bid to reach out to voters. Meanwhile, AAP candidate Mamata Singh is also likely to cut into votes, as per analysts. In the 2017 elections, the Congress had fielded SP Singh Engineer against Rathore -- the BJP candidate contesting the polls for the first time. Engineer gave his rival a tough fight but lost by a slender margin of 4,788 votes. As the Congress this time chose Bahadur, Engineer is contesting on the ticket of Azad Samaj Party (ASP) led by Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan.  A similar situation existed in the last elections also when there were two candidates -- Engineer and Brij Rani -- opposing the BJP candidate. Votes against Rathore were divided between Engineer and Brij Rani, a rebel Congress candidate contesting as an independent after being denied the party ticket. This facilitated the BJP candidate's victory, though with a narrow margin. While Rathore polled 29,513 votes, Engineer got 24,725. Engineer, analysts here said, is “a strong candidate, but in a weak party”. This might mar his prospects of winning. On the other hand, Bahadur is better placed than him but he is a comparatively lesser-known. “This may tilt the scales in Rathore's favour,” said Naresh Gupta, a local resident. Lalit Chauhan, another resident, felt that anti-incumbency will be a strong factor against the sitting MLA. Besides, a case against Rathore registered on the complaint of a member of his own party is under investigation, he added. The woman had earlier withdrawn the case and a final report was submitted by police. But a local court got it reopened, causing much embarrassment to Rathore. He dismissed it as a conspiracy against him, but people apprehended that it might damage his poll prospects. In the Jwalapur constituency, there are a number of villages with a substantial population of Muslim and SC voters. This, according to SMJN College ex-principal PS Chauhan, is "a favourable situation for the Congress candidate”. Engineer will not get enough votes to spoil Bahadur's chances of victory, he added. AAP candidate Mamata Singh's presence in the constituency might make a difference. She will harm the BJP more than the Congress, it was pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cong-bjp-brace-for-stiff-fight-in-jwalapur/articleshow/89165827.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

This year, towards the end of the admission round, the directorate of technical education (DTE) allowed even students who have not answered the Goa common entrance test (GCET) to claim available seats. However, this resulted in just 10-15 vacancies being filled by non-GCET students. Of the 380 unclaimed seats, a maximum of 200 were left untouched at the Shiroda-based Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology (SRIEIT). During the last academic year, nearly 50% of the seats in the four private engineering colleges had gone unfilled. This figure has come down to a little over 32% this year, which could be due to the new government scheme subsiding engineering degree programme fees in private institutes. Goa Engineering College (GEC), Farmagudi, which is the state’s only government engineering institute, has, as usual, seen all its 450 seats filled up. Seventy seats each have gone vacant at the Don Bosco College of Engineering (DBCE), Fatorda, and Agnel Institute of Technology and Design (AITD), Assagao. At the Verna-based Padre Conceicao College of Engineering (PCCE), 40 seats have found no takers. “Most of the vacancies were seen in the mechanical engineering and electronics engineering streams. This is a reversal of trend, as until three-four years ago, these two streams were the most preferred by students. Now, students are seen opting more for computer engineering and IT streams,” said an official. At the GEC, all seats of existing programmes were taken, but attempts to reopen the mining engineering programme have failed. Admission to the programme had been stopped a couple of years ago for want of takers, and the state government had given its approval to resume admissions to the programme for 2021-22. However, officials said that not a single student showed interest in the programme, and therefore, first year mining engineering will not be able to begin this academic year either. The number of first year vacancies in engineering programmes in Goa started going up after seats were increased across colleges to be able to introduce the quota for economically weaker sections (EWS). College - Total seats available – Seats vacant GEC - 450 – 0 (mining engg admissions were to resume, but no takers for 30 seats) RIEIT – 300 - 200 PCCE – 300 - 70 Don Bosco – 300 - 70 AITD – 225 - 40 Total seats - 1,575 Total seats in private engg colleges – 1,195 (380 vacant)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/even-after-gcet-criteria-relaxation-380-pvt-engg-coll-seats-go-vacant/articleshow/89188786.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The bench comprising chief justice R V Malimath and Justice Purusendra Kaurav also took note of the fact that respondents in the case have not submitted their reply to the petition despite being given several chances. Meanwhile, the court stay on any mining-related activity by the company would continue,. Two petitions have been filed in the MP high court against leasing of land in Buxwaha forests in Chhatarpur district to M/s Essel Mining & Industries. While the petition filed by Nagrik Upbhokta Margdarshak Manch contended that the area should be preserved as a heritage site as prehistoric rock paintings have been found in the caves of Buxwaha jungles. Activities related to diamond mining could start in the area anytime as 364 hectare land has already been leased out to the company for the purpose but the Archeological Survey of India has not declared the area as "protected area.

Asked when he expected the Corona third wave to hit the peak in Bhopal, additional collector in-charge of Covid preparedness, Sandeep Kerkatta, said “It’s almost there. Cases have started declining in metros like Delhi and Mumbai and we shall see it happening in Bhopal in a week”. Since January 23, when new Corona cases crossed the figure 2000 in the district, it has been hovering around that mark, not spiralling and threatening to go out of bounds. When asked about Covid preparedness, Kerkatta said that the administration had made elaborate arrangements to deal with any eventuality but fortunately all that was not required to be put to use as the overwhelming majority of infected persons are in home isolation and recouping. “We had 11,000 beds ready and more beds could have been added, if it were required, but not even 1000 beds are occupied. Most of the people are in home isolation. All other measures for prevention and control like testing, vaccination are going on. Things are under control”, said Kerkatta, who, himself, had contracted Covid infection and joined the office only on Thursday after home isolation for some days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/3rd-wave-peaks-almost-here-cases-to-fall-in-a-week-official/articleshow/89167547.cms||---

Notably, schools in the state are closed till January 31. School education minister Prabhuram Chaudhary has already said that the present situation is not conducive to open schools for offline classes even after January 31. Home minister Narottam Mishra on Thursday said that a state-level review meeting will be held on January 30 or 31 wherein CM Chouhan may decide about the opening of schools. Incidentally, school education minister Inder Singh Parmar in a recent statement had said that it was difficult to open schools in Madhya Pradesh, citing the rise in the Covid cases. He added that a review will be done before making any final decision. After declaring that the schools will remain closed till January 31 the biggest concern was as to how long the campuses were to be closed. Senior officials of the school education department told TOI that the state government does not want to make any decision in haste. Notably, the school education department has recently launched pre-board examination of classes 10 and 12 for the academic session 2021-22. Class 10 pre-board exam began from January 20. Class 12 pre-board exams also began from Jan 20 which are to end on Jan 31. Both exams are being organised on the ‘take home’ concept. Following the covid guideline, question papers and answer sheets have been made available to all the students at least a day before the question paper. In order that the students do not have to call the school multiple times, 2 to 3 question papers have been made available simultaneously and on the day of receipt of the next question paper, the answer books of the previously provided question papers will be submitted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/shivraj-to-decide-whether-to-open-schools-or-not-after-jan-31/articleshow/89167548.cms||Ramendra Singh

There is one thing significant though, the number of persons who recovered from Covid infection in the state outnumbered the new cases found; something not seen so far though the cases had started declining since January 23. According to the state health bulletin issued by the directorate of health, the number of new Corona cases found in the state on Thursday was 9532 down from 9966, the new cases found on Wednesday but still more than Tuesday, when 9451 new cases were found. During these three days, the number of tests conducted for Corona across the state have also varied considerably. While 72382 tests were conducted on Tuesday, 81016 on Wednesday and 79813 on Thursday. There were 71203 active cases in the state and 6 Corona deaths were reported from across the state on Thursday. There were 8 deaths Corona reported on Wednesday. Remarkably, since January 22 when persons recovering from Corona infection in a day were not even half the persons found infected, the number of persons recovering from the disease outnumber the new infection cases found.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/recoveries-outnumber-infections-as-mp-reports-9532-new-cases/articleshow/89167549.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The family in which we are born decides whether we call God, Ishwar or Allah. Humanity is the religion of humans and the foundation of every religion.”In a second tweet, the former chief minister said, “There are good and bad persons in all religions. Individuals may be bad but the entire group and community cannot be bad. That is why, respect all religions. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis – they have all made their contribution in the freedom struggle.”Digvijaya’s remarks drew a sharp reaction from Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra. “Since Ghulam Nabi Azad has received the Padma Bhushan, and from the moment the announcement was made, Digvijaya Singh started seeing villains in Muslims,” he said.Former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is one of the G-23 leaders of Congress, who had written to AICC president Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 for revival of the party. After Azad was conferred the Padma Bhushan, the Congress was split in half in its reaction – the rebel group congratulated him while others, like Jairam Ramesh, took a swipe.On Thursday, Mishra said: “Right since Independence, it has been Congress’ conspiracy and policy to segregate Muslims. Article 370 has been abrogated, a decision on triple talaq has been taken, Muslims are joining the mainstream. Now Chacha Jaan (Digvijaya) has come to know that even in Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are not supporting Congress. That is why he deliberately makes comments like separatists.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/political-circumstances-have-made-muslims-villains-diggy/articleshow/89167559.cms||Suchandana Gupta

---||Thiruvananthapuram||3 students held for vandalism, criminal trespass||Thiruvananthapuram: Three college students were arrested by Parassala police on Thursday for vandalising the political symbols of their rival students’ organisations at a nearby college. The police identified the three accused as Akhil, 20, of Vellarada, Abin, 20, of Elluvila and Salman, 19, of Kaliyikkavila. All of them are students of College of Applied Sciences, Dhanuvachapuram. Three of them are also learned to be SFI activists. The students had allegedly set on fire the flag poles of ABVP that was installed outside Velu Thampi Memorial Nair Service Society (VTM NSS) College at Dhanuvachapuram. They are also accused of stealing the surveillance camera installed outside the NSS School nearby, vandalising two cars parked in the vicinity and also defiling a poster displaying images of deities at a nearby temple. The alleged atrocity took place around 3 am. The police received the information in this regard around 5am following which they immediately launched a probe. District police chief (rural) Divya V Gopinath personally monitored the probe since the crime had the potential to create unrest in the locality since VTM NSS being a stronghold of ABVP. The place also has a history of political clashes in the past. Sajin Muhammed, an 18-year-old SFI activist of Government ITI, Parassala, was allegedly murdered during a clash between SFI and ABVP in August 2013. “Though the three accused are SFI supporters, there is prima facie no evidence for their actions being part of a political conspiracy. They were reportedly in an inebriated state when they carried out the crimes,” the Inspector said. The trio reached the crime scene around 3am from a wedding party which they attended during the previous night. One more youth is suspected to have been with them and a probe is on to nab him. The inspector said that it was the peculiar hairdo of Salman that helped them identify the suspects quickly. An elderly woman witnessed the youths fleeing the scene on motorcycles and she noticed Salman’s hair which was entirely dyed in white colour. When the police started enquiry using this information, some local residents, who have seen Salman multiple times in the area, told the police that he was a student of College of Applied Sciences nearby. The police checked the campus around 6 am and as suspected the trio was still on the campus. Though they tried to flee, the police chased them down and apprehended them. The police have invoked charges of vandalism, causing provocation to incite riot, defiling place of worship and criminal trespass against the three students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/3-students-held-for-vandalism-criminal-trespass/articleshow/89165838.cms||---

Well, it was marriage that changed the context of consent. Maintenance, obligations came into the picture. It is a milestone in life and brings with it many legal obligations. There are countervailing rights. So, there is an intelligent differentia between marital and non-marital,” advocate J Sai Deepak contended before a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar. Appearing for the NGO Men Welfare Trust, Deepak pointed out that consent and context couldn’t be separated and it was the issue at the heart of this debate. Expanding on the link between consent and context, Deepak maintained that marriage was treated differently in several provisions of criminal law and the “blinkered approach” of viewing the issue of sexual intercourse between a husband and wife only from the perspective of “consent”, in the absence of context of the marital setting, was incorrect. “Rape between two rank strangers and institution of marriage and other relationship having trappings of a marriage within the meaning of a domestic relationship in the Domestic Violence Act, cannot be the same. That is the intelligible differentia,” underlined Deepak. The lawyer argued that in the case of sexual abuse in a marriage, a “basket of remedies” was available in law, which was different on account of the difference in relationship and context. Their alleged “inadequacy” couldn’t be a ground to strike down the exception. He added that even abroad, spousal sexual violence was treated as an offence separate from rape. “A marriage creates an ecosystem. And therefore, laws are meant to try and protect the integrity of the ecosystem as much as possible. I’m not making a submission that the ecosystem must be protected at the expense of one particular individual’s dignity. I’m saying there are safeguards,” Deepak said. He also questioned the comparison made between Supreme Court’s interventions in Vishakha (sexual harassment guidelines), pointing out that the first was a case of legal vacuum, but here legislature had pointedly kept an exception.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/marital-rape-consent-and-context-linked-ngo-tells-hc/articleshow/89166771.cms||Abhinav Garg

President of Law Students' Association of Rani Durgavati University, in his petition, said that the MP Nursing Registration Council had recognised 55 nursing colleges opened in tribal areas in 2000-2001. “The recognition was given after inspection by a team il but these nursing colleges are only being run on paper and are bereft of facilities as laid down by the guidelines of the council to open a nursing college.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Total Covid clusters in the district now crosses 100||Thiruvananthapuram: Going into the fourth week of third wave the number of Covid clusters in the district has crossed 100. The Vikas Bhavan building has emerged as the biggest cluster among the government offices. It started with two index cases in Vikas Bhavan building on January 10 and in the next two weeks random scattered distribution was reported in the building with various directorates reporting 10 to 30 cases each.Agriculture directorate and college education directorate have reported 35 cases each while economics and statistics department have so far reported 27 cases.Unlike the first two weeks, other institution clusters are outnumbering health care clusters and educational clusters. The district now has 72 active clusters of which 55% has been reported from other institutions; mostly government offices. About 30 clusters have so far been contained in the district.Even while clusters have been decreasing among schools and colleges, the rapid pace of virus spread in schools has been alarming. Cotton Hill Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Vazhuthacaud, had seven index cases on January 13. Till date, the cumulative cases from the school are 121 of which 100 cases are categorised as active. Despite stringent directions issued to staff of the government offices, clusters are being reported from many workplaces. Forest headquarters, Vazhuthacaud, has reported 78 cases so far with cases being reported from divisional forest office, administration wing, and fair copy and development wing. Central prison here has been another major cluster with 234 cases.Regional Institute of Ophthalmology is the new active cluster in the health sector. About 63 cases are active here which include nine students and 54 staff. The government central press at Thampanoor has also reported 40 active cases so far. Officials said that the spike in the number of clusters in government offices is a clear indication of breach of protocol and the community spread is also a reason. “Even if some staff are not symptomatic, there are chances that they happen to be primary contact in many families with one or more positive cases. They continue to report for work because they may not be symptomatic. This may lead to spread of infection,” an official said.Care home and old age homes are also reporting clusters in the city. About 11 cases have been reported from Sree Chithra poor home and the destitute home at Kalladimugham has reported 22 cases. The destitute home has a total of 43 inmates and 18 staff.The police force has also been badly hit. In addition to clusters at Museum, Poonthura and Karamana stations, clusters have been reported from SAP camp, AR camp and Traffic enforcement unit. The total cases reported at SAP camp, Peroorkada, so far are 92. Nine index cases were confirmed on January 15. Many of those who returned after Sabarimala duty had tested positive.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||3 students held for vandalism, criminal trespass||Thiruvananthapuram: Three college students were arrested by Parassala police on Thursday for vandalising the political symbols of their rival students’ organisations at a nearby college. The police identified the three accused as Akhil, 20, of Vellarada, Abin, 20, of Elluvila and Salman, 19, of Kaliyikkavila. All of them are students of College of Applied Sciences, Dhanuvachapuram. Three of them are also learned to be SFI activists.The students had allegedly set on fire the flag poles of ABVP that was installed outside Velu Thampi Memorial Nair Service Society (VTM NSS) College at Dhanuvachapuram. They are also accused of stealing the surveillance camera installed outside the NSS School nearby, vandalising two cars parked in the vicinity and also defiling a poster displaying images of deities at a nearby temple.The alleged atrocity took place around 3 am. The police received the information in this regard around 5am following which they immediately launched a probe. District police chief (rural) Divya V Gopinath personally monitored the probe since the crime had the potential to create unrest in the locality since VTM NSS being a stronghold of ABVP. The place also has a history of political clashes in the past. Sajin Muhammed, an 18-year-old SFI activist of Government ITI, Parassala, was allegedly murdered during a clash between SFI and ABVP in August 2013.“Though the three accused are SFI supporters, there is prima facie no evidence for their actions being part of a political conspiracy. They were reportedly in an inebriated state when they carried out the crimes,” the Inspector said.The trio reached the crime scene around 3am from a wedding party which they attended during the previous night. One more youth is suspected to have been with them and a probe is on to nab him.The inspector said that it was the peculiar hairdo of Salman that helped them identify the suspects quickly. An elderly woman witnessed the youths fleeing the scene on motorcycles and she noticed Salman’s hair which was entirely dyed in white colour. When the police started enquiry using this information, some local residents, who have seen Salman multiple times in the area, told the police that he was a student of College of Applied Sciences nearby. The police checked the campus around 6 am and as suspected the trio was still on the campus. Though they tried to flee, the police chased them down and apprehended them.The police have invoked charges of vandalism, causing provocation to incite riot, defiling place of worship and criminal trespass against the three students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/3-students-held-for-vandalism-criminal-trespass/articleshow/89167565.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Revival plans of eateries hit a wall||Thiruvananthapuram: The third wave of the pandemic has spoiled the revival plans of shops and commercial establishments in the city. As the district has been listed under ‘C’ category, shoppers and patrons have been staying away, hurting the businesses which were slowly getting back into shape.Most of the institutions had undergone renovations at a huge cost. The restaurant owners said that they are not even getting half of the income they used to get. As the government has brought in more restrictions, most of the bookings for wedding halls have been either cancelled or postponed. As there are only a few people attending the wedding, the clients are also asking for discounts.“When we get a confirmed hall booking with advance payment, we will also book other necessities, including food and generator facilities. Those companies will not give us a refund for cancellation. According to the government’s rule we have to refund the advance paid by our clients. We are taking loans to repay them. Auditorium owners are making calls to us asking whether we are interested in buying their buildings,” said Ricky N Chandran, manager of Al Saj Convention Centre.Even before the onset of third wave, bookings had dwindled. “Now it seems bookings will pick up only after a decision is made on the current situation. People are also confused about whether they should postpone or continue with their wedding plans,” said Rarith R R, managing director of RDR Convention Centre.The Paragon restaurant which has been providing food and accommodation to their employees all these days has not been getting half of the profit it used to earn.“People used to book their tables before they come for dining, now all the seats are lying vacant. Our only hopes rest on takeaways and deliveries,” said Abhilash V S, general manager of Paragon. Not only restaurants and auditoriums, other small scale and large-scale businesses including shopping malls have also been hit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/revival-plans-of-eateries-hit-a-wall/articleshow/89167568.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Policy change makes central deputation less attractive||Thiruvananthapuram: The Centre’s proposed amendments to the IAS (cadre) rules, 1954 on central deputation of the IAS officers, comes at a time when lesser number of officers are willing to go on deputation due to a policy change by the Centre with regards to appointing officers at mid and top levels.As per existing rules, 40% of the senior duty posts of IAS officers in the state is the maximum number of officers who can be on central deputation at a time. Since there are 126 senior duty posts in the state currently, 50 is the maximum number of officers who can be on Central deputation. While the quota used to be mostly full till the end of the tenure of the previous UPA government, the number has been dropping since then. At present, only 20 officers (15.8%) are on Central deputation, the records show.The NDA government had come up with an ambitious plan to reform the civil services by bringing in fresh talents from outside in the posts that were originally being filled by IAS officers. In 2019, it had recruited nine persons from outside the government for filling up joint secretary posts in nine ministries. Last year, the Centre short-listed 31 candidates from the private sector and public sector undertakings for filling up positions at senior and mid-level positions in various ministries. These posts of deputy secretary, director and joint secretary at various ministries in the Centre used to be filled by officers from Group A services, including IAS, IPS and IRS. The joint secretaries are the third highest ranking officers in the ministries that were filled up from the IAS pool alone. Sources in the IAS say that ever since the Centre introduced such reforms, the charm of joining the Centre on deputation is lost.It is under these circumstances that the Centre has now come up with amendments to the deputation rule. The general feeling is that these amendments are coercive in nature.At present, the officers need to receive a no-objection certificate from the state government for their Central deputation. As per the new amendment, if the states fail to give the NoC within a specified time, the officer shall be deemed to have been relieved from the date specified by the Centre.As per the existing rules, the states are supposed to depute all India services officers to the Centre but the proposed amendments say that the Centre will decide the actual number of officers to be deputed. The state government has joined a few other states ruled by the opposition parties in opposing the proposed amendments. Meanwhile, the recent decision of the state government to fix the salaries of newly formed KAS at a higher scale than the IAS has motivated some young officers to leave the cadre by the time they are eligible for deputation. The officers are eligible for central deputation nine years after being inducted into the service.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/policy-change-makes-central-deputation-less-attractive/articleshow/89167569.cms||---

It was the denial of this opportunity that led to the controversy. It is a fact that no necessary political interactions were held in this connection,” he said.The reaction of CPI leadership came soon after all opposition parties accused the LDF government of trying to disarm the judicial body constituted to act against corruption. Though LDF doesn’t discuss ordinances that are promulgated on administrative grounds, the proposed amendment in the provisions of major acts like that of Lok Ayukta are generally discussed between coalition partners before the ordinance is promulgated.Meanwhile, the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday also did not discuss the uproar over the Lok Ayukta Act amendment ordinance. It is claimed that not even the members of the CPI in the cabinet raised the issue during the cabinet meeting amid the hullabaloo over the move to silence the watchdog.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/no-political-discussions-were-held-says-cpi/articleshow/89167571.cms||---

Those who are claiming that the ordinance needs the President’s assent are living in the pre-2013 period as it was in 2013 that the Parliament passed the Lokpal bill, he said. The minister’s remarks came in the wake of the opposition requesting the governor to forward the ordinance to the President for his assent.He said that when an amendment was brought in 2000 in the act, the President’s assent was not sought then. The powers to control the Lok Ayukta completely are vested in the state government and constitutional provisions cannot be overcome through legislation, he said. Regarding the opposition registered by the CPI that the matter was not discussed in the LDF, the minister said that the matter was discussed in the cabinet, and is a collective decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/state-can-amend-lok-ayukta-act-says-rajeeve/articleshow/89167572.cms||---

He claimed that four persons were arrested on charges of abetment to suicide, and three persons including two then BJP councillors – Rajbha Zala and Kamlesh Mirani — were also named as accused persons in the chargesheet filed by Rajkot police. The petitioner alleged that the BJP councillors were named by one of the deceased, Girish Nepali, in his dying declaration.The petition alleges that the investigating agency has taken no legal action against the two local BJP leaders on the sole grounds that they have been named by one of the deceased and not by others. He alleged partiality and lethargy in the probe and termed it a tardy investigation that Zala and Mirani were never arrested and no investigation took place with regard to their involvement. He has sought transfer of the probe for the alleged inaction against the BJP leaders.The petitioner also submitted his complaints made before the police in which he had been alleging involvement of former CM Vijay Rupani along with other BJP leaders. However, the petition is silent on the role of any other leader and insists that the police complaint filed after the mass suicide should be thoroughly probed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/detailed-probe-sought-into-nepali-family-suicide/articleshow/89167573.cms||---

Several arbitration and dispute resolution experts, including seven from foreign countries, brainstormed on the draft rules, in the virtual meeting. Despite India having over 35 arbitral institutions, none of them exclusively focus on maritime and shipper sector disputes. Most companies prefer Singapore, London or Hong Kong for arbitration, thus involving cost and time. Officials said GIMAC is also working towards requesting the Supreme Court of India and High Court of Gujarat to recognize the centre as an appointing authority as arbitral tribunal in the absence of agreement by parties. The government is also being requested to nominate GIMAC as the preferred mode of arbitration in all contracts entered into by all the government departments. GIMAC is being developed by the state government under its Gujarat Maritime University. “GIMAC is envisaged to shape the alternate dispute resolution system in maritime and shipping sector in India with access to the experienced arbitrators, mediators and legal professionals in maritime and admiralty law. We have now taken up the process empanelment of arbitrators,” said an official present in the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gimac-set-to-draft-rules-for-arbitration/articleshow/89167574.cms||---

In its December report, Unesco put forth the concerns of its thinktank, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), in particular about construction of new buildings on the western side of the core walled heritage city zone and its buffer zone. The ASI and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had indicated that no high-rise development would be permitted, but it was not clear whether this provision applied to the buffer zone as well as the inscribed world heritage area. “…But it is not clear from the material provided by the state party (Archaeological Survey of India) whether these have now been fully addressed,” the Unesco report states. Unesco also took note of “media reports that had highlighted problems associated with traffic congestion, pollution and neglected pol buildings in poor condition”. The ASI’s response of May 2018 regarding the efforts of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to monitor and address long-term challenges had been noted by the world body, the report said. In 2019, the ASI provided information about the Hutheesing Jain temple, noting “some conservation work had been completed, but further restoration works awaited the required financial resources”. The Unesco report also drew attention to civil society’s concerns regarding the state of the tomb of Hazarat Qutub-e-Aalam, demonstrating the scale of conservation needed for the building. It is also recommended that Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) be applied to heritage restoration projects, since these can have an impact on the value of property, which should be understood in advance. Unesco, however, welcomed improvements to the local development regulations to support conservation of the heritage fabric of Ahmadabad — particularly for restoration of pol houses. “While a number of tourism and visitor management actions have been implemented, creation of the Visitor Management Plan is considered an essential component of the management system,” the Unesco report noted. It also recalled the WHC’s recommendation that the Local Area Plan (LAP) be completed, with a special focus on conservation of wooden houses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/unesco-seeks-report-on-pols-traffic/articleshow/89167578.cms||---

The court asked the central government to make its stand clear on the issue. The Centre told the HC that if the notification of revocation, which was issued on January 24, is stayed and the arrangement of levying of anti-dumping duty extended, it would lead to irreparable injury to the downstream industry and consumers. The expiry of anti-dumping duty would also otherwise not preclude local industry from seeing re-levying on the goods. The petitioner in this case, Qrex Flex Pvt Ltd, submitted that if the tribunal is not going to hear the appeals, and if the local manufacturers are not in a position of obtaining interim relief, they may also cause irreparable loss to them. As the special bench is not available, leading the local manufacturers to approach the high court, the bench said that a litigant should not suffer because the tribunal is not available. The tribunal has to make necessary arrangements for urgent hearing of these appeals.

The idea is to keep one side of the bridge’s carriageway open for traffic while repair work is carried in the other portion. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) roads and bridges department officials claim that a traffic diversion plan is being prepared and will be released shortly. “We are repairing the expansion joints of Vivekanand bridge oor the new Ellis Bridge which will be labour-intensive. Also there are minor works like waterproofing and plastering that needs to be carried out,” says the AMC official. While explaining the process, the official added that a slab seal expansion joint method will be followed for the joint repairs. “An edge beam made of steel will be inserted between the bridge joints, which is an elastomeric slab. This is the latest technology used for bridge expansion joints. Since the bridge was constructed in the mid-1990s, there were issues with the expansion joints needing modulations every 6-7 years,” added the AMC official. The process followed for traffic flow will be similar to the one considered during Sardar Bridge repairs. “We will not be requiring floating pontoons. Labourers will be required on the bridge deck to replace the expansion joints,” added the AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/half-of-ellis-bridge-to-be-closed-for-repair-of-expansion-joints/articleshow/89167582.cms||---

---||Delhi||We are open: Delhi eateries, bars cheer move||NEW DELHI: The city’s restaurants and bars, many of which had posted morose computer printouts on their premises saying, “Home delivery available”, were jolted back to life on Thursday. Within no time of Delhi Disaster Management Authority permitting reopening of the hostelries subject to 50% seating and lifted the weekend curfew in light of declining Covid cases, exuberant messages announcing “We are open” reached social media platforms and inboxes from joyous food outlets. Ordered shut during a potentially remunerative period by the Omicron surge, the restaurants saw the small revival in their fortunes after financially disastrous years in 2020 and 2021 stalling once again. Food delivery and take away were permitted, but earnings from these were hardly a match for dine-in sales. That is why restaurateurs welcomed Thursday’s relaxation of the closure heartily. Among the worst affected sectors, the restaurant and bar industry also requested the authorities to have a scientific outlook when deciding future actions of this sort and not to make closing of restaurants and bars the default response to tackling the pandemic. They cited examples of cities across India and abroad that tackled the pandemic without shutting down restaurants. Restaurateurs Zorawar Kalra, Priyank Sukhija, Akshay Anand, Dinesh Arora and Amit Bagga also requested the curfew of 10pm to be lifted. They said dinner sales contributed most to their revenues and longer operating hours would allow them to serve more people within the limit of 50% seating. Satyajit Dhingra of Impresario Handmade Restaurants said that constant closures and rules curtailing operations weren’t conducive to economic recovery. “We urge the government to help us with sustainable solutions,” he said. Kabir Suri, president, National Restaurant Association of India, was delighted at the “much-needed oxygen support” for the eateries, but pleaded for lenience in night-time operations, both to reduce overcrowding and to aid the sector’s financial revival. Restaurateur Navdeep Sethi of Klap too said the industry needs further government support, such as in waiver of excise and licence fee for at least a quarter. The industry has suffered unprecedented losses due to overheads like rent and salaries while generating no substantial income. New projects have been delayed, wary investors have cried off and many people have lost their jobs. The restaurants requested the immediate implementation of Delhi’s new excise policy, with reduced drinking age and operations till 3am. Restaurateurs also hoped that the Union budget on February 1 would allow outlets to claim input tax credit and offer loans at attractive rates to overcome their cash crunch. Joy Singh of Raasta cited examples of measures taken by governments abroad to boost the restaurant industry and hoped such steps were announced in Delhi as well. For the moment though, he is happy just to have his outlet opening again.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/we-are-open-eateries-bars-cheer-move/articleshow/89166325.cms||Amin Ali

Passenger movement including both international and domestic passengers stood at 56.84 lakh in 2021 against 47.06 lakh in 2020. While travel has improved as compared to 2020, the overall spending continues to remain less with continued restrictions on international travel. “Travel bookings picked up well in the second half of 2021. With most people working from home, the overall sentiment remained good for long weekend getaways through the year in 2021, particularly in the second half. “That apart, even Diwali holiday bookings continued to remain buoyant with domestic travel recovering very well, so much so that even hotel tariffs had increased sizably,” said Virendra Shah, president, Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI) – Gujarat chapter. As Covid-19 cases receded and continued to remain low due to better vaccination and ease in restrictions, air travel picked up in a big way, according to travel agents and tour operators. “Several exhibitions and conferences were also held at a smaller scale. A lot of business delegates resumed travelling which gave a major impetus to air traffic. “Moreover, the Ministry of Civil Aviation also eased guidelines for airlines, allowing them to operate at 100% capacity. As a consequence, the overall travel sentiment remained upbeat,” said Manish Sharma, president, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat chapter. Even though air travel revived well, as compared to pre-pandemic levels, passenger movement has still reduced by 44% as compared to 2019 when passenger movement breached the one-crore mark. “Non-operation of international flights across most sectors was a major drawback for the travel and tourism industry due to which the passenger movement remained curtailed. With change in visa norms, a lot of students aspiring to study abroad could not go. At the same time, due to the deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections in peak summer, summer vacation bookings were cancelled too, which also impacted air travel,” said Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/passenger-footfalls-at-airport-grow-by-21-in-2021/articleshow/89167584.cms||Niyati Parikh

The Sabarmati resident has been helping people cremate bodies of Covid patients since last year. “I have a job as a store manager at an establishment near Jodhpur crossroads. However, if I get a call about a cremation, my priorities are clear. If needed, I will leave early and make up for it the next day. So, I attend many funerals. Last year was all about Covid deaths. This year too, the number of deaths have been rising over the past few days, and I help families cremate bodies with proper Covid protocol,” says Nayak. Why does he participate in the cremations even when the deceased is not a close relative or friend? Nayak says that nowadays people who know the rituals are thinning fast. “My father started taking me to cremations when I was 16 years of age. His philosophy was that it is okay if we cannot attend someone’s wedding or auspicious events, but we must stand with the family in the death of a near and dear one. Today many do not know how to bathe a body, tie it perfectly and perform the last rites. I try to help people in the last journey of their loved ones,” he says. Talk about Covid deaths and Nayak has several anecdotes to share: “I might have cremated about 50 persons with Covid protocols since the start of the pandemic. Earlier there was too much fear, but gradually, the stigma reduced. In about 15-odd incidents, even the family members of the deceased were not present as they were either in hospitals or ad tested positive and could not participate. On such occasions, we performed the last rites.” Nayak, is now teaching his son and others the details of the last rites, so that ‘traditions don’t go extinct’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sabarmati-man-helps-with-covid-pyres-eases-grief/articleshow/89167588.cms||Parth Shastri

The woman, Sonal Patel, had approached the HC in 2017 with prayers that the accrued dues towards court-ordered maintenance from her husband, Jitendra Patel, be recovered by tracing him in the US. During the hearing on Thursday, the central government’s lawyer told the court that he was awaiting instructions from the ministries concerned. This irked the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri and it observed that this was a classic case of delaying the matter and the State, its instrumentalities were not cooperating with the court, and it resulted in the matter being adjourned for want of instruction from the ministries. The court made it clear that the delay was caused for no fault on the part of the court. “We only hope wisdom will dawn on the officials concerned in furnishing information to the learned advocate,” the court ordered to send a copy of the order to the secretary concerned. The court posted the next hearing for February 17. Last year, the high court ordered the Centre to undertake the process of locating the man in the US and recovering the maintenance money due to his wife. In 1997, a court in Ahmedabad had ordered the husband to pay Rs 1.5 lakh per month to his wife since January 16, 1997, because he deserted her in India and fled to the US a few days after their wedding in 1992. The woman approached the HC for recovery of maintenance money and for contempt of court action against the husband, for not obeying court orders to pay maintenance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-irked-by-centres-delay-in-recovering-alimony-from-us-man/articleshow/89167596.cms||---

The accused, identified as Thaltej resident Mayank Dixit, had allegedly shot the act on his phone and used it to blackmail her into yielding to his demands. He also allegedly threatened to post the videos online if the victim, now 21, agreed to marry anyone. The 42-year-old was a science teacher and motivational speaker at Allen Institute, a centre that offers training for JEE and NEET aspirants, in 2016 when he first met the victim. “Being a motivational speaker, he would speak about life and its philosophy to his students. The victim, who was just 16 years old, became impressed by him. He would give her extra time after classes. After one of their classes in August 2016, he took her to a friend’s place in Thaltej where he raped her the first time,” said an officer from Vastrapur police station. He allegedly recorded videos of the offence and used it to blackmail and rape her at different places in Thaltej and Bodakdev. “Recently, the victim told him that her family had been receiving marriage proposals for her. This did not go down well with the accused who threatened to post her videos online if she agreed to a match,” said police. Scared, the 21-year-old went into depression and remained confined in her room. Seeing the change in her behaviour, her parents and relatives got concerned. When they asked her what was wrong, she gathered the courage and told her about her ordeal. The elders encouraged her to approach the police.

A near total shutdown was observed in the town on Thursday after the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) called for a bandh to protest against the killing. A large posse of policemen led by senior officers have been deployed to avert law and order issues. According to a police official, the deceased, Kishan Bharwad, was riding pillion on a motorcycle with his friend near Modhwada on Tuesday when two unknown men fired two rounds at him. One bullet hit him, killing him on the spot. A senior police officer said two men have been detained in the case. “On January 9, an FIR was filed against Bharwad for allegedly criticizing people of a particular religion and sharing videos and photos of decapitation. Bharwad also made objectionable remarks about some religious figures and said in his social media post that people cannot make blasphemous comments against a religion,” said the police officer. In that particular case, police had arrested Bharwad and later released him on bail. “Though the matter seemed to have ended with his arrest, some of the witnesses in the case say Bharwad was murdered for his objectionable post. However, we are probing all angles,” said the officer, adding that extra police force has been deployed in the town. Ahmedabad range IG V Chandrasekhar; Ahmedabad SP Virendra Yadav; two deputy superintendents of police, five police inspectors and seven police sub-inspectors have been stationed in Dhandhuka. The VHP said Kishan Bharwad was killed by people from another religion as they were angry at him for his controversial social media post. Several leaders of the Gujarat VHP reached Dhandhuka to push for the immediate arrest of the culprits, claiming that Bharwad was targeted for the social media post. “We know that some persons from another faith were angry with Bharwad and had even threatened him recently over that social media post. We want police to catch all the culprits behind the murder of the Hindu youth. They must be tried in a fast-track court. Today’s bandh was successful,” Gujarat VHP spokesperson Hitendrasinh Rajput said. Meanwhile, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal have called for a bandh in Ranpur town of Botad district on Friday. The bandh has been called in protest of the murder of a youth in Dhandhuka on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/youth-shot-dead-dhandhuka-tense/articleshow/89167598.cms||---

The budget should draw a roadmap to address these issues, it added. “Looking into our mid-term target of $1 trillion by 2027-28 for merchandise exports, container manufacturing should be encouraged as we are also pushing for coastal shipping in our country,” said the exporters’ body.“A production-linked incentive (PLI) kind of scheme for container manufacturing can come handy ,” it further suggested. Stating that international trade is emerging as an important component of the Indian economy, it urged for the development of an Indian shipping line of global repute. “We may be remitting over $75 billion or more as freight charges this year. An Indian shipping line, which gets 25% of this business can save $17-20 billion annually. . Some tax concessions may be required so that such ships are encouraged to register in India,” FIEO president A Sakthivel said . tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/exporters-want-support-to-boost-shipments/articleshow/89167601.cms||---

As the news finally came in, Multiplex Association of India (MAI) expressed its gratitude to the Delhi government for listening to the Indian film industry’s collective call to allow reopening of theatres. Rajender Singh Jyala, chief programming officer of Inox Leisure Ltd, said they were optimistic that producers would also plan their releases, which would strengthen the Hindi film content in the months to come and usher in better health for the cinema exhibition industry. “We are bullish about the entire 2022, thanks to a great line-up. We are certain about a great turnaround in the industry from February with major releases lined up, a hugely successful vaccination programme, positive consumer sentiment and settling of apprehensions,” Jyala said. Kamal Gianchandani, president of MAI, said the decision would give the cinema industry the necessary impetus to recover from the impact of the pandemic. He hoped that with the Covid cases falling and vaccinations rising, the Delhi government would soon restore 100% seating capacity and remove the night curfew, which will further aid in the revival. “Governments across the world are maintaining a balanced approach to Covid-19 measures and considering the health of economy together with public health concerns. We remain committed to the safety and hygiene protocols and urge all our state governments to allow us to operate without restrictions on the seating capacity or the operating hours,” Gianchandani said. The reopening of theatres and restaurants also means a boost to the malls as these two are among the biggest attractions. Pushpa Bector, executive director of DLF Retail, expects an increase in the footfall. “While the relaxations will help in increasing the footfall as serious consumers will slowly start stepping out, we will continue to maintain all necessary protocols. Our malls are 100% vaccinated, with all staff, including retailer employees, being double vaccinated,” she explained. “We are happy to welcome our customers back in the safest possible environment.” While the announcement has enthused operators, Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director and CEO of Select Citywalk, said this also meant additional responsibility. “We are aware of the high level of responsibility that comes with this decision and the importance of taking necessary precautions to run a public place in these challenging times,” Sharma pointed out, adding that all staff, business owners and their workers had already been vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/relief-lights-up-mood-at-multiplexes-malls/articleshow/89166338.cms||आमीन अली

Pande, a Congress veteran from Maharashtra who was the AICC’s general secretary in-charge for Rajasthan, was appointed hours after RPN Singh resigned from the primary membership of the party and joined BJP in New Delhi on January 25. Singh’s near five-year term (since July 2017), which is the longest as the state in charge in Jharkhand, saw him work with four state presidents. The Congress, under his watch, stitched a winning alliance with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the RJD which managed to oust the BJP government in 2019. However, his style of functioning upset many senior leaders and veterans who have been speaking openly since Tuesday. State Congress president Rajesh Thakur sought an audience with the party’s central leadership after Singh’s exit. On Republic Day, Thakur flew out to New Delhi and met Rahul Gandhi in the AICC headquarters, along with Pande and former Jharkhand president Ajoy Kumar. “I met Rahul-Ji and briefed him about the party’s ongoing activities in the state. It was a short meeting. Rahul-Ji emphasised on strengthening the party’s organisation at the grass-root level,” Thakur told TOI over phone from the national capital. Congress sources in the state also said that Singh’s exit will put the lens on a few of the party’s ministers in the cabinet of chief minister Hemant Soren. Speaking to media persons in New Delhi, Pande claimed Singh’s exit will not have any effect on the party’s organisation in Jharkhand. “As the in-charge, my primary responsibility will be to bridge the communication gap within the organisation and improve the framework. I am going to Jharkhand soon to take stock of the situation,” Pande said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/pande-likely-to-visit-ranchi-tomorrow/articleshow/89170348.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||‘Jharkhand poorly managed central funds meant for running welfare schemes’||RANCHI: BJP’s state chief Deepak Prakash on Thursday evening alleged that the Jharkhand government has been trying to mask its failures by falsely accusing the Union government of not disbursing appropriate funds for running the social welfare schemes here. Prakash convened a press meet at the BJP’s state headquarters in the evening and claimed that the Narendra Modi government had provided Rs 107.67 lakh crore to Jharkhand between 2019 and 2022 (including transfers and grants) but the Hemant Soren-led government poorly managed the funds and failed to put the money in use. “For two years now, the state government has been complaining that it is not getting necessary funds from the Centre. On the contrary, the Centre has provided more funds to the present government than it did to the previous BJP-led government,” Prakash said. Between 2014 and 2019, the Centre provided Rs 135.010 lakh crore to the state in grants and transfers, the BJP claimed. Prakash further alleged that the state government did not distribute edibles provided by the Centre in 2020 and 2021 and let them rot in the warehouses. “As much as 16.14 lakh metric ton between April and October 2020 and between November 2020 and May 2021 around 1,776 metric ton of edibles were provided to the state for over 1 lakh migrant workers. But the state government was negligent and the people of Jharkhand went to bed starving. It is the failure of the state government that nine districts of the state are still extremely backward,” Prakash claimed. Prakash also alleged that the state government was reluctant in taking the Centre’s flagship social welfare schemes such as PM Suraksha Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana to the masses. Till evening, JMM did not respond to Prakash’s allegations while the Congress party termed the claims as rubbish.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/state-poorly-managed-central-funds-meant-for-running-welfare-schemes/articleshow/89167612.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Now, even the President and Prime Minister discuss Indore’s cleanliness with local public representatives when they visit Delhi” the divisional commissioner said, adding that it’s however yet not clear whether Indore will participate to win the coveted title for the sixth time in the row.“It’s a complaint from many cities (which are competing in the Swachh Survekshan) that they are unable to win the first prize (due to Indore retaining the position from the last five years). It’s then possible that Indore won’t participate for the sixth time and will be kept out of the contest by giving ‘Iconic City’ title ``, Sharma said.Sharma’s statement came on the same day when chief minister Shviraj Singh Chouhan launched IMC’s theme song for this year ‘Indore Lagayega Swachata Ka Chhakka’ on Wednesday.While talking to TOI, the divisional commissioner said that Bhopal-based senior officials had recently informed him about chances of Indore being kept out from Swachh Survekshan 2022 by providing the title of ‘Iconic City’ to guide other cities in the field of sanitation. IMC Commissioner Pratibha Pal also denied receiving any such written or verbal communication about chances of Indore being kept out from Swachh Survekshan 2022. “As part of Swachh Survekshan 2022, IMC has started working on improving the air quality of Indore and has even fulfilled some of the parameters of the toolkit” Pal said.

The deaths were recorded against around 15000 Covid-19 infections each in both the periods.MGMMC Dean Dr Sanjay Dixit told TOI, “Fatalities have increased in the district because of incidental finding of disease in patients already suffering from other diseases.”“It is causing delay in diagnosis in most of the cases because of mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 infections. Till then, the pandemic virus infection is detected, the patient is found already suffering from disease for a long duration”, said Dr Dixit.“In most of the cases, the deaths are occurring after 12-16 days with around three to four days in hospital. The fatality rate has shot up in the last couple of days because of this rise in deaths”, said Dr Dixit.“Overall, in the district, the fatality rate is on a lesser side than that of national average in the third wave. It can go on a downward trend as the infections have begun to dip”, added Dr Dixit.HoD Chest and TB department MGMMC Dr Salil Bhargava told TOI, “Cold weather/dip in temperature cause precipitation of Covid-19 cases. Despite this, the Covid-19 pneumonia is not on the rise in the district.”“The deaths are happening because of this dip in temperature causing association of pneumonia’s bacteria and other disease with pandemic virus for now”, added Dr Bhargava.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/weekly-fatality-rate-now-highest-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/89167617.cms||Antriksh Singh

Reiterating the importance of the project, Simha said that he would go ahead and ensure its completion. The issue was slated for discussion at the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Council meeting, but discussions had to be postponed owing to lack of quorum in the house. Simha sought to remind Ramadas that the project to supply piped gas to households was envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The MP said, “Ramadas had organised the ‘Modi Yuva Utsav’ to highlight the achievements of PM Modi-led central government. The MLA must also extend support for the piped gas project, which is an initiative very close to the PM’s heart.”Ramadas is upset with the roads being dug up in localities in Krishnaraja constituency to lay pipes for the project. MCC commissioner Lakshmikantha Reddy confirmed to TOI that Ramadas had written to the civic agency, drawing attention to the condition of the roads being dug up for the piped natural gas project.“The MCC will give permission for roads to be dug for laying of pipes for the PNG project only after all aspects of the project are deliberated on at length in the council meeting,” Reddy added.Interestingly, work on laying pipes to supply cooking gas to households is already under way in Hebbal and other localities along the Outer Ring Road (ORR), which fall outside the purview of the MCC. The MCC Council meeting was marked by drama on Thursday, with mayor Sunanda Palanethra getting emotional when she was forced to adjourn the meeting owing to the lack of quorum. Pointing out that another meeting could not be scheduled for another week, Sunanda said, “I cannot hold the meeting on January 31, and I cannot preside over sessions next month. During the last meeting, JD(S) corporators staged a walkout. I did not approve any projects since I was keen on a discussion. Today (Thursday), I came fully prepared to arrive at a decision on the issue raised by the MP, but sadly, that did not happen.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/simha-ramadas-lock-horns-over-piped-natural-gas-project/articleshow/89167621.cms||---

The Hale Undavadi drinking water project, which, once completed, will be able to pump up to 900 million litres daily is one of the initiatives that is expected to help ensure that all resident receive sufficient drinking water. In addition to Mysuru city, water will be supplied to 92 villages in the district and neighbouring Mandya.On Thursday, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and Chamundeshwari MLA GT Devegowda visited the project site to take stock of its status. Among others, the project, once completed, will help supply drinking water to new layouts developed on the outskirts of Mysuru city by Karnataka Housing Board, Mysore Urban Development Authority, in addition to villages falling under the ambit of the Chamundeshwari segment.The project, being undertaken at a cost of Rs 545 crore, is being developed across 123.7 acres, of which 91.3 acres were acquired directly from the farmers. The project site is situated along the backwaters of River Cauvery, with 2,500 HP capacity pumps being installed for pumping water. Among others, scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) are being consulted for the implementation of the project. A plant to treat the water pumped at the site has been planned at Melapura, from whence, it will flow into storage tanks in Vijayanagar and Yadavagiri. Work is also under way on a 22-kilomentre long pipeline that will carry the water from the project site to the city.Chamundeshwari MLA and former minister GT Devegowda said that the project was a long-cherished dream of his. “When I was a minister in the HD Kumaraswamy-led government, a sum of Rs 545 crore was allocated for the Hale Undavadi project. Later, the corpus of funds for the project was reduced to Rs 350 crore. But, if the project is not executed in accordance with the original plan, it will serve no purpose. I spoke to urban development minister BA Basavaraj about this, and he has agreed that the original plan will be adhered to,” Devegowda said.Simha, meanwhile, lamented the fact that, many villages in Mysuru were parched for water despite the district being home to two major reservoirs in the Cauvery Basim. “Once this project is completed, we can ensure round-the-clock supply of drinking water,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mp-mla-inspect-work-on-hale-undavadi-water-project/articleshow/89167622.cms||---

---||Raipur||CM Bhupesh Baghel & Raman spar over Chhattisgarh’s fiscal health||RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh’s fiscal health is becoming a political debate with BJP vice-president and former chief minister Raman Singh taking a dig at the state government for directing corporations and boards to transfer its excess funds to ‘K deposit’, questioning whether the state has gone bankrupt. Chief minister countered it by releasing on social media copies of similar orders issued during the previous BJP regime saying the BJP leader is apparently having ‘memory loss”. In a tweet on Thursday, former chief minister Raman Singh released copy of an order by the state finance department directing chief executive Officers (CEOs) and managing directors of 20 state owned corporations and boards to deposit the surplus amount in their respective banks to the state government’s K deposit. A K-deposit is a civil account maintained by state governments to keep funds without incurring any interest cost and the balance in K-deposit helps states present a picture of solvency and creditworthiness. The 20 corporations and boards, which have been asked to transfer its surplus funds to the K-deposit, include state road development corporation, text book corporation, khadi gramodyog board, marketing corporation limited, state beverages corporation, state industrial development corporation, medical services corporation, mineral development corporation, tourism development board, state infrastructure corporation and the board of secondary education. “Has the Chhattisgarh government has gone bankrupt?”, the former chief minister said in his tweet saying that “perhaps no other state has asked to transfer its funds meant for emergency use to the state’s K-deposit”. This is the situation even after availing of a loan of more than Rs 51,000 crore. Bhupesh Baghel has converted Chhattisgarh into an ATM for the Congress party”, the former chief minister alleged. Countering the BJP vice-president’s allegations, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel promptly took to Twitter and Facebook four copies of 2013 orders, issued during Raman Singh’s tenure as chief minister, asking boards and corporations to transfer its surplus funds to the state government’s K-deposit. “Dr Sahib, I am concerned. Are suffering from memory loss?”. The chief minister, however, did not explain anything further. Maintaining that the state’s fiscal health is good, the finance department clarified that the corporations or boards concerned can withdraw the money from the K-deposit with the finance department approval whenever they need to make a payment, asserting that the present decision was taken for better regulation of funds. Last week, opposition parties had mounted an attack on the Bhupesh Baghel government after the Union Bank of India took ‘symbolic possession’ of a defaulter property of Naya Raipur Development Authority (NRDA) after it failed to repay a loan of Rs 317.79 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/baghel-raman-spar-over-chhattisgarhs-fiscal-health/articleshow/89167633.cms||---

BSF is working on a border tourism model a little beyond Tanot Mata temple to create a Waghah-Attari border like charm.The initiative will commence in the form of Beating Retreat ceremony at Babliyan post next month and would be soon extended to Bikaner’s Sanchu and Khajuwala border posts.IG, BSF (Rajasthan Frontier) Pankaj Goomar on Tuesday said that every citizen of the country has a wish to visit the international border and keeping this in mind, the BSF has been working on a model to develop tourism at the border posts close to the border."For this, a stadium with a seating capacity of 2,000 visitors has already been built at Babliyan post. In the beginning, we would hold Beating Retreat event like the one at Atari border from next month," said Goomar adding that Pakistan would not be a part of this event for now. BSF has taken this initiative in association with the state government. While fulfilling the wish of the citizens to have a glimpse like Wagah-Attari Indo-Pak border, this initiative is also aimed at instilling in the visitors a sense of patriotism. A large number of tourists and devotees visit Tanot Mata temple every year and almost all of them nurture a wish to visit the Indo-Pak border, which is about 20 km from the temple. But in absence of any such permission, they have to go back with an unfufilled wish.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/bsf-to-start-border-tourism-at-3-posts/articleshow/89167644.cms||---

He said, “Development and investment in any state depends on its law and order situation. In such a situation, it is the direct responsibility of the district superintendents of police to maintain the atmosphere of peace and harmony in the state as well as present a clean and fair image of the police.” The police officers can easily meet the complainants and hear them sensitively to strengthen the public's confidence in the police. The supervisory police officers up to the circle, sector and district level should also be involved directly with the complainants. Such efforts should be made that the complainant does not have to come to the CM’s office or any other higher level. The chief minister directed the officers to make suggestions to make a law in the upcoming assembly session for effective prevention of organized and unorganized crimes. He said that there is a great danger to the future generation from organized crime including illegal drug trade. He also directed the SOG to launch a helpline soon. Gehlot said that in some cases it has been seen that correct information could not be received on the occurrence of crime or incident. Officers should develop a system at the lower level, to receive correct information about the incidents in time so that quick action can be taken in bringing justice to the victim. He also directed that effective monitoring of stock should be done with arms dealers to check illegal arms. The minister of state for home Rajendra Singh Yadav said that there is a need to crack down on illegal cartridges. There should be effective monitoring of the sale of cartridges from the gun dealer.

---||Jaipur||Timings, curfew hit restaurant business in Jaipur||JAIPUR: On Republic Day, malls in the city ran out of parking space. People witnessed parking chaos at almost every mall. The reason was that it was a public holiday when the malls were not closed. Since the Sunday lockdown kicked in, office goers hardly had time for shopping, leading to a chock-a-block crowd in malls on January 26. “Since malls remain closed on Sundays and timing for week-days getting reduced to 8 pm in the evening, office goers hardly find time for shopping. That was the reason why a large number of people visited malls on Republic Day,” said Vikas Joshi, general manager of Pink Square mall. The effectiveness of curfew timings has been a major debate in the town in curbing the spread of the coronavirus. While hotels, restaurants, mall managers, traders, shop owners all have been arguing that the reduction in business hours is only creating crowds or concentration of people, the state government is in no mood to buy their arguments. Varun Behl, owner of a restaurant chain in the city said, “Sunday curfew has led to the bigger hit. It’s a very big day for hotels and restaurants. Tourists generally come down to Jaipur from nearby cities and towns on week-ends. Since there is a lockdown on Sundays, the inflow of tourists has come down drastically. Besides tourists, the locals who used to go out with their families on a holiday and dine out are unable to do so. Sunday contributes to 25-30 per cent of total weekly sales. That is where the restaurants have got the biggest setback.” Behl said instead of time reduction, the government should look at capacity of the restaurants and social distance. “How does time matter? If the same people can come during the day, why not at night? The issue here is social distance, not day or night,” added Behl. Since the curfew starts at 10 pm, people planning to dine out do not go after 8.30 or 9 pm. As per industry estimates, dinner services contribute 70 per cent to the total revenues of a restaurant. Aziz Panwar, owner of restaurants, said, “Business was good till January 2, but after that it suddenly declined. Restaurants are losing 40per cent of their normal business due to the curtailed timings and Sunday curfews. Online sale is not profitable compared to dine out sales as the food delivery platforms charge 28 per cent commission. Additionally, the restaurants offer a 10-12 per cent discount to stay competitive. Payments also come after a week’s time.” Panwar said families are not coming out due to the curtailed timings. “I opened a new outlet in Kukas. Initially it did well. But since the timing restrictions came in, the business declined suddenly. We cannot expect people to finish dinner by 9.30 PM and take another half an hour to reach home,” added Panwar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/timings-curfew-hit-restaurant-biz/articleshow/89167665.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Jaipur||Mahouts wait for promised cash to feed captive jumbos||Jaipur: The caretakers at Haathigaon, who are struggling to feed the 88 captive elephants after new coronavirus variant hit hard, continue to wait for the final installment of the grant which was provided to them under chief minister relief fund. Many alleged that the forest department failed to provide the entire grant to the elephant owners, which was announced with much fanfare in July 2021. The chief minister had announced to provide Rs 4.20 crore to provide relief to the owners. The share per elephant was approximately Rs 4, 42,105. An elephant owner said, “We are still waiting for the final installment. Under this, each owner will be provided with Rs 80,205. Till date, the owners have received two installments of Rs 3, 15,900 and 46,000 respectively. Despite several reminders, the department is not releasing the funds in difficult times.” Elephant owners claimed tourism was paralysed after a few Indians, who were visiting, also stopped after the new variant it the country. Mahout Balu Khan is now jittery as the situation is expected to continue.According to the mahouts, an adult elephant eats around 350kg of food per day. They are facing a double whammy as not only their earnings have ceased during the pandemic, but prices of most of the food items, including sugarcane, have gone up. “Earlier, sugarcane rates were Rs 300 per quintal. Now rates have increased and we are receiving it for Rs 450. An average maintenance of one elephant is between Rs 3000- 3,500 per day,” Khan said.Earning of the mahouts, who own these elephants, has come to an end and without an urgent bailout, fear of hunger and survival looms large over these animals and their caretakers.“The funds provided by the state government were exhausted. The mahouts had created an ‘elephant welfare fund’ in 2005. An amount of Rs 20 from every ride was deposited in the fund, which is monitored by the forest department. The department should provide elephant owners their money at the time of crises,” said a mahout, who wished not to be named.For the last two years, Haathigaon has been hit hard in the peak tourist season and there is rising concern over feeding these giants till the time normalcy returns.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/mahouts-wait-for-promised-cash-to-feed-captive-jumbos/articleshow/89167668.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Deception key to skill-set of Ravi Bishnoi||Jaipur: It was only a matter of time before Ravi Bishnoi received his maiden national call. On Wednesday night, the wait was finally over.The 21-year-old leg-spinner made it to the 18-member squad for the upcoming T20I and ODI series against the West Indies. The news followed close on the heels of the new IPL franchise, Lucknow Super Giants, buying him for Rs 4 crore as one of the three draft picks.Naturally, there has been no stopping celebrations at the Bishnoi household and Spartans Cricket Academy in Jodhpur since the last one week.“Both at his home and at the academy, we have been in celebration mode for many days. We were dancing and singing till late last night. We were expecting his inclusion in the India squad. In fact, for the last six months, we were hopeful as he did well in the IPL and also in the domestic circuit. With 2022 T20 World Cup coming up after nine months, I think it became obvious after his performances that the national selectors would like to test him at the international level,” said Bishnoi’s coach Pradyot Singh Rathore, who runs the Spartans academy along with his friend Shahrukh Pathan where the spinner trains.With Punjab Kings, for which he made his IPL debut in 2020, the Rajasthan bowler has taken 24 wickets and has an economy rate of 6.96 runs per over in 23 IPL matches. At the state-level, he has scalped 24 wickets at an economy of 5.48 in 17 List A games, while in the T20s, he has 49 wickets from 42 matches at an economy of 6.63 runs.After the Lucknow franchise signed him a week ago, the 21-year-old had said he wanted to stay in the present and spoke to TOI about ‘focusing on doing even better for his new IPL team, rather than thinking beyond it’.Now with a bigger opportunity at hand, the young leggie is excited about living his dream of representing India at the highest level, and has been advised by his two coaches, Rathore and Pathan, to stick to his natural game.“Complex nahi rakhna hain...when people come and tell you aisey nahi phekta hain, waisey nahi phekta hain (You should have no complexes when people come and speak to you about your bowling style). People have many times said things about his bowling, but we have always told Ravi to stay the way he is because that is his strength. Bowling deceptive googlies is what that got him so far. And our focus has been on improving his strengths rather than changing his style of bowling,” said Rathore.“We have worked for around two years on getting his googly right. Earlier, the ball used to land on the middle and leg stump. We advised him to ensure his googly landed slightly outside the off stump, so that it could hit the stumps,” shared the coach.It is at the same academy from where the young spinner started since he made up his mind to make a career in cricket. After he was spotted by Rathore and Pathan, who themselves have played age-group cricket for Rajasthan, Bishnoi joined them in setting up the academy in 2015 and even did mason work because of the money crunch.“From joining us in setting up the academy to staying focused even when he was ignored by the selectors, Ravi’s determination has helped him not deviate from his goal of playing cricket for the country,” said Pathan.The leg-spinner was rejected thrice at the age-group level. “At the Under-16 level and twice at the Under-19 level he was ignored by state selectors. We had contacts through whom we requested to give Ravi a closer look and then take a final call. Things fell in place in 2018 when he also participated in the Rajasthan Royals’ camp as a net bowler,” added Pathan. The headstrong rookie also went against his father’s instructions to write the 12th board exams and instead chose to appear for the net session with Royals. He sat for the exams in 2019.Making steady progress since the 2020 U-19 World Cup, where he was the highest wicket-taker, Bishnoi has managed to stay true to his calling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/deception-key-to-skill-set-of-ravi-bishnoi/articleshow/89167678.cms||---

Immediately after Siddhesh decided not to contest the elections as an independent candidate, BJP appointed him as party secretary and asked him to work in Vasco constituency. On whether he supports Janita, Siddesh said, “The party has given me the responsibility of Vasco constituency. I will work in Vasco. With regards to Cumbharjua, BJP has an official candidate there and party workers will work for the candidate. My supporters will vote for the party candidate.” After he was denied the Cumbharjua ticket on Thursday, Siddhesh held a meeting with his supporters to discuss his future course of action. Backed by his supporters, he had expressed willingness to rebel against the party, but a senior party functionary met Siddhesh and convinced him not to quit and contest as an independent candidate. This has been the second time that BJP has denied him the ticket to contest the assembly election. During the 2017 assembly elections, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had inducted Madkaikar in to BJP and had given him the ticket to contest from Cumbharjua. BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said his first opinion was that Siddhesh should get the ticket, but “my opinion cannot be the party’s opinion”. “I can only recommend a name, but the final decision is taken in Delhi,” he said. Both Siddhesh and Madkaikar’s wife were strong contenders for the ticket in Cumbharjua. Reacting to Madkaikar’s statement that Siddhesh can stand for election but he would not get even 500 votes, Tanavade said that he has called Madkaikar and told him that he cannot repeat such statements. Tanavade said that BJP wanted to get Siddhesh into state politics. The party held several rounds of discussions before the final list was declared to avoid members getting upset. As Siddhesh was one of the contenders and his name did not figure in the list, he has been appointed as secretary, Tanavade said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/shripads-son-supports-bjp-gets-secy-position/articleshow/89188227.cms||---

Verma, a Delhi based social worker, who founded Change With One Foundation, under which he runs two programmes, Simply Blood, a virtual blood donation platform, and Change With One Meal, said that this walk is going to be the longest blood awareness campaign ever by an individual, which will run for more than two years. The mission of the walk is to spread awareness about blood donation among people, so that nobody should die waiting for blood in India, after December 31, 2025.Due to rising Covid-19 cases, voluntary blood donation in India has significantly reduced in the last two years. This walk is to encourage people to go out and donate blood, even in this tough time, so that blood banks and hospitals don’t run out of blood. He has covered Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Mahe, Kannur and Kasaragod districts, which is a distance of more than 650km. He will walk towards Udupi, Coimbatore, Madurai and other parts of Tamil Nadu.He launched Simply Blood, after he got to know about the black market of blood. On December 26, 2016, he got a call and donated blood for a patient belonging to a poor family from Raipur; Chhattisgarh. After donating blood, he went to meet the family, and got to know that the person who called Kiran took Rs 1,500 for the blood, that he donated for free. He was also shocked to learn that the woman who paid for his blood, got into prostitution to pay medical bills.He said that according to an estimate, every day more than 12,000 people fail to get blood in India, due to which more than three million people died waiting for blood. If five million youth start donating blood, then there will not be a single death due to the non-availability of blood in India, he said.In 2018, Kiran travelled 16,000 km across India, covering more than 6,000 km on foot, for the same cause. As part of his current drive, he plans to hold four blood donation camps in different districts of the state. Due to the Covid protocols in place, Kiran is meeting small groups of youth. He walks an average of 30 km per day, but had to slow down due to a muscle tear.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/blood-donation-delhi-man-walks-across-india-to-create-awareness/articleshow/89167686.cms||---

More than 90% of the active cases in Dakshina Kannada are in home isolation, and Covid Care Centres, since a majority of the cases are asymptomatic,” he said. Since the majority of the active cases are in Mangaluru city, the MCC has taken up additional measures to check the spread of the virus. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that more cases are found in clusters in educational institutions in the city. “We have appointed nodal officers in all the 60 wards. Similarly, nodal officers are appointed in each of the 10 urban PHCs in the city. Those nodal officers have been given the responsibility of monitoring those who are undergoing treatment in home isolation, and for contact tracing. Officials from the MCC and health department have also been conducting door-to-door visits to identify unvaccinated people in the city. Nearly 50% of the unvaccinated people are in Mangaluru city. We have been no facing issues due to hesitancy from a section of beneficiaries. Initiatives are being taken to vaccinate all the people who are unvaccinated in the city,” Sridhar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mluru-has-76-of-dks-active-cases/articleshow/89167687.cms||Vinobha K T

All the schools have completed their syllabus, which had been reduced by 80%, due to the pandemic.The state government said that the SSLC examination will be held as usual, like before the pandemic, without any relaxations. With this, schools in the district are now preparing for the examination with zeal, even though many students and teachers have Covid-19. Shamanth V M, nodal officer for the SSLC examination, DK district, told TOI that at the moment, all the schools in the district have completed their syllabus. DK is planning for an exclusive examination for SSLC students, with question papers framed by teachers. The examination is called a practice paper. It is formed with 80% of the syllabus, so that students are aware and prepared to face questions that appear in the final examination. The practice paper, which is a liberal examination to familiarise students on the current syllabus, will be held from Monday. The common preparatory examination held across the state is scheduled on February 21. School teachers in the district, fearing a lockdown being imposed and closure of schools that could hamper studies, had slogged to complete the syllabus well in advance. Shambhu Shankar, coordinator, block resource centre, Belthangady, said that though there are rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district, and many students and teachers have been infected by the SARS CoV-2 virus, it has not stopped the learning process in the schools. Schools are continuing as usual, except in institutions with five or more cases of Covid-19, that had to be shut down for a week. The only issue that schools face is chronic absenteeism. A department of public instruction official said that about 5% of SSLC students continue to remain absent from classes every day. The numbers are slightly high this time, since attendance was not strict due to the pandemic. “However, high school teachers are trying their best to trace these children and bring them to school,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-schools-gear-up-for-sslc-exam-amidst-pandemic/articleshow/89167688.cms||---

While beneficiaries above the age of 18 have an option to choose between Covishiled and Covaxin, those between 15 and 18 years are being administered only Covaxin doses.“We have directed the towns to have at least one centre where Covaxin is available so that children in the 15 and 18 years category can get vaccinated,” Misal said.“In rural areas vaccination is being carried out through schools that have been assigned to primary health centres. All children, who are yet to get vaccinated, can get their shots from any of the 15 municipal councils where the centres are being organised,” he added. Out of the total 3.43 lakh beneficiaries in the age group of 15-18, around 1.64 lakh have taken their first dose so far — accounting to around 48% covergae.

The exclusive society has already been registered and it will consist of a governing committee and an executive committee. The 13-member governing committee will have elected representatives, ministers and corporators and the district minister will be its chairman. The deputy commissioner is the chairman of the nine-member executive committee and representatives of government departments will be its members. HDSCL’s MD is its member secretary. Smart City officials decided to form the society to ensure proper maintenance and operations of the assets created and renewed under Smart City Project. They then began legal measures and then got the society registered a few days ago. HDSCL MD CW Shakeel Ahemad said, “Once the assets created and developed under SCP are thrown open for public use, it is very important to maintain them. We realised that there is a need of an exclusive society which can monitor them. If successful, our initiative will be followed everywhere. The assets created are maintained on perpetual basis from their own revenue.” “The Society will monitor MG Park, Tolankere, Nehru Stadium sports complex along with Bengeri shaniwar sante. The society will take appropriate decisions on the expenses for maintenance from the revenue generated,” he said. Mohan C, an activist, appreciated the idea of forming an exclusive society to take care of the assets developed under Smart City Project. “It was a matter of concern on whether the projects developed under SCP will be maintained properly after a few years. HDSCL officials have formed the society for this purpose and we should wait to see how it works,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/in-a-first-society-registered-to-monitor-smart-city-projects-in-twin-cities/articleshow/89167702.cms||---

We will also also take care of persons who are having symptoms.” “Initially, we will open the OPD from 4pm to 6pm everyday and we will extend the timings if there is rush of patients in the days to come. We will run the OPD till the third wave comes to an end. We will provide medicines and other necessary treatment to non-Covid patients for free and will refer symptomatic persons to Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) for Covid test,” Dr Mulkipatil said. He said most of the Covid patients are isolated at home and hospitalisation of patients is very less now when compared to the first and second waves. “If there is a request from the district administration to handle Covid cases in government hospitals in case there is a rise in admissions, we will definitely be ready to help,” said Dr Mulkipatil, appealing to people to make use of the free OPD to get timely treatment and also suggested to undergo Covid test if people have any symptoms.Covid positivity rate has crossed 20% in Dharwad district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/ima-in-hubballi-opens-free-opd-clinic-to-treat-people-with-diseases-other-than-covid/articleshow/89167703.cms||---

Friday is the start of the third phase.Nagesh Kalburagi, the president of HDUDA, told TOI that there were many illegal layouts in the twin cities and it was also causing a huge loss to the HDUDA in terms of revenue. “I have started targeting illegal layouts after taking charge as the president. In the last six months, we have launched a drive in two phases and we have demolished 177 illegal layouts in Hubbballi and Dharwad. Now, we are prepared to launch the third phase of demolition of illegal layouts from January 28,” he said. “Our team of officials will also seek police help to prevent any untoward incident during the demolition and I will personally monitor the drive,” he added.“We have also identified ninety illegal layouts which will be demolished in the third phase. Of them, 36 layouts are built on 104 acres in Dharwad. We will first launch a drive in Dharwad and then start in Hubballi. In the next one week, we will remove all 90 illegal layouts,” he said.“We have served notices to all the owners concerned but they did not reply to our notices and have not come forward to convert their illegal layouts to legal by following norms laid down by the government. Hence, we will start the demolition of such layouts,” he said.He pointed out that most of the owners developed illegal layouts on 3-12 acres without following government norms. “According to government norms, the landowner should earmark 10% of land for garden, 5% for CA (civic amenties), and 30% for construction of roads. Besides, they have to convert their land into NA (non-agriculture) sites by paying fees and must take layout approval from the HDUDA and get the plots registered in the sub-registrar’s office by paying a fee fixed by the government. For all these works, the landowner has to spend at least Rs 6-7 lakh per acre to build layouts legally, but most of the owners have thrown all these norms to the wind and started constructing illegal layouts. After we started the demolition drive, the number of applications for land approval has increased now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hduda-to-start-next-phase-of-demolition-drive-from-today/articleshow/89167705.cms||---

And, with around nine weeks for the end of the financial year, the government may be way short of the target, with the initial public offer by Life Insurance Corporation expected to narrow the gap significantly. “LIC disinvestment amount will be included in this year’s (Budget) because we aim to list it before March 31,” department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told a news agency. The target included a mop-up of Rs 1 lakh crore from banks and financial institutions and Rs 75,000 crore from other PSUs. Although the year had started on a positive note with the Centre hoping to clinch several of the strategic sales in the pipeline — from oil retailer BPCL to Shipping Corporation and Concor — none of them have materialised. Similarly, the bank privatisation exercise, including IDBI Bank, are still on the drawing board. Apart from Air India, so far, the government has only managed to finalise the sale of Central Electronics, which will fetch it Rs 260 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govts-selloff-mop-up-just-5-of-target-till-now/articleshow/89167707.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Gadag farmers continue to wait for crop compensation||Dharwad: The untimely rain that lashed the four districts of Mumbai-Karnataka region continuously for four days in the third week of November had shattered the hopes of farmers who were expecting some recovery from the loss they suffered in August and September. Of all the four districts, Dharwad had suffered maximum loss followed by Gadag, Haveri and Belagavi. As per preliminary estimates, crops worth Rs 300 crore were damaged in the region. The report says cotton and red chilli crops have suffered severe damage, followed by Bengal gram, maize, jowar and paddy. Cotton growers continue to face the brunt of rains as BT cotton grown in parts of Dharwad, Navalgund, Kundgol, Mulgund, Mundargi, Nargund taluks have lost golden yield. Bengal gram too has been lost in 40,000 hectares. In Athani, grape plantations in 500 hectare too have been damaged. Farmers rued that so far only a small percentage of farmers have received compensation while for nearly 95% of farmers, particularly in Gadag district, the relief has been elusive. In Dharwad district, Rs 74.4 crore compensation has been disbursed to 93,401 farmers who have incurred crop damage. This is thanks to the interest evinced by sugar and textile minister Shankar Patil Munenakopp who was the minister in-charge of Dharwad district. But the same enthusiasm is not seen from other ministers and legislators in Gadag district. Nearly 99% of farmers who suffered crop loss due to heavy rains in the district are yet to get compensation for kharif season 2021, said Somanagouda Patil of Ron taluk. “We lost agricultural crops like groundnut and maize and horticulture crops chilli and onion. The government has fixed compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare for agricultural crops. Revenue officials say they have done their job by uploading the information regarding the extent of loss suffered by farmers as per the recommendation of agriculture and horticulture officials. But till date, only 2% of farmers have received compensation and that too not more than Rs 500 each,” said Somanagouda. The situation is similar in other taluks of Gadag district. Farmers from Gadag, Mundargi, Shirahatti and Nargund taluks echoed the same complaint and blamed elected representatives for not bothering about farmers. “Our elected representatives, irrespective of their political affiliation, are busy fighting for their own cause and have neglected the electorate,” said Basanagouda of Itagi village in Ron taluk. Now, agriculture minister BC Patil has been appointed as district minister of Gadag and it is to be seen if he will come to rescue of farmers. The farmers, who had insured against crop loss, said the crop insurance has become a mirage as there is no one to listen to their woes. Allegations are loud that elected representatives are hand in glove with insurance companies and together they are cheating farmers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/gadag-farmers-continue-to-wait-for-crop-compensation/articleshow/89167709.cms||---

Speaking after inaugurating road works and redeveloped roads here on Thursday, Shettar dubbed statements by Congress leaders that BJP leaders were in touch with them as just a gimmick. After elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states, people will realise Congress party has lost its complete base. Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar were under the wrong impression of coming to power, and indulged in fighting within their party, he said, adding BJP is becoming stronger day by day. Before this Shettar dedicated a concrete road from Sarvodaya Circle to Station Road. Senior corporator Veeranna Savadi, Santosh Chavan and others were present. Public irked: For the inauguration of roads, students from colleges were made to stand on the road sides holding roses, which irked the public. People said using students for the function was not correct, ad that too during a pandemic. Reacting to this issue, Shettar said as the schools and colleges are on the road, students might have gathered to express their happiness over the completion of the concrete road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/congress-has-lost-base-in-country-says-shettar/articleshow/89167714.cms||---

He also said that the construction and demolition (C&D) waste policy would soon be notified. Addressing the Republic Day function at Parade Ground in Sector 17 on Wednesday, Dharam Pal elaborated upon the various initiatives of the Chandigarh Administration, both proposed and ongoing. “We have been working on themes of Clean City, Green City and Smart City and making Chandigarh carbon neutral by 2030,” he said, adding, “Under the Clean City project, we have been working tirelessly to set up an improved system of waste management. As many as 524 twin-bin garbage collection vehicles have been pressed into service to collect segregated waste while 622 SWM vehicles have been put on GPS tracking for better monitoring; two material recovery facility centres are functional and processing 200 tonnes of waste daily. The third MRF Centre will start operations soon and thereafter, 550-tonne waste will be scientifically managed.” Stressing on the importance of treating waste, he said that sewage treatment plants would be upgraded to follow most stringent parameters in the country to make treated water reusable for non-contact purposes. “The Construction and Demolition Waste Policy will be notified shortly. We have set ourselves a target of processing 100% waste, including construction and demolition waste, by 2023. No unprocessed waste will be allowed to go to the dumping site,” he announced. On electric buses, he said that 40 electric buses have been introduced and 40 more would be introduced by June. “All diesel buses in the city will be replaced with electric buses in a phased manner,” he said. Besides, he informed that Intelligent Transportation System has been implemented on 358 buses to make the local CTU service more reliable and punctual.

It also said that sewerage treatment plants (STPs) must have an online monitoring system to check the quality and quantity of the discharge.The principal bench of the tribunal, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, asked UT and Punjab to lay a sewage network and complete its treatment in a time-bound manner in Faidan village. Punjab must check collection and treatment of untreated sewage from villages near the Ghaggar and its catchment area and ensure that STPs operate efficiently. The NGT also said immediate action was required to regulate dairies and gaushalas in villages of Chandigarh and Mohali. Grievance was filed by advocate Sunaina against the failure of authorities to install necessary STPs, resulting in pollution in the drain originating from Chandigarh and passing through various sectors and villages of Mohali before merging into the Ghaggar. The discharge of untreated sewage into the drain is a violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Constitutional obligation under Article 243W. Since wastewater in the drain is used for cultivation and washing of vegetables, it is affecting the food chain and public health.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-solid-waste-in-n-choe-ngt-directs-ut-pb/articleshow/89167726.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

But, be aware that conditions apply before you start making plans. The island near Jamnagar which is popular as a marine biodiversity spot will reopen for visitors, who will, however, have to take permission from the forest department and agree to abide by certain conditions. The forest department has framed guidelines for regulated visit of this island with certain conditions after holding discussions with the district administration, Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) and the Indian Coast Guard. The first group from Jamnagar’s Navanagar nature club visited this island on Wednesday, where the members hoisted the national flag and celebrated Republic Day. The island was closed for visitors from 2010 to 2015 and then again since December 2017. Visitors were prohibited on the island after several complaints of intrusion and illegal activities surfaced a few years ago. The forest department had then framed strict guidelines to curb any illegal activities there. The forest department will now declare dates according to tidal condition every month from February onwards to help tourists know on which dates they will be allowed to go the island and apply for permission. According to the forest department, more than 100 people will not be allowed in one day to visit the island. Visiting hours will be strictly between sunrise and sunset. In accordance with the rules, only three days in one fortnight will be given to visitors as on other days it won’t be possible to come back before sunset because of high tide. The visitors will be allowed to go to the island under the supervision of forest staff or being guided by experts and also in registered boats only. No visitors will be allowed to go to the island in fishing boats because of safety reasons. Range forest officer of marine national park, Pratik Joshi said, “We will allow visitors on basis of our framed guidelines. Visitors will have to apply for passes three four days in advance, which will be issued one day prior to the visit depending on the tidal situation. We won’t allow a group of more than 10 people in one trip and not more than 100 people on one day.” Without any mobile network inside the island and looking at its difficult terrain, the forest department has asked elders and minor children not to visit the island. Boat owners are equipped with radios to send distress signals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/pirotan-island-reopens-after-5-years/articleshow/89167728.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Delhi||Delhi: 637 deaths in 27 days, but it’s not just Covid||NEW DELHI: The fatalities due to Covid-19 has touched 25,744 in Delhi, the fifth highest toll in the country after Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In the last 27 days alone, there were 637 deaths in the city, with the viral infection claiming an average of 24 lives a day. On Thursday, the city recorded 34 fresh fatalities even as the daily tally of Covid-19 cases reduces to 4,291, the lowest in three weeks. The dip could, however, be due to lower testing in the last 24 hours on account of the Republic Day, officials said. Only 44,093 tests were conducted on Wednesday. A state health department official, however, was certain the third wave had begun to ebb. “There is a constant decline in test positivity rate and hospitalisations have reduced in the past few days, both of which are good signs,” the official said, cautioning that it was still important to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. About the high number of fatalities in the last 27 days, one of the officials added that most deaths were of patients with pre-existing medical conditions or those who got diagnosed with Covid while undergoing treatment for other serious medical conditions. An analysis of the cause of Covid deaths reported in the state between January 13 and January 25, which was presented in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority meeting on Thursday, confirms this. It shows that in the 439 deaths of Covid patients in the last 13 days, coronavirus infection was the primary cause of death in only 94 (21%) cases. This included 60 people who were unvaccinated. In 318 of the 439 deaths, Covid was only an incidental finding, meaning the patient was admitted for other serious medical conditions but was also found to be corona positive. There were at least eight fatalities attributed to Covid in individuals who had either met with an accident or suffered burn injury or some kind of trauma. “The Omicron variant, which is responsible for the third wave, usually causes mild symptoms. That’s why over 80% of Covid hospital beds are vacant despite the high incidence of the disease,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president, Delhi Medical Council. “Most people are reporting symptoms such as fever, cold and cough that tend to subside in three to four days.

The stones had been in existence from the later Pandiya period in the village, when it was known as Athoor Nadu.It is said that the village got its name Paraipatti because the armed forces that belonged to the Ramanathapuram Sethupathi kings had stayed there during a war when they were sent to reinforce the forces of the Nayak kings. The hero stones have seven men sculpted on it. It is assumed that they may be the warriors who lost their lives in war, said Karuppaiah.The sculptured men are seen wearing jewellery and swords, and the stone in the middle has three figures of which the one in the middle is a tall man. The two side stones have relief sculptures, which are projected out. On the stone on the left, a man is seen lifting his sword in his left hand and a weapon in his right hand that is pointed towards the ground. The stone on the right hand has the men standing with weapons.The hairdo of the men and the design of the jewellery on the sculptures, which are mostly damaged, shows that they date back to the Nayak period, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/three-hero-stones-belonging-to-nayak-period-found-in-dindigul/articleshow/89167743.cms||---

If a subway is constructed, then the width of the road would be reduced and it would cause inconvenience to the public.A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that it is always open to the railway authorities to choose a suitable place to construct a subway. In the event the width of the road gets narrowed down on account of such construction, there is no doubt the local authorities will take steps to extend the width.The judges said that this petition has been filed under the garb of public interest litigation with an intention to prevent the construction of a subway. However, this petition is against the interest of the general public.Disposing of the petition, the judges directed the railway authorities to obtain opinion from the experts before proceeding with the project. The authorities should take into consideration the safety of the pedestrians and should ensure that there would not be any stagnation of rainwater in the subway.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-refuses-to-stop-subway-construction/articleshow/89167745.cms||---

Only 12,921 have taken the precaution dose so far in Madurai and only 8,104 in Trichy. The special vaccination drive for the 15-18 years age group has also witnessed a fall. A total of 10,852 healthcare workers, 8,153 frontline workers and 17,755 senior citizens with comorbidities were identified in the probable list for the third dose in Trichy till January 31. In Madurai, the 12,921 account for only about 30% of the total 43,688 beneficiaries targeted to be eligible till January 31. On Thursday, only 1100 beneficiaries including 350 from rural and 650 from urban areas took the precaution dose in Madurai whereas in Trichy less than 100 people took the booster dose on Wednesday. “All those who are due for the precaution dose are getting SMS message alerts. We have also communicated to healthcare workers and frontline workers as well to get the precaution dose. A large number of healthcare workers have got the precaution dose. We are trying to ensure easy accessibility too,” said a health official in Madurai. At Government Rajaji Hospital, most doctors, nurses and workers have come forward to take precaution dose.As the booster dose is administered in normal camps, some senior citizens are hesitant to venture out as they may be exposed to Covid-19. “Eligible residents are making inquiries. Since some of them have normal flu symptoms, they say that the third dose can be taken later,” a medical officer in Trichy Corporation said. To overcome the lull, the civic body in Trichy is extensively promoting doorstep vaccination for the aged population. Still, the number of calls has come down in the past week. With schools closed, the children were told to take the jab along with the adults at public vaccination camps. But for the past three days, the coverage for the 15-18 years age group has been stagnant at 86.5%. “As schools are to be opened next month, we will improve the coverage,” the official added.Private hospitals in Madurai are trying to insist on ensuring that all their eligible staff get the precaution dose. Some who caught Covid-19 have indeed not been able to take the jab. “As long as someone tests negative for Covid-19 and are eligible for the precaution dose, they can get the jab without fear. Senior citizens in particular must understand the importance of getting the precaution dose and come forward as they are most vulnerable to Covid-19,” said a Madurai corporation health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/turnout-dips-for-dose-3-jab-for-teens/articleshow/89167747.cms||---

The Cumbharjua candidature was given to sitting MLA Pandurang Madkaikar’s wife and Old Goa sarpanch Janita, while the Santa Cruz ticket went to sitting MLA Antonio Fernandes. BJP held several rounds of discussions before the final list was declared to avoid members getting upset in these constituencies. A day after he joined BJP, former Congressman and former Calangute sarpanch was also named in the list as its candidate for Calangute. Sequeira, who had openly supported former BJP Calangute MLA Michael Lobo in 2012, will take on Lobo who is the Congress candidate for Calangute. In Santa Cruz, there were three candidates in the race — sitting MLA Fernandes, Chimbel ZP member Girish Uskaikar and da Cunha. While Monserrate was strongly pushing for da Cunha’s candidature, the local BJP mandal opposed his candidature stating that they did not want any candidate from outside the constituency. After several rounds of discussions with the mandal and Monserrate, BJP decided to give the ticket to Fernandes. “I told the party that whichever candidate is given the ticket, I will wholeheartedly work to get him elected,” Monserrate told TOI. Immediately after he was denied the Cumbharjua ticket, Siddhesh held a meeting with his supporters to discuss his future course of action. This is the second time that BJP has denied him a ticket. During 2017 assembly elections, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had inducted Madkaikar in BJP and given him the ticket to contest from Cumbharjua.

While Monserrate was strongly pushing for da Cunha’s candidature, the local BJP mandal opposed his candidature stating that they did not want any candidate from outside the constituency. After several rounds of discussions with the mandal and Monserrate, BJP decided to give the ticket to Fernandes. “I told the party that whichever candidate is given the ticket, I will wholeheartedly work to get him elected,” Monserrate told TOI. Immediately after he was denied the Cumbharjua ticket, Siddhesh held a meeting with his supporters to discuss his future course of action. This is the second time that BJP has denied him a ticket. During 2017 assembly elections, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had inducted Madkaikar in BJP and given him the ticket to contest from Cumbharjua. BJP has announced the name of Narayan Naik for Cortalim after its sitting MLA Alina Saldanha quit the party to contest on an AAP ticket. Anthony Barbosa belonging to the ST community has been declared as the candidate for Curtorim.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/bjps-second-list-out-party-denies-ticket-to-union-mins-son-yet-again/articleshow/89166425.cms||---

Sixteen classrooms at Shaheed Amir Chand Sarvodaya Vidyalaya on Shankaracharya Marg have already been transformed into smart classrooms by installing hi-tech smart boards. On Thursday, education minister Manish Sisodia visited the school to review the transformation process and understand the working of smart boards. “All these smart boards are equipped with state-of-the-art technology that will not only make the teaching-learning process joyful, but also help children learn better,” said the deputy chief minister. “With the integration of technology, children will have access to all online learning resources. Modern cameras will be installed in classrooms for live recording. These recorded videos can be accessed by students and teachers for educational purposes, whenever required,” Sisodia added. The conversion into smart classrooms will be done in a phased manner. Special training will be given to all teachers to make better use of the smart boards for improving the quality of education at schools. “In the past five-six years, the infrastructure of Delhi’s schools has become world-class. Five years ago, there were no benches and proper blackboards in classrooms, today the Delhi government is making those schools smart and equipping them with smart technologies,” said the minister. It was a dream of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar that each child should get quality education, said Sisodia, adding that the government wants to provide quality education to each student in its schools. “We are determined to do that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/20000-new-classrooms-of-govt-schools-to-get-smart-boards-on-their-road-to-transformation/articleshow/89166371.cms||---

The Indian fishermen had been hoping that they would get back their boats sometime.The Sri Lankan government has no right to auction the boats belonging to the Indian fishermen. Hence, the Tamil Nadu government should give thrust to the Union government and get it to influence the Sri Lankan government to return the boats to their rightful owners, he said.“This is a disgrace to the Indian nation and all efforts should be taken to thrust upon that country to withdraw its auction and return the boats,” Panneerselvam said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/ops-slams-lanka-move-to-auction-indian-boats/articleshow/89167753.cms||---

BJP has pitted advocate Akash Saxena against him. The latter is responsible for lodging multiple FIRs against Azam and his kin which led to their arrest. The contest for Rampur is likely to be a straight battle between these two but Congress candidate, Kazim Ali Khan, could prove to be a dark house. Kazim belongs to the nawab family of Rampur and is highly regarded in the area. Aseem Raza told TOI, “Azam’s nomination has been submitted after completing all the legal formalities. He has always won from here and we are sure it will be a historic win again for him. All five seats of Rampur will be won by the SP.

On the basis of the video and the protesters' statement, the police have registered the case under sections 147, 148, 149, 151, 152, 186, 187, 188, 323, 332, 353, 504, 506 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The Jain spiritual leader, who celebrated her 86th birthday at Veerayatan in Rajgir on Wednesday, told this reporter, “It is a great honour bestowed upon me and will facilitate my work of service to mankind.” Asked about the challenges she faced as the first female Jain spiritual leader, she stated, “There were many who opposed my appointment directly or indirectly, but I worked tirelessly and passionately on my mission of service to humanity without regard for caste, creed, or faith, which eventually paid off. I maintained my composure through thick and thin and infused each day of my life with joy and happiness.” The octogenarian claimed that after the atmosphere shifted in her favour, she founded Veerayatan in 1974 that now manages several technical, vocational, and elementary schools throughout the country, providing nearly free education to approximately 10,000 deprived and needy children. Veerayatan was conceptualised by her mentor, Acharya Amar Muni Maharaj, who elevated her from the rank of nun to acharya. Apart from an eye hospital in Rajgir and one school in Pawapuri and Lachhuar in Jamui district, Veerayatan also owns a BEd college in Pawapuri where services are almost completely free. Regarding future projects, Acharya Chandanaji stated that a school, a diagnostic centre, and a vocational training centre had been proposed in Rajgir. She added, “Our organisation intends to open 200 schools across the country, but progress is being held back by funding constraints and government rules and regulations. We must strictly adhere to the rules and cannot disregard them at any cost.” In her message to the people of the state, the spiritual leader emphasised the importance of strictly adhering to the Covid safety guidelines and the well-off members of society stepping forward to assist the needy. She claimed that during the last wave of the pandemic, she adopted 50 orphaned and deprived children who were receiving free education and staying at a residential school in Kutch.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/spiritual-leader-will-continue-serving-mankind/articleshow/89167765.cms||Farrukh Nadim

Approximately 1.5 lakh Covid tests are conducted daily, but the number is significantly lower on Sundays due to the weekend, resulting in a lower number of new cases on Mondays. Nonetheless, the downward trend in the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Bihar has been observed since January 14, when the state recorded the highest single-day spike of 6,541 cases. On January 15, the daily caseload decreased slightly to 6,325 and on January 16, it dipped further to 5,410. On January 20, it fell to 3,475 and on January 25, it decreased to 2,362.

---||Patna||Railway exam row: Two bogies of empty train torched in Gaya||PATNA/GAYA: The angry protests of the railway job aspirants escalated on Republic Day on Wednesday when they squatted on rail tracks in Gaya, Rohtas, Supaul, Samastipur and Jehanabad and disrupted movement of trains for hours. Hundreds of students carrying the tricolour gathered at Jehanabad and Taregna railway stations on Wednesday. They squatted on the tracks and raised slogans against the government. The protests continued for more than five hours and the agitators also burned effigies of PM Narendra Modi and railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. When the students pelted stones and tried to burn a train coach in Jehanabad, the police charged at them with batons. According to East Central Railway (ECR), four trains were affected at Jehanabad and Taregna and 21 trains were cancelled due to agitation. In Samastipur’s Dalsinghsarai Station, five trains were affected, two in Sasaram and one in Supaul. In view of the crowd of students at Sasaram and Bikramganj railway stations, a large number of police forces and officers were deployed. Sadar SDO Manoj Kumar and other officials somehow pacified the agitation. The agitators resorted to vandalism at Gaya railway station on Wednesday and torched two bogies of a train being prepared as election special. The railway protection force (RPF) had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the agitators. Meanwhile, the railway ministry has formed a high-level committee headed by Deepak Peter Gabriel, the principal executive director of industrial relations in the ministry, to examine the aspirants’ grievances. The committee will look into the concerns raised by students in regard to the results of Stage-I computer-based test (CBT) of non-technical popular categories (NTPC).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/two-bogies-of-emptytrain-torched-in-gaya/articleshow/89167768.cms||Faryal Rumi

Following showers in parts of the state earlier this week, the Patna Meteorological Centre issued a yellow alert on Thursday for a cold wave in various areas on Friday and Saturday. In its evening bulletin issued on Thursday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that a cold wave condition is very likely in isolated pockets over Bihar during the next two to three days. Explaining the expected pattern of the cold wave, the Patna Meteorological Centre pointed out in its bulletin that a cold wave is likely to occur in isolated locations across the state’s north-west, north-central, south-west, and south-central regions on Friday and Saturday. According to IMD standards, a cold wave condition exists when the actual minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or less, with a deviation of 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C from the corresponding normal. The anticipated cold wave has been attributed to the state’s cold north-westerly winds. Kamini Kumar, a Met official, claimed, “North-west winds are blowing across the state, resulting in dry conditions for the next five days. They are blowing at an average speed of 8-10km per hour, implying the possibility of a cold wave.” Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in Patna on Monday was 9 degrees C, one degree below the corresponding normal, while the maximum temperature was 18.6 degrees C, five degrees below the day’s corresponding normal. The state’s lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Pusa in Samastipur, at 7 degrees C. The minimum temperature is expected to be in the range of 8-10 degrees C in most parts of north Bihar over the next three days. In south Bihar, it is likely to be in the range of 6-8 degrees C on Friday and 8-10 degrees C on Saturday. On the other hand, the state’s maximum temperature is expected to be in the range of 18-20 degrees C over the next two days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/met-issues-yellow-alert-for-cold-wave-in-state-over-next-2-days/articleshow/89167769.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Delhi||Parents, educators question rationale behind keeping schools shut when other curbs eased||New Delhi: Several parents and private associations on Thursday expressed disappointment with DDMA’s decision to keep institutes shut, pointing out that if cinema halls and restaurants could reopen with riders, so could schools. The Action Committee, an association of private schools, said it had been hopeful after deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia had acknowledged Wednesday that closure of schools was affecting children’s mental and emotional well-being. “The fraternity had expected DDMA to allow schools to reopen but we are disappointed to know that learning has again been compromised. It is high time schools are reopened in the national capital also, as they have in some other states. Many parents had also expressed their concern on the issue,” said Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee. He added physical classes could have resumed for at least students of classes 10 and 12, allowing them to finish their syllabus in a smooth manner. “Schools have undertaken the vaccination drive proactively. While private schools have inoculated 70% of those eligible in the 15-17 age group, 84% of children in this category have got their first shots in government schools,” he said. Parents TOI spoke to questioned the rationale behind the move. Tanya Agarwal, who is leading the campaign for reopening of schools, said, “Are bars and shops more important? When the education minister supports the decision, why does DDMA want Delhi to be the last city in the world to reopen schools?” Saying there was “no logic” in DDMA’s decision, Raveena Sinha, whose son studies in Class 2, said, “It has been over 600 days that children have been out of school. Why can’t it be left to the parents whether they want to send their kids to school or not?” Former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra also took to Twitter and said parents and kids had no political voice which made it essential for those in authority to speak for them. “Just open the schools,” Chandra said. The Delhi chapter of Indian Paediatrics Association has said it will make a representation to the government in this regard. An official said Delhi government was “keen” to call back students of all classes. “The LG said the matter will be considered in the next meeting, which is scheduled for February 7,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/parents-educators-question-rationale-behind-keeping-schools-shut-when-other-curbs-eased/articleshow/89166836.cms||Shradha Chettri

Fadnavis said that those who do not believe in the Constitution will not be allowed to sit on the speaker’s chair. “We would like to demand an apology from the government of Maharashtra for its conduct and for keeping these 12 MLAs suspended for more than six months which is gross injustice against the people who have elected these 12 MLAs. This government which is undemocratic and unconstitutional should apologise,” Fadnavis told reporters on Friday. “I would like to thank the Supreme Court for this historical decision to revoke the suspension of the 12 MLAs suspended by the Maharashtra legislature. It’s a tight slap against the MVA government which has acted unconstitutionally and as rightly pointed out by the Supreme Court that they have acted illegally and irrationally,” he said. Fadnavis said that the Maharashtra government has been acting unconstitutionally for a long time and they feel that they are above the Constitution and that is why they suspended these 12 MLAs for one year based on a story created by them. “These 12 MLAs were fighting for the rights of the OBC community and what was portrayed as happened in the chamber of the speaker never happened, but it was narrated in the House and on the basis of that these 12 MLAs were suspended,” he said. Fadnavis said that the Supreme Court has unequivocally said that wherever the legislature will not respect the Constitution, the court will step in. “I think the SC gave one chance to the legislature to correct itself in the last hearing. It directed the 12 MLAs to represent themselves to the legislature and allow the legislature to revoke their suspension, but the government which doesn’t respect the Constitution did not act upon it, thereby allowed the SC to step into the affairs of the legislature and the SC, today, has quashed the resolution of the Maharashtra assembly,” the leader of opposition said. Fadnavis said that the SC is above everybody, it is the custodian of the Constitution and if any decision of the SC is not complied with by the legislature or the government it would act as a breakdown of constitutional machinery. Reacting to the Maharashtra government’s decision to allow sale of liquor in supermarkets, Fadnavis said that we should first know in whose interest this decision has been taken. “This decision is not in the interest of farmers. Few people have started distilleries and distributorship of liquor companies and to benefit such persons they have taken such a decision,” he said, “We condemn the decision of the state government to make Maharashtra a Madhirarashtra.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sc-revoking-suspension-of-12-mlas-slap-on-mva-govts-face/articleshow/89188316.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 115-ft-high tricolours come up at 75 spots to instil patriotism||NEW DELHI: To pay homage to freedom fighters and instil a sense of patriotism among the residents of Delhi, the AAP government on Thursday installed 115-foot-high Tricolours at 75 more locations in the national capital. After hoisting one such flag at Timarpur near Delhi University, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhiites must see at least two-three national flags around them every time they step out of the house. The government plans to install such flags at 500 locations across the city. Five flags were put up on August 15 last year. According to officials, AIIMS roundabout, Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium near ITO, Signature Bridge, Akshardham temple, Dwarka court, Model Town Metro station, Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies, Rohini, Rajghat, Mayur Vihar Phase II and Apsara Border are some of the locations where the Tricolours were installed. In August 2021, the flags were installed in East Kidwai Nagar, Patparganj, Shakur Basti, Kalkaji and Dwarka. “Seeing Tiranga fly high with pride instils a stronger sense of deshbhakti in everyone. Delhi is perhaps the only city in the world to have installed the country’s national flag on such a large scale. We are examining our achievement, hopefully we have secured a record in Guinness World Records,” Kejriwal said. The government had wanted to install all 500 flags by January 2022, but the process got delayed due to the restrictions on construction activities due to high pollution levels and then the surge in Covid-19 cases, he added. PWD minister Satyendar Jain said most of the flags had been installed at roads under the department’s jurisdiction. “We identified 75 locations at key intersections, in schools and on main roads to ensure that every single resident of Delhi comes across these little monuments of pride in their neighbourhoods or while travelling even within a range of 2km,” he said. “Tiranga is a constant reminder of the unity in our diversity. It should and will be honoured.” Jain pointed out that the department had followed the 2002 Flag Code of India rules while installing the flags. Adequate lighting has been given priority and each foundation has been painted red and white, he added. While presenting the Deshbhakti budget of Rs 69,000 crore for the 2021-22 fiscal, the government decided to install the flags to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Independence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/115-ft-high-tricolours-come-up-at-75-spots-to-instil-deshbhakti/articleshow/89166381.cms||---

So far, they got either economic zones that were too large for their pocket or sites that are too remote.Janata Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association president Jaswinder Singh Thukral said: "Ludhiana has several new and upcoming industrial areas but, unfortunately, the land cost there is very high, while the industrial corridors under construction are too far away from the city and supply system to be ideal sites for small-scale units."Lakhs of small manufacturers need a proper industrial space because they have no room for expansion in the mixed land use (MLU) areas. Shifting to a new site is the only alternative. The new land for the small industry needs to be both accessible and affordable for the small businessmen. Thukral said: We ask all the parties that whoever forms the next state government should consider fulfilling our demand."Ludhiana Business Forums general secretary Narinder Mittal said: "An special area for the small industry is the need of the hour and we hope the next government works in this direction. The micro and small industry is the backbone of the medium and large-scale units. If we don’t function smoothly, the bigger units will struggle as well."United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association former president Iderjit Singh Navyug said: "It would be in best interest of the small industry if some factory zones with plots sizes of 100 to 500 square yards come up either towards Gill village or on the Canal Road towards Doraha, because these areas have good access to road, besides other infrastructure. But it should be ensured that the land cost doesn’t cross Rs 1,000 for each square yard."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/small-units-seek-affordable-accessible-industrial-areas/articleshow/89167779.cms||Mohit Behl

The youth years are from 15 to 24. Garcha said: “In the age group of 10 to 13, we observe a spike in secondary sex. After 14, children start building a separate identity from their parents and making new relationships with peers and opposite sex, in their desire for experimentation. By the age of 17 or 19, they have a distinct identity, well-formed opinions, and independent ideas.”Keeping this in mind, the Adolescent Education Programme has been launched in the district’s government schools. The children in classes VIII to XII in 533 middle, high, and senior secondary schools of Ludhiana district will be sensitised about drug abuse, adolescent reproductive health, and HIV-Aids, besides being given sex education and lessons on gender equality.This programme is about physical, physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, and interpersonal issues of reproductive health. This knowledge will give the schoolchildren a proper understanding of the process of growing up and inculcate in them a healthy attitude towards sex, respect for the opposite gender, and awareness of responsible sexual behaviour. This will help them understand the implications of AIDS, the causes and consequences of HIV infection, as well as the ways and means of preventing it.An advocacy programme was conducted at Government Senior Secondary Smart School on the campus of Punjab Agricultural University on Tuesday, where principal Garcha and Youth Services assistant director Yadvinder Singh were the resource people. The deputy district education officers, nodal officers for this programme, were in attendance. They will take his programme to 5,057 schools of the state, where they will train a female and a male teacher of each campus.State project coordinator (science) and district nodal officer Sushil Bhardwaj said about the programme that: “It is high time to sensitise children about they issues they can’t discuss freely with their parents. We have been sensitising the children through the online medium but now offline activities such as painting competitions, role plays, and dances will be used to communicate the message.” The State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) will share the schedule. Moga will be the first aspirational district to distribute this educational content among the students.Assistant nodal officer Pradeep Chhabra said: “We will try to channelise the students’ energy through interactive teaching and life-skill education.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/adolescence-now-starts-at-9-new-course-to-sensitise-schoolchildren/articleshow/89167780.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Ludhiana||Garbage collection points to be monitored by 86 CCTV cameras||Ludhiana: In order to keep a check on dumping and segregation of waste, the civic body is all set to install CCTV cameras at secondary garbage collection points across the city. These CCTV cameras will be linked with a integrated command and control centre, and officials will be able to keep a tab on garbage collection and segregation while sitting in the command & control unit. A survey has been recently conducted at all secondary garbage collection points, and the list is ready where these cameras will be installed. The idea is to keep a check at all garbage collection points because segregation at dumps remains a big question mark. The officials have been claiming that they have directed garbage collectors to bring segregated waste at the secondary points, but since garbage processing is not happening these days at the main dump or even even at the secondary garbage collection points, waste is being dumped in a non-segregated format. In the previous visit by National Green Tribunal monitoring committee members too, issue of non segregated waste at the main dumps was highlighted and officials had to bear the brunt. One of the officials claimed that in the next few months, static compactors will cover the secondary garbage collection points and when CCTV cameras will be installed , it would become easy to keep an eye on the ongoing activities at the dumps. The static compactors will help in keeping the waste in segregated form and in case the waste collectors do not follow the instructions, they will be caught on cameras. A senior MC officials, while confirming the move, said, "We have conducted a survey and very shortly cameras will be installed at garbage collection points. The monitoring will be through ICCC.”Notably, the city generates 1100 tons of garbage daily and MC officials in papers have claimed that they are doing 50 percent segregation of waste but actually segregation is not taking place from households and even at dumps. At the main garbage dump at Tajpur Road too, garbage is being piled up like before.The 86 cameras will be installed at garbage dump in Books market, Field Ganj, Backside dental college, Khwaja Kothi Chowk, Near petrol pump in salem Tabri, Duke point at GT road, charan Hosiery, cremation ground Bajwa Nagar bridge, Priknit hosiery ground, Gehlewal, Green Belt Salem Tabri, Transport Nagar, scooter market, Dugri compactor, Feroze Gandhi Market etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/garbage-collection-points-to-be-monitored-by-86-cctv-cameras/articleshow/89167782.cms||---

During the rainy season, the constituents get dirty drinking water. The area has no government hospital, charitable medical facility, or college." Voter Gautam Dang of Model Town pointed to unsanitary conditions, saying: "The entrance to Model Town is from under a bridge where garbage is dumped. Yes, water logs on the streets in the rainy season but it is not that big a problem. The roads are decent."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/defending-atam-nagar-fort-bains-under-heavy-rival-fire/articleshow/89167785.cms||Shariq Majeed
