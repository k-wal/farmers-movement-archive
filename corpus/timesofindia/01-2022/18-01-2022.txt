---||World||Americans must...protect the sacred right to vote: Biden on birth anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr||ATLANTA: Americans must commit to the unfinished work of Martin Luther King Jr, delivering jobs and justice and protecting "the sacred right to vote, a right, from which all other rights flow", President Joe Biden said Monday. "It's time for every elected official in America to make it clear where they stand," Biden added. "It's time for every American to stand up. Speak out, be heard. Where do you stand?" Major holiday events included marches in several cities and the annual Martin Luther King Jr service at the slain civil rights leader's Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where US Sen. Raphael Warnock is the senior pastor. Pews have been packed by politicians in past years, but given the pandemic, they offered pre-recorded speeches instead. Monday would have been the 93rd birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr who was just 39 when he was assassinated in 1968 while helping sanitation workers strike for better pay and workplace safety in Memphis, Tennessee. King's eldest son criticised Biden and Congress as a whole on Monday for failing to pass voting rights legislation, even as 19 Republican-led states have made it harder to vote in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims about election-rigging. "You were successful with infrastructure, which is a great thing -- but we need you to use that same energy to ensure that all Americans have the same unencumbered right to vote," Martin Luther King III said. Senate Republicans remain unified in opposition to the Democrats' voting bills. Biden described their stonewalling as part of "a true attack on our democracy, from the January 6 insurrection to the onslaught of Republican anti-voting laws in a number of states". "It's no longer just about who gets to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote. And whether your vote counts at all. It's about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion," Biden said. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate's Black Republican, countered with a series of King Day-themed videos he said would emphasise positive developments on civil rights. Scott sidestepped criticism about GOP actions and accused Democrats of labeling his party members as racists. "To compare or conflate people who oppose his positions as being racists and traitors to the country is not only insulting and infuriating, it's dead wrong," Scott told The Associated Press. King, who delivered his historic "I Have a Dream" speech while leading the 1963 March on Washington and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, considered racial equality inseparable from alleviating poverty and stopping war. His insistence on nonviolent protest continues to influence activists pushing for civil rights and social change. The US economy "has never worked fairly for Black Americans - or, really, for any American of colour", treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech delivered Monday, one of many by national leaders acknowledging unmet needs for racial equality on Martin Luther King Day. Yellen referred to King's famous speech in remarks she recorded for delivery at the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network breakfast in Washington, noting the financial metaphor he used when describing the founding fathers' promises of equality. King said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial that "America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of colour are concerned". He called it "a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. But we refuse to believe the bank of justice is bankrupt!" "It is compelling rhetoric, but I also think Dr King knew it was a more than a metaphor. He knew that economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice he fought against. From Reconstruction, to Jim Crow, to the present day, our economy has never worked fairly for Black Americans - or, really, for any American of colour," Yellen said. She added the Biden administration has sought to ensure that no economic institution fails to work for people of colour. Equity was built into the American Rescue Plan so that communities of colour would get pandemic relief, and treasury is injecting $9 billion into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions traditionally poorly served by the financial sector. "There is still much more work treasury needs to do to narrow the racial wealth divide," she said. Atlanta's planned events also included a march, a rally and a voter registration drive by the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda and Youth Service America.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americans-must-protect-the-sacred-right-to-vote-biden-on-birth-anniversary-of-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/88959934.cms||---

The teen remained in critical condition Monday as the shooting is investigated.  The 29-year Miami-Dade police veteran who shot the teen was serving on Operation Community Shield, a joint state-federal-local task force focused on violent crime. His patrol unit has been busy in the aftermath of the killing of Miami rapper Wavy Navy Pooh in an ambush shooting on Friday evening.  Police spotted the 15-year-old driving a black Dodge Challenger after another agency asked officers to look out for the car. Officers followed the car and another vehicle for several blocks until one of the drivers noticed they were being followed and a chase began. One of the vehicles got away, and the Challenger crashed into a fence. Several people then got out and ran, police said.  The other suspects got away, police said. The teen police wounded was found with a Glock, and a semi-automatic rifle was found in the car, police said.  The teen was wanted for firearms possession and occupied burglary, according to police. The police officer, a sergeant, was not injured, police said.  On Friday evening, the 28-year-old rapper, whose real name was Shandler Beaubien, was stopped at a light when a car pulled alongside and someone inside opened fire, killing him, the Miami Herald and WPLG-TV reported. Two children, ages 5 and 1, and a woman were also in his car but were not hurt.  Quality Control, the rapper's record label, confirmed he was the victim, WPLG reported. No arrests have been made in the case.  Beaubien is best known for his song "M.I.A.M.I. (Murder is a Major Issue). Its video shows him waving a handgun, a staged murder scene and footage of police officers at actual shooting scenes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/officer-shoots-teen-in-neck-after-car-chase-near-miami/articleshow/88959938.cms||---

Farooqi was behind the March 2020 attack on a gurudwara in Kabul in which 27 Sikh worshippers were killed. Reports of Farooqi’s death were confirmed by locals and close relatives of the IS-K leader in his native region of Orakzai, one of the volatile Pakistani tribal districts along the border with Afghanistan. The shooting incident took place at a remote place in northern Afghanistan on Sunday. His body, according to locals, will reach his hometown by Tuesday. Farooqi had replaced the group’s former leader, known as Abu Omar Khorasani, as the IS-K chief in July 2019, after the group had suffered setbacks under pressure from military operations by the US, the then Afghan government and the Taliban in the Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. In April 2020, he was arrested by the National Directorate of Security (NDS), a spy agency of the former American-backed Afghan government, from Kandahar in connection with a terrorist attack on gurdwara in Kabul in which 26 Afghan Sikhs and an Indian national were killed. Following the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, Farooqi was released from prison, like other terrorists, who were in Afghan jails. There were conflicting reports about Farooqi’s death. Some sources suggested that he was killed during an investigation by the security agency of the incumbent Afghan government relating to organised kidnappers and criminal mafia. The investigation reportedly resulted in a clash and Farooqi, along with his aides, was killed. However, there were also reports that the IS-K leader was killed during an internal strife within the IS-K. His death came a week after Khalid Balti, alias Muhammad Khurassani, the operational commander and the spokesperson for the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was killed in the Nangarhar province. Balti hailed from Pakistan’s northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/former-is-k-chief-who-was-behind-kabul-gurudwara-attack-killed-in-afghanistan/articleshow/88959956.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

On the said date, unknown terrorists had rained bullets upon a police party near the Behibagh PS. Alert cops retaliated effectively, thwarting the terror bid, but the assailants managed to escape with help from an associate. During the investigation, the involvement of two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, Amir Ahmad Mir and Amir Manzoor Ganie — both later slain in anti-terror operations — came to the fore. Further probe revealed the involvement of their associate, Suhail Ahmad, in the crime. Suhail was later arrested along with illegal arms, ammunition besides other incriminating evidence, said a police statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kulgam-terror-attack-chargesheet-filed-before-nia-court/articleshow/88960032.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Last Monday, Delhi LG Anil Baijal tweeted that “given the increase in positive cases, it was decided to close the restaurants and bars and to allow takeaway facility only.” While in Gurgaon and Noida restaurants are open for dine-in with restricted timelines (Gurgaon till 11pm and Noida till 10pm) and 50% seating capacity, the complete shutdown of dine-in at Delhi restaurants has impacted businesses adversely in neighbouring cities of NCR as well. “As has happened in the past, we all were hoping that business in Gurgaon and Noida will improve as Delhi restaurants are shut for dine-in. But that hasn’t happened this time. The reasons are restrictions on dining hours in Gurgaon and Noida and weekend curfew – most people would drive down from Delhi to neighbouring cities on weekends for dining and that is not happening now. It is a very disappointing situation,” says restaurateur and Noida chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) Varun Khera, who has outlets in both Delhi and Noida. ‘Almost 30% fall in delivery numbers across NCR’In the pandemic, whenever restaurants were closed for dine-in and were only offering takeaways and home deliveries, the number of orders were usually sufficient for businesses to stay afloat and run their kitchens with skeletal staff. But in the last one week, even the delivery orders have seen a huge slump, which is worrying restaurateurs. “We don’t know what the reason is for the low number of delivery orders this time, but there has been a sharp decline. Just delivery and takeaway won’t help us sustain businesses in the long run, so we are just hoping that restrictions are lifted soon,” says restaurateur Saurabh Khanijo. Varun Khera adds that there has been “almost 30% decline in the number of food delivery orders from December last week till now.” Restaurateur Vikrant Batra adds, “I am doing delivery service from some of my outlets only to minimize losses. It is not possible to keep the kitchen running at all outlets and incur costs when delivery numbers are not very high across NCR. Also, if we keep all outlets open for delivery and do not get enough orders, we have a lot of perishables and that adds to our losses.” ‘No dine-in and weekend curfew in Delhi is affecting Gurgaon and Noida footfall too’In Delhi, many restaurants do not do takeaways or delivery and have decided to remain completely shut amid dine-in restrictions. But in Gurgaon, where restaurants are allowed to be open for dining-in with time and capacity restrictions, several restaurants have temporarily shut down due to lack of customers. “I know of so many outlets at Gurgaon hubs like Sector 29 that have decided to remain shut temporarily because there is no footfall. When it was announced that dine-in will be shut in Delhi, even I had moved staff and resources from Delhi outlets to Gurgaon and Noida outlets, hoping that footfall would increase there, but that didn’t happen, so we had to send most of the staff on leave. I think after Delhi restaurants were shut for dining, people got scared to dine out in Gurgaon and Noida too,” says restaurateur Varun Puri. Restaurateur Umang Tewari says that time restrictions in Gurgaon and Noida is also deterrent for people who would otherwise drive to the neighbouring cities from Delhi for dining. “No one wants to spend an hour driving to be at the restaurant for just an hour or so. On weekends too, people can’t step out. So, businesses in Noida and Gurgaon are suffering as well,” says Umang. Even though dine-in is allowed in Gurgaon and Noida, various COVID restrictions have limited the footfall (picture for representational purposes only) ‘Survival will be impossible for businesses if restrictions continue for long’Restaurateurs say that businesses across NCR have been impacted and many outlets might face permanent closure if restrictions continue for long. “Restaurants are always the first to be shut during COVID restrictions and last to open. It is becoming very difficult for us to run businesses when we are allowed to stay open for just a few months at a stretch,” says Umang Tewari. Kabir Suri, restaurateur and president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), had earlier said in a statement, “Right from the onset of COVID, the food and beverage industry has been one of the worst-hit. We somehow survived so far, but with the new guidelines in Delhi, it seems highly unlikely that we can sustain any longer. We were shut for most of last year. We have been operating at 50 per cent capacity and restricted hours since then. We had just started seeing some respectable surge in consumption which prompted us to hire back our people but now we are in a fix. These new guidelines, which prohibits dining completely and allows only deliveries, is completely unsustainable. It is like an excruciatingly slow death for an erstwhile vibrant industry.” Read AlsoNo dining-in rule will result in slow death for industry: RestaurateursSince last week, restaurateurs in NCR say they have witnessed an 80% slump in business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dine-in-ban-in-delhi-affects-gurgaon-and-noida-restos-ncr-home-deliveries-down-by-30/articleshow/88956527.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||Delhi||Daily tally of new Covid cases in Delhi drops 50% in 4 days||NEW DELHI: The downward spiral of Covid-19 cases in Delhi continued for the fourth consecutive day, with the city reporting 12,527 new cases on Monday. Data shared by the state government shows the daily tally has fallen by nearly 49 per cent in these four days, from 24,383 cases on January 14. The positivity rate, too, is down — from 30.64 per cent to 27.99 per cent — in this period. Twenty four people died of Covid Monday, a nearly 30% fall from 34 on January 14. A total of 280 such deaths have taken place in Delhi in the last 17 days. Most of these patients had co-morbidities, say hospitals. Experts are keeping an eye on the daily testing that has fallen nearly 44% – from 79,578 Covid-19 tests on January 14 to 44,762 tests Monday. Delhi has a capacity to conduct close to 1 lakh tests a day. However, only half of it is being currently utilised, says a health official, adding the drop in testing could be due to multiple reasons: "New ICMR rules do not require asymptomatic contacts of positive cases, except those with co-morbidities, to get tested. Also, many aren’t getting tested if they have mild symptoms and are recovering at home". ‘Need to keep a close watch on admission rate’We need to watch the hospitalisation rate carefully over the next few days. If it remains constant or reduces, that would establish the declining trend of Covid as reflected in the daily bulletin. But, if the hospitalisation rate goes up, we would need to step up the containment strategy to prevent any potential crisis,” Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket said. At present, the government data shows, there are 83,982 active cases of Covid-19 in the city. Of them, 2,784 are hospitalised. The occupancy of Covid beds is 18%. Of the hospitalised patients, 909 are on oxygen support and 140 are on ventilator support. The capital saw 130 fatalities in the last six months nine in December, seven in November, four in October, five in September and 29 in August. In July, Covid claimed 76 lives in the city. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council (DMC), said an analysis of the recent deaths among Covid patients suggested that less people were dying ‘of covid’ and more ‘with covid’ and, therefore, the government needed to do proper death auditing and categorise accordingly. “This also highlights the need that people should not ignore other health issues and be in touch with doctors for non-Covid problems also,” the DMC president said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/daily-tally-of-new-covid-cases-in-delhi-drops-50-in-4-days/articleshow/88960374.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The victims were caught in a fire after “small flying objects” triggered an explosion in three petroleum tankers near the Abu Dhabi airport. The Indian embassy said in a tweet that UAE authorities had confirmed three casualties in the explosions, which included two Indian nationals. The mission is in close touch with the UAE authorities to seek details of the incident, it said. Another minor fire broke out in the new construction area of the Abu Dhabi International Airport, according to the Emirates News Agency. Preliminary investigations suggest that the cause of the fires are small flying objects, possibly belonging to drones, that fell in the two areas. Teams from the competent authorities have been dispatched and the fire is currently being put out,” it said. This is the second time in the past few weeks that Indian nationals have been caught in the crossfire between the Houthis in Yemen and a Saudi-led coalition. Seven Indians are among the 11-member crew on a UAE-flagged ship that was hijacked off the coast of Yemen earlier this month by the Houthis. Abu Dhabi police identified the dead as two Indian nationals and one Pakistani, the Gulf News has reported. At least six persons were injured, police said, without disclosing their identities. Authorities have launched an extensive investigation into the cause of the fire and the circumstances surrounding it, police added. “However, there are no significant damages resulting from the two accidents,” reported WAM. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed that they have targeted the UAE, without giving details. The Houthi group has taken responsibility for several attacks on Saudi oil facilities in the past.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/2-indians-killed-in-suspected-drone-attack-in-abu-dhabi/articleshow/88960468.cms||---

A funeral procession on the rain-soaked streets of the city Monday morning was followed by services at Temple University's Liacouras Center, to which members of the community were invited and asked to wear white.  Those in attendance at the three-hour service listened to Bible readings, official proclamations and music. Relatives spoke about their loss and their memories of their loved ones from two microphones behind tables bearing caskets amid white flowers and large pictures of the victims.  "None of us know what to do with a funeral with 12 people," said the Reverend Dr. Alyn Waller of the Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. "We're in a space of grief and pain we wish on no one else."  One speaker, an aunt of the children, tearfully said she believed there was "a family reunion in heaven".  "I believe they're with their dad. I believe they're with my mother. I believe they're with my father, their uncles and aunts," she said. "The hurt is deep but it will subside."  The victims of the January 5 fire were all on the third floor of a duplex north of the city center near the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The three-story brick duplex was owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, which is the city's public housing agency and the state's biggest landlord.  Three sisters - Rosalee McDonald, Virginia Thomas and Quinsha White - and nine of their children died in the blaze, according to family members. The city last week identified the other victims as Quintien Tate-McDonald, Destiny McDonald, Dekwan Robinson, J'Kwon Robinson, Taniesha Robinson, Tiffany Robinson, Shaniece Wayne, Natasha Wayne and Janiyah Roberts. Officials did not provide their ages.  Investigators last week confirmed that it started at a Christmas tree but stopped short of officially saying that it was sparked by a child playing with a lighter.  The blaze had been the deadliest fire in years at a U.S. residential building but was surpassed days later by a fire in a high-rise in New York City's Bronx borough that killed 17 people, including several children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/funeral-services-held-for-12-killed-in-philadelphia-fire/articleshow/88960599.cms||---

As per the new schedule, January 25 will be the date for poll notification, February 1 last date of filing nominations, February 2 date of scrutiny of nominations, February 2 last date for withdrawal, and February 20 date of poll. The counting date is unchanged on March 10. The deferment is being seen as a concession in view of the sentiments of the Ravidasiya community who have a sizeable presence in Punjab and elsewhere. CM Charanjit Singh Channi, BSP and subsequently BJP, SAD and Punjab Lok Congress had approached EC seeking postponement of the polling date. They cited the expected movement of many electors who are Guru Ravidas’s followers and travel from Punjab to Varanasi in UP during the week coinciding with Gurupurab. Stating that a large number of voters usually leave for Varanasi a week before Ravidas Jayanti and would therefore miss out on voting were the polls held on February 14, they pleaded with the EC to consider postponing the polling day in Punjab by at least six days, by when Guru Ravidas’s followers would be back. “After considering these new facts emerging out of these representations, inputs from the state and chief electoral officer, past precedence and all facts and circumstances in the matter, now the Commission has decided to reschedule the general elections to legislative assembly of Punjab,” the EC stated while shifting polling in Punjab to February 20. Sources told TOI that the EC had chosen February 14 as the polling date for Punjab after taking into account all festivals, exams, weather and agricultural schedules etc. It had also considered Ravidas Jayanti while preparing the schedule and decided to schedule the polls ahead of the festival.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-polls-put-off-to-february-20-due-to-ravidas-jayanti/articleshow/88960609.cms||---

"Though the last two years have been tough on the education sector in particular, Your-Space is targetting more than 20,000 beds by July 2022 for the coming 2022-2023 academic year. It currently has 7000+ operational beds in 9 cities. Said Shantanu Rastogi: “There is a significant unmet need for safe, comfortable, convenient and affordable lodging & community spaces for the 30 million + migrant undergrad and post-grad students in India. India being one of the largest suppliers of skilled talent across engineering, medicine, law, finance and several other professions to the world, needs high quality student housing operators to address this large and growing demand alongside high quality universities and institutions”. Added Ajay Gupta of Capital Foods, “This segment is growing and has demonstrated growth every year even during economic downturn. The Indian student population base is growing consistently. The future of student housing is going to be driven by technology and building a strong community.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/your-space-raises-10-million-in-series-a-funding/articleshow/88960708.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||India||Another Covid wave but mood positive: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: A fortnight before the Budget, PM Narendra Modi made a bold pitch for foreign investment, assuring all support to investors, saying India has fast-pedalled on reforms and infrastructure and the financial mood is positive even as it is facing another wave. “The spirit of entrepreneurship in the country can provide new energy to every global partner. This is the best time to invest in India,” he said at the World Economic Forum’s annual meet, which is being held virtually. He listed a host of steps and reform initiatives, ranging from a cut in corporate tax rates, to sorting out retrospective tax, the PLI scheme and easing of rules, in what was seen as an indication that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present an investor-friendly budget on February 1. The government is looking for a major boost to investment in the coming months to ensure that the growth process stays its course and more jobs are created in the country. “There was a time when India was recognised for ‘Licence Raj’, the government had control over most things. We are trying to remove these challenges. We are trying to promote ‘ease of doing’ business and reduce government intervention,” he said, while pointing to developing technologies and platforms such as CoWin to deal with the pandemic, the pharma industry’s contribution and sought to position India as a “trusted partner” for global supply chains. He suggested that the proposed free trade agreements with the UK, European Union, UAE and Australia would help and push investment in semiconductors and other businesses. He also listed out the large asset monetisation and infrastructure investment plans lined up by the government. “Today, India is making policies for the present and the next 25 years, it is decisive. During this period, India has set itself a goal of high growth and saturation of welfare and wellness. This era of growth will also be green, clean, sustainable and reliable,” Modi said. While mentioning that India was way ahead of its target on the Paris goals, PM said: “While making large commitments on global goals and the tradition of sticking to them, we have set ourselves a target of net zero. With 17% global population, India may be making only 5% contributions to global carbon emissions, but it is 100% committed to dealing with the global climate challenge.” Calling for a reform of the multilateral agencies, he underlined the need for cooperation between countries and global bodies while pointing to cryptocurrencies as one possible area of coordinated action. Even as the government seeks to strike a balance between regulating or banning private digital currencies, Modi said that given the link with technology, it was not possible for one country to deal with it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-covid-wave-but-mood-positive-pm-modi/articleshow/88960702.cms||---

Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who was among the four congregants taken captive on Saturday, the Jewish sabbath, told CBS on Monday that he and others managed to escape after he threw a chair at the hostage-taker and then rushed for an exit door.  The FBI identified the man as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British citizen.  "When I took him in, I stayed with him. Making tea was an opportunity for me to talk to him. And in that moment, I didn't hear anything suspicious. Some of his story didn't quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that's not necessarily an uncommon thing," the rabbi said.  The rabbi returned to prayer, after which he said he "heard a click - and it could have been anything - but it turned out it was his gun".  One hostage was released unharmed after six hours of tense negotiations aided by the suspect's family. The incident ended in gunfire with the suspect dead as members of an FBI hostage rescue team raided the synagogue.  It was unclear whether the gunman took his own life or was killed by members of the FBI team. The FBI said its Joint Terrorism Task Force was investigating the incident. Cytron-Walker, the rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, west of Dallas, Texas, said he drew on hostage training from the FBI to determine when to try to escape.  "When I saw an opportunity where he wasn't in a good position, I made sure that the two gentlemen who were still with me, that they were ready to go, (and that) the exit wasn't too far away," Cytron-Walker said.  "I told them to go. I threw a chair at the gunman, and I headed for the door, and all three of us were able to get out without even a shot being fired."  Police in England said they detained two teenagers for questioning in connection with the case.  Hate crimes targeting the US Jewish community constitute over half of all religion-based crimes nationwide, the Anti-defamation League said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-worshippers-had-offered-british-pakistani-man-tea-before-he-held-4-hostage/articleshow/88960731.cms||---
---||Business||Petrol, diesel sales fall in January as Omicron spreads||NEW DELHI: India's petrol and diesel sales fell in the first fortnight of January as the third wave of the pandemic starts to bite the economy as reflected in dip in workplace mobility and airline traffic. Sale of diesel, which accounts for about 40 per cent of India's overall fuel consumption and mirrors industrial activity, fell 14.1 per cent to 2.47 million tonne during January 1-15 when compared with the same period in December and 4.99 per cent from a year ago, preliminary data from state fuel retailers showed. Diesel sales were down nearly 8 per cent over the January 2020 period. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus has led to the imposition of local restrictions in several parts of the country, hurting truck movements. Petrol sales during January 1-15 at 9,64,380 tonne were 13.81 per cent lower than the first fortnight of December and 2.82 per cent lower than a year-ago period, the data showed. It however was 5.66 per cent higher than January 2020 sales and continued to stay above pre-Covid-19 levels as people continued to prefer using personal vehicles over public transport for safety reasons. Jet fuel sales fell 13 per cent to 2,08,980 tonne during the first half of January when compared with the month-ago figure but were 7.34 per cent higher year-on-year. It was 38.2 per cent lower than January 2020 numbers. Cooking gas LPG sales rose 4.85 per cent month-on-month and 9.47 per cent year-on-year to 1.28 million tonne. This was 15.25 per cent higher than January 2020, the data showed. LPG sales have been higher on the back of free cylinders that the government distributed to mitigate the fallout of Covid on the poor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/petrol-diesel-sales-fall-in-january-as-omicron-spreads/articleshow/88960762.cms||---
---||India||ICMR norms junk oral antivirals, antibiotics||MUMBAI: Oral antivirals, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies and vitamins have no place in India’s latest Covid management guidelines, which were put up on the Union health ministry website on Monday. Antiviral remdesivir, which is given via an IV drip, is recommended for moderate to severely ill patients on oxygen support. Off-label use of the rheumatoid arthritis drug, tocilizumab, continues for severe patients who don’t improve with steroids. The guidelines come 10 days after ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargav stated that a new oral antiviral, Molnupiravir, has “safety issues”. Many doctors have a different opinion. “The general opinion among the medical community is that this omission is a mistake,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava, who is a member of the Maharashtra task force. The task force’s guidelines allow Molnupiravir for patients who are over 50 years old and have at least two comorbidities and continuous fever for at least three days. “Doctors should have the discretionary right to prescribe Molnupiravir because there is a subset of patients that benefits from it,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathew. The ICMR guidelines state that patients with mild illness need symptomatic treatment for fever and pain and, if needed, a nasal spray of corticosteroid (budesonide). CT scans and expensive blood tests are only recommended for moderate and severely-ill patients. Last week, a group of 35 doctors wrote an open letter to the Indian health authorities asking for updated guidelines that clearly spell out the government stand on new anti-virals and monoclonal antibodies so that “unwarranted medication, testing and hospitalisation” stops. Dr Satchit Balsari from Harvard School of Medicine and one of the letter’s signatories said, “It is reassuring to see that the new guidelines are evidence-based and eschew antibiotics. It is prudent from a public health standpoint that other drugs that have marginal benefit and are unavailable to most people are also not included. I hope state agencies that have distributed drugs en masse now abandon the practice.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/icmr-norms-junk-oral-antivirals-antibiotics/articleshow/88960767.cms||---
---||World||UAE says deadly Houthi attack on Abu Dhabi will "not go unpunished"||DUBAI: Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group attacked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in what the group said was an operation using missiles and drones, setting off explosions in fuel trucks that killed three people, including two Indians, and causing a fire near the airport of Abu Dhabi, capital of the region's commercial and tourism hub. The strike on a leading Gulf Arab ally of the United States takes the war between the Houthi group and a Saudi-led coalition to a new level, and may hinder efforts to contain regional tensions as Washington and Tehran work to rescue a nuclear deal. "The UAE condemns this terrorist attack by the Houthi militia on areas and civilian facilities on Emirati soil... (It) will not go unpunished," the foreign ministry said. "The UAE reserves the right to respond to these terrorist attacks and criminal escalation." The UAE, a member of the coalition, has armed and trained local Yemeni forces that recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing Shabwa and Marib regions. "With (nuclear) negotiators running out of time, the risk of a deterioration in the region's security climate is rising," said Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, in a phone call with his Emirati counterpart, condemned the attack, the UAE state news agency reported. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington would work to hold the Houthis accountable. The Houthis have frequently launched cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but have claimed few such attacks on the UAE, mostly denied by Emirati authorities. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group fired five ballistic missiles and "a large number" of drones at Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, an oil refinery in Musaffah and several "sensitive" sites in the UAE. Abu Dhabi police said three people were killed and six wounded when three fuel tanker trucks exploded in the industrial Musaffah area near storage facilities of oil firm ADNOC. State media said those killed were two Indians and a Pakistani. Police said initial investigations found parts of small planes that could possibly be drones at the sites in Musaffah and Abu Dhabi airport, but they made no mention of missiles. ADNOC said an incident at its Mussafah Fuel Depot at 10 a.m. resulted in a fire. Police closed the road leading to the area, where unverified footage on social media had shown thick smoke. "ADNOC is deeply saddened to confirm that three colleagues have died. A further six colleagues were injured and received immediate specialist medical care," it said. An Etihad Airways spokesperson said a small number of flights were briefly disrupted at Abu Dhabi airport due to "precautionary measures", but normal operations quickly resumed. Proxy fightThe Saudi-led alliance carried out air strikes on Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa, Reuters witnesses said, following the strike on the UAE and after the coalition intercepted eight drones launched toward Saudi Arabia on Monday. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack on the UAE and urged "all parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent any escalation", his spokesperson said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the attack threatened regional stability. There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials, but Iran's Tasnim news agency reported it as an "important operation". Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had moved to engage directly with Iran in recent months to avoid any wider conflict that could hurt regional economic ambitions. The Yemen war is widely seen as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran. The Houthi strike could derail UAE and wider Gulf dialogue with Iran, said UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla. "The UAE is not going to take this very lightly," he said. The attack coincided with a visit to the UAE by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. A Blue House official said a summit between Moon and Abu Dhabi's crown prince was cancelled.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-says-deadly-houthi-attack-on-abu-dhabi-will-not-go-unpunished/articleshow/88960427.cms||---
---||---||In UP’s Sonbhadra, 11 villages prepare to vote one last time||LUCKNOW: Vishwanath Kharwar awaits his last election as a voter from Sundari village in UP's Sonbhadra district with a sense of inevitability that has been part of his life for 45 years. Back in 1976, when the foundation stone of the Kanhar dam project was laid, Vishwanath was barely 10. Four and a half decades later, the time of reckoning seems to have arrived for Sundari and 10 other villages of Duddhi constituency that will be swamped by the waters of the Kanhar river once the project is operational by the end of this year. “A large part of our lives has gone by waiting for the project to commence. But when things started moving, we were handed a raw deal. Each family is getting Rs 7.11 lakh in lieu of their land,” Vishwanath said, demanding a hike in compensation. Residents of all 11 villages that will cease to be a part of the Duddhi assembly seat, numbered 403 among that many constituencies in UP, seem to battling similar feelings as the polls draw nearer. “Things will change for good after this election. The river will flow into our land, and we will all be scattered in different parts of Sonbhadra. I can only pray that our last vote from our village ensures a better future,” said Rani Devi of Sugwaman. Speaking for 25,000-odd voters from the 11 villages, which have a combined population of around 50,000, former village head Gambhira Prasad of Korchi has been approaching various political parties in the hope of getting a patient hearing at election time. “Parties lend us an ear only during polls. We have decided to support those who promise to do something for us,” he said. Irrigation department officials said over 65% of the land required for the project had been acquired, but some villagers were refusing to accept the government’s terms. Gambhira said the villagers want the compensation to be doubled, a job for at least one member of every displaced family, a house each under the PM Awas Yojana and alternative agricultural land. The Kanhar dam project straddling Duddhi is expected to benefit parts of UP, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The project had been launched at an estimated cost of Rs 27.75 crore, which has since swelled to Rs 2,000 crore. According to the project blueprint, a 39-metre high and 3.2km-long dam will be constructed to store 0.15 million acre-feet of water. It also entails construction of 121 km of canals to irrigate over 35,000 hectares, benefiting 108 villages. Overall, around 2,500 families will be displaced by the dam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/in-ups-sonbhadra-11-villages-prepare-to-vote-one-last-time/articleshow/88960858.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||World||US condemns Houthi attack in UAE, vows to stand beside Emirati partners||WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday (local time) condemned the Houthi attack in the UAE that killed three civilians, including two Indians, and vowed to stand beside the Emirati partners against all threats to their territory.  "The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, which killed three innocent civilians. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for this attack, and we will work with the UAE and international partners to hold them accountable," read a statement by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  "Our commitment to the security of the UAE is unwavering and we stand beside our Emirati partners against all threats to their territory," added Sullivan.  Two Indian nationals are among the three people killed and six injured in the explosions in Abu Dhabi today as three petroleum tanker trucks blew up after catching fire near a major oil storage facility in the Mussafah area of the UAE capital.  Abu Dhabi police said that the explosion involving three oil tankers and a fire in the construction site of the Emirate's new airport extension was potentially caused by drones.  "The fire provoked an explosion in three tanks for transporting fuel in the Misfah area near the fuel depots of the Emirati state-owned company ADNOC," a police statement said.  Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition destroyed eight drones headed towards the kingdom, according to Al Jazeera.  Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree, at the time of the attack, told the Almasirah broadcaster that the Yemeni rebel group will soon reveal details about the military operation in the UAE territory.  The UAE has been part of a Saudi-led military campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen since 2015. It intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 as part of the Arab Coalition but scaled down its operations in 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-condemns-houthi-attack-in-uae-vows-to-stand-beside-emirati-partners/articleshow/88960863.cms||---

He also said intermediate commercial vehicle (ICV) and light commercial vehicle (LCV) segments are likely to do better, as the Q3 performance for certain segments is seeing a "tapering" effect. "I think this fiscal will end significantly better than FY21. Last year, the whole industry was two lakh units. We believe this year, the industry is already sitting at 1.80 lakh. "We will see a good double-digit growth this year by the end of the year," said Veejay Nakra, chief executive officer (automotive sector) of Mahindra & Mahindra, in response to a question on the outlook for the commercial vehicle (CV) industry. From the base effect point of view, if one looks at year-to-date (YTD) data, it is encouraging for the industry, the 3.5 tonnes to 55 tonnes, which has grown over 60 per cent, he said. Nakra added that even within that, segment-wise, they have seen strong double-digit growth. "But, if one was to look at Q3FY 22 data versus Q3 FY21 data, some of the segments have already started tapering off. It could be because when the industry opened in Q3FY21, there was pent-up demand and, hence, there was a surge in sales," Nakra said. The third quarter of the current fiscal is already starting to see pressure on what is going to play out in the March 2022 quarter, Nakra said. He added that there is a number of reasons for that. GDP forecast has been revised a couple of times, the Omicron is starting to see some of its effects, freight rates have not moved up in commensurate with the hike in diesel rates, and overall utilisation of trucks is not more than 45-50 per cent. "So, we have seen pressure playing out on some of the segments," he added. Earlier, MTB announced the 'Get More Mileage or Give Truck Back' guarantee for its entire range of BS-VI trucks. MTB offers a complete range of trucks from 3.5 tonnes to 55 tonnes, comprising HCV Blazo X, ICV Furio, and LCVs Furio 7 and Jayo range. The Mileage Guarantee, 'Get More Mileage or Give the Truck Back', was first offered on Blazo trucks in 2016. The Mileage Guarantee will be applicable on the entire range HCV, ICV and LCV of Mahindra BS-VI trucks, it said. The 'Get More Mileage or Give Back Truck' Guarantee across the range of trucks is a landmark move for the light, intermediate and heavy commercial vehicle industry. Given the spiralling fuel prices, there wasn't a better time to introduce this customer value proposition," said Nakra. He added that it will reaffirm the company's customers' faith in Mahindra's ability to create technologically advanced, class-leading products and set higher standards for the Indian CV industry while reflecting its commitment to the segment. "'Get More Mileage or Give the Truck Back' was first offered on our HCV truck Blazo in 2016 and not a single truck has come back. All our new introductions ever since — Blazo X, Furio ICV range and Furio 7 have delivered higher fuel efficiency," said Jalaj Gupta, business head (commercial vehicles business unit) at Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. He further said that additionally, MTB is offering a service guarantee to ensure higher uptime for its customers through the guaranteed speedier turnaround of the truck, be it on the highway or at the dealership workshop. "We are seeing increasing penetration of CNG fuel in LCVs as well as the ILCV and the ICV segments. It has raised to almost one third level YTD this year because of the operating. "There is an increasing shift towards CNG (compressed natural gas) from diesel...We have our plans on the CNG on our entire ILCV range of trucks," he stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/commercial-vehicle-industry-may-perform-significantly-better-this-year-mahindra-group-official/articleshow/88960792.cms||---
---||World||Former Ukrainian president lands in Kyiv to face treason case||KYIV: Ukraine's former president Petro Poroshenko landed in Kyiv on Monday to face treason charges in a case he says was trumped up by allies of his successor Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  In a brief stand-off at border control after arriving on a flight from Warsaw, Poroshenko accused border guards of taking away his passport. He later greeted a crowd of thousands of cheering and flag-waving supporters outside the airport.  Poroshenko's return sets up a showdown with President Zelenskiy's government in what critics say is an ill-judged distraction as Ukraine braces for a possible Russian military offensive and seeks the support of its Western allies.  Western diplomats called for political unity in Ukraine before the arrival of Poroshenko who was president from 2014 until 2019.  Poroshenko, 56, is being investigated for alleged treason linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales in 2014-15. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. His party accused Zelenskiy of a reckless attempt to silence political opposition.  Zelenskiy's administration says the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accuses Poroshenko of thinking he is above the law. Zelenskiy trounced Poroshenko in an election in 2019. He ran on a ticket to tackle corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs in the former Soviet republic.  "We are not here to protect Poroshenko, but to unite and protect Ukraine," Poroshenko told the crowd, before heading to the Pechersk court in central Kyiv for a hearing into his case, as supporters chanted outside the building.  During a break in the court session, he told the crowd: "The authorities are confused, weak and instead of fighting (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, they are trying to fight us."  Tetiana Sapyan, a spokeswoman for the State Bureau of Investigations (DBR), told a separate briefing that the DBR was apolitical.  The court eventually deferred a decision on whether to order Poroshenko's arrest after a session lasting nearly 12 hours. The former president and supporters broke out in song after the hearing ended. The hearing resumes on Wednesday.  "Today we did not win the war, we did not win the battle, but we kept our positions, preventing them from advancing," Poroshenko told the crowd. Russian troop build-up On Friday, Zelenskiy's chief of staff batted away suggestions that Zelenskiy was behaving like Viktor Yanukovich, a former president who was backed by Russia and whose political rival Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in a case that Western countries widely condemned as politicised.  Ukraine has tried to rally Western support in its standoff with Moscow after sounding the alarm about a build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops near its borders.  A confectionary tycoon, Poroshenko was elected as head of a pro-Western government after the Maidan street protests that ousted Yanukovich in 2014.  Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and backed separatist fighters in a conflict in eastern Ukraine.  Prosecutors asked a Ukrainian court in December to arrest Poroshenko, with the possibility of bail set at 1 billion hryvnia ($37 million).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/former-ukrainian-president-lands-in-kyiv-to-face-treason-case/articleshow/88960951.cms||---
---||India||Birju Maharaj, maestro who breathed Kathak and took it global, dies at 83||Kathak doyen Birju Maharaj died at his Delhi home in the early hours of Monday, surrounded by his family and disciples. They were playing ‘antakshari’ after dinner on Sunday when he suddenly took ill, his granddaughter Ragini Maharaj said. He would have turned 84 next month. Kathak dancer and choreographer Aditi Mangaldas pays tribute. Eight decades ago, from the depths of ancient mountains, a stream emerged. Along its journey through the valleys and forests it passed, the seasons it witnessed, from the lands and living beings it nourished, this tributary grew into a vibrant, dynamic art-life sustaining river. My guru, Pandit Birju Maharaj ji, was this river which has now merged into the ocean of eternity. It is a river that has left behind many tributaries by inspiring motivating and giving the gift of dance to multitudes of artists around the globe. Born Brijmohan Mishra into the illustrious Kalka-Bindadeen gharana of Kathak, which had many great artists preceding him, he was a child prodigy. His deep immersion in the form, astute observation of nature/humanity and expansive imagination took Kathak beyond its geographic context and brought it centre-stage, not only in India but globally. He transformed not only Kathak’s repertoire but its presentation, pedagogy, life-span and yet kept its essence intact. Though dance itself was a tradition he had inherited from his family, he created ‘in the moment’. Every life experience, however minute, was given a new meaning in the most profound dance. Let me narrate an anecdote that shows you what I mean by actively living in the moment. I remember being super-excited when he told me that I would be part of the Festival of India tour to the UK in 1982. I rehearsed and re-rehearsed what was choreographed, and finally the day arrived. I was standing in the wings, waiting for my entry to the huge London theatre when Maharaj ji danced from the stage and into the wings to tell us, “Cut this tukda, go for the last part”. And then he went back to the stage! He had sensed the pulse of the audience, and felt the need to improvise on the spot. He was always evolving and transforming. He became the wind and we just followed where the wind blew, and suddenly a new world emerged. How can one pay tribute to Maharaj ji? He wasn’t just guru and dancer but also choreographer (‘Devdas’, ‘Bajirao Mastani’ and many others), singer, percussion player, and composer. If that isn’t astounding enough, he wrote poems and painted too! He was awarded many honours across the world, including the prestigious Padma Vibhushan. Yet, all these accolades dim in comparison to his immense artistry. Every breath he took was immersed in dance, his body, mind and heart one with the resonance of his bells. I remember how Maharaj ji loved to hold impromptu baithaks in class where he would sing and do abhinaya, regale us with jokes (he had such a great sense of humour) and also do a particular scary expression with just his eyes. This transformed his face and suddenly one saw rage and evil. Even though I knew it was coming, I would still end up screaming in fright. The whole class would then burst into laughter at the silly scared girl from Ahmedabad. How will the greatness of a legendary performing artist like Maharaj ji resonate through centuries? After all, dance is intangible, ephemeral, something that one cannot hold onto. The resonance of Maharaj ji’s radiant artistry will live through the many tributaries that he gave birth to and nourished.

The Centre’s statement was in response to a petition seeking exemption from vaccination certificates for persons with disabilities and requesting for vaccination arrangements at their places of stay. The Centre said the government is running ‘vaccination for all’ programmes, including near to home or at home vaccination strategies, providing facilities that would enable disabled persons to get vaccinated without hindrance. Coronavirus live updates“A total of 23,678 doses have been administered to disabled persons who have voluntarily chosen to be identified as such at the time of vaccination,” it said. The Centre said it has advised all states and UTs to “vaccinate bed-ridden or beneficiaries with extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs along with their caregivers at their places of residence using mobile vaccination teams”. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant will take up the case for hearing on Tuesday. On the plea that persons with disability could be exempted from wearing masks, the Centre said it is a global practice advised by WHO and health experts. “Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected people who may feel well and are unaware of their infectiousness to others are also likely to transmit infections to others. Similarly, persons with disabilities are just as likely to get infected with Covid-19 and transmit the same around them as any other person,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaccination-certificate-not-must-for-any-purpose-centre-tells-sc/articleshow/88961003.cms||---
---||India||No political bias, R-Day tableaux picked by 'apolitical panel': Govt||NEW DLEHI: The government on Monday rejected the charge that exclusion of tableaux of a few states from this year's Republic Day Parade had to do with 'political bias' and deplored the efforts by some CMs to link the decision taken by a committee of 'apolitical experts' to regional pride. The government's assertion came soon after Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin joined West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee in seeking PM Modi's intervention over the rejection of the tableaux of their states. Senior government sources emphasised that the Centre had no role to play in the call taken by the experts. "We have recently seen letters being written by state CMs about the exclusion of the tableaux of their states. This is projected as an insult to the people of the state by the Central government. This script also plays out almost every year," a source said. In their response coinciding with Left parties also faulting exclusion of tableaux of West Bengal and Kerala besides Tamil Nadu, sources frowned upon what they called the "wrong precedent" set by the CMs to frame an apolitical exercise as a flashpoint between the Centre and states. It is not the Modi Government that decides on the tableaux as the proposals received from various states and ministries are evaluated in a series of meetings of the expert committee comprising eminent people from art, culture, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography and other related fields, sources said. "The expert committee examines the proposals on the basis of theme, concept, design and visual impact before making its recommendations," a source said. CPI leader D Raja alleged that the Kerala government's theme was rejected as it featured a statue of Sree Narayana Guru and the selection panel wanted it to be replaced with one of Adi Sankaracharya. "The jury is appointed by the defence ministry. Is it not an attack on federalism as well as on India's diverse culture and history?" he asked. He added that Bengal's tableau on Subhas Chandra Bose and Tamil Nadu's tableau on Bharathiyar (Subramania Bharathi), VO Chidambaranar Pillai and Rani Velu Nachchiyar were also rejected. Official sources claimed that given the constraint that the parade had to wound up within a time-frame, proposals of all states cannot be accommodated. This year, 21 of the 56 proposals were accepted due to time constraints. "It is natural for more proposals to be rejected than those accepted given the paucity of time," said the source. "Perhaps, some of the CMs and political parties don't have positive agenda of their own and resort to the same trick again and again," said a source. "It should be noted that the tableaux proposals of Kerala were accepted through the same process in 2018 and 2021. It should be also noted that proposals of West Bengal were accepted under the same Modi government in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2021. Furthermore, this year's tableau of CPWD includes Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, so the question of his insult does not even arise," a source said rejecting charges of discrimination.

Deaths from the virus continued to inch up for the seventh consecutive day with 250 fatalities reported in India, as compared to 235 on Sunday. The daily toll, not counting old deaths added to the tally, has touched 250 after 102 days, since October 7, 2021. India had reported 2,35,456 new cases by late Monday night, with data from Tripura awaited. Coronavirus live updatesThese cases came out of 13.13 lakh tests done on Sunday, the lowest in 13 days. The daily case count has now fallen for three days in a row, in sync with steadily falling testing numbers in the last four days, some of which have coincided with major festivals in the country. While cases have fallen of late, daily death numbers have been rising since the previous Monday (January 10), when 130 deaths were reported. Bengal recorded the highest number of fatalities at 33, followed by Delhi and Maharashtra with 24 each and Punjab as well as Tamil Nadu at 20 each. The sharpest fall in cases since the previous day were reported in Maharashtra (31,111, down from 41,327), Karnataka (27,156, from 34,047) Delhi (12,527, from 18,286) and Bengal (9,385, from 14,938).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-cases-fall-for-3rd-day-positivity-up-deaths-rise-to-250/articleshow/88961074.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||OBC tag for transgenders opposed||NEW DELHI: The National Commission for Backward Classes is learnt to be against the government's move to include transgenders in the central list of OBCs, with a majority of its members opining that the proposal goes beyond the accepted principle of classification of Mandal castes. The government proposal will enable transgenders to avail the 27% Mandal reservation benefits in jobs and education. In response to the cabinet note moved by the ministry of social justice and empowerment, sources said that the NCBC members have argued that transgenders cannot be classified in the OBC list as a bloc, but should be assigned to the lists of community that individual transgenders are born in. In a recent meeting to discuss the proposal, the members argued that a transgender born in a scheduled caste family should be put in the list of SCs, if born in a scheduled tribe family one should be classified as ST, and only those born in an OBC family should be put in the central list of OBCs. It has been argued that transgenders are not a "class", but is a "medical condition and a gender", and the gender quota cuts across different categories. "Caste is assigned by birth, and thus whoever is born in a community should be given reservation benefits in that community," an NCBC member said, summing up the opinion of three members of the commission. The negative opinion appears to stem from the belief that including a new community (transgenders) in the OBC list will eat into the reservation benefits of the existing backward castes. However, sources said one member in the NCBC has come out in favour of the government proposal, terming it a "progressive move" which will provide social protection to the most marginalised social group. Sudha Yadav is learnt to have argued that there were only a few lakh transgenders in the country and their inclusion in the OBC list dealing with population of crores will not make much difference to the fortunes of the existing beneficiaries of the mandal communities. The clash has stalled the opinion from being submitted to the ministry, and is still with the NCBC, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/obc-tag-for-transgenders-opposed/articleshow/88961108.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Besides prominent citizens and minority organisations, Congress functionary Kapil Sibal had also written to the district administration demanding denial of permission for the event "that could spark tension in the communally sensitive city". ADM (city) RK Patel told TOI on Monday that since the model code of conduct and Covid guidelines were in force, permission would not be granted to the organisers. Several senior citizens, retired officials, professors and social workers had written to district magistrate Selva Kumari demanding her to stop the event. In a letter, they said: "The Dharam Sansad in Aligarh is being organised on the pattern of Haridwar. Since Aligarh is a sensitive city, provocative speeches like the ones delivered at the Haridwar Dharam Sansad, which disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of the entire nation, could create tension and fear in society amid assembly elections. Therefore, such an event should not be allowed in public interest." Organiser of the Dharam Sansad and trustee of Sanatan Hindu Seva Sansthan Annapurna Bharti said the event has been postponed "by us" due to fear of Omicron "and as two of our main speakers, who are also members of the core committee of the Dharam Sansad in Haridwar, are in judicial custody for their Haridwar speeches". She added, "We will meet on January 23 to decide on a future date. We don't need permission from district administration to organise a religious event in the city."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aligarh-admin-refuses-nod-for-dharam-sansad-on-january-22-23/articleshow/88961134.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Interestingly, he didn't describe the Nitish government as NDA government, but "Bihar government". Recently, JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan and its parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha had condemned playwright Daya Prakash Sinha and issued statements dragging in PM Modi, asking him to withdraw the Padma Shri award conferred on the playwright. "Stop playing Twitter-Twitter with PM. He's the pride of every BJP worker. If anything has to be told to him, it should be done directly, face-to-face. If you play Twitter-Twitter with him and ask him questions, the 76 lakh BJP workers in state know how to give a befitting reply," Jaiswal said in a veiled attack at Lalan and Kushwaha. "For the Bihar government (Nitish government) to function, it's is not just our responsibility, but yours too," he added.

---||Mumbai||ICMR norms junk oral antivirals, antibiotics||Mumbai: Oral antivirals such as Molnupiravir, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies and vitamins have no place in India's latest Covid management guidelines, which were put up on the Union health ministry website on Monday. Antiviral remdesivir, which is given via an IV drip, is recommended for moderate to severely ill patients on oxygen support. Off-label use of the rheumatoid arthritis drug, tocilizumab, continues for severe coronavirus patients who don't improve with steroids.The guidelines come barely 10 days after ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargav said Molnupiravir has "safety issues".On Monday, the Maharashtra government, however, allowed the use of Molnupiravir for a select group of patients with "abundant caution". On the omission of Molnupiravir from the management guidelines, many doctors have a different opinion. "The general opinion among the medical community is that this omission is a mistake," said infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava, who is a member of the Maharashtra task force. The Maharashtra task force's guidelines allow Molnupiravir for patients who are over 50 years old and have at least two comorbidities and continuous fever for at least three days."Doctors should have the discretionary right to prescribe Molnupiravir because there is a subset of patients that benefits from it," said infectious diseases specialist Dr Anita Mathew.The ICMR guidelines, which were last updated in July 2021, state that patients with mild illness need symptomatic treatment for fever and pain and, if needed, a nasal spray of corticosteroid (budesonide). CT scans and expensive blood tests for D-dimer and IL-6 levels are only recommended for moderate and severely ill patients.Last week, a group of 35 doctors wrote an open letter to the Indian health authorities asking for updated guidelines that clearly spell out the government stand on new anti-virals and monoclonal antibodies so that "unwarranted medication, testing and hospitalization" stops.Dr Satchit Balsari from Harvard School of Medicine and one of the letter's signatories said, "It is reassuring to see that the new guidelines are evidence-based and eschew antibiotics. It is prudent from a public health standpoint that other drugs that have marginal benefit and are unavailable to most people are also not included. I hope state agencies that have distributed drugs en masse now abandon the practice immediately."

The owners of residential plots, measuring 350 to 400 sq yards, were running hotels, guesthouses, spa and salons, clinics and, real estate offices in violation of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act 1975.The enforcement team of town and country planning department had received several complaints by ll residents through chief minister's window. The residents alleged these activities were not only leading to loss of revenue to the state exchequer but also causing inconvenience to the residents by putting additional burden on the infrastructure and leading to parking woes.District town planner RS Batth said that there is provision of using 25% space on the ground floor of residential plots for “non-nuisance activities” like clinic, lawyer and other offices, and therefore these properties were directed to furnish any permission documents which they might have received from the departments concerned . “But none of the properties had taken any such permission from the department, the properties were therefore sealed in presence of police team,” he said. He further said the department will recommend registering of FIR against the property owners for the violations.Batth said the director DTCP has issued strict instructions to the the officials of planning and enforcement wings to carry out surveys throughout the licenced colonies and ensure that all commercial activities running from the residential properties in illegal manner are stopped.In December 2020, DTCP had proposed that the fee for de-sealing residential properties that have been sealed for running commercial activities from the premises be raised 10 times along with a bank guarantee. The officials had claimed the proposal was made because the current fee for de-sealing such properties is too low and house owners easily get away with paying a small amount in comparison to the huge profits they earn by running a commercial establishment from a residential building. Since the fine is low, such property owners often resume the illegal commercial activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/six-housing-plots-used-for-spas-salons-sealed/articleshow/88961162.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

The community members, police said, would train the children from an early age for street performances like walking on the rope. The girls, after a certain age, were sold to people as brides. This was revealed by the gang leader after his arrest by the police.On Sunday, cops nabbed Kulwant Singh from Delhi and Anil from Alwar in Rajasthan, bringing the total number of arrests to 11. Kulwant, the investigators said, was the mastermind of the gang while Anil was responsible for arranging possible clients for the infants.To date, police have recovered three infants, two girls barely a month-old and a four-month-old boy. “We are trying to find out details of children sold,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. “The gang members, during interrogation, told us they used to sell the infants to a community of street performers in Rajasthan.”Cops said many more members of the gang are still at large. The accused, during interrogation, told cops that they had no knowledge of the current locations of the children sold by them. The gang was busted on January 8 when a suspicious cab driver from the city drove straight to the DLF-3 police station and helped arrest two women and a man who had stolen two infants and were planning to sell them to childless couples.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/trafficking-gang-sold-infants-to-raj-street-performers/articleshow/88961163.cms||Bagish Jha

They also plan to gherao the residences of all three BJP MLAs from the district and the mayor, this week.On Monday, hundreds of anganwadi workers and helpers gheraoed the residence of Kakkar as part of an ongoing statewide agitation over their pending demands. The protesters said that in the coming days, they would be staging protests outside the residences and offices of various leaders and MLAs of the BJP and the JJP and other government officials since their nearly 40-day-long protest has yielded no results so far. “We are following the footsteps of our farmers, who relentlessly protested against the government for justice. We have been protesting peacefully, but nobody is listening to us. So, we are now stepping up our agitation and till January 25, we’ll continue to gherao the offices and residences of political leaders,” said Saraswati Devi, secretary, Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union.Over 50,000 workers in the state have been protesting against the government since December last year. They have suspended operations in over 26,000 Anganwadi centres in 22 districts and declared that they would return to work only when their demands are met. On January 12, these workers and helpers also courted arrest as part of their ongoing protests.The protesters are seeking the implementation of the promised monthly salary hikes of Rs 1,500 for workers and Rs 750 for helpers. Presently, the Anganwadi workers receive a salary of Rs 12,000 and helpers get Rs 6,000. Additionally, protesters are demanding the grant of skilled and unskilled workers’ status and subsequent revision of wages, as well as the introduction of dearness allowance (DA) and retirement benefits, worth Rs 3 lakh, among others.“It’s been nearly four years since the PM had given us the ‘Diwali gift’ of promises of the Rs 1,500 and Rs 750 hikes. The past two years of the pandemic has increased our workload. The ASHA and Anganwadi workers do all the survey and data collection work for the government. “But even as we exposed ourselves to the deadly second wave, the government is nonchalant about our concerns and needs. This entire protest is to get our pending dues and basic employee benefits,” said CITU state president Surekha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-pay-hike-anganwadi-staffers-warn-of-stir-at-mlas-homes/articleshow/88961166.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Covid effect? Net pains for many in Gurugram as usage up||GURUGRAM: Patchy network is not an uncommon problem in the city but in the past few weeks, residents have been facing increased call drops, network outages and slower internet connectivity. From work-from-home professionals to students continuing with online education, many residents said that network issues have increased compared to earlier. “I have been using a mobile hotspot for my work-from-home needs and did not get a local wi-fi installed, but the network issues have got worse over the past few weeks. Now, I have no option but to get a wi-fi connection as I cannot depend on the hotspot at all,” said Rishav Kumar, a resident of Sector 14. The government school teachers, tasked with reaching out to students without smartphones through voice calls, complained of struggles due to network outages and call drops. “I have two mobile numbers of different operators. But the situation is such that both are giving equally bad networks. It takes multiple attempts to connect a call, and then there are call drops or a lack of voice clarity. If we do not meet our target, officials pull us up and are not ready to believe that our work suffers because of poor network,” said a government school teacher. Network providers and industry insiders have blamed the sudden spike on the third wave leading to a high demand for networks in the city. The recent issues, they said, are due to a sudden rise in the traffic in some of the residential areas, with offices having closed once again and schools and colleges shifting back to online classes. The areas witnessing issues are the ones, which have fewer towers, but are now seeing a spike in consumer demands. “There are no issues with the services, but there has been a 50% spike in data usage in certain residential pockets. Since offices and schools have shut down due to the third wave, the traffic, earlier scattered across the city, has spiked in certain pockets. The areas where we are struggling to erect more towers are facing the issues,” said an industry insider on the condition of anonymity. The private operators and their associations have also noted an upsurge in demand, adding that they are trying to expand their infrastructure to increase coverage and meet the demand. “The upsurge in demand for more bandwidth is being monitored and met at present by a robust back-up and redundancy feature inbuilt in the operators' network systems,” said Lt. Gen SP Kochhar, director general, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI). “COAI has engaged with the telecommunication department (DoT) and state-level authorities, getting permission to deploy telecom infrastructure such as towers, cell on wheels (CoW), etc., to ensure business continuity and provision of seamless services,” he added. Meanwhile, the district administration said that the operators, who are witnessing an upsurge in demand and feel the need to boost their infrastructure, should approach them. “The district administration is committed to improving network in the region. If the telecom operators face any hassles, they can easily reach out to me. Even if they face a procedural hindrance, we will facilitate them,” deputy commissioner Yash Garg told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/covid-effect-net-pains-for-many-as-usage-up/articleshow/88961167.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

Along with Yadav, his wife, sister and a property dealer have been arrested so far. Yadav’s brother-in-law, an ITBP assistant commandant deployed at NSG, is on the run.On Monday, a city court extended by two days the police remand of Yadav’s wife, sister and the property dealer. Yadav is already on a six-day police custody.The police said Yadav had created a current account in a bank that has a branch on the NSG campus. The money collected from the fraud was deposited there initially. From there, the amount was transferred to the account of a company that Yadav and his relatives had floated. The money was further transferred in small amounts to various other accounts. Of the Rs 125 crore allegedly collected through the fraud, the police have so far recovered Rs 13.8 crore in cash, jewellery estimated to be worth Rs 1 crore and around Rs 2 crore in the account of the accused. Apart from these, the cops have identified properties worth Rs 12 crore that Yadav had purchased and 10 luxury cars. Still, a large amount of the money is left to be traced.“Our priority is to trace the money and recover as much as possible,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. He added that going through all the documents and bank details was a time-consuming process. Officers from the economic offences wing, the crime unit and the Manesar police station are on the job. Yadav had orchestrated the Rs 125-crore fraud by awarding tenders for projects on the NSG campus that did not exist at all.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/contract-fraud-cops-kick-off125cr-trail/articleshow/88961168.cms||Bagish Jha

The maximum temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday. The minimum temperature settled at 7.5 degrees Celsius, the same as it was a day earlier. According to an IMD official, with the prevailing icy-cold north-westerlies wind, conditions are likely to be similar today as well. However, there will be some respite from the cold Wednesday onwards, with the mercury rising slightly later in the week. The city has been reeling under an intense cold spell since January 14.

The daily positivity rate also witnessed a spike from 27.7% to 28.5% in the past 24 hours. However, only 154 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals. Of the two Covid patients who died on Monday, one was a 60-year-old man who was admitted to a private hospital with a chronic liver disease on January 10. He tested posi-tive three days later and was shifted to the ICU. He suffered a cardiac arrest on Monday. The other patient, an 80-year-old man, was suffering from hypertension and was hospitalised on January 15. He was then put on ventilator after his oxygen levels started to drop significantly. He, too, suffered a cardiac arrest. In the past one week, the city has reported eight deaths related to Covid — one on January 10, another on January 12, two more on January 14 and one each on January 15 and 16. So far, 935 people have died in the city after testing positive. Of them, 619 also had comorbidities. Meanwhile, two areas with a number of highrises — Chadralok and Tigra — have emerged as hotspots in the city. Together, these two areas have accounted for nearly 40% of the city’s total cases in the past seven days. While Chadralok has reported 4,542 cases, Tigra has seen 3,306. Of the 21,365 cases the city has recorded in the past week, these areas have contributed 7,846 of them. While Tigra includes sectors 47, 49, 50, Sushant Lok 3 and Suncity, Chandralok covers the DLF phases, Ardee City and sectors 24, 25, 26, 42, 43 and 52. Officials in the health department said they were conducting focused testing in these areas. “As a majority of the cases are contacts of Covid patients or those with travel history, we have been monitoring them closely and conducting focused testing of those showing symptoms in these hotspots,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical official. On Monday, the health department carried out inspections at primary health care centres in the city to assess the status of oxygen, medicines and other infrastructure. Yadav, meanwhile, cautioned senior citizens against anyone posing as a government official and offering to book booster dose slots with an OTP. “It’s a scam. Our officials are not calling anyone to book slots on their behalf. We also don’t need an OTP for the booking of slots. Although no such fraud has taken place in the city so far, people should always stay alert,” he added. Haryana, meanwhile, reported 9,204 new cases on Monday and a positivity rate of 22.8%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/2-more-covid-deaths-in-city-both-60-plus-and-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88961171.cms||Ipsita Pati

It, however, has a target of covering 1.51 lakh children. On the other hand, it has administered 14,924 booster doses since January 10.With the daily cases increasing in the district, speeding up the vaccination of the two groups in focus has become an administrative priority. “We have included the 15-17 age group and eligible booster recipients in our door-step vaccination plan. We will be organising camps in every village as per the data, focusing on children between 15-17 years. We are also mapping out schools in rural areas where vaccination camps have not come up. Also, we will deploy mobile vans in the areas where children can not visit schools due to a lack of last-mile connectivity,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.Additionally, the administration will set up vaccination camps in the local weekly market areas. “We will also hold vaccination camps for the children and the people above 60 who have completed nine months after their second jab at all religious places, including temples, churches, madrasas and gurudwaras, across Gurgaon on Sunday, January 23,” said Yadav.However, people who had Covid infection after their second dose, Yadav said, would have to wait another nine months to take the booster.Meanwhile, a team of auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM) and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers will visit 100 houses daily to get data on the vaccination coverage of their respective blocks. The mobile vaccination teams will use this data to carry out a door-to-door drive.When asked how Gurgaon planned to increase the pace of vaccination for children in the urban areas, Yadav said, “We are planning to hold drive-ins, especially for the 15-17 age group, and also, for people who are eligible for the booster."On Monday, 2,100 people in the 15-17 age group got vaccinated in Gurgaon while 9,425 people in the 18-44 group, 1,202 people between 45-59 years and 1,641 people aged above 60 got their jabs, too. A total of 198 healthcare workers and 295 frontline workers also got inoculated. On the eighth day of the booster vaccination drive, 1,723 recipients got the precautionary dose.Talking about the other districts in the state, Rajeev Arora, ACS (health), Haryana, said, “As each district has its target and issues, the booster delivery and 15-17 group vaccination are not included in the door-to-door drive yet. Already, we have completed 50% of our target for the 15-17 age group in Haryana,” said Rajeev Arora, ACS (health), Haryana.With a target of vaccinating 15.43 lakh children in the 15-17 group, Haryana, so far, has administered only 7.82 lakh doses to this group.A senior state health official said that all the districts had got directions to undertake initiatives to increase the pace of vaccination. “Districts can decide their strategy depending on their target,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/doorstep-vax-drive-starts-for-15-17-group-booster-recipients/articleshow/88961173.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||Widening of Old Delhi Road-Shankar Chowk: GMDA sets March 31 deadline||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has extended the deadline for completing the road widening project on the 2km-long stretch between Old Delhi Road and Shankar Chowk from December 31 last year to March 31. Nearly 30% of the project is still pending, with the work on the last portion towards Old Delhi Road stuck due to encroachment near Dundahera village. “The deadline for the project has been moved to March 31. The last portion of the stretch near Dundahera village has some encroachment. Once removed, work can start there. The matter had been in court, so there was a delay,” said a senior GMDA official, who did not want to be named. Most of the work is complete, said the official, but the repair work on the last 100-150 metres of the road and drain construction in the encroached portion are still left. "We have completed demarcating the encroached portion. After the demolition drive, work can start there," the official added. A joint team, including the GMDA and the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) officials, will complete the demolition drive within a month. “Nearly 30% of the work on the project is remaining, but we should be able to meet the March 31 deadline,” the official quoted above said. The 2km-long stretch, which is getting widened as a part of an Rs 8 crore project, sees a high footfall. It serves as a link between NH8 and Old Delhi Road and also has several hotels, offices, and commercial spaces in its vicinity. The GMDA had started work on the project in January 2019, with an initial deadline of six months. However, the project got repeatedly delayed by lockdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic, the shortage of labour that followed, the repeated bans on construction in light of the high pollution levels in the region, the complications in the shifting of utilities, and encroachment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/widening-of-old-del-rd-shankar-chowk-gmda-sets-march-31-deadline/articleshow/88961174.cms||Sakshi Dayal

With over 40 Covid cases in Panchsheel Greens and over 25 in Gaur City 1 Avenue, both the highrises have reopened their Covid care centres with oxygen cylinders and adequate medicines. Last year, these societies set up the Covid care centre on their premises. “On January 13, we reopened our Covid care centre that was set up during the last coronavirus wave. We have kept 10 big oxygen cylinders and five small cylinders on standby, while all the sanitisation work is being done by our support staff,” said Anoop Kumar Soni, assistant secretary of AOA, Gaur City 1 Avenue. “We have provided the housekeeping staff with infrared thermometers, safety kits and glasses. While we haven’t set up any isolation bed facility yet, since the requirement hasn’t arisen as residents are managing within their flats, we will, however, arrange the beds if required,” he said. To manage sanitisation in the absence of the housekeeping staff, the AOA has placed sanitising spray pots in each tower lobby. Also, hypochlorite mixture is provided to the lobby guard for lift and lobby sanitisation. Apart from that, the AOA has arranged a medicine bank for all residents. Vikas Kumar, AOA president of Panchsheel Greens, said they also revived their Covid care centre in the common area of the society on December 5 last year. “We have two oxygen cylinders each with 100-litre capacity, three oxygen concentrators each of seven-litre capacity and five isolation beds. If required, we will ramp up with 10 beds. Sanitisation is carried out daily.” “Last year, our Covid care centre was able to save many critical patients, including a three-year-old child. This year till now, no residents have asked for the requirement of beds or any other facilities, but we are ready,” Kumar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/covid-care-centres-in-city-highrises-are-back-as-cases-surge/articleshow/88961176.cms||---

As it has become almost a norm for parties to announce pre-poll freebies, it is the public sector banks, especially the stuttering cooperative banks, which suffer from the loan waiver schemes that have been routinely announced for more than two decades. Read AlsoPunjab: Ropar maize farmers to be compensated for crop lossThe district revenue officials in Ropar are all set to disburse the compensation among farmers who faced loss of their maize crop following pest attack.Advocate Sudhir Walia, appearing for the Patiala Central Cooperative Bank, said the Punjab and Haryana high court had in January 2020 ordered reinstatement of a daily wager, who was sacked in 2005, with a compensation of Rs 20,000 along with 6% interest per annum from 2005 till the date of payment to the worker. He said there are 12 such similar cases pending in the HC, in which daily wagers were similarly sacked. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, however, insisted that there was no infirmity in the HC order directing reinstatement of the sacked daily wager as the procedure stipulated under Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act had not been followed. Assembly elections 2022: Live updatesWhen the bench said it would uphold the direction to the bank for reinstatement of the sacked daily wager, who was engaged as a peon in 1999, Walia said that a lump sum amount be fixed instead of Rs 20,000 with 6% interest per annum, as that would entail severe financial blow to the bank. When the bench suggested a lump sum compensation of Rs 1 lakh, the worker's counsel Durga Dutt said that it should be much more as the person was sacked in 2005 and faced hardship for nearly 17 years.

Additional financial burden, given the fact that there are 12 similar cases pending in the HC, through heavy compensation would break the cooperative bank's back." This argument struck a chord with the bench, which told the worker's counsel that unless the bank survives, where would he get the job and the compensation. "If it goes into liquidation, you will get nothing," the court said. It upheld the HC's order for reinstatement of the worker but directed the bank to pay Rs 1 lakh within two months to him as compensation for the period he was out of job.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eyeing-sops-punjab-farmers-arent-repaying-loans-sc-told/articleshow/88961177.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

For the Noida assembly seat, nominations were filed by Dhruv Agrawal of Liberal Party of India and Sunil Chaudhary of Samajwadi Party. From Dadri, National Aam Janseva Party’s Yunus and Amit Baisoya, an Independent, filed their papers. From Jewar, nominations were submitted by Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Avtar Singh Bhadana and Bahujan Samaj Party’s Narendra Kumar. Subhashwadi Bharatiya Samaj Party’s candidate, Manoj Kumar Sharma, filed his nomination from Muradnagar. Sitting BJP MLA Sunil Kumar Sharma and AAP’s Chhavi Yadav submitted their papers in Sahibabad, while Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Sudesh Sharma filed nomination from Modinagar. Congress’s Sushant Goyal filed his papers from the Ghaziabad seat. Of these candidates, Sudesh Sharma is the only one from Ghaziabad who has criminal cases registered against him in the past. Sharma has been booked at the police stations in Bhojpur, Modinagar, Shamli and Muradnagar for allegedly violating the model code of conduct, rallying without permission in the municipal elections, for orchestrating a rail roko movement in 2016 and various other offences. Among the Noida candidates who filed papers on Monday, four FIRs were registered against Chaudhary for staging demonstrations and unauthorised gathering in 2021. Bhadana was booked last year for violation of the model code of conduct. Instead of the usual sloganeering and fanfare that marks the filing of nominations, the exercise on Monday was rather peaceful because of the imposition of Section 144 CrPC amid rising Covid cases. Only two proposers were allowed to enter the nomination hall along with each candidate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/on-foot-or-tractor-11-file-nominations-in-noida-ghaziabad/articleshow/88971623.cms||Aditya Dev

Nagar, who has been re-nominated by his party from the Dadri assembly seat, was in a group housing society in Greater Noida (West) for campaigning and according to police, it was there that norms were violated. The legislator along with five other “unknown” persons has been booked under provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Nagar could not be contacted immediately for his response. “The FIR has been lodged at the Bisrakh police station following a complaint by the local police chowki in-charge at Gaur City,” a police official said. “The case has been lodged under the Epidemic Diseases Act and Indian Penal Code Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (unlawfully or negligently spreading infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life),” the official said. Purported pictures and videos on social media showed Nagar campaigning with scores of people around him as he went around societies seeking votes, defying Election Commission’s guidelines related to Covid-19 for poll campaigning. The action comes close on heels of the police in Gautam Budh Nagar district lodging an FIR against Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who was in Noida on Sunday to campaign for Congress' candidate Pakhuri Pathak. The election to the Dadri assembly constituency, which has 5.86 lakh voters, is scheduled on February 10.

The man had gone to speak to the two accused, whose dog had bitten his six-year-old nephew on Sunday afternoon, but was thrashed and manhandled by them. The accused have been identified as Rajinder Singh and Saurabh Kumar, both residents of Sadopur village in Badalpur area of Greater Noida. “On Sunday afternoon, a six-year-old boy named Shaurya, who was playing outside his house in Sadopur village, was bitten by a Dogo Argentino. The entire incident was captured on camera and the video of the incident went viral on social media,” Elamaran G, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (central) said. In the video, a white coloured Dogo Argentino can be seen mauling the kid on the road while a couple of passerby try to free the child. The dog’s owner can be seen standing on the terrace of their house and watching the incident. “The kid was rushed to the hospital by the family members. Later in the evening, Shaurya’s uncle Sonu Gujjar went to speak to the dog’s owner about the incident, but the owner, identified as Rajinder, along with two other relatives assaulted him.

---||Noida||Noida: IT firm’s crypto wallet emptied out by hackers||NOIDA: An IT company in the city’s Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has gone to police alleging that its cryptocurrency wallet has been emptied out by hackers. The police complaint was filed on Friday by Hemendra Bharadwaj, the administrative head of Cyfuture, an information technology services company. He mentioned that the company had an account with Bitfinex, a global cryptocurrency exchange located in the British Virgin Islands. “Around 10.30am on December 13 last year, we received several messages regarding the withdrawal of crypto assets from our account. The transactions were not authorised by us,” Bharadwaj stated in the complaint. According to the firm, any such withdrawal requires an email verification, a mobile code verification and a password. Neither was shared by them, they said. The complainant claimed that when they had approached the crypto trading company, they were told that their account had been hacked. “We have requested Bitfinex to punish the offender and recover the cryptocurrency. We are able to identify the account(s) that profited from the trades. However, we are not in a position to determine whether the account(s), on the other side of the trend, only profited from the (lucrative) order or had malicious intent,” the complaint read. It, however, did not reveal the total amount lost in the fraud. Contacted, Bharadwaj said he had submitted a police complaint with the cyber cell. Bitfinex didn’t respond to multiple calls from this correspondent. Elamaran G, additional deputy commissioner of police (Noida central), said they had launched a probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/it-firms-crypto-wallet-emptied-out-by-hackers/articleshow/88961186.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: Bhangel flyover to be ready in August?||NOIDA: The Noida Authority is hopeful of completing the Bhangel elevated road project by August this year, four months ahead of its deadline. Once operational, the six-lane, 4.5km elevated road — being built over the Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) road — will ease movement of traffic between Aghapur and Sector 82 since commuters will not have to negotiate Chhalera, Barola and Bhangel markets on the way. Work on the Rs 468-crore project, commissioned in June 2020, has of late picked up speed, despite some delays due to the Covid pandemic, officials said. Some 97% of pile work and 89% of pile cap work are already complete. Similarly, 78 girders have been launched so far, according to officials. “We will be ready with the Bhangel elevated road by August this year,” said Rajeev Tyagi, principal general manager (projects), Noida Authority. According to Tyagi, work is underway in full swing with 24x7 deployment of workers. “Although the pandemic and the consequent lockdown slowed down the pace of work, we will still complete it before the December deadline. That’s because of meticulous planning.” Once ready, the elevated road — currently under construction between Aghapur and NSEZ turn in Sector 82 — is expected to provide a seamless commute through the busy stretch which passes through markets in Aghapur, Chhalera, Barola, Salarpur and Bhangel. Currently, the traffic burden on the stretch makes it a 45-60 minute commute to reach the NSEZ turn from Noida Golf Course. While the Bhangel elevated road is being constructed through Uttar Pradesh Rajya Setu Nigam Limited, the DSC road is one of the important roads of Noida with densely populated villages and sectors on both sides. Due to this, the road has always faced immense pressure from vehicles which will be addressed with the construction of the elevated road that will not only reduce the traffic jam on the stretch but also curtail pollution as a result of the smooth commute.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/bhangel-flyover-to-be-ready-in-aug/articleshow/88961188.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Bengaluru||Call on easing weekend curbs after Friday review: Karnataka govt||BENGALURU: With experts suggesting that the third wave in Karnataka could peak by January 25 and then start its downward journey, the Karnataka government on Monday said it was in favour of relaxing weekend curfew if the forecast comes true by month-end. The government will make the decision after another review meeting on Friday. Based on experts' recommendations that the state should cut down on testing from 2 lakh a day – said to be the highest for any state in the country – the government decided to reduce it by 25%. "If we confirm the trend of Covid-19 tapering off by month-end, then we may end the weekend curfew," revenue minister R Ashoka said after a virtual meeting by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai with his cabinet colleagues and health experts here on Monday. "Considering the decreasing trends in Maharashtra and Delhi, experts believe the pandemic in Karnataka, too, will start declining soon," he added. Under pressure from business community to end the weekend curfew, Bommai held a meeting on Monday but deferred a decision since the cases are likely to go up significantly this week before hitting a peak in the fourth week. Hoteliers' association president PC Rao and others met Bommai immediately after the meeting and urged him to withdraw the weekend curfew and instead allow eateries to run with 50% seating capacity as is being done in Maharashtra. "The hotel owners and staff have been under stress for one and a half years. Weekend curfew is like rubbing salt into our wounds," Rao said. Ashoka, however, said the state cannot risk the lives of 6.5 crore people to help the hoteliers. "We'll go with experts, Centre and WHO's Covid advisory." Owners of liquor outlets urged the government to start the night curfew from 11pm as against the existing 10pm. The meeting decided to install generators in all district hospitals, including Chamarajanagar where Covid cases are high. "This is to ensure uninterrupted power supply at hospitals and avoid disruptions during procedures," Ashoka said, adding they would accelerate vaccination drives in districts where the number of people who have not taken the second dose is high. The CM is planning to soon hold a virtual meeting with deputy commissioners and chief executives of districts with high number of Covid cases and issue specific instructions to intensify vaccination drives for the 15-18 age group. Bengaluru police on Monday banned rallies, demonstrations and protests and congregations of more than 200 people in open places and 100 people in closed places till January end.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/call-on-easing-weekend-curbs-after-friday-review-ktaka-govt/articleshow/88961201.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Soon, students can take up engineering courses in Gujarati, Punjabi and Odia||MUMBAI: Engineering will soon be taught in Gujarati, Punjabi and Odia. A year after the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) launched engineering in Indian regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Bengali, other states have approached the apex body to include their state languages too. This, despite the lukewarm response that colleges received in terms of enrolment numbers in institutes already offering engineering in Indian languages. Data from the AICTE shows for 2021-22, the AICTE had approved 1,230 seats in 19 engineering institutes across India, of which 255 seats have been filled. “We are seeing rising interest in colleges wanting to start engineering in regional languages. As textbooks are released, there will be more confidence amongst students. Germany, Japan and Korea have all followed this pattern and we know that these countries are highly advanced in research and development,” said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the AICTE. In fact, while the AICTE felt this would attract students from regional language schools into professional education, without them having to struggle with language issues, several colleges informed the apex body that English-medium students who fail to understand certain concepts are often found looking up reference material in Hindi. Currently, in Maharashtra, merely one Pune-based engineering college, Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, has started a division in computer science in Marathi and has 60 students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/soon-students-can-take-up-engineering-courses-in-gujarati-punjabi-and-odia/articleshow/88961203.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||Officials fake report to build bridge in Kolhapur, face Bombay HC ire||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has slammed district authorities in Kolhapur for a “brazen act of fabrication” intended to show that an archaeological site was over 100 metres away from a bridge under construction. Declaring their May 2018 survey report and map to be illegal, the court pointed out that the ancient site of Brahmapuri was shown on a private plot at a safe distance only to enable completion of the new Shivaji Bridge on the Panchganga river in Kolhapur. Brahmapuriis an ancient site under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act. As per Kolhapur city’s existing Development Plan, it lies close to the over 140-year-old Shivaji Bridge. However, on a direction from the Kolhapur collector, a report and map were prepared by the District Superintendent of Land Records showing the bridge further away on privately owned land. HC: Unbelievably, Brahmapuri report and map made in a dayMumbai: The Bombay high court has found that on the Kolhapur district collector’s direction a report and map were prepared in May 2018 to show an archaeological site to be over 100 metres away from its location so that the under-construction new Shivaji bridge on the Panchganga fell outside the no-construction zone. The high court has directed a fresh survey within four weeks after a notice is issued to the landowners. “Merely because the construction of the new bridge is in public interest, it gives no right to the government or the statutory authorities to declare the private land of a citizen as an ancient monument site, and thereby jeopardise the right of such private land holder,’’ said a bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice Milind Jadhav on January 12. The judgment said, “We do not have the slightest hesitation to declare the impugned report dated 28.05.2018 and Survey Map—of same date—prepared by the district superintendent of land records, Kolhapur, as completely illegal.” It said the action of the collector, DSLR and City Survey Officer, in conjunction with officials of the Archaeological Department, “is not only shocking but deserves to be strictly reprimanded”. The entire exercise “at the behest of Kolhapur collector…smacks of mala fides and is a completely colourable exercise of power,” said the HC. Kolhapur resident B D Jadhav had in 2019 petitioned the HC to challenge the legality of the report and map. He argued that the ‘Brahmapuri of Kolhapur’ is on CTS 2355, not 2357, as mentioned in the 2018 map. He is owner of part of CTS 2357. The HC observed that the site was indeed in CTS 2355 in the Development Plan and in close proximity to the old Shivaji Bridge. In 2012 the road transport ministry sanctioned a new bridge at the spot and it needed a nod from the Archaeology Department. In 2014 a proposal was sent to the National Monument Authority, but permission was refused as the bridge was coming up within 40 metres of the site. Construction then stopped. On May 28, 2018, the Kolhapur collector sought a survey to know the monument’s location. A report along with a map were unbelievably prepared the same day, said the HC. In May 2019, the NOC was granted and the bridge completed. The HC said, “to overcome the…statutory provision under which no construction could have taken place within…100 metres from a protected area or protected monument, the impugned Survey Report and Survey Map is prepared… so that the NOC from the Archaeological Department could be obtained”. “To serve the interest of the National Highway Authority and to complete…construction of the new bridge, the Survey Report and Survey Map were prepared without giving notice to land owners,” the court said.  In the year 1945, the then Princely State of Kolhapur Government, at the suggestion of Professor D.R. Gadgil, Director of Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, invited the Research Institute, Pune, to undertake the work of excavation at a site on scientific lines. The excavation work lasted for four months and with the sanction of the then Government of Bombay, a report titled "Excavations at Brahmapuri (Kolhapur) 1945-46" was published. The report set the location of the ancient site of Brahmapuri as North latitude 16041' and East longitude 74071'. The old Shivaji Bridge is stone masonry with five arches constructed in 1878. Section 20 A of the Ancient Monuments Act prohibits public work within 100 metres from protected sites, said the HC. The HC said, “The deafening silence of the Respondents in answering this aspect of the matter and the specific grounds raised in the present petition, is clearly evident.’’ The HC judgment said, “In fact, the Development Plan of Kolhapur City prepared by the Corporation and sanctioned by the Government, clearly bears out the location of the said site on CTS No. 2355 and not on CTS No.2357’’ adding “There can be no better evidence than the sanctioned Development Plan.’’ The HC also said “it is impossible to believe and comprehend’’ how in one day the survey was completed with no notice to the petitioner. “Without adhering to the procedure prescribed by law, shockingly on the same date—May 28, 2018--the City Survey Officer has submitted a premeditated report and a map,’’ the HC held. Jadhav had also challenged two notices one received from the Archeological Survey of India last July for allegedly contravening of the Ancient Monuments Act by putting a fencing and the other issued in September 2021 by Kolhapur municipal corporation alleging that he carried out unauthorized construction on plot number 2355 which he said he is not in possession of. His petition made the Union Ministry of Culture, The National Monument Authority, the Archaeological Survey of India, Mumbai Circle, apart from National Highway Authority, Maharashtra government, Kolhapur district collector, others s party respondents. The HC quashed both notices holding that the July 2021 notice was issued to “protect or camouflage the ostensible illegality’’ and the September notice of the KMC was also incorrectly issued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/officials-fake-report-to-build-bridge-face-hc-ire/articleshow/88961191.cms||Swati Deshpande

However, due to rise in Covid infections, his visit was cancelled.State BJP president Chandrakant Patil, addressing a press conference at the party headquarters in Mumbai on Monday, came down heavily on the Metro rail administration for going ahead with the trial test merely because the prime minister’s visit had been postponed.“The Metro rail administration ignored BJP’s elected representatives. We have six MLAs and the MP, Girish Bapat, is also from BJP. Former Union minister Prakash Javadekar is also from Pune. But none of them were invited for the inauguration. Even the Pune mayor was not invited,” he said.Patil said the project was initiated by BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis when he was CM and he had ensured all permissions were obtained. “If the trial is an administrative action, then why did you invite Pawar and ensure he got all the publicity? Why was the mayor not invited? When we inaugurated projects initiated in the Congress regime we invited their leaders as well,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bjp-slams-pawar-for-inaugurating-test-trials-of-pune-metro-rail/articleshow/88961207.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks recall of SC order on poll OBC quota||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Monday approached the Supreme Court seeking a recall of its December 15 order that directed re-notifying of 27 per cent reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the state’s local body elections. Senior counsel for the state, Shekhar Naphade, mentioned the matter and state’s standing counsel, Rahul Chitnis, required some time to make the application available and the SC bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said it would hear all petitions along with the Maharashtra application on Wednesday. Last month the Central government and Madhya Pradesh had already filed such applications seeking recall of the December 17 order of the Justice Khanwilkar bench. The Centre and MP government said that OBC reservation in Panchayat and civic body elections are constitutionally mandated. The Maharashtra government’s application is on slightly different grounds as it also is submitting in its plea certain data on OBC. Maharashtra application says the issue raised is “of great public importance and has a pan-India ramification on the issue of implementation of OBC reservations in elections.” It says “upliftment of SC, ST and OBC has been the utmost priority of the State and any inadequate representation of OBCs in local self government defeats the very object, intent and purpose of the very idea of de-centralisation of power and taking governance to the grassroots level.’’ The SC had stayed the election to OBC quota as it said its earlier orders requiring a mandatory ‘triple test’’ to determine backwardness.  The Maharashtra application submits that 27 percent reservation is provided to OBC pursuant to Mandal Commission Report. The commission was established in 1979.  The Centre also wants the SC to consider striking a balance between triple test compliance and constitutional mandate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maha-seeks-recall-of-sc-order-on-poll-obc-quota/articleshow/88961209.cms||Swati Deshpande

The poll was staggered after the SC verdict denotifying the 27% reservation for OBCs in local body polls in December. The SEC had initially announced polls to 106 nagar panchayats. However, following the SC verdict, polls could only take place in 11 nagar panchayats where there was no OBC reservation on December 21, 2021. The polls for nagar panchayats which had an OBC quota which was to be converted to the general category were postponed to January 18. Accordingly, on January 18, polls will be held in 336 seats of 93 nagar panchayats. Also for 13 and 10 seats respectively in the Bhandara and Gondia zilla parishads and bypolls in 209 seats in 195 gram panchayats and bypolls in one seat of the Sangli Miraj Kupwad municipal corporation.

The case has been filed under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In all, 17 people, including students and a warden of a medical college hostel in Naigaon, have been booked in connection with a case filed last month by a third-year student of Occupational Therapy who had alleged that he was subjected to caste slurs and ragging in the college hostel for three years. The police said that from their inquiries with students, it did not appear to be a case of ragging.  Two anti-ragging committees formed at KEM Hospital have not been able to establish any ragging though some incidents of misconduct were found. Two students have been suspended for two months. Dean Dr Sangeeta Ravat said that they have handed over their findings of the ragging investigation to the police and MUHS. “We didn’t find any evidence to support his allegations of ragging.

He assailed the order on grounds that the state needed to have identified what documents it specifically was seeking and state’s application cannot be a roving enquiry, as it itself said they wanted the pen drive and document “for verification’.The court issued notice to the state and the next hearing is on January 27. —Swati Deshpande||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/phone-tap-report-magistrates-order-challenged-by-centre/articleshow/88961214.cms||---

These suspected patients were again tested and 26% of them (2,415) were found to be diabetic.As per Indian studies, roughly 30% of the population have the sugar balance disorder. During the Covid pandemic, this subset of patients emerged with the highest risk for complications and death. Hence, the BMC has decided to strengthen diabetes care at the primary health level or dispensaries. “We have dieticians who advise people on food and lifestyle changes,’’ said Dr Daksha Shah, the deputy executive health officer in charge of non-communicable diseases. The BMC gives diabetes medication for free at its dispensaries, but insulin only at its hospitals.“Diagnosed patients have been advised to seek regular treatment for diabetes at the municipal hospitals,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare.“If positive lifestyle changes are adopted, diabetes can largely be avoided in people on the verge of diabetes, that is, those with predisposition to diabetes. Also, regular medication can help reduce the risk of complications from diabetes,” said Shah.Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi said: “Early detection means people can use lifestyle modifications and medication to reverse diabetes.’’ tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/26-found-diabetic-after-tests-bmc-boosts-dispensary-care/articleshow/88961215.cms||---

Separated from her husband since five years, Unnati was living with her son and daughter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/woman-leaves-home-after-a-yr-killed-by-dumper/articleshow/88961220.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Leopard on prowl caught on CCTV of Goregaon housing society||MUMBAI: C33-Delta, the two-year old female sub-adult who was recently wrongfully captured by the forest authorities and then set free in the wild, was caught on CCTV cameras of housing societies in the Gokuldham area of Goregaon East. The CCTV footage was shared by residents with the forest department on Monday. Local residents said the leopard had visited the area in the early hours of Sunday, January 15. G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator and director, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, confirmed the identity of the leopard. “We have come across a CCTV footage of a leopard roaming in the premises of the buildings in Gokuldham area in Goregaon East. The forest department and team of researchers are continuously monitoring its activity and there is no need for panic,” he said. The CCTV footages show the cat on a high wall and then moving among parked vehicles. The forest department has deployed teams to patrol the area and also create awareness among residents. In a span of 50 days starting late August last year, a female sub-adult had caused panic in Aarey Colony as it attacked at least nine people on separate occasions in different locations in the colony. As the forest department set traps to capture the two-year old sub-adult female leopard, it first captured C33-Delta, the sibling of C32 who was causing the attacks. C32 was finally caught in the first week of November, and on November 12, C33-Delta was released after being radio-collared. C33-Delta is not part of the forest department’s study on SGNP leopards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/leopard-on-prowl-caught-on-cctv-of-goregaon-soc/articleshow/88961221.cms||---

Last week, the HC had concluded the hearing. Senior counsel Virendra Tulzapurkar and Nikhil Sakhardande, for the petitioners, had submitted that the challenge was to the November 30 ordinance amending Section 5 of the MMC Act by which number of corporators has been “arbitrarily” increased to 236. The number of corporators is based on the 2011 census, but the change in population from 2001 to 2011 was already acted upon before the 2017 BMC election, stated the plea. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, in his submissions before a bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and Abhay Ahuja, had said the state was justified as given a 3.87% increase in the population from 2001 to 2011, it was a duty to increase the number of corporators proportionately.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-rejects-plea-against-bmc-wards-increase/articleshow/88961222.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Special MCOCA branch set up to ascertain if case requires invoking stringent Act||MUMBAI: The city police have from Monday started a new unit called the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) branch to gather information on crimes related to organised gangs. Police said the branch will gather information on whether the case fulfills the legal requirement as set out in the Act. MCOCA came into force on February 24, 1999, and was aimed at tackling organised crimes. The crime is fuelled by illegal wealth generated by contract killings, extortion, smuggling in contrabands, illegal trade in narcotics, kidnapping for ransom, collection of protection money and money laundering, etc, says the statement of objects and reasons for invoking the Act. One of the conditions is that the person should be engaged in “continuing unlawful activity” which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years of more, undertaken either singly or jointly, as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than one chargesheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of 10 years, and that court has taken cognizance of such offence. The police had also started invoking MCOCA against chain snatchers. The MCOCA branch is headed by police inspector Manish Sridhankar, who was with the crime branch. The team will also have five to six policemen, including two sub inspectors and constables. The branch will be supervised by joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe. According to statistics, 27 offences of MCOCA were registered between 2019-2020 and 31 between 2020-2021. “Many times, when a member of an underworld gang is deported or a member of an organised crime is arrested, there is lack of information on whether the stringent Act can be invoked. A sanction from the commissioner of police is required and many a times sanctioning authority is dragged to courts for not following due legal process. The branch will also keep a tab on the activities of criminals who are released on bail in MCOCA case,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/spl-mcoca-branch-set-up-to-ascertain-if-case-requires-invoking-stringent-act/articleshow/88961223.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||Shot in the arm for MSRTC as strike declared illegal by court||MUMBAI: A labour court on Monday held as illegal the strike by employees of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). Following the order, MSRTC MD Shekhar Channe has appealed to workers to end the strike and resume duties across the state. Channe told TOI, “With the labour court order, our action against protesting workers — which includes suspension of over 11,000 employees, dismissal of nearly 3,000 and transfer of several others — stands justified.” In the case filed by MSRTC versus Maharashtra State Transport Kamgar Sanghatana and others, the order by D V Joshi, the presiding officer of fourth labour court, said, “The strike from October 27, 2021, onwards is declared as illegal.’’  MSRTC’s advocate, Gurunath Naik, had argued that all unions and their members proceeded on illegal strike under the guise of hunger strike, also did not give 14 days notice, and did not comply with the provisions of Section 24 (1) (a) (b) of the MRTU & PULP Act, 1971 and Section 22 of the ID Act, 1947 and, therefore, the strike is illegal. The MSRTC made various unions a party, and the unions, through their advocate, argued that they were not striking. But Naik argued that employees belong to a union and hence the union is responsible. . So far, nearly 26,000 workers have resumed duties and MSRTC has managed to operate 226 out of 250 bus depots across the state. The daily ridership has crossed four lakh. The order is a shot in the arm for MSRTC management. “We have been saying that the strike is illegal for over two months, but a section of workers and unions refused to believe this. They claimed that the protest was a mourning (“dukhavta”) for employees who had committed suicides in the past few years,” said an official. Sources said that the government can now demand that employees resume duties at the earliest or face strict punitive action, under MESMA (Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act) .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shot-in-the-arm-for-msrtc-as-strike-declared-illegal-by-court/articleshow/88961225.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Citizens ask for ‘oversight committee’ to be set up to monitor parks, gardens||MUMBAI: With the BMC clearing tenders for maintenance of parks and gardens to companies that have bid close to 40% below the BMC’s estimates, citizens groups have suggested that an ‘oversight committee’ be set up to review the works by contractors. The BMC took over three months to decide on the low bids but finally gave in and cleared a proposal to award contracts worth Rs 69 crore to companies that have bid 40% below estimates. Despite scrapping tenders and forfeiting deposits of contractors for making bids 40% below estimates, contractors have once again bid around 40% below estimates in fresh tenders floated this month for maintenance of over 200 parks and gardens. In a letter to Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal, NAGAR, an NGO has recommended setting up of an oversight committee to keep a check on the work being done by contractors. “NAGAR would like to suggest that during the one-year tenure of the current contracts a mechanism of oversight and audit of these open spaces be put in place at the ward level. This should include the formation of a municipal ward level committee comprising BMC officials, the local Corporator and neighborhood Residents’ Associations/ALMs. They should meet at specified intervals, say once a month, to check the state of the open space to ensure the contractor is doing his work as per the conditions of the contract, including the deployment of experienced staff. Residents’ Associations should be encouraged to be the eyes on the open space and give both positive and negative feedback to the ward office and the feedback should be reported to the Ward Committee for further action,” NAGAR said in its letter. The letter signed by NAGAR’s Nayana Kathpalia and Meher Rafaat stated that the details of the contractors must also be put in public domain. “It is our earnest request to you to urgently put in place such a monitoring group to coincide with the approval of the tenders and the allocation of the public open spaces being handed over to them. Such a ward wise list, including details of the allocated contractor, should also be put up on the BMC website for the information of all citizens who could then participate and play an important role in oversight of such spaces to the benefit of all,” the letter added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/citizens-ask-for-oversight-committee-to-be-set-up-to-monitor-parks-gardens/articleshow/88961226.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||HC rejects pre-arrest bail plea of BJP MLA Nitesh Rane||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday rejected a plea for pre-arrest bail filed by BJP MLA Nitesh Rane. It, however, continued interim protection of no coercive action against him till January 27. Rane, a BJP MLA, is now expected to appeal against the rejection order. The HC also rejected a similar plea for pre-arrest bail by Rane’s co-petitioner, Sandesh Sawant.Rane and co-accused Sandesh Sawant had sought protection against arrest in connection with an attempt to murder case registered last month in Sindhudurg. Their senior counsel, Niteen Pradhan, had argued before Justice C V Bhadang saying the invoking of an offence of attempt to murder was “preposterous’’.The HC in its order said in such a case it is required to balance the conflicting considerations of personal liberty and a need for proper investigation in a larger societal interest. “At this stage, in my considered view, the proper investigation is the paramount consideration. Thus, I do not find that the applicants Rane and Sawant are entitled to pre-arrest bail,’’ said Justice Bhadang.Co-accused Manish Dalvi who also sought pre-arrest bail argued through his senior Ashok Mundargi that he was earlier named a witness and it is not explained why or how he was made an accused. The HC granted pre-arrest bail to Dalvi in the case, saying , “His name does not figure in the complaint lodged by the injured. His involvement is not prima facie shown on the basis of the investigation at this stage. He was called as a witness. It is also pointed out that there are no criminal antecedents to the discredit of the applicant as he has been acquitted of the offences in a full trial on contest, which is not disputed. Thus, in my considered view, protection can be granted to the applicant Manish Dalvi on conditions.”Special Public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola argued that co-accused Sachin Satpute was arrested and he was a close associate of Rane. He said Satpute’s statement was recorded and it was found that all co-accused except Rane were in telephonic contact with each other.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-plea-of-bjp-mla-nitesh-rane/articleshow/88961227.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||MMRDA contractor to pay Rs 1 crore fine for girder crash||MUMBAI: Four months after a span of an under-construction elevated road, which was under construction, collapsed at Bandra-Kurla on September 17 last year, the regional development authority, MMRDA, has penalised the contractor Rs 1 crore for “not taking adequate precaution, leading to the collapse”. The 65-metre-long and 8-metre-wide two-lane span which collapsed weighs 250 metric tonnes. TimesViewEvery year there have been instances of labourers or construction workers getting killed at infrastructure project sites, which is shameful. MMRDA has done the right thing by imposing a penalty. Hopefully, this will deter contractors from ignoring safety protocols. Hope other government bodies also take a leaf out of this and begin taking stringent action for minor and major mishaps.The span was for the elevated, road which was under construction, which is an extension of Santacruz-Chembur Link Road. Fourteen labourers had had an escape but sustained minor injuries. A senior MMRDA official said, “We have imposed a fine of Rs 1 crore on J Kumar Infra Projects Ltd and another Rs 20 lakh on the consultant. Both these firms failed to ensure adequate material support that would ensure the span does not collapse.” Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas confirmed, “We have imposed the penalty to ensure accountability although no death had taken place.” Sources said it the first time that such a steep penalty has been imposed by the infrastructure body although there was no casualty. The sources also said that the penalty was based on the findings of an inquiry committee that comprised experts from Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and from Veer Jijamata Technical Institute. The collapsed span was made of steel. It had a sharp curve-shaped design. In April, the span was laid above the MMRDA ground portion, near BKC-MTNL junction, parallel to the path ofMithi river in that area. There were no pedestrians below the collapsed portion at that time since the MMRDA ground, where work is under progress, is completely barricaded. The arm that collapsed originates near Citibank on BKC Road and takes a left turn before taking another left to take traffic from BKC to Santacruz. The bridge tilted when work on pouring of concrete was in progress on the surface of the slab. The work on the bridge had begun in 2016 and was scheduled to be completed in 2019. However, absence of right of way and design issues as well as Covid-induced lockdown had led to extension of deadline. The bridge, as per revised schedule, was targeted to open in March this year but MMRDA will miss this deadline too as the steel span will be procured again. Such steel span design girders require time to be designed and to be manufactured. SCLR, which is 3.8 km long, is beingconstructed at a cost of Rs 415 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mmrda-contractor-to-pay-1cr-fine-for-girder-crash/articleshow/88961228.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Mumbai||‘Omicron wave ebbing in Mumbai; in rest of India, it could linger till March’||MUMBAI: The waning of the Omicron wave has begun in Mumbai, but it may take at least another month before the rest of the country experiences a decline in the third wave. As for the pandemic, with some European countries having registered around five Covid-19 waves between 2020 and 2022 so far, it may continue to linger—though not in as debilitating a manner as it was in 2020—if new mutations of concern occur, said experts. “Based on the various mathematical models, the Omicron wave in India will last until the last week of January or early February,” said epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu. The Omicron wave typically takes three weeks to reach a peak and is about three times faster than the Delta wave to do so. “The next two weeks are crucial across India,” he added. There are pockets such as Mumbai and Delhi, though, where the threat was noticeable in late December and the wave has already peaked. “By the time this wave stabilises and declines, it is likely to be March,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava. The popular theory is the pandemic could translate into an “ endemic” viral infection sometime this year and see localised and short peaks. “In India, we may see small pockets persistently reporting cases. For instance, Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala and Chhattisgarh could continue to see small waves that will hopefully be localised,” added Dr Shrivastava. As per the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a research institute working on global health statistics and supported by Harvard University and Bill Gates Foundation, Omicron will continue to circulate and potentially return later in the year as immunity wanes. The January 13 IHME report said new variants would emerge in 2022 and Covid will continue to be a recurring problem. “However, the notion of a pandemic requiring extraordinary intervention and behavioral change is likely over by early March,” the analysis added.  In India, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said there is a high possibility of the pandemic declining if there is no new variant of concern beyond March and April. “We can expect a disruption-free world after March or April, with mini or mild outbreaks,” he said. But will the pandemic end? Dr Joshi said flattening would occur only after we have vaccinated all 7 billion people on the planet. American virologist Dr Kutub Mahmood on Sunday said it would end soon. “This cannot go on forever, and that end is pretty soon. I would say there is no winner in this game of chess, this is going to be a draw, where the virus will go in hiding and we win, we may come out of hiding behind our facemask. So, we hope to move forward, I think we are getting very close to that.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/omicron-wave-ebbing-in-mumbai-in-rest-of-india-it-could-linger-till-march/articleshow/88961230.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fewest daily Covid cases in 2022 take tally past 1 million, deaths up||MUMBAI: Nearly 680 days after the pandemic started, the city’s Covid-19 caseload touched the 1 million mark on Monday. Only the US, India, Brazil, the UK, France, Russia and Turkey have seen more patients than Mumbai in the two-year-long pandemic so far. The day also marked one of the lowest daily tallies for Mumbai since January 1: only 5,956 patients were registered on Monday as against 20,971 on January 7. Daily detections in the city as well as the state reported a drop due to low testing over the weekend. Maharashtra added 31,111 cases on Monday, the lowest in 12 days. The total caseload in the state touched 72.4 lakh, of which 10.1 lakh are in Mumbai. Mumbai has had more Covid-19 cases than many countries, like the UAE, Nepal and Saudi Arabia. While cases continue to report a decline, fatalities in the city stayed in double digits. Mumbai added 12 deaths, the highest since July 29 (13). The state added 24 deaths, taking the death toll to 1,41,832. “Due to the Sunday effect, when fewer tests are conducted in the city, Monday’s tally is slightly lower. We need to watch the trend for a few more days before declaring that the Omicron wave is surely waning,” said a senior BMC official. While doctors agree that the Omicron peak has passed in Mumbai, the city has a history of a thick “tail” during the stable period of the infection. “For the time being, the Omicron wave seems to be on a decline in the city at least. However, we need to be alert for a couple of days more,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19. A civic hospital doctor said there is a need to study the spread of the infection. “Most of the infections so far have occurred in the highrises. We need to see how the infection pattern continues in the city’s other zones,” said the doctor. Dr Shashank Joshi, another task force member, said while most Covid cases have mild symptoms, there is a need to watch out for Delta infections, which still account for 10% to 20% cases in the city. Active cases in the state rose slightly to 2. 7 lakh while that in Mumbai dropped to 50,000. State government officials said the sudden rise in cases in smaller cities like Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur is a cause of concern and health infrastructure in these areas can be overburdened in no time. Officials said oxygen demand in the state was gradually on the rise, but not drastic. “People in smaller cities, especially rural areas, are still not following Covid protocols like wearing masks and maintaining distance,” said a senior official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fewest-daily-city-cases-in-22-take-tally-past-1m-deaths-up/articleshow/88961233.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Third Covid-19 wave now spread across all Maharashtra districts||MUMBAI: The staggering number of infections has drastically altered Maharashtra’s Covid-19 picture in just a fortnight. The third wave surge that started with Mumbai and Pune has now spread to all 35 districts.  Active cases in the state increased from 32,225 on January 1 to 2,65,346 on January 16, a jump of 736%. At least seven districts from Vidarbha and several from Marathwada and northern Maharashtra, including Nandurbar, Bhandara, Wardha, Washim, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli and Hingoli that had active cases in single digits have registered a 100 to 300-fold rise in the past two weeks.  From Vidarbha region, Bhandara’s active cases have jumped from 2 to 570, Wardha’s from 7 to 1,003, Yavatmal from 9 to 572 and Washim from 3 to 296. The region’s biggest city Nagpur has seen active cases rise from 251 on January 1 to nearly 10,000 now. The graph has been equally steep in districts of Marathwada. Nanded has seen active cases jump from 17 to 2,768 in a fortnight, while Latur has seen a rise from 41 to 2,142 cases.  In northern Maharashtra, the tribal district of Nandurbar has seen cases surge from 6 to 621, a 100-fold rise. Its neighbouring districts Dhule (10 cases to 810) and Jalgaon (17 to 1,846) have also seen a big surge. Dr Mahendra Chavan, district health officer of Nandurbar, said that the rise so far has been in Shahada, Taloda and Nandurbar talukas, from where a lot of people travel to other districts or states for work. The district has two confirmed cases of Omicron and both had a Mumbai and Pune travel link.  A state official told TOI that the third wave spread is much like the first wave that had started from big cities and spread to the smaller ones as people travelled. In the Delta-driven second wave, the increase was first seen in Vidarbha, from where it spread to Marathwada and gradually to the rest of the state. The fact that Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s share in active cases has now dipped to 46% from upto 82% on January 1 is the biggest marker of the disease’s spread, the official said.  The exponential rise in cases, though, is yet to translate into crushing load in hospitals, said district health officials, although hospitalisations and deaths typically lag the rise in cases by 2-3 weeks. In ten districts, the death figures have remained the same in the last two weeks. While in seven others, it has increased by single digits. Palghar has seen the highest jump in deaths at 0.6%, followed by Mumbai, where deaths have risen by 0.5%. In Maharashtra, deaths have increased by 275 from 1,41,533 to 1,41,808.  Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and head of Covid death audit committee, said the coming 2-3 weeks will be crucial and both Mumbai and many other districts will start seeing a rise in deaths. “As the disease moves from the young to vulnerable groups, deaths are likely to go up,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/third-wave-now-spread-across-all-maha-districts/articleshow/88961234.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The plants were inaugurated by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Before this, the BMC refilled its oxygen cylinders from plants in Navi Mumbai. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu said, “This will enable proper distribution of oxygen cylinders along with tackling storage of medical oxygen. All the officials of the BMC rushed day and night to get all the necessary permits, set up the project in a span of only 3 to 4 months. BPCL also gave invaluable support for the work.”“The BPCL medical oxygen production plant at Mahul produces about 72 metric tons of medical oxygen per day. Out of which about 10 to 15 metric tons per day will be available for cylinder refilling by the BMC. Around 112 cylinders with a capacity of 7.1 cubic meters can be filled per hour,” said an official. The plant cost BMC around Rs21 crore. Officials said that a refilling plant has been set up at Mahalakshmi Racecourse area for liquid medical oxygen dura cylinders. “There is a large tank that can store about 13,000 litres. The project has the capacity to fill 100 to 120 cylinders per day. Overall,it has reduced the cost of dura cylinder refilling by about 35 to 40%, which is expected to save around Rs1.5 to Rs2 crore for the BMC,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-launches-2-oxygen-cylinder-refilling-plants/articleshow/88961235.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||4 out of 5 Indians set to change jobs this yr||Mumbai: In what indicates that India is mirroring the American phenomenon of ‘the great reshuffle’, 82% of the country’s workforce is considering changing jobs in 2022.Leading the pack are freshers (94%) and Gen Z professionals (87%), according to a new job-seeker study by the online professional network, LinkedIn. Based on the responses of 1,111 workers in India, the survey — the findings of which were shared exclusively with TOI — shows that professionals are leaving their current jobs due to poor work-life balance (30%), not enough money (28%), or greater career ambitions (23%). Ankit Vengurlekar, India managing editor, LinkedIn News, said the top three things professionals are looking at are flexible working arrangements (29%), sustainability/corporate responsibility element in the role (27%), and the opportunity to take the next step in their career paths/career progress (27%). “Overall, professionals in India are confident about their job roles (45%), careers (45%), and overall job availability (38%) getting better in 2022,” he said.What’s alarming, however, is that 71% of professionals said they question their abilities at work more now than before the pandemic, while 63% said they suffer from “imposter syndrome”. Over 30% professionals said the pandemic has negatively impacted their confidence at work and the reasons behind such anxiety are, not surprisingly, a lack of face-to-face support from supervisors and peers (40%), having to take on new responsibilities (34%), and having to use more technology (31%).Several reports suggest that pandemic-related disruptions have had a significant impact on mental health of people due to factors like isolation, increasing health concerns, and uncertainty about the future. Recently, Procter & Gamble India (P&G) announced that it has set up a task force of certified mental health first-aiders. This was done to strengthen its mental health support system. The first-aiders are P&G employees from different work groups who are trained to provide support and assist a person experiencing mental health issues and guide them towards professional help. On the other hand, Mariwala Health Initiative (MHI), a personal philanthropy of Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala, launched a mental health toolkit for corporates to help them take preventive and proactive steps to ensure employee mental well-being. In 2022, the LinkedIn survey said working women are more likely to quit their current job due to poor work-life balance, when compared to men. Over 2 in 5 (43%) working women (total 321 female respondents) are actively looking for a new job, primarily for better work-life balance (37%), and higher pay (30%). Working women are also more likely (49%) to say they will remain with their current employer if they get better pay, when compared to working men (39%). “The top reasons that can convince professionals in India to stay with their current employer in 2022 include better salary (42%), more appreciation (36%), and improved work-life balance (34%),” said Vengurlekar.

---||Mumbai||‘Rohit or Ashwin must be stop-gap captain’||Mumbai: Indian cricket is in the midst of a massive debate: Who should be the next Test captain of India post Virat Kohli vacating the post? At the moment, sources point towards Rohit Sharma — who is already India’s white-ball captain in Kohli’s place — being the top favourite for the position. Rohit was appointed as the vice-captain of India’s Test side before the tour of South Africa, before a hamstring injury ruled him out.Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar and India’s 2011 Yuvraj Singh are batting for star wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant, who slammed a hundred in the final Test, to take over as the new Test captain. Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar, though, recommends that, for now, anyone amongst Rohit Sharma or Ravichandran Ashwin should be the new skipper of India’s Test team, as Pant and opener KL Rahul aren’t yet ready for the job.“I would appoint Rohit or Ashwin as a stop-gap captain and groom the future captain. Right now, you need somebody with captaincy experience and an assured place in the Test side. Rohit and Ashwin have established themselves in Test cricket. Pant, Rahul, or Shreyas (Iyer) need another year before they’ll be ready for the job. Pant has proved his mettle, but needs to work on his shot selection. Till then, either of them can be asked to captain India in the white-ball format, and be the vice-captain in Tests. That ways, they’ll get to observe and learn how to lead the Indian team,” Vengsarkar told TOI.Back in 2007, Vengsarkar, who was then the chairman of the selection committee, and his panel had appointed then veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble as the Test captain for the series against Pakistan, when everyone thought MS Dhoni would be appointed for the job. “We wanted to give some more time to Dhoni before he took the Test captaincy. He was already the white-ball captain, and we wanted him to learn a few things by following Kumble closely. Kumble led India superbly in that period,” he recalled.The 116-Test veteran blamed the previous selection committees over the years for the leadership crisis in Indian cricket following Virat Kohli’s exit as captain. “It has been caused over the years by the selectors’ lack of vision in grooming a captain for the future. Like we groomed Dhoni, they just haven’t identified the right man to replace Kohli as a captain. I just couldn’t understand why Shikhar Dhawan was named as the captain of India’s tour of Sri Lanka last year.,” Vengsarkar opined.“Rohit is my choice. He’s still got a lot of cricket in him. By virtue of being the best batsman in the team today, he’s a certainty in the side. He’s got the tactical skills for captaincy. He’s a good man manager. He’s an experienced, cool, responsible guy. All this talk about giving captaincy to someone for a decade is nonsense,” said former Mumbai captain and chief selector Milind Rege.Rege too was critical of KL Rahul’s captaincy during the second Test against South Africa at Wanderers, which India lost. “Captaining India is not easy. Rahul, I thought, was found wanting as a captain. His inexperience of captaining a team — leading an IPL team is completely different to captaining a side in a Test match — cost us dear. You could’ve waited before asking him to lead the team in a Test. A vice-captain doesn’t need to automatically become the captain,” Rege explained.Pant, though, has his backers. “This is the perfect time to make him Test captain. He’s 24, and in fine form and could be a long-term option. Captaincy might also bring out the best in him,” said ex selector Sarandeep Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rohit-or-ashwin-must-be-stop-gap-captain/articleshow/88961238.cms||---

Devendra Pol, Senior Police Inspector of Pen Police Station said, “The thieves targeted the SBI bank’s ATM kiosk located at the Sun City building in Pen city along the main road. The bank officials have claimed that on January 15, they had refilled the ATM machine and the total cash stolen is more than Rs 56 lakhs. The thieve escaped with the cash and left behind agas cylinder and tools that were used for cutting open the ATM panel at the bottom.” Atul Zende, Raigad Additional Superintendent of Police said, “The theft at ATM came to light at around 5.30 am, after a JSW logistics firm worker reached the spot, which was his pickup point as per his daily routine to board the company’s bus. The worker saw the glass door of the ATM kiosk open and the ATM machine damaged. Hence, he immediately informed the Pen police.” Zende further informed that the thieves sprayed black paint on the CCTV camera inside the ATM kiosk, before cutting open the ATM machine. Hence their images were not captured. However, we have got the footage of a CCTV camera in the locality and four suspect thieves are seen escaping in a four-wheeler, which is a vital lead for us to nab the thieves.” Tracker dog ‘Oscar’, a Doberman, who recently helped the Mahad taluka police, in identifying the accused in the rape and murder of a woman Sarpanch of a village in Raigad, was taken to the SBI bank’s ATM, to track the robbers. But Oscar was unable to smell the scent of the robbers as they might have used hand gloves while handling the tools for gas cutting the ATM machine, the police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/gang-utilises-gas-cutter-to-break-atm-steal-56-lakh/articleshow/88961239.cms||George Mendonca

Analysis of state war-room data shows 5,726 children in this age group tested positive between January 1 and 16. In other words, more than 350 children were infected each day of January, compared to 376 in December and 332 in November. Cases in January so far are more than the total cases reported from September to December 2021. The last time monthly cases in this category were more than 5,000 was June 2021, while May and April that year saw more than 20,000 cases. At the end of May, the state had 77,000 cases in this age group which had jumped to 94,340 at the end of December. As of January 16, it has breached the 1-lakh mark. Detailed age-wise data shows that while the 0-10 group has more than 1 lakh cases, the next 10-19 group has more than 2.6 lakh patients. Those aged between 30 and 39 account for most cases (more than 7.3 lakh) followed by 5.5 lakh patients from the 40-49 age group. Health officials said almost all of these cases are mild and the rise in infections among children is in line with the overall increase in cases in the past fortnight. Karnataka has added 2.1 lakh cases in January so far at a rate of 13,296 a day. The test positivity rate among those in the age group has breached the key 5% mark in Karnataka for the 15-day period in January, while the highest TPR (16%) is among those aged above 80 years of age, followed by 14.4% in the 70-79 group. District-wise TPR analysis puts Bengaluru on top with 14.6% of all samples from this age group returning positive, followed by Tumakuru (6.7%), Bengaluru Rural (5.2%), Mandya (5.6%) and Mysuru (4.58%). Analysis of five 15-day periods preceding January 1-15 shows TPR in this category never crossed 0.3% barring once during October 16-31.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/more-cases-in-2-weeks-of-january-than-past-4-months-in-0-9-yr-kids/articleshow/88961257.cms||Chethan Kumar

Formula E is a single-seater motorsport championship hosted by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for electric cars. It has zeroed in on Hyderabad as part of its global hunt for new locations. Other iconic cities to host the sport include Monaco, Paris, Berlin, London, New York, Seoul, Tokyo and Rome to name a few. If all goes well, Hyderabad will book its slot as host city for the E-Prix's upcoming Season 9 to be held between December 2022 and March 2023. The championship's Season 8 is set to begin later this month starting with Diriyah in Saudi Arabia and travelling to a dozen cities across five continents, including Mexico City, Rome, Berlin, New York, London, Monaco, Cape Town and Vancouver before ending with Seoul. The Telangana government has mooted a T-shaped, 2.3-km stretch near the Secretariat and overlooking Hussainsagar for the Hyderabad E-Prix. The race will see scores of formula EVs zip and zap their way on the city's roads and below the Telugu Talli flyover at speeds of up to 280 km per hour. A team from Formula E, including its co-founder and chief championship officer Alberto Longo and track and overlay director Agus Zomano, that is on a two-day visit to the city, inked a letter of intent on Monday with the Telangana government and Hyderabad E-Prix promoter Greenko Group. The tripartite agreement, signed in the presence of Telangana's industries & IT minister KT Rama Rao, makes Hyderabad an official candidate host city for the championship that has been fast gaining ground among motorsports enthusiasts. Formula E has garnered an estimated cumulative viewership of around 500 million in the past seven years since its first race was flagged off in 2014. Pointing out that hosting the prestigious motorsporting event was in line with Telangana's vision to become the ‘most electrified' state in India in terms of mobility, KT Rama Rao said: "Hyderabad has always been a happening place with a cosmopolitan crowd that has the awareness and appetite for such marquee events. This will be one of the flagship events for the state, putting Hyderabad on the global map with 18 cities such as Paris, Rome, London, Hong Kong, New York, Berlin, Monaco." Alberto Longo said he was excited about the championship's potential entry to India. "Hyderabad truly has the necessary ingredients to be a probable host from the next season. It has always been our desire to come to India as it's a major automotive market quickly adopting electric vehicles. We hope Formula E can accelerate this change," he said. Sujai Karampuri, director -- electronics & EV, Telangana, pointed out that Formula E fits right into the Telangana government's gameplan to put Hyderabad on the global map at a time when the state is also trying to pitch itself as India's EV hub. Pointing out that one needs to look at the motorsporting event from a 10-year perspective, Karampuri said that though the first couple of years will necessitate investment by the state government as well as the E-Prix promoter, eventually it will generate a huge global buzz around brand Hyderabad. "Once we are on the calendar we will be rubbing shoulders with iconic global cities, boosting brand Hyderabad and its recall value. Also as it's a huge activity, it will also drive a lot of international motorsporting enthusiasts and tourist traffic into the city, benefiting sectors like hospitality, among others," he pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-set-to-vroom-into-formula-e-circuit-inks-pact/articleshow/88961262.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The flight was to take off around 2.30pm, but much to the flyers’ shock, they had to wait for nearly four hours inside the plane before the crew announced that all of them will have to disembark. They were later informed the flight was cancelled due to a technical snag but no AI official was present to address passenger grievances.With no information on rescheduling of the flight, many passengers staged a protest inside the terminal, demanding that Air India officials give clear information regarding the new flight timings and accommodation for those stranded. Airport officials intervened and pacified them, following which Air India officials reached out to them.According to an Air India spokesperson, AI 175 was grounded because of a technical snag and all 196 passengers were offered accommodation or return taxi fares to their homes for Monday. The flight has been tentatively rescheduled to 12.45pm on Tuesday and the airline will also bear the cost of RT-PCR test of all flyers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/passengers-protest-after-ai-sfo-flight-is-rescheduled/articleshow/88961266.cms||---

Locals, however, were under the impression that the civic body itself was responsible for taking away a huge chunk of greenery from their area. In fact, they were irked by the fact that BBMP hadn’t held a public consultation before axing the trees. The Palike’s zonal-level engineers were unaware of the illegal activity until late Sunday evening. Govindraju, deputy conservator of forests, BBMP, said: “The felling was illegal. It was brought to my attention only late Sunday evening and I visited the spot on Monday morning. Unfortunately, there are no CCTV cameras in the vicinity to help us get more evidence.” BBMP officials said residents were under the impression that the civic agency was felling the trees either to widen the road or to make room for Metro work. “BBMP did not authorise this. We have filed a case with the forest cell under Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act,” Govindraju explained. The miscreants cut only the smaller trees such as Pongamia and did not touch the ones with slightly larger girth, he added. According to BBMP sources, miscreants saw the weekend curfew as an opportunity to illegally axe trees, knowing that citizens would be indoors and police busy managing law and order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/23-trees-felled-bbmp-clueless/articleshow/88961267.cms||---

The Act needs to be amended on scientific lines which will allow maximum use of water by all riparian states in the river basin,” the chief minister said at the inauguration of ‘PM Gati Shakti’ southern zone conference chaired by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The CM’s statement assumes significance as Karnataka has been pushing for environmental and other clearances for the Mekedatu project that Tamil Nadu is opposing. The execution of many irrigation projects has been delayed by inter-state river water disputes with Maharashtra, Goa, and Andhra Pradesh as well. Bommai said there are also some legal interventions necessary to resolve the ongoing issues.  “The delay is costing states heavily and time has come for the Centre to re-examine the laws governing irrigation projects. There should be a scientific win-win formula on the basis of the maximum utility of a river basin’s capacity and use of technology, without heeding political considerations,” he added. Bommai also emphasised the need to have a uniform coastal regulation zone (CRZ) for overall development of the country’s coastline.  “At present, the laws are different in each state. The laws on environment, forest, investment, inter-state river water disputes and CRZ need to be revisited to accelerate the speed of infrastructure development and for the development of tourism,” he said. PM Gati Shakti objective The Centre has initiated PM Gati Shakti — Rs 100 lakh crore national infrastructure master plan — to lay the foundation for holistic infrastructure development and ensure integrated pathway for the economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched it on October 13 last year to break departmental silos and bring in more integrated planning and execution of projects to address issues of multi-modal and last-mile connectivity. The aim of the southern zone conference was to achieve a concrete roadmap for the state master plan along with the creation of the PM Gati Shakti institutional framework at the state level for proper planning, management and scheduling of projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/interstate-river-water-act-creating-more-disputes-than-resolving-them-says-cm/articleshow/88961268.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai may announce debt relief panel||BENGALURU: Following pressure to waive farm loans, given the huge crop loss caused by excessive rain in November 2021, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai is said to be working on a permanent policy to address farmers’ distress. It is expected to be announced in his maiden budget in March. Officials from the agriculture and cooperation departments said the government is considering enacting a debt relief bill outlining guidelines for issuance of crop loans, their recovery, the conditions under which interest component is waived, and when the government can take over the entire burden of loan and repay on behalf of farmers. The government is also expected to set up a permanent debt relief commission to monitor enforcement of the law, on the lines of Kerala model. “Waiving loans year after year is an ad-hoc approach that is impractical considering the financial implications. And the present financial situation, hit by the Covid slowdown, is not conducive to having such measures,” said agriculture minister BC Patil. “Instead, we want a permanent policy and it will be part of the 2022-23 state budget.” Cooperation minister ST Somashekhar said he has asked department officials for ideas that can be formulated into policy, and the debt relief commission is one such proposal on the cards. “We will convene a series of meetings in the first week of February and prepare a budget wishlist for the farm sector that will be presented to the chief minister,” he said. What previous regimes didWhile the JD(S)-Congress government headed by HD Kumaraswamy had, in the 2018-19 budget, announced a scheme to waive crop loans running up to Rs 1 lakh, benefiting 26 lakh farmers, Congress’ Siddaramaiah had, in 2017, waived loans running up to Rs 50,000 taken by 22.3 lakh farmers. Bommai, who also holds the finance portfolio, is already under pressure to announce a similar populist measure as his budget will be the last full-fledged one before the 2023 assembly elections. He is expected to present an interim budget for 2023-24 in March 2023 before the end of his government’s tenure. Further, it also comes ahead of zilla and taluk panchayat polls this year. While Kumaraswamy’s scheme cost the exchequer Rs 29,000 crore, Siddaramaiah’s cost Rs 8,165 crore. Somashekhar said the present government cannot afford another scheme like this. “Instead, we will disburse the pending payment of loan waiver scheme of the previous government. About 53,000 farmers are yet to get loan waiver to the tune of Rs 350 crore and we will clear it this time,” he said. GC Bayya Reddy, president, Karnataka Rajya Prantha Raitha Sangha, said the Kumaraswamy government had enacted the Karnataka Debt Relief Act in 2019 as a temporary measure to waive loans, but the state needs a permanent policy. Somashekhar said the farm loan target was increased to Rs 20,810 crore in 2021-22 from Rs 14,500 crore in 2020-21 and the government’s priority is to ensure deserving farmers get loans and official assistance. “Measures like enacting the Debt Relief Act and setting up a relief commission will help,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/cm-may-announce-debt-relief-panel/articleshow/88961269.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

In case MUDA fails to refund the amount within eight weeks, the petitioner is entitled to 12% interest from the date of order till payment, the order stated. Radhika had paid under protest the penalty for a site originally allotted to her father-in-law Vishwanath Bhat in Mysuru in December 1988 by the housing society.After change of khata and execution of sale deed in March 2018, following payment of penalty, she challenged the November 23, 2016, endorsement issued by MUDA. MUDA had said she was required to pay the penalty as her father-in-law had failed to construct a structure on the allotted site. Her father-in-law, the original allottee, died in November 1998 and his successor, Radhika’s mother-in-law, passed away in April 2007. Five years later, in September 2012, Radhika’s husband Venkatesh also died, leaving behind their two children. Radhika contended that by an erroneous interpretation of the rules, MUDA had charged a penalty of 25% of the site value and argued that it could be levied only if the allottee sold the site. MUDA claimed it could have cancelled the allotment itself and the petitioner can’t contend she is not liable to pay the penalty as till date, as the site has been kept as land bank. Justice M Nagaprasanna pointed out that the rules relied upon by MUDA were brought into force only from May 2, 2013, and could be applied to allotments made between 2001 and 2005. The judge said Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987, does not empower framing of such a rule that imposes penalty. “When the rule prohibits it, the communication cannot permit it, as it is a well-worn law that a circular or government order by itself cannot be contrary to the law, much less an ordinary communication from the urban development department to MUDA. Such a communication cannot be elevated to the status of a circular or government order having the effect of amending the rule,” the judge observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-relief-for-bengaluru-woman-in-penalty-battle-against-muda/articleshow/88961271.cms||Vasantha Kumar

The government has identified 7,404 hectares of the compensatory afforestation (CA) land in three districts to be given in the ratio of 1:3 for the 5,096 hectares of forest land that is expected to be submerged due to the construction of the reservoir. According to water resources minister Govind Karjol, the CA land is spread across three districts of Ramanagara, Mandya and Chamrajanagara, and the state is awaiting to secure the terms of reference (TOR) from the Union ministry of environment and forests. “Of the 5, 257 hectares which will be required for the project, only 160 hectares is private land which needs to be compensated for in monetary terms,” he added. Medha Patkar to join greens’ protest  Social activist and Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, with the support of environmentalists and social organisations, is planning to launch an agitation against the project stating that it would result in submergence of 5,000 hectares of forest and displacement of thousands of tribals in the surrounding areas. The state government is also awaiting the outcome of the January 25 Supreme Court hearing of a plea related to the project. The Tamil Nadu government had filed several pleas, including the one for a direction to the Central Water Commission to reject and return the detailed project report filed by Karnataka on January 18, 2019. According to government sources, the BJP is trying to push for the project clearance and lay the foundation stone before the assembly polls next year as it will help consolidate its voter share in south Karnataka.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/state-pushes-for-eco-clearance-to-take-up-mekedatu-project/articleshow/88961272.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

Imran had claimed that the role assigned to him in the chargesheet cannot be read in isolation in the context of a derogatory Facebook post allegedly made by Naveen, a relative of local Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasamurthy. His participation in the protest in a peaceful manner does not amount to intention or premeditation on his part to inflict violence, the SDPI leader claimed. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-bail-for-local-sdpi-leader-in-east-bluru-violence-case/articleshow/88961273.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: This taxman’s passion for maths shows in brain-teaser calendars||BENGALURU: This superintendent in Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST), Bengaluru zone is fondly called the ‘Math Man’ by his colleagues. D Kumaresh, 57, weaves magic out of numbers and creates a calendar every new year. His pictorially informative calendar for 2022 is the 30th in a row. Year on year he has been designing and printing the annual calendar, very different from the conventional ones. He had even single-handedly conceptualised and created a taxation booklet for GST in Karnataka that was published by the department. “My calendar is something one can call a teaser, where the viewer must use his mind to find the days and dates. Apart from this, all days have a picture with an interesting message,” the officer says proudly. His 2022 calendar is just out and he has been distributing copies among friends and colleagues for free. Kumaresh, a civil engineer who has been with the state central tax department for 30 years, is a resident of HBR Layout. His penchant for numbers drove him to make his first brain-teaser calendar in 1992, featuring 100 years on one sheet. “In 2000, I made the millennium calendar featuring dates starting from 1950 to 2050,” laughs the superintendent. When celebs lauded workKumaresh’s pictorial calendars don’t just catch the eye of officials in his department, but celebrities too. His 2014 one themed on cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar post his retirement in November 2013 had the masterblaster himself pen a note of appreciation for the Bengaluru officer. “It was so special to receive his letter appreciating my work. Former Indian Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda too lauded my calendar for the year 2001, which is designed on the theme of famous TV game show ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’,” he recalls. In 2012, Kumaresh created a calendar themed around Bengaluru Metro Rail, marking its maiden run from MG Road to Byappanahalli in October 2011. An ardent cricket fan and music lover, Kumaresh recently made a pictorial timetable with the life and works of music maestro Ilayaraja, which he presented to the famous composer at his Chennai studio. Known as the man of numbers among Bengaluru central tax department colleagues, Kumaresh, who sits at the office of the commissioner of excise and service tax in Shivajinagar, conceptualised and created a taxation guide for GST after it was introduced in July 2017. “Out of interest, I created a complete guide incorporating details on all GST zones in Karnataka, statistical details of Karnataka Central Tax and taxation procedures, which could make GST procedures easier for the public and officials,” he adds. The central excise department printed and released his work as a booklet titled Margadarshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/this-taxmans-passion-for-maths-shows-in-brain-teaser-calendars/articleshow/88961274.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Man gifts tenant innerwear, lands in soup||BENGALURU: A 42-year-old schoolteacher alleged that her landlord gifted her innerwear on her birthday and demanded that she put them on and show him. The woman went to jurisdictional Hanumanthnagar police and filed a complaint against Padmanabha, her landlord and resident of Srinagar, south Bengaluru. The woman told police that she had been residing in a rental house belonging to Padmanabha for the last 12 years and worked as a schoolteacher. On her last birthday, Padmanabha gave her a gift packet. She thought it was a normal gift, but was shocked to find lingerie items instead. Padmanabha allegedly started demanding that she go out with him and also wear the stuff he had gifted her and show the same to him. He allegedly started asking her for sexual favours over phone. When the woman resisted, the accused directed her to vacate the house. “On the night of January 11, he jumped the main gate and locked my house from the outside,” she alleged. The woman decided to file a complaint and approached Hanumanthnagar police on January 12. Police have taken up a case against Padmanabha under IPC sections 441 (criminal trespass), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 354A(1)(ii) for demanding or requesting sexual favours. Police summoned Padmanabha for questioning in the case. The landlord reportedly claimed innocence and alleged the teacher had filed a false case against him as he had asked her to vacate the house.  Preliminary investigation revealed there was a dispute between the woman and the accused over vacating the house. The probe also revealed Padmanabha had indeed locked her house on January 11, when she was sleeping inside. “We are investigating the gift and sexual harassment allegations. If the allegations are proved, we will take action against the suspect,” a police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-gifts-tenant-innerwear-lands-in-soup/articleshow/88961275.cms||Santosh kumar.B

Three persons approached HR manager Abhijit Roy saying they had paid between Rs 15,000 and Rs 75,000 to a suspect to get a job in the company. “The three came to us with fake job offer letters given to them by the conmen. The letters mentioned the victims were appointed and should meet HR manager MR Pradeep. In our company, there is no HR manager by that name. Similarly, the trio took online payment from many others after promising them jobs at our company,” Roy said in his complaint. The suspects — Sanjeev GG, Deepak Singh and Deepak Kumar Singh, all from Bengaluru — have been booked by police. “They suspects approached aspirants who had uploaded their resumes with different private job consultancy firms. The manner in which they interacted with the victims and won their trust shows they had ample knowledge of the formalities followed by IT firms when hiring employees,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/three-booked-for-cheating-aspirants-with-fake-job-letters/articleshow/88961277.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Pandemic fuels dip in takers for auto permits||BENGALURU: With the demand for autorickshaw rides falling after Covid-19 struck and work-from-home arrangements began, there are very few takers for new auto permits in the city. In 2018-19, the transport department decided to issue 30,000 new auto permits in Bengaluru by 2023. This included 24,500 for LPG/CNG autos, 5,000 for electric ones, and 500 for pink autos. However, the department has issued only 10,000 permits so far. There are also no takers for pink autos. “Every year, we were supposed to issue 5,000 permits. We were planning to issue 15,000 permits by now, but only 10,000 have been given out because of low demand,” said VK Moosa, regional transport officer (autorickshaws), Shantinagar. Many autorickshaw drivers say there has been no business following Covid. “When existing auto drivers are struggling to pay EMIs, why will new drivers obtain permits? Many financiers are also not giving loans for new autos. If they give permits to more auto drivers, it will affect existing drivers too,” said K Manjunath, a driver. The Centre had stated that commercial transport licence (yellow badge) is not a prerequisite for driving light motor vehicles. However, the state has not issued a notification yet. “The Centre had stated that yellow badge is not compulsory, but the Karnataka transport department is still insisting on it. This is one of the reasons many drivers are not applying for permits,” said Ramesh Kumar, another auto driver plying in Indiranagar. Getting a yellow badge is a time-consuming process. Drivers can apply only one year after obtaining a licence to drive commercial vehicles. “If there are no takers for new permits, they can regularise illegal autos or give multiple permits to existing drivers,” Kumar added. The transport department recently said around 35,000 illegal autorickshaws are plying on city roads. Officials said they will issue autorickshaw permits to those who are permanent residents of Bengaluru and have commercial transport licence. An applicant will be allocated one permit only and s/he shouldn’t have any other autorickshaw permit. The permit fee will be Rs 500. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike had, in 2017, announced a women-driven autorickshaw scheme. However, not a single pink auto has hit Bengaluru roads so far. The civic body had announced a subsidy of Rs 80,000 per pink auto for women availing permits. The 500 pink autos were to be equipped with GPS and CCTV cameras. However, stringent conditions like ferrying only women and children, congested roads, and very few women having commercial licences have resulted in the poor response.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/pandemic-fuels-dip-in-takers-for-auto-permits/articleshow/88961278.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Colleges asked to take part in R-Day Surya Namaskar event||BENGALURU: The University Grants Commission requested universities and colleges to ask students to participate in the Surya Namaskar event on Republic Day. The National Yogasana Sport Federation, with the support of Ayush ministry, had planned to hold a musical Surya Namaskar project in front of the tricolour on Republic Day and a 75-crore Surya Namaskar project as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations. The programme is expected to run in 30 states, involving 30,000 institutions and 3 lakh students. “All universities and their constituent/affiliate colleges are requested to participate in the event and spread the word among students, faculty and staff,” read the circular. A similar circular to schools and PU colleges in December created controversy after several educationists and managements called it an attempt to “saffronise” educational institutions. PU colleges in the city said they will do Surya Namaskar on January 26. “Around 55 students are part of it. If the government’s intention is to improve health, it’s a good idea,” said the principal of a government PU college. A standard operating procedure for celebrating Republic Day in higher educational institutions has also been released. The flag-hoisting programme should end before 9.30am. It can be organised in either virtual or physical format depending on the Covid situation, but all teachers and students should participate. This apart, higher educational institutions have to develop a craft project on 75 years of independence . The ministry of defence will provide a central mechanism to send them to jawans on the border. If higher education institutions are closed, students could be asked to do these activities from their homes. Students are also encouraged to participate in competitions like dance, debate, plays, essay-writing and class projects during days leading to January 2. Quizzes should be on the theme of India’s freedom struggle, gallantry awards, victories by armed forces, etc. Covid protocols should be maintained during the events, the circular added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/colleges-asked-to-take-part-in-r-day-surya-namaskar-event/articleshow/88961279.cms||---

The closure of the flyover since December 25 for maintenance work has triggered a nightmarish crawl on the national highway. According to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials, pre-stressed cables were found damaged in two pillars — 102 and 103— and needed immediate repair.Though it was initially said that the work will be wrapped up in a week, the closure was later extended till January 14. However, NHAI sought one more extension, stating the work isn’t over. The flyover carried 50,000-60,000 vehicles every day in both directions.With vehicular movement diverted to the road below, commuters are complaining that during peak time, it takes 2-3 hours to travel between Parle toll plaza to Yeshwantpur railway station, a distance of about 7km. Normally, it would have taken less than 40 minutes. Not only commuters, even traffic cops are facing a tough time. At least 100 traffic cops are deployed for most part of the day between Parle toll plaza and Goraguntepalya junction.A letter dated January 13, 2021 and addressed to city traffic police by the project-director, NHAI, AK Janbaz read: “Earlier, we had requested to extend the closure of elevated highway (Peenya flyover) up to January 14. The repair/rehabilitation work of pre-stressed cables is a highly skilled work and has to be carried out in precise manner, the same is being carried out by the concessionaire through the specialised agency. The repair/rehabilitation of the pre-stressed cables work is under progress.”“Further, this office has requested the IISc director to carry out detailed inspection of the project highway (elevated highway) and urgently take up structural audit to ascertain the soundness of the elevated highway and to suggest the remedial measures required to be taken for ensuring safety of road users.”Given the above facts, it is requested to further extend necessary support for closure of highway traffic till the safety audit and remedial measures for repair/rehabilitation of the pre-stressed cables are completed, the letter added.Janbaz, however, did not respond to calls or messages from TOI.Kuldeep Kumar Jain, DCP (traffic-west), said IISc will conduct an audit on January 19 and traffic police are awaiting response from NHAI officials on opening the flyover.Bengaluru-Nelamangala elevated expressway was opened to the public in December 2010 and the closed stretch is the first flyover from the city side. It connects the city to 20 districts of north, central and coastal Karnataka.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/iisc-to-do-safety-audit-of-tumakuru-rd-flyover-report-to-decide-opening-date/articleshow/88961282.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Attrition levels are reaching record levels.Apparao V V, CHRO at HCL Technologies, said they did an analysis of those who are quitting, and constructed a compensation roadmap that captured the aspirations of people. “We talked to the lines of business to train them for niche skills, certify them and deploy them,” he said. HCL's attrition rose to 19.8% in the December quarter, from 15.7% in the quarter before.HCL, which has 1.9 lakh employees, plans to hire 20,000-22,000 fresh graduates this fiscal year. “We will double our fresher hiring in the 2023 fiscal,” Apparao said.The Indian IT industry is seeing a great resignation wave because of the talent shortage. Apparao said they are training many more people than before. “When we hire, we end up paying 25-30% more. Today, for the sake of growth we are paying, but it’s not a sustainable model. HCL is a 2-lakh people organisation, we are running an attrition of 20% which means we are losing 40,000 people, we are growing at 15%, that means we must add another 30,000 people. Where will we get 70,000 people? We have to reskill. We haven’t had a bench in the last 1.5 years. We have exhausted all the people,” he said.Apparao said HCL has identified 600 leaders who are in their mid-30s and 40s as nextgen leaders based on past performance, and customer feedback, and are mentoring them, giving them role rotations to make them well-rounded leaders. “Even in our delivery centres in the US, Europe and elsewhere, attrition has gone up from 4%-5% to 15%. The demand-supply gap is everywhere. Most youngsters get 3-4 offer letters before they decide where to join,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hcl-provides-5-yr-compensation-visibility/articleshow/88961284.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||‘HCL products biz at $1.5bn annual run rate’||Bengaluru: HCL Technologies saw its revenue rise 7.6% sequentially, the fastest in 12 years, and faster than that of peers TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Growth was led by the products & platforms business, and by engineering R&D services. The former is a big bet that HCL has taken with the purchase of legacy products of companies like IBM. In an interview with TOI, CEO C Vijayakumar spoke about the momentum in these businesses...It was a standout quarter for the products & platforms business. How do you see that?Our growth is broad-based. The momentum in the services business is continuing. In products, some deals did not close in the previous quarter, but did so in the December quarter, and that aided growth. This is a long-term business, can’t look at it quarter-on-quarter. This is a strategic bet we have taken, and differentiated compared to the general industry, which is focused on services. It requires modernisation of products, it needs a better positioning in the analysts’ ratings. More marketing will help to create good momentum for the business. Some of the products are mission-critical for our clients. For instance, Commerce runs e-commerce for many big corporations. Our products business is at a $1.5-billion annual run rate and it’s a profitable business. There are very few companies which have $1.5 billion in annual revenue from software products, and are also profitable. What was the organic and inorganic mix in your growth numbers?The sequential growth is 100% organic. In the year-on-year growth, there may be possibly 1% which could be inorganic. Demand for outsourcing and transformation services is very strong. A lot of customers are adopting cloud, but more so as a business strategy, as cloud allows them to increase resilience, scale up and scale down in line with the business dynamics. We were one of the first to build the hyperscaler ecosystem and we have our Cloud Smart offerings, which we launched two quarters ago and focused on providing cloud consulting services.ER&D contributes 16% to your revenue and grew at 20% YoY. What are the demand drivers?Engineering R&D is the fastest growth segment for us. The verticals where we have seen the most traction are the software and internet segment, including silicon design projects. There is also tremendous traction in telecom — whether it is about low latency, enterprise 5G deployment. There’s also medical engineering.How are customers responding to higher prices for in-demand skills and how are you repurposing the talent pyramid?Every programme has a mix of talent that comes together to deliver the outcomes, and that will determine the nature of the team — whether it is a pyramid or any other talent structure. Customers are open to hiring tech skills at higher rates. The services business margins dropped 190bps. Was it due to wage hikes and retention measures?It is, of course, driven by supply-chain cost escalations. We increased wages, which contributed to 80bps (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) drop in margins. We hired a lot of freshers and they are under training, Attrition has spiked and there are backfilling costs. These are some of the reasons that have contributed to the drop in margins.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hcl-products-biz-at-1-5bn-annual-run-rate/articleshow/88961285.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Chennai, which logged 8,571 new cases, reported a drop after 28 days. However, during the same period the number of tests have reduced to 1.35 lakh from 1.39 lakh, and the daily test positivity rate has increased by two percentage points to 19%. “The drop in daily cases may not mean that the wave is receding,” cautioned health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “Many patients have not reported symptoms during the festival week.

However, over the last week, the number of patients getting admitted in ICU wards have nearly doubled. Health officials say the occupancy rate is 27% in Vellore district, which has tertiary facilities. On Sunday, 11% of the 75,000 isolation beds -- non oxygen, oxygen and ICU -- in the state were occupied compared to 8% a week ago on January 9. During the same period, the occupancy of ICU beds doubled to nearly 8%. In at least nine districts, including Chennai (14%), the occupancy rate is above the state average. “People from several other districts and states come to hospitals here for treatment,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The state health department said there is no need to panic. “We cannot compare this wave with the previous wave when we were short of beds, oxygen and lifesaving drugs. Nearly 90% of hospital beds in the state are still vacant across the state,” said health minister Ma Subramanian. Data show that around 6% of the active patients require hospitalisation and 0.5% of them require ICU admissions. However, the biggest worry for the state is that nearly 37% of the 10 lakh senior citizens (above 60 years) – nearly 3.9 lakh people — have not taken even the first dose of vaccine. And more than half of them haven’t been fully vaccinated. “The risk of hospitalisation, ICU admissions and deaths is very high in this group. Vaccines are provided free of cost and there is no shortage. We want everyone to take at least two doses,” Subramanian said. On Monday, 16 of the 20 Covid deaths reported by the state were above the age of 60. An equal number of senior citizens were on the Sunday’s list too. “The risk of deaths is high among people above 60 years and comorbid conditions worsen it. We have seen vaccines providing immense benefit,” said director of public health Dr TS Selvavinayagam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/covid-19-bed-occupancy-high-in-chennai-vellore/articleshow/88961289.cms||Pushpa Narayan

---||Chennai||Chennai: Wrong numbers, unattended calls a challenge for civic body||CHENNAI: Wrong numbers given by Covid-19 positive patients and home-quarantined patients not taking the calls are becoming a challenge for city corporation officials in Covid-19 containment. The officials said at least 35 to 40 numbers are either fake or have a few wrong digits daily. Close to 200 calls go unattended even after multiple attempts. A zonal health official from Royapuram, said a person had given a wrong number during his time of testing, and the staff could not follow up after the patient turned positive. “We went to his house based on the address. We enquired the neighbours and got to know the correct number. The patient later attended and he was travelling in a suburban train,” the official said. Recently, in a meeting held at Ripon Buildings, the city health officer told zonal health officers to file police complaints on those giving false details to the corporation. Jeevankumar Sankar, floor manager in-charge of collecting patient data at the tele-counselling centre of zone 5, said in the last week, 26 people had given wrong numbers, including an RGGGH staff nurse, giving ‘90000 00000’ as her number. “We could not contact the person and had to send a sanitary officer to find out where the person was,” he said. Dr Mothis Kumar, who heads the tele-counselling centre in Anna Nagar, had similar experiences to share. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said they do a three-source verification of patients. “Some give wrong numbers. Some may genuinely not attend as they may be busy or sleeping. So, first we check through tele-counselling, then send a sanitary inspector and finally a triaging doctor, if they need help,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/wrong-numbers-unattended-calls-a-challenge-for-civic-body/articleshow/88961291.cms||Omjasvin M D

Meanwhile, the content of the programme was translated to Hindi and other languages. The programme was telecast as part of the special programmes during the Pongal festival. Two contestants, aged below 14 years, adopted a theme from Tamil movie ‘Imsai Arasan 23 am Pulikesi’ and aluded to the PM. Netizens, particularly Dravidian stocks and their supporters, shared it widely and trolled BJP TN unit and its president K Annamalai. “During the course of the programme, the kids were deliberately making obnoxious comments about PM Narendra Modi.

Since January, chief minister M K Stalin, corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi and chief secretary Irai Anbu have inspected the road-relaying work at night at a few places. Activists said the civic body must blacklist erring contractors to bring a change in quality of roads. “Accountability must be fixed on the contractors and officials in-charge, and the contractors must be blacklisted and officials taken to task,” Arappor Iyakkam convenor Jayaram Venkatesan said. “Complaints to 1913 helpline are forwarded to the assistant engineer, who is part of the project. How would they act on complaints on their own project? Thus, a control room, headed by the commissioner, must be set up,” he added. Venkatesan also questioned how the public can monitor road-relaying projects, if it were done during curfew time. H Chandrabose, a contractor with the corporation, said the civic body must bring in diversity by including multiple contractors and not give contracts in bulk to a few. Bedi said blacklisting of contractors has been advised and action would be taken on the erring contractors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/blacklist-contractors-to-ensure-quality-road-work-say-activists/articleshow/88961301.cms||Omjasvin M D
---||Chennai||French civil law won’t apply to partition of property in Pondy: HC||Chennai: Only Indian civil law is applicable if immovable properties are located in the territory of India, even though the parties to the litigation are French nationals living in Puducherry, the Madras high court has held.Though the marriage (of the litigants) was solemnised and divorced under the French law, when it comes to partition of immovable properties, particularly those located in Puducherry, only Indian civil law comes into force, a division bench of Justice T Raja and Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy said.In this regard, it ruled as maintainable a suit for partition moved before an Indian family court.The issue pertains to an appeal moved by a man, challenging the order of Puducherry family court dated January 30, 2017 ruling in favour of his wife who sought partition of properties owned by the couple.As their marriage falls under the community regime under the French law, after divorce the properties owned by the couple during their marriage would be equally divided between the two.According to the husband, as per French civil law, to get the properties, the wife has to approach the ‘Notaries of France’ within three months of dissolution of the marriage. In default, the partition ordered during the divorce would become void.Since the divorce was ordered in 2005 by a French court, there was an eight years delay in seeking partition. He further argued that since the marriage and divorce was under the French law, a partition suit moved before the Puducherry family court is not maintainable.Refusing to concur, the court said: “The manner of effecting partition is a rule of procedure and therefore in matters of rules of procedure, the law of the forum (rule of the land), will be applicable.”There is no ‘Notaire’ system under the rule of the land. Unlike Indian law, where there are separate enactments dealing with substantive law and procedural law, French Code Civil is a compendium of their entire civil law. Therefore, French law would not apply,” the judges said.Further, the ‘Notaires of France’ do not possess territorial jurisdiction to carry out the partition of the properties situated in India since all the properties were located only in Puducherry, the court added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/french-civil-law-wont-apply-to-partition-of-property-in-pondy-hc/articleshow/88961303.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai’s performers pay tribute to kathak legend Birju Maharaj||CHENNAI: A sense of humour that sparkled with wit and sarcasm – that’s how dancer Anita Ratnam remembers late Pandit Birju Maharaj. The kathak legend died at his home in Delhi late on Sunday after suffering a heart attack. He was 83. “In the 1970s and 1980s, he used to come to Chennai regularly for the December music and dance season. He had a fantastic sense of humour. One of his performances centered on going to an office and opening a filing cabinet. It was done through mudras and created the office scenario for the audience. He had the audience in splits,” says Ratnam, who first met the dancer in Mumbai in 1973, when he presented her with Sur Singar Sansad’s youth dancer award. “Another of his dances dealt with cell phones – call drops, putting people on hold, and the various kinds of calls you get.” In 2013, Ratnam brought him down to Chennai to be part of the Purush (Men in Dance) conference. “His performance was the closing event. We didn’t ask him to dance. Instead, he did a sit-down musical concert at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He sang ghazals, thumris, and played the pakhavaj and got a standing ovation,” says Ratnam, adding that Maharaj was a fantastic percussionist. “He could play the tabla, pakhavaj, dhol, and even mridangam.” As a dancer, he can be credited with bringing a kind of format to kathak, says Ratnam. “As a performer, Birju Maharaj can be credited with organising the kathak repertoire into a full evening’s performance,” she says. Revathi Ramachandran, director of Kalakshetra Foundation, remembers the time the kathak maestro visited the Besant Nagar campus in 2018 for a workshop. “He would keep breaking into song and playing the table and the students just loved it,” says Ramachandran. “Offstage, he was a simple and soft-spoken person, but on stage, that was a whole new person, larger than life,” she adds. Bharatanatyam dancer and member of the state planning commission, TN government, Narthaki Nataraj remembers performing with him at the Cleveland Thyagaraja Aradhana in 2015. “He played Krishna in the “Mahabharata’ and I was playing Krishna in a dance-drama on Andal, and it was a scene where both Krishnas meet. He was humble and down-to-earth and also taught me in-depth about the nuances of abhinaya and mudras, and how to convey a message subtly,” says Narthaki. Actor-politician Kamal Haasan tweeted a tribute to Panditji along with a picture of the dancer training him and actress Andrea for 'Unnai Kaanaadhu...', from 'Vishwaroopam'. The first line of the song translated, reads, "I am not myself today as a result of being unable to see you", which Haasan ended his tribute with. The dance sequence won Maharaj the National Film Award for choreography in 2012.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennais-performers-pay-tribute-to-kathak-legend-birju-maharaj/articleshow/88961306.cms||---

The department has collected Rs 5.6 lakh as compounding fee from these bus operators in the last six days, according to official data. Twelve teams were formed to inspect bus fares across the state. During their checks, they found many buses did not pay taxes. So, a total of Rs 11 lakh was collected from such violators and among them six buses were impounded for violating vehicle permit conditions, said transport minister RS Rajakannapan. The teams are expected to continue the drive for the next three days. The government has launched a toll free number (1800 425 6151) to file complaints in this regard. While the public have welcomed this move, private omni bus operators feel anguished. The Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, allows omni bus operators, who have obtained a contract carriage permit, to fix their own fares. While the law allows the passengers (clients) to negotiate the fares, it doesn't give the government any scope to act against such arrangements. The state can get involved only when it amends the said rules. But TN is one of the very few states not to implement the new MV Act, 2019. Mohammed Afzal, president, Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners Association said the industry is already in doldrums as only one-third of the available buses are operated. Even in those buses, the occupancy is very low. The expenditure on the other hand has increased due to fuel cost and taxes. "The government can take over our high-end buses and attach them to SETC. But their unions will not allow us to join and also, they will not have the capacity to pay us back," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pongal-buses-250-pvt-operators-booked-for-collecting-excess-fare/articleshow/88961311.cms||Ram Sundaram

Slamming delays of such largescale revenue matters, Justice S M Subramaniam said: “Such a situation is absolutely unconstitutional and further anything under the earth belongs to the government and it is the nation's property, which belongs to the people of India.” Pointing out the negligence on part of court officials, the judge said: “There are many instances, where petitions are not even listed for hearing before the courts, and it is yet another issue, which is to be taken note of by the registrar general of the high court.” There are several allegations that these writ petitions are not listed on account of bundles misplaced or on various other reasons, including corrupt activities and if these things are noticed, then serious actions are to be initiated against all officials, who all are responsible for lapses, negligence and dereliction of duty, the court added. Noting the grouping section of the high court must be put to proper use, the judge said, “The section must be utilised for collecting large scale revenue involved cases now pending before the high court for many years and the registry must place all those cases before the Chief Justice for speedy disposal.” Considering the fact that large scale state revenues are at stake and many persons are taking undue advantage of the pendency of the writ petitions for unjust gains, which can never be tolerated and allowed by the courts, the judge added. The court passed the order on a plea moved by Dalmia Refractories Limited, Trichy seeking direction to the state government to grant necessary transport permits for mining and transporting mined minerals from Therani Village, Kunnam Taluk, Perambalur District to its factory at Dalmiapuram, Trichy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/pending-revenue-cases-cause-great-loss-to-nation-hc/articleshow/88961313.cms||---

The average hours spent on a mobile per day per user surged by around 4.5% from 3.7 hours in 2019 to 4.7 hours in 2021, according to data from global app intelligence firm AppAnnie sourced by TOI. The time spent on mobiles in 2020 had stood at 4.5 hours per day. Overall, India saw 655 billion hours spent on mobiles in 2021 (on Android phones) — a 37% increase since 2019 (381 billion hours). India stood at fifth place globally in terms of time spent on mobiles after Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea and Mexico. Users in the top three countries surpassed five hours per day on mobile apps. “Year 2021 was another blockbuster in mobile, following a pandemic-induced catalyst to mobile habits in 2020. We saw the average user in the most mobile-first markets spend 4.8 hours a day, equating to nearly one-third of waking hours — up 30% from pre-Covid levels,” AppAnnie head (insights) Lexi Sydow said.Consumers in India spent an annual 7.6 billion hours on shopping apps — a 16% year-on-year (YoY) growth from 2020, and 80% overall growth since 2018 (4.2 billion hours). The biggest gainer among social networks was Meta-owned photo- and video-sharing app Instagram, where users spent an average 13 hours every month — a 32% YoY growth from 9.8 hours in 2020. Indians spent an average 19.8 hours every month on WhatsApp, a marginal 1.5% dip from 2020 but an overall 3.1% growth since 2018.India continues to be in the second spot in terms of the largest app downloads market after China. AppAnnie’s ‘State of Mobile Report 2022’ showed that India clocked over 26.6 billion app downloads in 2021. However, monetisation remains a work-in-progress in the country as India did not feature even in the top 20 markets globally when it comes to consumer spends.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/indians-spend-nearly-5-hrs-daily-on-mobiles-in-2021/articleshow/88961315.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

It aims to move more than 50% of its gold jewellery range to its recently introduced ‘Hi-Lites’ segment in 12 months.Titan CEO (jewellery division) Ajoy Chawla said, “The Hi-Lites range offers among the lightest weight products in the market and, after our soft launch before Diwali, it has already seen a sharp growth in new customers in Q3.” Tanishq’s overall customer growth is up 32%, but the brand saw a 39% growth in new customers. “New customers typically buy gold and day-to-day wear and the Hi-Lites products have contributed 40% of the gold jewellery sales,” he added.In the second phase, the company will add more products to the light-weight category. “We are already looking at all our bestsellers and, in future, all new products will go through the process of light-weighting,” he added. “We are institutionalising it.” Tanishq expects to sell Hi-Lites products to “more than a million buyers in 12 months”, said Chawla.Gold prices have gone up by more than 20% in the last 12 months, prompting the brand to look for ways to light-weight some of its best-selling designs. “We have reimagined the product piece on 3,500 SKUs (stock-keeping units), which are among our bestsellers, and launched them in October,” said Chawla.The Hi-Lites range was 30% of the gold jewellery in stock, but contributed 40% of sales in Q3. The range of reduction is 15-25% with the company using a combination of “design reconstruction to remove excess gold”, changing the manufacturing process to make the piece lighter and changing the material to hard alloy 22-carat gold to provide lighter weight pieces in the same design.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tanishq-sets-its-focus-on-light-weight-gold-jewellery/articleshow/88961316.cms||---

The petitioner stated that he was terminated not over his performance, but due to a misunderstanding. R Loganathan of Madurantakam, in his petition stated that he was appointed as a sweeper in 2008 in one of the colleges run by Chennai based Sri Malolan educational trust. In June 2011, he was issued the termination order, following which he contested the same and sought salary arrears and other benefits. The trust contended that the petitioner is a non-teaching staff and said that the labour court doesn’t have jurisdiction to entertain his plea. The court, after perusing the submissions, set aside the termination, and directed that the salary arrears and other benefits be issued to the petitioner. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/labour-court-sets-aside-termination-of-pvt-employee/articleshow/88961318.cms||---

Syed Sajjad Ahmed claims that the police are yet to register a first information report (FIR) on his complaint. He also handed over the CCTV footage from the area to the cops. The crime wing personnel at the Ashok Nagar police station deliberately demanded that Ahmed sticks to the missing laptop and eliminates the car damage portion from the original complaint. Ahmed had gone for dinner on January 8, and on returning around 9pm, the windshield of his car was smashed, and the laptop was stolen. He had to rush home before the night curfew and couldn’t file a complaint the next day because of Sunday lockdown. He then visited the station on Monday and filed a formal complaint.

"A proposal has been sent to the ministry of education to establish these chairs. We are awaiting approval," said R Chandrasekaran, director of CICT. Chief minister M K Stalin, who is the chairperson for the governing board of the CICT, visited its new campus in Perumbakkam. "CM asked us to familiarise the institute's research work among school and college students. He also asked us to invite experts from other classical languages like Greek, Latin, and Arabic to conduct a comparative study at our institute," Chandrasekaran added. The institute has a residential facility for the visiting professors and researchers at its new campus. Stalin also released eight new books including Ainkurunuru Kurinji, Ainkurunuru Palai, A Historical Grammar of Tamil. The copies of the books were received by minister for Tamil official language Thangam Thennarasu, a release from the state government said. Kalaignar Karunanidhi Semmozhi Tamil awards for the years from 2010 to 2019 will be given to selected persons on January 22, the release added. Prime Minister Modi recently inaugurated the new complex built at the cost of 24 crore. It has four stories with a library, two conference halls, an administrative building and e-library, a video conferencing room, and rooms for visiting professors and researchers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/cict-to-set-up-4-classical-tamil-chairs-in-se-asia/articleshow/88961324.cms||---

In the next six months, visitors here will be welcomed by a sea of changes that include an LED wall displaying events and programmes, special light settings, refurbished floors, and new furniture. Apart from this, the leaky roofs and damaged glass panels are also being fixed. The parking lot and the entrance to the library will be well lit and those attending events at the auditoriums and conference halls will have a rejuvenating experience with improved lighting, sound systems and projectors. Besides, the library is all set to add to its vast collection of six lakh books after the state government allocated Rs5 crore to buy a new collection and Rs 1.5 crore for e-books and e-journals. The public works department started the restoration work last week. The state government has earmarked Rs 29 crore to repair and restore the library, which has been neglected for the better of the last decade due to political reasons. “A major chunk from Rs 29crore would be spent to repair and improve the infrastructure in the library. The government allotted Rs 6.5crore to buy new books, e-books and e-journals for the next three years,” an official from the directorate of public libraries said. The library is likely to offer access to its online resources from anywhere and anytime to its readers. “After receiving the amount, we will initiate steps to procure new books and e-books. These will be procured based on catalogues from leading institutes and on recommendations and ranking from leading book clubs, award-winning titles and authors,” staff from the library said. Presently, the library has around six lakh books, as against its objective of having more than 12 lakh books. It also has access to only 3000 e-books against the 2 lakh e-books target when it was inaugurated in 2010 by then CM M Karunanidhi. Inspired by the National Library of Singapore, Anna Centenary Library was conceptualised as a knowledge hub with a large collection of books and designed as a bustling centre for performing arts --drama, theatre, music, and other cultural events -- with a mammoth amphitheatre, an auditorium and conference halls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/anna-library-restoration-underway/articleshow/88961325.cms||A Ragu Raman

The national survey in six metros also found that for a majority of Chennaiites, the distance between the workplace and home still matters. While most homebuyers/ tenants look for independent houses, landlords in Chennai largely prefer families over bachelors as tenants.  The survey, conducted by online real estate portal NoBroker, questioned 21,000 customers in six cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai. According to NoBroker’s annual real estate report 2021, 53% of buyers from Chennai said it was a good time to buy a property for security of owning a physical asset, the highest among metros. For 56% of homebuyers, water supply was a top priority, next only to budget. Interestingly, 60% of buyers in Chennai preferred independent houses over society flats and plots, another top priority among the other metros. While 76% wanted a house within Chennai, 62% preferred a Vaastu-compliant home.  Among tenants, 66% looked for water supply and 58% security, while 45% chose homes for facilities available. About 41% shifted from their previous accommodation for want of a bigger house, while barely 2% cited work from home as a reason for moving out. For 69% of tenants, the distance from their workplace still matters.  On the other hand, 84% of landlords prefer families as tenants and 42% increased the rent now.  S Sridharan, chairman of development and housing body Credai, differed with the survey regarding for independent houses. “If you take the Chennai real estate market, apartment units are top, followed by plots and villas. In fact, homebuyers prefer apartment complexes because the maintenance and security are taken care.” Moreover, homebuyer's priority list is in the order of location, budget and water supply, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/water-supply-key-for-homebuyers-survey/articleshow/88961327.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

NH stretches across the state, particularly those connecting Chennai with Madurai, Bengaluru and Coimbatore, were battered by unprecedented rain in November. Some of them were temporarily closed due to excessive flooding. Potholes started to show up, making the commute dangerous. Accident rate also went up. A majority of the accident victims were bikers who hit heavier vehicles while changing lanes to avoid these potholes,” said S Yuvaraj from TN Lorry Owners' Association. Despite paying a toll fee, the damages remain unattended even now, he said, hoping for government intervention.  The Union ministry in its annual budget had sanctioned only Rs1.6 crore to TN for such damages. Following the state’s request, another Rs2.4 crore was approved recently, according to a circular.  Repairs along NH 66 (Tindivanam-Krishnagiri) and NH 205 (Chennai-Tirupati) will be taken up on priority using these funds, said a senior official of National Highways Authority of India whose Chennai office is expecting more funds next month. NHAI has written to concessionaires liable to maintain NH45 (Chennai-Trichy) and NH48 (Sriperumbudur-Hosur), to repair damages using the toll collected in the last few years. “Action will be taken if they don't oblige,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/2-4-cr-more-to-fix-rain-hit-nhs-in-tn/articleshow/88961328.cms||Ram Sundaram

According to sources, the vice-president was scheduled to take a flight around 9am, but his plan was changed at the last moment. Following this, the railway authorities were instructed to ready a special train with five coaches for the vice president. “The train will take six hours to reach Vijayawada from Tirusulam railway station,” said a senior railway official. The train was attached with coaches at Chennai Central railway station. The coaches were fumigated, cleaned and spruced up before being attached to the train. A senior official said that the salon car, which is meant for the general manager of the southern railway, had special facilities. Terming it as a ‘mini five-star hotel room on wheels’, the official said that the train has two bedrooms with an 4attached washroom and a hall. The running speed of the train will be displayed on a speedometer and the VIP travelling in this car can experience the outside view. Apart from this, the other coaches are meant for chief operations manager, chief commercial managers, and the divisional railway manager. A separate coach will carry the support staff, the official said. Earlier, the special train was scheduled to leave from Tirusulam railway station around 11.30am. However, due to a delay in the cleaning work, the train reached the station around 1.15pm, and left for Vijayawada destination around 1.45 pm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/vp-venkaiah-naidu-takes-special-train-to-reach-vijayawada/articleshow/88961330.cms||P Oppili

Civic officials said the pandemic had delayed the ₹45-crore project that envisaged restoration of the lake, building of a suspension bridge over it and an amusement park with rides for the public. Another issue has been delay in relocating about 275 families who had encroached in the lake-bed. Some 75 families were moved out last week and another 60 will be allotted homes soon. By February-end, the remaining 140 families will be resettled at K P Park tenements. An official said the controversy over construction quality at K P Park was delaying the process. C K Entertainment, which has the franchise to run the amusement park, paying the Greater Chennai Corporation ₹1 crore a year, has begun work on the suspension bridge, restaurants on an island in the lake, a bowling alley, an amphitheatre, a toy train, an aquarium, and rides. A senior civic official said the suspension bridge work will be completed by February 15. The bridge will be 250-metres-long at a height of 12.5 metres. Based on the model of the Macritchie treetop walk in Singapore, this bridge will also have a staircase and a lift that people can use to access it. “The lake level is full now. It is ideal to open it for public. We have almost completed most of the work. Due to encroachment removal, there was a delay. Also, most of the orders made for the bridge and other equipment was stuck due to the pandemic and lockdown,” said an official. To ensure that the lake doesn’t dry up in summer, metro water will set up a sewage treatment plant near it. Officials said the lake would be opened to the public for boating by March first week, but the amusement rides would be ready only by May. The island in the centre of the lake would be ready by then with restaurants and recreational activities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/boating-on-villivakkam-lake-to-begin-in-march/articleshow/88961333.cms||Komal Gautham

It also reiterated its earlier direction to the government to increase the number of tests per day being conducted in the state. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili heard a clutch of Covid-19 PILs and sought a fresh status report on the pandemic situation by January 24. The case will come up for hearing again on January 25. Responding to complaints by advocates representing petitioners that the high court's earlier directions, including one lakh tests per day, were not implemented, advocate general BS Prasad said that they have been following all the directives of the high court. "We are complying with all the directions given by this court. As far as one lakh tests per day are concerned, the officials at the ground level have some practical difficulties. Since some contempt petitions were filed in the high court for not conducting one lakh tests per day, we challenged that direction in the Supreme Court. We are complying with all the other directions given by the high court," the AG said. Not only that, there were a series of guidelines and directions from the central health ministry, ICMR, etc. "We are following them too. Even in respect of the number of tests also, we have increased them from 30,000 to 90,000 per day," he said. The government had directed all the educational institutions in the state to conduct online classes till the end of this month. "This is to stop the spread of the Omicron variant," the AG said. The bench then directed the state government to increase the tests and also to follow the central guidelines without any deviation. The health authorities will have to submit their status report by January 24.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-tells-t-to-scale-up-covid-tests-seeks-report/articleshow/88961339.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||All govt schools in Telangana to have English medium from next year||HYDERABAD: The Telangana cabinet has decided to introduce English medium in all government schools in the state from the next academic year. This was decided at the state cabinet at a meeting chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday. The decision to introduce English medium was taken after seeing a substantial jump in enrolment of such students in the state in the past year, especially after the second wave of the pandemic. The government will also come up with a legislation to regulate fees in all schools and colleges in the state. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh had in 2019 made English medium education compulsory from classes I to VI in primary, upper primary and high schools from 2020-21, in the process becoming the first state to have such a rule. But the AP high court struck down the GO in April 2020 and the state government challenged the order in the Supreme Court where the case is pending. While the Centre's new National Education Policy recommended education in the mother tongue or regional language ahead of English, many states like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh have given precedence to English in government schools. To prepare modalities and guidelines both for fee regulation and also on English medium schools, a cabinet sub-committee has been constituted. It will be headed by education minister P Sabita Indra Reddy, and have ministers Koppula Eshwar, Talasani Srinivas Yadav, S Niranjan Reddy, V Srinivas Goud, T Harish Rao, V Prashath Reddy, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, E Dayakar Rao and KT Rama Rao as members. "The committee will look into the aspects of availability of teachers to teach in English medium, availability of textbooks and other aspects," a senior official of the education department said. On fee regulation, various parents' associations have been demanding curbs on hikes by private schools. The government had set up a committee headed by former OU vice chancellor Tirupathi Rao, which recommended maximum 10% hike every year. To strengthen infrastructure and qualitative improvement in teaching in government schools in the state, the cabinet has sanctioned Rs 7,289 crore under the `Mana Vooru-Mana Badi programme. The cabinet took a decision to provide reservations for students studying in Forest College and Research Centre (FCRC) at Mulugu in Siddipet in the recruitment to the state forest department. "While 25% of the posts will be reserved in assistant conservator of forest posts, 50% in forest range officers and 50% in foresters," the Telangana chief minister's office said. To provide reservations, the cabinet also resolved to amend Telangana Forest Service Rules, 1997 and Telangana State Forest Subordinate Rules, 2000. The cabinet discussed irrigation issues in detail. To mobilise funds for Sangameshwara and Basaveshwara Lift Irrigation project proposed in Sangareddy, the state cabinet has cleared a special purpose vehicle `Manjeera Lift Irrigation Corporation Limited'. Irrigation special chief secretary or principal secretary will act as chairman while other officers will be directors of the corporation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/all-govt-schools-in-t-to-have-eng-medium-from-next-year/articleshow/88961343.cms||Koride Mahesh

In the same month, auction house Christie’s sold a digital work of art for the first time for $69 million. It not only set a record but also made a blockchain application called NFT instantly popular. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital items stored on a blockchain, the same network that runs cryptocurrencies. Anything digital — images, videos, music, even the online version of this article — can be converted into an NFT and monetised. NFTs are not the digital art but instead certificates of authenticity, and most use the blockchain of ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency. Just like crypto, trading of NFTs too has no legal backing yet. The lack of regulation also means that it is prone to price manipulation. Increased use of the internet and a surge in interest in crypto has driven NFTs’ popularity. “Many consumers who had put money in crypto were introduced to NFTs as a new medium of investment. NFTs also gained popularity when celebrities like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, Paris Hilton, and Snoop Dogg sold NFTs,” said Sumit Ghosh, CEO & co-founder of Chingari, the NFT marketplace that was launched by Salman Khan in October 2021. Apart from art and memorabilia collectors, some have taken to NFTs due to speculation as the value of a token is derived from what buyers are willing to pay for it. “The appreciation of crypto market capitalisation along with mainstream users adopting crypto drove NFT popularity,” said Santosh Yellajosula, member of Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) and chief ecosystem officer at Xfinite. He added that the NFT market may see a correction in the short term. The rising interest in digital art due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns also helped NFTs reach a mainstream audience — those that were not crypto backers. NFTs also enable digital content creators and owners of IP (intellectual property) to monetise their work or assets without a ‘middleman’ and earn a royalty every time the NFT is resold. “NFTs gave the ability to make digital assets scarce and verifiable. NFTs fractionalise digital content and make it tradeable — making IP liquid,” said the CEO of an Indian sports NFT company. The world’s most expensive NFT sold by Christie’s — a collage of 5,000 pictures by US artist Beeple — can be downloaded and ‘viewed’ by anyone but only one person actually ‘owns’ it. That ownership data is stored as an NFT on a decentralised blockchain network. In 2021, NFT sales reached $25 billion compared to just $95 million in the previous year, according to Reuters. But what led to this surge in virtual ownership? Industry players say, in an increasingly online world, ‘bragging rights’ — in the form of NFTs — too have gone digital. Top brands such as Coca-Cola and Gucci too have latched on to the trend and sold NFTs in 2021. In November, Amitabh Bachchan auctioned a recorded rendition of the poem ‘Madhushala’. Other celebrities like Salman Khan and Sonu Nigam too have launched NFT collections.

The report said that while India encountered headwinds from a rapid surge in infections due to Omicron, aggregate demand conditions are resilient amid upbeat consumer and business confidence and an uptick in bank credit. It also pointed out that manufacturing and several categories continue to remain in expansion mode. “Data from the UK and South Africa suggest that such infections are 66-80% less severe, with a lower need for hospitalisation. This has brightened near-term prospects and financial markets reflect this optimism,” the report said. The ‘State of the Economy’ report is authored by RBI staff and is published in the central bank’s monthly bulletin. In contrast, the global outlook remains clouded by considerable uncertainty. “Inflation continues to mount across geographies amid disruptions in production, supply chains and transportation. Consequently, the divergence between monetary policy stances across jurisdictions has widened,” the report said. Despite inflationary pressures, it made a case for policies favouring growth. “There are indications that supply chain disruptions and shipping costs are slowly easing, although the waning of inflation may take longer. This provides a window of opportunity to focus all energies on accelerating and broadening the global recovery”. The bulletin includes a study on consumer confidence. According to this, despite the low perception of the prevailing situation, respondents’ expectations for the year ahead showed faith in economic recovery after the subsidence of the pandemic. This is despite the pandemic severely denting consumer confidence in India, which reached historic lows as the repercussions of Covid unfolded. “Sentiments of households across strata were influenced by the spread of infections and fatalities. There was the enduring impact on consumers’ sentiments on their financial conditions as well as the general economic situation — with the latter increasingly driven by the former,” the study said. Consumers in cities severely hit by the pandemic expressed more negative sentiments as compared to respondents in the other cities. Another report in the RBI bulletin called for a second green revolution along with the next generation of reforms to make agriculture more climate-resistant and environmentally sustainable. It said that while the farm sector has been resilient during the pandemic, there are new emerging challenges including climate change. “Addressing these challenges would require a second green revolution focused on the agriculture water-energy nexus, making agriculture more climate resistant and environmentally sustainable. The use of biotechnology and breeding will be important in developing eco-friendly, disease-resistant, climate-resilient, more nutritious and diversified crop varieties,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-study-omicron-may-be-flash-flood-not-wave/articleshow/88960229.cms||---

As the real estate company told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant that an NoC would be required, including for using explosives for demolition, the court directed it to do the needful so that demolition could start immediately after two weeks. Supertech also agreed to start refunding money to homebuyers without any further delay. It said that there are differences in calculation done by it and the amicus curiae regarding the amount to be refunded to homebuyers and it was ready to disburse the amount as calculated by him. The bench, thereafter, allowed the company to refund the amount, but made it clear it would not prejudice the claim of homebuyers and final amount would be decided on Friday. The apex court had on August 31 granted three months to the company to demolish the towers comprising around 1,000 flats, which were built in contravention of various rules and buildings regulations including safety and fire norms. The time period expired by November-end but the demolition work has not even begun. The demolition work was to be carried out by the company at its own cost under the supervision of Noida officials. The court had also directed Noida to consult its own experts and experts from Central Building Research Institute in Roorkee to carry out the demolition work. Over 950 flats were to be built in the twin towers in which construction was done upto 32 floor when the Allahabad High Court first ordered their demolition in 2017. As many as 633 homebuyers had booked the flats in the twin towers, out of which 248 have taken refund and 133 shifted to Supertech’s other housing projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/twin-tower-demolition-2-wk-ultimatum-to-supertech/articleshow/88960420.cms||---

In its compliance report, the state government submitted to the apex court that it has, till January 16, received 89,633 applications from relatives of Covid-19 victims seeking compensation. Of these, the government has already sanctioned 68,370 claims. It has rejected 4,234 applications after scrutiny. However, the scrutiny of more than 17,000 applications is under process. Like many other state governments, the Gujarat government also regularly apprises the SC of its process of sanctioning the ex gratia payment in response to the orders passed by the court in October. Earlier, the state government had adopted a scrutiny process, but its notification was challenged by advocate Amit Panchal. The SC had pulled up the state administration when, despite suggesting strict adherence to its guidelines on disbursal of compensation, it had not simplified the process. A positive RT-PCR test report and death of the patient within 30 days are the only requirements for claim eligibility, according to the guidelines. Despite acknowledging nearly nine times higher Covid-19 death claims as compared to its official death toll, state health department bulletin has not updated the Covid toll. As per the bulletin. till January 17 Gujarat has recorded deaths of 10,164 Covid patients. Out of total, 53% of the deaths are recorded in Ahmedabad and Surat districts alone. Top sources in the state health department insisted the government followed ICMR guidelines in acknowledging a Covid death. “The ICMR guidelines were clear – those who had existing comorbidities and age-related complications were not included in the tally. Thus, those that fit the criteria were declared dead due to the pandemic,” said a senior official, adding that the all-cause deaths during this period has also seen an upward trend – in both 2020 and 2021, however refusing to quantify the number. A recent paper ‘Covid mortality in India: National survey data and health facility deaths’ is published in the latest issue of Science journal and is authored by 11 researchers from Canada, India and the US had claimed that the overall all-cause death in 2021 was 230% higher in Gujarat than the 2018-19 – the highest among the Indian states under survey. According to the estimates, Gujarat’s death tally rose from average 17,000 per month to 39,000 per month recorded during April-May 2021. This was the highest among 16 Indian states under survey.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/90k-ex-gratia-claims-against-gujarat-covid-toll-of-10094/articleshow/88960293.cms||---
---||Business||4 out of 5 Indians set to change jobs this year||MUMBAI: In what indicates that India is mirroring the American phenomenon of ‘the great reshuffle’, 82% of the country’s workforce is considering changing jobs in 2022. Leading the pack are freshers (94%) and Gen Z professionals (87%), according to a new job-seeker study by the online professional network, LinkedIn. Based on the responses of 1,111 workers in India, the survey — the findings of which were shared exclusively with TOI — shows that professionals are leaving their current jobs due to poor work-life balance (30%), not enough money (28%), or greater career ambitions (23%). Ankit Vengurlekar, India managing editor, LinkedIn News, said the top three things professionals are looking at are flexible working arrangements (29%), sustainability/corporate responsibility element in the role (27%), and the opportunity to take the next step in their career paths/career progress (27%). “Overall, professionals in India are confident about their job roles (45%), careers (45%), and overall job availability (38%) getting better in 2022,” he said. What’s alarming, however, is that 71% of professionals said they question their abilities at work more now than before the pandemic, while 63% said they suffer from “imposter syndrome”. Over 30% professionals said the pandemic has negatively impacted their confidence at work and the reasons behind such anxiety are, not surprisingly, a lack of face-to-face support from supervisors and peers (40%), having to take on new responsibilities (34%), and having to use more technology (31%). Several reports suggest that pandemic-related disruptions have had a significant impact on mental health of people due to factors like isolation, increasing health concerns, and uncertainty about the future. Recently, Procter & Gamble India (P&G) announced that it has set up a task force of certified mental health first-aiders. This was done to strengthen its mental health support system. The first-aiders are P&G employees from different work groups who are trained to provide support and assist a person experiencing mental health issues and guide them towards professional help. On the other hand, Mariwala Health Initiative (MHI), a personal philanthropy of Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala, launched a mental health toolkit for corporates to help them take preventive and proactive steps to ensure employee mental well-being. In 2022, the LinkedIn survey said working women are more likely to quit their current job due to poor work-life balance, when compared to working men. Over 2 in 5 (43%) working women (total 321 female respondents) are actively looking for a new job, primarily for better work-life balance (37%), and higher pay (30%). Working women are also more likely (49%) to say they will remain with their current employer if they get better pay, when compared to working men (39%). “The top reasons that can convince professionals in India to stay with their current employer in 2022 include better salary (42%), more appreciation (36%), and improved work-life balance (34%),” said Vengurlekar. Affiliate marketing specialist, site reliability engineer, molecular biologist, wellness specialist and user experience researcher are among the top 15 fastest growing jobs in India according to LinkedIn’s ‘jobs on the rise 2022 India list’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/4-out-of-5-indians-set-to-change-jobs-this-year/articleshow/88960242.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Delhi||Focus on ‘act’, not marital status: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: It is not enough to say that the “act” inside a marital sphere is not rape, and outside the sphere, it is, Delhi High Court said on Monday while hearing a batch of petitions seeking to criminalise marital rape. A bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar asked the amicus curiae, senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao, if there was any decision in the past where a statute saying that an act was not an offence had been quashed or struck down by any court, either the Supreme Court or a high court. “Till today, there has not been even a single argument, except in your arguments to some extent, or the judgments of the Supreme Court, which lay down principles or on which statute be declared unconstitutional, especially a statute dealing with criminal offence. We have not been shown any judgment on this point,” the court told Rao. Justice Shankar also said when a man was married, there was a social, moral and legal right for each partner to expect meaningful conjugal relations with the other. “The core issue is not being addressed… There is an expectation for accommodating the partner. If we have to say no, then we have to make out a case that the marital relations are totally irrelevant,” the judge said. The court asked the Centre to clarify its position in principle on the issue after the government sought time to formulate and place its “considered stand”. Justice Shakdher, who is heading the bench, said the Centre had to say “yes or no” as in issues such as the present one, deliberation didn’t end. Justice Shankar said there should be a “dispassionate” attitude and that the issue of criminalising marital rape should prima facie be viewed from the perspective of the “act”, and not of a married or unmarried woman. Senior advocate Rao submitted that there was no reason to preserve the marital rape exception in Indian Penal Code. He argued that a married woman couldn’t be denied the right to prosecute her husband if she believed that she was raped, and in case of denial of a conjugal relationship, the remedy before the spouse was to file a plea for restitution, “not force himself upon her”. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said it won’t be appropriate to place before the court a “less discussed and consulted stand” and time was needed to undertake the process of consultation. “I don’t mind that (consultation), but they have to take a decision which way they are going. There are some matters, for whatever reasons, I think the court ultimately decides one way or the other, and that’s how it gets resolved. You take your time,” Justice Shakdher observed. Mehta said the Centre had to place a considered stand before the court. “Considering that this is a 2015 matter, if your lordship can grant us a reasonable time. This might need a little consultation etc,” the solicitor general said. The bench said it would continue to hear other lawyers in the case, which would give time to the Centre. The Centre, on January 13, told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue of criminalising marital rape and had sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities on comprehensive amendments to the criminal law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/focus-on-act-not-marital-status-hc/articleshow/88960406.cms||Usha Das

This, as the original pieces have been reduced to ashes in Sunday’s raging fire, said officials of the club. Also damaged in the mishap are images of past presidents and vice presidents, who served since the inception of the club .“They included photographs of ex-defence officials and civilians, which are hard to get again. In fact, the collection of trophies was also exclusive to the Secunderabad Club. The walls have lost decades worth of glory,” said a member.Admitting how previous the trophies and taxidermy wall mounts were, president of the club, R Raguram Reddy said that the management would get wooden replicas of those made, in due course. “This activity will be taken up after the damanged portion of the club club is rebuilt,” said Reddy adding that the cost of the work is yet to be estimated. Even the final assessment of the damage, he said, would take at least a couple of more days. “While we are trying to assess the damage, it is turning out to be a difficult task as we are not being able to go into the building. The interiors are still very hot and police have sealed the premises for their investigation,” said a source from the club.Meanwhile, the club management has decided to constitute different panels comprising senior members and city-based historians who will assess the loss of the main hall, built with over 99% rare teak wood. Already a CLUES team is at work to ascertain the exact reason for the fire mishap — electric short-circuit or something else.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/replicas-may-make-up-for-trophies-at-club/articleshow/88961367.cms||Sunil Mungara

The three areas have between 1,000-1,500 active cases. Also, Ghatkesar, Mehdipatnam and Miyapur are seeing a spurt in cases, resulting in authorities distributing 50-70 isolation kits daily in these areas.“The spread of the virus is unbelievably fast. While there are other clusters, but currently we are looking at three areas — Amberpet, Ameerpet and Malakpet— with concern as the cases are spreading like wildfire. In Hyderabad district, we are now distributing 500-600 isolation kits daily. The only respite is the majority of the cases are mild and most of them are showing symptoms like mild fever, running nose and headaches,” a health official said.Residents in these areas, meanwhile, suggest that many symptomatic people not taking tests could have resulted in the fast spread too. “In our area, we had many residents who have had cold, cough and mild fever for a day or two, but didn’t go for tests. Now, their families and neighbours are testing positive. It is possible that since they didn’t test and didn’t isolate themselves, it could spread more. We still have many who are not getting tested,” said Ashfaq Ahmed, a resident of Amberpet.With two waves behind them and a previous prescription in hand, some were repeating their old medicines too. “Last time also everyone in our family had mild symptoms. We had tested positive and consulted a doctor. Now, we are taking the same medicines like paracetamol and doxycycline,” said a resident from Mehdipatnam.Cases were spreading rapidly in large families staying in smaller houses. “Several houses do not have proper isolation facilities. Congested areas are seeing more cases. We are seeing families, neighbours and relatives turn up for tests together and several turn positive,” official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-19-clusters-give-jitters-to-health-officials/articleshow/88961375.cms||Amrita Didyala

On Sunday, the state had extended holidays to all educational institutions, except medical colleges till January 30. Though Osmania University and Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, directed colleges to conduct online classes, no such directions have been given by the school education department. The state government has not yet released the schedule of digital classes either, while many private budget schools have not yet made arrangements to conduct online classes. “It looks like there won’t be any digital classes for government school students until January 30 as the education department has not released any schedule. Even teachers are not being asked to come and prepare or monitor digital classes,” said M Ravinder, vice president, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation. The State Institute of Educational Technology (SIET), however, will be recording content for online/digital classes from January 17-27 for classes 6 to 10. When it comes to private budget schools, the Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA) members said that hardly 5% to 10% of schools, which have been conducting classes in the hybrid mode, have resumed online classes from Monday. “The remaining might start online classes from Thursday. Even at my school, we had a meeting and teachers have been asked to get in touch with students and instruct them to download the required app,” said Shekhar Rao, president, TRSMA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/e-classes-for-govt-small-privateschools-now-hang-in-the-balance/articleshow/88961379.cms||---

Among the help most need in isolation is food, and some in city have been providing that at people’s doorstep for free. Helping Spot Organisation, an initiative launched by a couple from Miyapur, has won hearts of many people as they feed the needy amid trying times. Launched in April last year as the second wave raged, the group had served free food to hundreds of people caught at home with neither health nor resources to cook. Now, with the city facing the third wave, the couple is back serving people free food. “We are serving almost 150 families lunch and dinner on a daily basis for the last two weeks. We serve rice, two curries, lentils and curd as part of the meal. I spend Rs 15,000 from my own pocket per day. Majority of them are either senior citizens or students who are in isolation and can’t cook for themselves,” said Bhargav Ventrapragada, founder of organisation. The operation is managed by Bhargav, who works in a corporate event management company, and his wife Uma Maheshwari. The food is delivered with the help of friends. Currently, the group provides food in Miyapur, Ameenpur and Bachupally. “When I was infected, I sought their services for almost 10 days. I had no energy to fend for myself. The food was nutritious,” said Anil Naidu, a techie. A similar initiative by another couple serves free food in Miyapur. NGO Aashri Society is run by Ram Kishore Reddy and his wife Prapurna Reddy. “In last few weeks, we started getting calls again. In one week, we have distributed 40 meals and intend to help as many as we can,” said Ram Kishore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/serving-people-for-free-one-hot-meal-at-a-time/articleshow/88961382.cms||Preeti Biswas

The last three are conducting more than 40% daily tests through the RT-PCR method. Surprisingly, Medchal Malkajgiri and Ranga Reddy have higher rates of RT-PCR testing (46% each) than Hyderabad, which has 44%.Medak, Sangareddy, Kamareddy, Jangaon, and Nirmal are other districts that perform more than 30% RT PCR tests.More than 90% of antigen testing is being done in districts such as Mancherial, Warangal rural, and Bhadradro Kothagudem.Currently, the state has 39 lakh antigen kits on hand and only 2.98 lakh RT-PCR kits. According to officials, the majority of RT-PCR testing takes place in private labs in Hyderabad and surrounding districts. Some smaller districts, such as Mulugu, conduct 100% antigen tests. Following the start of the third wave in the state, daily tests were around 20,000, increasing to more than 80,000 on Monday. The health department has stated on several occasions that it has the capacity to perform more than one lakh tests per day.The state’s current policy, however, is to conduct tests on those who are exhibiting symptoms and have had their first contact with comorbidities. The previous policy of testing on demand has changed. Officials claim that, despite an increase in the number of cases, most people with mild Covid-19-like symptoms are refusing to be tested and instead are isolating themselves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/majority-of-testsin-most-dists-viaantigen-method/articleshow/88961383.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A clutch of PILs are seeking a direction to the Centre to frame model agreements on this field under provisions of Section 41 and 42 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, under which the Real Estate Regulation Authority (RERA) was set up. But, the Centre in its response affidavit had said that it had no role to play in this regard and that under the Act, it was for the states' responsibility to frame the model agreements. Read AlsoBuilder liable to pay damages for occupation certificate delay: SCIn a relief to homebuyers who are forced to take possession of their flats and start living due to delay on part of the builder to get all clearances from the authorities, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that it would amount to deficiency in services on the part of real estate company if it failedA bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant persuaded the Centre not to adopt a hands off approach and get involved in drafting model agreements to protect the unsuspecting middle-class flat buyers who often get fleeced of their hard-earned money because of the builder-framed sale agreements that titl heavily towards the realtors. "Instead of leaving it to the states, the Centre can frame a national model law. Builders often prepare a bulky sale agreement document with clauses that helps them fleece the flat buyers. We are concerned by the plight of the middle-class who get caught in the web of such builder-leaning sale agreements," the bench said. Read AlsoMumbai: Homebuyer fails to get possession, given Rs 2 croreIn a recent order, MahaRERA member Vijay Satbir Singh directed promoters of Shreepati Jewels to refund a sum of Rs 2 crore that a homebuyer had paid, while booking a flat measuring about 1,200 in the developer’s project at Girgaum, along with interest rate, as the promoter had failed to hand overSolicitor general Tushar Mehta agreed to personally look into the issue and respond back in two weeks. The bench said, "the model builder-buyer and agent-buyer agreements must have certain clauses (to protect the middle-class flat buyers from getting fleeced) which must be non-negotiable even if the states wanted to tweak the model agreements in accordance with the prevailing situation in the respective states." When the bench took up PILs filed by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, Tarun Kumar Gera, Jim Thomson and Nagarjuna Reddy for hearing, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said that under section 41 and 42 of the RERA, the Centre has a definite role to play in framing model agreements. The petitioners had complained to the court that under RERA, the states were mandated to frame uniform/model builder-buyer agreements, but most states are yet to complete the exercise even after five years of RERA coming into force. They said the model agreements should incorporate clauses to force the builders to compensate home buyers in case of delay in delivery of possession of flats, ensure protection to buyers from getting overcharged on heads like interest and late payment and penalize the builder if there were any deficiency in quality of construction. Justice Chandrachud recalled a judgment authored by him relating to the West Bengal RERA. The SC had foiled the TMC government's attempt to run a parallel regime on regulating the real estate industry as the SC on May 4 last year quashed West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (WB-HIRA), 2017 as unconstitutional for being either a copy or in conflict with central legislation Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), 2016.

P Indira Reddy, an organic farmer and resident of Amberpet village in Abdullapurmet mandal, and Akiti Nikhil Kumar Reddy of Chinna Ravirala in Abdullapurmet filed a petition with the NGT. The petitioners alleged that illegal mining activity, massive blasting and stone crushing were going on in Banda Ravirala, Chinna Ravirala revenue villages and private patta lands in Deshmukhi village in Abdullapurmet and Bhoodan Pochampally mandal. Indira Reddy alleged that two mining lease holders illegally encroached into patta lands and completely damaged seven acres. “I am running a meditation centre and a Lord Shiva temple was built by my husband in 15 acres of fertile agriculture land at Saddupalli village in Abdullapurmet. There are six stone crushing units, eight mining quarries and 11 hot mix plants in the vicinity,” she alleged. Nikhil Reddy said his agriculture land was surrounded by four stone crusher units and six mining quarries. “Massive mining, stone crushing, ready mix and hot mix plants activities have been going on for the last 15 years. Due to noise, air pollution and vibrations caused by the blasting, locals residing in Banda Ravirala, Chinna Ravirala, Guvvaleti, Taramatipet, Saddupalli and Deshmukhi villages are suffering a lot,” he said. Apart from losing cultivable land due to the illegal mining, the locals were facing serious health issues like throat infections, severe cough and breathing problems, he said. Indira and Nikhil said the pollution generated from mining, stone crushing and tar and RCC mixing units was causing health hazards for the locals. Despite several complaints to the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, district collectors of Rangareddy and Yadadri Bhuvanagiri, mining and revenue departments, no action was taken to stop illegal mining and pollution, alleged the petitioners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/residents-move-ngt-over-stone-and-mining-units/articleshow/88961391.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In 2021-22 financial year alone, 2,029 acres got encroached, taking the total encroachments to 15,742 acres. West Godavari district collector Kartikeya Misra said 554 cases had been registered related to encroachments, mainly for aquaculture in all categories of the land since 2006-07, and the cases are under trial in various courts. In 2006, illegal encroachments, mostly fish tanks, were demolished, and the land within plus five contours was handed over to the forest department. D-form pattas issued earlier was cancelled because of sanctuary notification. However, a few persons resorted to pisciculture in these lands and officers were asked not to allow pisciculture in the wildlife sanctuary. In 2008, an integrated management plan for KWS was prepared by Wetland International South Asia for a period of five years. Currently, the management plan for KWS is being prepared by involving Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Mumbai. An amount of ₹30 crore has been spent in the sanctuary area from 2006-07 to 2020-21 for protection, wildlife habitat improvement, ecotourism and development of bird congregation sites. Around five base camps, a strike force and six checkposts are functioning from various locations in the sanctuary area. Mishra said: “The forest department is taking stringent action against all illegal activities in the sanctuary area. Seasonal encroachments, if any, identified in the sanctuary area for aquaculture have been tackled by registering offence cases, demolishing bunds and conducting village-level awareness programmes. We are making all possible efforts to prevent and remove all kinds of encroachments in the sanctuary area to protect the water body.” Regular census is being conducted to enumerate different bird species and their population. “Research related to tagging of bids was conducted by BNHS. Currently, MS Swaminathan Research Foundation is conducting a study on socio-economic and livelihood assessment of communities living in and around KWS,” an official said. In 2006 after demolitions of illegal structures were carried out, the land measured 33,987 hectares. The AP legislature had unanimously passed a resolution in 2008 to reduce the sanctuary from below plus five to plus three contours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kolleru-shrinks-2k-acres-gobbled-up-this-yr-alone/articleshow/88961392.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases is very high in India, compared to the West. Severe cardiomyopathy leads to heart failure. The findings of the team of scientists led by Dr K Thangaraj was published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology recently.“The beat myosin heavy gene is one of the major genes implicated in cardiac diseases globally. Not many genetic studies were carried out in Indian cardiomyopathy patients. Hence, we sequenced -MYH7 gene of 137 dilated cardiomyopathy patients along with 167 ethnically matched healthy controls to identify the mutation(s), if any, that are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy in Indian patients”, said Dr K Thangaraj, senior author of the study.“Our study revealed 27 variations, of which 7 mutations (8%) were novel and were detected exclusively in Indian dilated cardiomyopathy patients. We for the first time demonstrated how these mutations uniquely disrupt a critical network of non-bonding interactions at the molecular level, and may contribute to the development of disease phenotype”, said Dr Deepa Selvi Rani, the lead author of this study.“This study can help in developing gene editing methods that may rescue cardiac contractility of failing hearts among Indians with the novel mutations”, said Dr Vinay Kumar Nandicoori, director, CCMB.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/gene-mutations-behind-indians-heart-troubles/articleshow/88961393.cms||---

This will be one of the major activities under the state unit’s “Mission 19” programme to capture those seats. A coordination committee will prepare an action plan to make things favourable for Bharatiya Janata Party in these segments to gain support from all communities and not just dalits. However, the committee will not select candidates in these seats, but provide regular reports to state and national leadership. Addressing a meeting of select leaders from these constituencies and state-level leaders, state chief Bandi Sanjay stated that the Scheduled Castes (SCs) community’s support for the Bharatiya Janata Party has grown since state formation and his victory in Karimnagar Lok Sabha polls was the best example as he had received substantial votes from them. He directed the coordination committee to visit the constituencies once a month from now on. Another major programme would be to undertake two months of walkathon in these seats by leaders from April 14, birth anniversary of Ambedkar. The committee will also compile a list of unresolved issues in these segments and by Ugadi plans will be in place to establish party constituency offices in these seats. The campaign will centre on local issues and Telangana Rashtra Samithi government’s promises that are yet to be fulfilled. The Bharatiya Janata Party also intends to boost its chances in ST constituencies. On Tuesday, the party’s ST coordination committee will meet in virtual mode to discuss the future plans. This will be followed by a virtual meeting of state-level leaders on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bjp-firms-up-plans-to-capture-sc-seats-in-next-elections/articleshow/88961394.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Kochi||MKP made environment a public concern||By - Anand ParthasarathyOne morning in 1994, I got a telephone call from Prof M K Prasad. He was somewhat agitated – a rare condition for him. Close to his home at Panampilly Nagar junction in Ernakulam a large rain tree which provided shade for decades, was under threat of being cut down by some ‘developers’, but for local resistance. During his morning walk that day, MKP saw that the tree had been surreptitiously felled during the night. “I plan to lay a wreath on the tree stump. No one cares but I have to do this,” he said. I had a column in an English newspaper in those days and requested MKP to wait till I rushed there with my camera. He laid a wreath with a simple card which read in Malayalam: “Vriksha Snehi”. I got my photo, which I used in next week’s column and MKP’s action was widely appreciated. When he went to the flower shop to order the wreath, the shop owner, told of the purpose, refused to take money from MKP. Once more, he had turned defeat in environmental matters into a kind of victory, and moved people by his actions. For over 70 of his 89 years, Prasad, perhaps more than any other son of Kerala, made the environment meaningful to generations of lay citizens – and in doing so his activities straddled local and global. MKP, who was the head of the environment brigade of the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, was undoubtedly the public face of the popular movement in the 1960s and 1970s that helped save Silent Valley from inundation for a hydel project. His efforts and contacts helped internationalize the issue and bring pressure on the government. “You have to trek across Silent Valley, to understand why it is so important,” he told me during an interview. In a seminar held in Silent Valley in 1995, to mark the first decade of the National Park, MKP was there with many of the stalwarts who helped preserve the Valley, like V S Vijayan, “Snake Man” Romulus Whittaker, danseuse Mrinalini Sarabhai, marine biologist Dr U K Gopalan and M A Parthasarathy of WWF-India. Prasad was the one who motivated many of them. By then MKP was representing India in many global bodies – WWF, IUCN, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the Earth Summit in Rio, etc. Unlike ‘sarkari’ delegates, he truly represented the people of India with his blunt and passionate message.  As the executive director of the Information Kerala Mission (IKM),. he brought humanism and a common touch that was to characterize so many of Kerala’s citizen services.

Telangana Olympic Association (TOA) president K Ranga Rao on Monday urged SATS chairman Allipuram Venkateshwar Reddy to help secure funds. “Associations have raised loans and met the expenditure in conducting state, national and international tournaments...Importantly, the associations have submitted all the relevant infomation along with the statement of expenditure but not a single paise is released so far,” Rao said in his letter to finance minister Harish Rao.Conducting events following Covid-19 SOPs is causing additional burden, Rao said and wondered what happened to the Rs 113 crore allocated to sports this year. “The state government has allocated Rs 113 crores in the 2021-22 budget. SATS has submitted a claim for Rs 14,51,32,000 for which tokens were issued and are pending with the finance department for clearance," Rao added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govt-urged-to-release-funds/articleshow/88961401.cms||---
---||Kolkata||On day 15 of teen vax drive, Bengal nears 50% jab target||KOLKATA: Bengal completed vaccinating almost 50% of the eligible recipients in the 15-18 age group on Monday, even as the number of fresh Covid cases in Kolkata plunged below the 2,000-mark for the first time since December 31 last year, leading some experts to think that the peak of the third wave might be behind us. While the city recorded 1,879 new cases on Monday, Bengal, too, recorded a sharp drop — from 14,938 to 9,385, even though there were 18,000 fewer tests. This was the biggest drop in fresh infections since the figure touched 24,287 on January 9, the highest single-day spike. Bengal’s positivity rate, too, has been declining. It was 29.5% on January 15, it dropped to 27.3% on January 16 and to 26.4% on Monday. The inoculation programme for the 15-18 group started on January 3, with a target to cover 48 lakh in this group with their first shots in a month. On Monday, the 15th day of the rollout, Bengal managed to cover nearly half that target. With 23,65,664 youngsters across the state having got their first shots, it was short of the half-way milestone by only about 34,000. Diptendra Sarkar, a professor of general surgery at IPGMER, found this very encouraging. “This is a fantastic performance and the right movement towards reopening schools,” he told TOI. Experts said Kolkata was over the peak of the third wave, and we were in a phase where cases were plateauing, though some felt a large number of the mildly infected were not getting tested. The overall fall in the daily case increase was due to a mix of both. “This seems to be a combination of a sharp drop in tests and that the number of cases is now on a decline. So, we might see a rise in cases on Tuesday, but the downward trend, which we have seen over the last three-four days, will continue,” Raja Dhar, CMRI’s director of pulmonology said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/on-day-15-of-teen-vax-drive-bengal-nears-50-jab-target/articleshow/88961364.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||BJP’s Tathagata urges PM to allow Bengal’s tableau||Kolkata: Former Meghalaya governor and former Bengal BJP president Tathagata Roy has urged the Centre to reconsider its decision of not allowing a tableau from West Bengal at the Republic Day festivities. In a tweet tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, Roy said: “My appeal to the Prime Minister: please allow the West Bengal tableau in the Republic Day festivities. It features the exploits of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose whose organization of the INA shook the faith of the British in their army and hastened their exit.”Roy’s tweet found traction among Trinamool Congress leaders, who were quick to comment on it. Rajya Saha MP Santanu Sen said in a reply: “He has been vocal against the deprivation of Bengal today. I wish him good health.”Roy took to his Twitter handle to post a reply: “My appeal to the Prime Minister was to bring to the fore the contribution of Netaji and other freedom fighters. I am not supporting any complaint like the Centre’s deprivation of the state.” The former governor took care that his tweet was not misread as defiance of the Centre. “The Centre had started, for the first time, celebration of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary as Parakram Diwas. Republic Day celebrations will now begin every year from January 23 instead of 24. So let no state government claim credit for remembering Netaji!” Roy said in an earlier tweet.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that the state government had planned to send a tableau commemorating the contribution of Netaji and his Indian National Army. Netaji’s grandnephew Chandra Bose, who had earlier written to the PM seeking accommodation of the Netaji-themed tableau, said he had a word with defence minister Rajnath Singh’s office and they confirmed a Netaji-themed tableau. “They said there will be a Netaji-themed tableau. However, such things should not happen on issues related to Netaji and there should be a joint effort by the Centre and the state on Netaji-related issues,” Bose said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjps-tathagata-urges-pm-to-allow-bengals-tableau/articleshow/88961403.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP dissent out in the open, leaders slam ‘poster culture’||KOLKATA: Posters and cutouts calling Bengal BJP (organization) secretary Amitava Chakraborty bibhishan (enemy within) and election strategist Prashant Kishor’s agent appeared on Monday at several places in central and north Kolkata like Shyambazar, Jorasanko and Esplanade and also near the BJP state headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane on Central Avenue. This comes two days after junior Union minister Shantanu Thakur threw a challe- nge to Chakraborty following a meet with rebel leaders. Monday’s posters carried the print line ‘BJP Bachao Karmi Brinda’, a faceless platform to record dissent. On Saturday, Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya had criticized posters against Chakraborty pasted on railway compartments in Bongaon-bound trains. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh slammed the new “poster culture” in BJP. “Those who have joined BJP recently are not aware of the party’s culture. They are trying to create ripples by putting up posters. We saw such a trend immediately after the assembly polls (posters appeared condemning Kailash Vijayvargiya). It has surfaced again. There have been some changes in the party and some outsiders are trying to take advantage of that. But such efforts cannot harm the BJP,” Ghosh said. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar, too, distanced the party from such acts. “Those who are aware of the party’s discipline will not commit such acts. I don’t believe that anyone in BJP could have done that. We are not giving any importance to the incident,” Majumdar said. However, the dissent showed no signs of a let-up when former party state office-bearers Sayantan Basu, Jayprakash Majumdar, Ritesh Tiwari and MLAs from the Matua belt, namely Bongaon Uttar MLA Ashok Kirtania, Gaighata MLA Subrata Thakur and Krishnaganj MLA Ashis Biswas, held talks for the second time in Bongaon following a picnic of Matua Mahasangha supporters on Sunday. The Matua Mahasangha is planning an all-India stir demanding implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that the Matuas have been urging for long. Thakur combined the im-plementation of CAA with the recent shuffle in the BJP to attract a greater audience beyond the Matuas. “A large section of BJP workers was left out when the state level committees were prepared. This forced me to speak out and I felt like bringing the issue to the notice of the higher leadership,” Thakur said. According to Matua Mahasangha estimates, there are nearly 60%-70% Matuas in Bongaon and Ranaghat and nearly 25 lakh members of the organization across the country. Thakur, who is also the Matua sanghadhipati, pointed out that there was no Matua representation in the BJP state committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-dissent-out-in-the-open-leaders-slam-poster-culture/articleshow/88961404.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Posters against Kalyan, TMC blames rivals for mischief||Kolkata: Several posters appeared overnight in Rishra against senior Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee, prompting the party’s district leadership to blame it on “rivals” trying to flog a dead issue.In a related development, TMC leader Madan Mitra also signalled a change from his comments against party leaders, saying he had no differences with anyone and will remain a dedicated party worker after he was cautioned by the party disciplinary committee.The posters against Banerjee in his Srirampore Lok Sabha constituency appeared to be an attempt to rake up the controversy pitting the MP and senior lawyer against a section of his pa-rty leaders, including Aparoopa Poddar, Kunal Ghosh and Mitra, said sources.Kalyan has not spoken on the issue after senior party leaders spoke to him and allayed his misgivings. The party had also cautioned others from speaking against leaders and workers. Trinamool’s Hooghly district president Snehasis Chakraborty said on the posters against Kalyan at Rishra, “This is an act of mischief by the rivals.”Mitra was on Monday asked by the party to refrain from speaking in public on party affairs. He said, “Partha Chatterjee called me. Who will call me if he does-n’t? He is the one who broug-ht me to TMC. He was in tears in court when I got bail. It was never my intent to hurt anyone by my statements.”Party sources said Mitra was cautioned by the party against his social media statements against the party, and its leaders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/posters-against-kalyan-tmc-blames-rivals-for-mischief/articleshow/88961405.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Diamond Harbour Covid tests show 2.8% positivity||Kolkata: The mass vaccination drive in Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency in the wake of Gangasagar Mela has indicated a positivity rate of below 3%, which remains a fraction of Bengal’s overall 26.4% positivity rate.According to a report by the South 24 Parganas district administration, in the 6,706 tests conducted, 189 people were found positive. The positivity rate is around 2.8%. A part of these tests was conducted by the mobile test labs introduced in the constituency that carried out 2,529 tests on community samples and symptomatic persons. It indicated a positivity rate of 0.3%.Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee took to Facebook to post: “Diamond Harbour parliamentary constituency does it again. Despite its proximity to Gangasagar and Kolkata, Diamond Harbour PC maintains a positivity rate below 3%. I wholeheartedly thank the people of Diamond Harbour for their support and cooperation in this fight.” Banerjee’s statement comes in the backdrop of several Diamond Harbour-specific measures he announced on January 8 that included banning all mass political and religious gatherings till February 28 and a double-mask protocol in markets. On January 12, over 50,000 Covid tests were conducted in the constituency that indicated a positivity rate of 2.1%. Gangasagar Mela concluded on January 15, drawing an estimated 5.8 lakh people who converged for the holy dip on Makar Sankranti. The pilgrims had to pass through three buffer zones and underwent screening. A large part of this route went through Diamond Harbour after pilgrims embarked in Kolkata. The huge gathering on Sagar Islands had remained a concern. The test result on Sunday is the first clear indication of any possible case spurt in the wake of the Mela. Experts, however, advise that the checks be maintained over this week to gauge whether Covid-19 has spread among locals.According to data shared by the district administration, 202 Covid-positive cases were reported in the Diamond Harbour police district in the last 24 hours. There are 1,721 active Covid cases in the district at present. Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency has a first-dose vaccine coverage of 106.3% and second-dose vaccination coverage of 88.7%. Around 61% of eligible teens in the 15-18 age group has also been vaccinated. Around 45 people have been shifted to safe homes in this period.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/diamond-harbour-covid-tests-show-2-8-positivity/articleshow/88961406.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Glimmer of hope for tourism: Travel buffs plan summer trips||Kolkata: Though the tourism industry and travel agents are passing through harrowing times after many people cancelled their tours following a spike in Covid cases, a section of people started planning trips for summer holidays. Some of them are also preparing for international tours as they are updating their passports and applying for visas. Travel agents in Bengal said that they had a pre-pandemic like domestic travel season between October and December as people had started gaining confidence. But the third wave put brakes on the progress again. “While tourist places across India were packed in December, by January people started cancelling their pre-booked holidays. The situation is still bad. But there is a glimmer of hope as we are getting some positive queries for the month of March onwards. Many people have understood that those infected are getting cured within a week and they are hoping that the rate of infection will go down further by the end of February,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. Meanwhile, multiple travel agents’ bodies in Bengal are appealing to the state government to issue clarity in their restrictions’ order and allow tourism to sustain with the necessary cap on number of tourists at specific places. “The state government order on January 2 simply states all entertainment parks, zoos and tourist places shall remain closed. But there is no clarity on the kind of tourist places, which has put our entire industry in a dilemma. Should the hotels and resorts be closed? Should entry at popular tourist hubs and hill stations be suspended? No one has any clarity. We urge the state government to clarify the issue and allow tourism to sustain,” said Amitava Sarkar, general secretary of Travel Agents’ Association of Bengal on Monday.  Association of Tourism Service Providers of Bengal also wrote to the chief minister Mamata Banerjee, pleading to offer a leeway in allowing operation of tourism and hospitality industry with 50% occupancy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/glimmer-of-hope-for-tourism-travel-buffs-plan-summer-trips/articleshow/88961414.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Eased wedding norms bring smiles back on couples’ faces||KOLKATA: State government’s decision to ease restrictions at wedding events — which can be attended by 200 people — has brought relief to not only the couples, scheduled to tie the knot, but also to several industrial sectors that are linked with various aspects of marriages. Several couples were either about to postpone their weddings or were planning to go for registry marriage and defer celebrations. Now they have decided to go ahead with their wedding plans in keeping with the new government guidelines. “We were planning to postpone the wedding and talk to the caterers and the owners of the venue for celebration. Now we will have to truncate the guests’ list but we have decided to go ahead with the ceremonies,” said Neha Som, a resident of Tollygunge, who will tie the knot on January 30. Salt Lake resident Chirashree Ghosh, whose daughter will get married on February 5, also heaved a sigh of relief. The family had booked the Swabhumi banquet venue nearKadapara on February 4 and 5 but their plans went haywire after the third wave of the pandemic struck the city. “My daughter works in Mumbai and the groom’s family is also settled there. They had booked flight tickets and applied for leaves. We had even thought of postponing the reception. It is a big relief for us that the restrictions have been eased,” Ghosh said. Several catering companies are also happy with the decision of the government. Rudra Prasad Saha, owner of Weddingbell Caterer, said, “Since the restrictions were imposed earlier this month, my team comprising 150 people were distressed. They were afraid of financial problems. The relaxation is a good news for us.” Saptarshi Mukherjee, owner of Mahabhoj Caterer, said, “We had a difficult time due to the restrictions. It is extremely difficult to whittle down the invitees of an event like wedding to only 50.” Several wedding photographers too were on the verge of losing out on work. “I have five bookings over the next two weeks. Earlier, the clients wanted to cancel the shoots. After the restrictions were eased, they are going ahead with the weddings and the shoot,” said Arindam Dhali, a wedding photographer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/eased-wedding-norms-bring-smiles-back-on-couples-faces/articleshow/88961415.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Dhakuria mystery: Family glued to TV set, robbed of Rs 3 lakh, gold||KOLKATA: A group of robbers on Sunday evening entered a three-storey house from the terrace, broke open a locked almirah on the first floor and looted Rs 3 lakh and gold while the family was watching television on the ground floor. Around Rs 1 lakh, all notes soaked, was mysteriously found in an alley right behind the house on Monday evening. According to complainant Gopal Halder, he and his wife were not at home when the crime took place. Other family members — the couple’s son, Halder’s mother and his niece — were busy watching television on the ground floor. The wet notes that were recovered after 24 hours “The theft took place between 6pm and 8pm. The thieves most likely had entered from the terrace and went down to the first floor. They broke open the almirah on the first floor, looted the cash and jewellery and fled from the house. My son came upstairs around 8pm and found the room, and especially the almirah, ransacked,” claimed Halder. “We suspect that someone in our neighbourhood who has a fair idea of our house is involved. They even dumped the money for the fear of getting caught. However, the news of the theft has not yet been accepted by my wife who is ill. I hope that the jewellery is recovered,” said Halder. Cops at the crime sceneThe cops said they were keeping all options open in their investigation. Even as police are questioning local criminals, they are not ruling out the insider angle. Sources said a drug abuse history in the neighbourhood, along with the fact that this money was part of a loan raised recently, are also being looked into. “We will ask the victim’s son to record his statement with us. There are still a few loose ends in his statement. The family claimed they had recovered the Rs 1 lakh from a road which is extremely narrow and no one except a local will think of entering it. The money recovered was all wet despite it being kept in a bag. We came to know of the recovery by the family much after they had removed the bag from the spot. We are sending the bag to forensics for fingerprints. All these are part of the probe,” said an investigating officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dhakuria-mystery-family-glued-to-tv-set-robbed-of-3l-gold/articleshow/88961418.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 7 of man’s best friends die in morning Sinthee fire||KOLKATA: A fire that broke out at a hutment at Sinthee’s Ramlila Bagan early on Monday morning might have spared the area of extensive damage, limiting its fury to a single house, but it left a two year-old dog mother — whose first litter consisted of seven puppies — childless. As the mother — fondly named Pappi by neighbours — kept running around in the ruins where he had last left the puppies, hardly a human around could control their emotions. Priya with her pet PappiFor five hours — long after four fire brigades left the spot and the initial panic slowly died down — neighbours joined Pappi in search of her puppies. Local policemen joined in too. In their official communication to headquarters, cops informed their seniors that “no human lives were lost, but there was growing despair that other lives have been lost”. Around 2.30pm, the locals finally dug out the charred body of one puppy. As soon as Pappi saw her two-day old newborn, she recoiled, rushed towards the burnt portion of the hutment and refused to budge from the spot. When TOI finally left the spot, Pappi was being consoled by her owner Priya Nayak (10), a Class IV student. Both of them huddled at the very spot where Pappi had given birth barely two days ago. According to locals, Ashoke Kumar Chandra (49) was sleeping at his residence along with his wife Dipali (37) and their two children — one studying in Class IX and another in Class I — when the fire broke out. The reason for the fire is still being ascertained. “The fire broke out probably around 4.15am. We realized that the hutment was on fire a little later. As we raised an alarm, locals rushed in. They arranged for buckets and poured water. It was their effort that ensured that the fire got arrested around our residence. The fire brigade was informed but they kept mistaking the road. They arrived at 5.20am. By 5.40am, the fire was controlled. We are worried now since we have lost everything. My children’s books are all damaged, so are our important documents. I am literally pushed to the brink,” said Ashoke. Police said Pappi had chosen to warm her litter right next to the boundary wall of the Chandras’. “Though a pet of Chandra’s neighbour, she had chosen this spot as it was a more warm and secluded,” said an officer. The fire brigade denied being late stating they received the call only at 5.10am. “On Monday, at 5.10am, we received information that a fire had broken out in a tile shaded house at 58/1B, BT Road (Sinthee PS area). It was extinguished at 5.50am with the help of four fire tenders. There was no report of any human injury. The situation remained peaceful,” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/7-of-mans-best-friends-die-in-morning-sinthee-fire/articleshow/88961419.cms||Amit Moulick
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 14-day closure of Bagdogra airport for runway repairs||KOLKATA: The state government and Airports Authority of India (AAI) have started a joint survey of land at Bagdogra before the handover to the latter around March-April. This will pave the way for the construction of the much-awaited modern terminal building to start thereafter. The airport is also going in for another major infrastructure upgrade with the Indian Air Force taking up the recarpeting work of the runway after 25 years. While this will mean a fortnight-long complete shutdown of the airport in April, it will ensure that the runway is again good to go for another 25 years after the work is done. “After years of anticipation, we are nearing the execution stage of major development of Bagdogra airport. On Thursday, a joint survey began on two land parcels — one measuring 94.1acre tea estate land that the state government has reclaimed and another 1acre that is already vested with the state government. We expect the survey to be completed in two months and its subsequent handover to AAI by April,” said Bagdogra airport director P Subramani. There is an additional 3.5acre private land that the state government has to acquire and hand over subsequently to complete the 104.6acre, for which AAI has already paid the state government. AAI has earmarked Rs 600 crore to construct the 1 lakh sq m terminal and allied facilities. The terminal will have a capacity to handle 1.2crore passengers per annum. The current terminal is spread over 8,000 sq m and has a capacity to handle 7.5 lakh passengers per annum, although it handled over 30 lakh passengers in 2019 prior to the pandemic. The daily flight count had also shot up from 10-11 to 37 in 2019. “Once the pandemic is over, airlines will again push for more flights. We have been constrained by the crunch in terminal space. If all goes well, the tenders will be floated and finalized this year and new terminal construction should be complete in 24 months. Thereafter, the flight count will soar,” he said. In the meantime, IAF that maintains the runway and provides ATC service will take up runway repair work from April 11 to 25, necessitating the shutdown of operations. “This is a busy time for tourism but the runway work is required to be completed before it rains. It is better to complete the work now when daily passenger count is hovering around the 4,000-mark, unlike 9,000-10,000 in other times,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/14-day-closure-of-bagdogra-airport-for-runway-repairs/articleshow/88961420.cms||Subhro Niyogi

So do his jugalbandis with Pt Ajoy Chakraborty and Vidushi Girija Devi. There is also footage of him singing Manna Dey’s ‘Jodi kagoje lekho naam’ at a city concert. His Bengali pronunciation was impeccable. The maestro played the harmonium too. His fondness for Manna Dey was evident from his rendition. Seated next was his disciple, Vidushi Saswati Sen, who diligently held a notebook of the Bengali lyrics. Many such memories have been doing the rounds of Kolkata’s music corridors ever since the news of the legend’s demise broke out. Pt Kumar Bose, who has accompanied him at countless concerts in India and abroad since 1980, remembered a Kolkata concert in the mid-90s that was organized by Rajan-Sajan Mishra’s Swar Ganga group. In the front row were 51 eminent musicians, who were being felicitated. The atmosphere was charged up and there was magic on stage. “The programme was organized by Rajan-Sajan Mishra. That was an important incentive. Presence of many eminent musicians in the front row was inspiring too,” he said. Clearly, that concert stands out as one of Bose’s memorable Kolkata programmes with the maestro. Describing their chemistry, Bose said, “He loved my playing style and was fond of my guru, Pt Kishan Maharaj. Knowing dance steps alone didn’t make him a legend. He was a complete musician, singing, composing, choreographing, playing tabla and writing poetry.” A still from Chidananda Dasgupta's 'Birju Maharaj'. Courtesy: National Film Archive of India (NFAI)Many also remember Chidananda Dasgupta directing a black-and-white Films Division documentary on him in 1972 that has priceless footage of the maestro as a guru and in performance. That apart, it has him recalling his growing years when he would dance at the Nawab of Rampur’s court. A rare footage has him showing a cannonball that was hurled by the British in 1857 at his ancestral residence which was gifted to the family by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. The rare footage of him narrating the story of the cannonball from the documentaryThankfully, NFAI has scanned the Original Camera Negative (OCN) of the film in 2K resolution to get the highest quality results. “We also carried out some basic level grading for its exclusive screening on November 20 in Kolkata by the Chidananda Dasgupta Memorial Trust. We will soon take up the restoration work,” said NFAI’s director Prakash Magdum. Another still of the maestro in performance from the documentary titled 'Birju Maharaj'One of the stories doing the rounds is of how Satyajit Ray had invited him to sing ‘Kanha main tose haari’ for his ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’ in 1977. A young Saswati Sen had danced to this Bhairavi composition that was sung by him. “My father was fond of both his dance and singing style. We had met in Hyderabad. Birju Maharaj had come down to Kolkata with his troupe and had recorded the song at a studio in Dumdum. It was picturized on an actor from his troupe,” said director Sandip Ray. Ray’s focus-puller Anil Ghosh, who had met the maestro during the song’s shooting at the Indrapuri Studio, said, “Manik-da (Ray) wanted an offbeat voice. Having Birju Maharaj on the sets helped since kathak had achieved greater heights under Nawab Wajid Ali Shah – the character played by Amjad Khan in the film.” If seniors including Pt Anindo Chatterjee, Pt Samar Saha and Pt Subhen Chatterjee have fond memories of accompanying the maestro in Kolkata, youngsters have had a brush with him too. When young sarod player Indrayudh Majumder wrote, composed, and produced a song for peace named ‘Om Shanti’ during the first lockdown, he “blessed” the project with his world-famous “Bhaav”. “We had 24 most prominent faces of Indian classical music and dance across India recording and shooting from their homes for this project. Pandit Birju Maharaj-ji was not in the best of his health during that time. So, he sat on a chair in his bedroom and blessed us with his world-famous 'Bhaav' (expressions in dance) for the lines, Om Shanti. He appeared on our music video too for just a few seconds. That made the entire project immortal in our hearts,” Majumder said. When Pt Subhankar Banerjee was critical, he would regularly call up to know about the progress of the tabla player who had accompanied him on numerous occasions.  Last November, Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar had met him at Saswati’s Delhi residence. “He had learnt the sarod and had wanted me to play,” he said. But that finally didn’t happen since both were engrossed in an adda. With Pt Bickram Ghosh, he had engaged in a percussion duet on stage. “I had gone to play a tabla solo on his birthday in Delhi. He was so excited hearing my solo that he asked his students to bring his naal on stage. It was an exhilarating experience that I’ll cherish lifelong,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/music-maestros-recall-kolkatas-jugalbandis-with-birju-maharaj/articleshow/88961421.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||After ichchhapatra, only 10 join Saoli on her last journey||KOLKATA: In 1972, the doyen of Indian theatre, Sombhu Mitra, wrote his ‘wish-letter’ on a stamp paper. No keeping his body at Rabindra Sadan. No gun salute. A quiet exit, away from the public eye. Years later, on a day when he was critically ill, he had told daughter Saoli: ‘If I pass away at night and you can finish off everything by early morning, it will be good fun.” The thespian breathed his last on May 19, 1997. He did pass away at night and was cremated at Siriti crematorium after midnight without the outside world getting a whiff of the news. It was not surprising Saoli, too, drafted a last wish-letter. “She told me she didn’t want any fanfare after her demise. She signed the draft at home on October 29, 2020. Her fear was I would be in trouble if I did what she wanted without having a legal document,” said theatre personality Arpita Ghosh, who was like her daughter.  In his last days, when Sombhu Mitra’s movements were restricted to bed, he stopped having food. “If he did, he would need to depend on others to take care of his other biological processes. He didn’t want it. Saoli’s wish on stamp paperThis, I understood two-three years after his death,” Saoli had recalled in an interview to TOI in 2015. Sombhu Mitra had ensured abstinence of any fanfare with his body. “He saw what had happened during Debabrata Biswas’s and even Ma’s (Tripti Mitra) death. He was firm no attempt be made to deliberately keep him alive,” Saoli had said. Biswas died in 1980, Tripti Mitra in 1989. Tripti Mitra’s mortal remains were kept at Rabindra Sadan before being taken away to Keoratala. Sombhu Mitra wanted a simple hearse. “An electric crematorium was his choice. No ‘mukhagni’ or shraddha. Changing his clothes before cremation wasn’t required. He wanted to die with dignity,” Saoli had said in the interview. Saoli didn’t want hospitalization either. In a humorous way, she mentioned no ‘asurik’ attempts be made to keep her alive. “Everything seemed to play out just the way it had in 1997. Despite coaxing her, she, too, had literally stopped eating. On Sunday, she only had tea and biscuits,” Ghosh said. Ten people accompanied Saoli on her last journey from her Senhati home to Siriti, including Arpita, Debesh Chattopadhyay and a few members of her Pancham Vaidic. “Debkamal Mondal, Sheila Mondal and son Bihan, Anirban Roychowdhury and Arpita’s assistant were present. Sayak started visiting Saolidi’s house some years ago to provide essential medical services. It became a mother-son bond,” said Debesh. She, too, did not have ‘mukhagni’ or shradhha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-ichchhapatra-only-10-join-saoli-on-her-last-journey/articleshow/88961422.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Spot fines return, over 800 charged on Day 1||KOLKATA: Over 800 prosecutions were reported on Sunday, the first day that Kolkata traffic police reintroduced spot fines. Out of a total of 1,046 prosecutions reported, over 80% were spot fines, stated police sources. The rest were citation cases. Though the numbers were half of the average prosecutions witnessed on city roads in the months of November and December, the top brass stated that the numbers were proof of the need for spot fines. It was evident that there is still some dilemma in the mind of sergeants as far as prosecuting motorists and forwarding them to local police stations was concerned. Significantly, not a single vehicle was seized. “Most of the prosecutions dealt with traditional offences committed by two-wheeler riders like not wearing a helmet, triple-riding and speeding,” pointed out a police source. In the absence of breathalyzer tests, there were just four drink-driving cases when compared to the average 20-25 cases per night. Dangerous driving cases were limited to 25. A quick analysis of the Sunday data by Lalbazar has led the top brass to ask all traffic guards to pick up daily prosecution further in the next 48 hours. The traffic unit on Monday took stock of all traffic cops who have received the booster dose, asking each of the 25 guards to prepare their reports. “While it will take a couple of days to go back to old routine, the fact remains that number of vehicles on Kolkata roads have gone down this month due to the Covid surge. We still have as many as 52 sergeants who were infected and a few of them are yet to join work. We expect a rise in prosecutions from Monday,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Police sources said that for now, the maximum focus will be on dangerous driving. “We have found that the prosecutions under MV 184 and MV 185 are most effective in tracking major traffic violations. Following Supreme Court guidelines, we will concentrate on the same,” said an officer. The commissioner of police Vineet Goyal held a video conference on Saturday with the senior officers and asked all traffic guards to restart spot fines along with citation cases. Joint CP (Traffic) Santosh Pandey then held video conferences with all OCs and ACPs asking them to begin checks but without compromising their security.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/spot-fines-return-over-800-charged-on-day-1/articleshow/88961423.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He was 76. According to his family members, the musician passed away in his sleep. He was battling complications following a brain stroke that he had suffered in September last year. Pt Pal was associated with Ravi Shankar Institute of Performing Arts in Delhi and was loved and respected as a fine teacher and mentor to hundreds of classical music students around the world. He was one of the pioneers of Maihar Gharana and travelled across the world to perform until the pandemic halted live concerts. “Lack of mobility due to pandemic took away the joy from a man who celebrated music all his life,” said a family member. Describing him as “one of the biggest unsung heroes in the country”, percussionist Pt Subhen Chatterjee said, “His contribution to Indian classical music with the Hansa Veena, his very own instrument, should have been celebrated. Barun da deserved more appreciations. He was a brilliant musician, a fantastic human being and a very knowledgeable person,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hansa-veena-exponent-pt-barun-kr-pal-dead/articleshow/88961424.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Delta puzzle in Omicron jigsaw: Fewer cases but more deaths||KOLKATA: Even as most Covid cases remain mild and recovery has been quick, there has been, over the last one week, a significant spurt in the number of severe cases that required ventilation and have even led to deaths across private hospitals. Doctors say these are the sporadic Delta cases that are extremely virulent unlike the rest with symptoms like high fever followed by a drop in oxygen saturation triggered by pneumonia. Around 10%-15% of Covid cases remain severe and these patients are filling up the Covid ICUs, say hospitals. At CMRI Hospital, there has been a spike in severe cases over the last 4-5 days, which, doctors, say was not seen so far during the third wave. A 49-year-old patient was put on ventilation on Sunday with symptoms that were common during the second wave when Delta was the dominant strain. A 60-year-old, too, has been on ventilation with similar symptoms. “I am not sure if this is a trend yet, but the number of severe cases has been climbing. These patents have typical Delta symptoms that include oxygen saturation drop and pneumonia. This is in sharp contrast to the rest which are mostly mild or moderate with few needing oxygen support,” said CMRI pulmonology director Raja Dhar. Referring to the 49-year-old patient, Dhar said he is so far the youngest to be ventilated at the hospital during the current wave. Sudden worsening of condition on the fourth or fifth day of contracting the virus has been frequent over the last one week, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “This indicates Delta and typically, these patients are suffering a drop in oxygen saturation after a few days. Many are getting pneumonia and their number is rising as the total number of Covid patients rise. So, we can conclude that a significant percentage of the cases are still triggered by Delta,” said Panja. All 11 patients admitted at the Peerless Hospital ITU are severe and on oxygen support. The rest 69 admitted at the Covid wards are mild to moderate, said CEO Sudipta Mitra. Since January 1, 10 such patients have died at Peerless. More than half of the patients in the critical care of RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) are the ones who arrived in the hospital with comorbidities like cardiac, neuro or renal ailments and turned out positive on routine Covid testing, said zonal head R Venkatesh. “Rest of the patients, which are few, have got admitted in critical condition in Covid ICU due to Covid . Their numbers have not gone up. In fact, our total Covid occupancy has dipped from 100 last week to 86 on Monday with not more than 7% of on ventilator support,” added Venkatesh. RTIICS has seen seven Covid deaths so far this month. There has been a rise in critical Covid patients at AMRI Hospitals that now have 130 ICU beds across its three units. It has also added step-down unit beds for moderately ill Covid positives. Twenty-two have died at AMRI since January 1.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/delta-puzzle-in-omicron-jigsaw-fewer-cases-but-more-deaths/articleshow/88961425.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Elective procedures make a cautious start: 7 Cov ICU patients get pacemakers at IPGMER||KOLKATA: The Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) on Friday carried out pacemaker implants on seven Covid patients who were admitted for the procedure but had tested positive without symptoms. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in Covid treatment in Kolkata, paving the way for surgeries and procedures on Covid patients who would so far be asked to wait till they turned negative. IPGMER experts felt that Covid infection in them was ‘incidental’ and not a major illness. Health experts hope SSKM will show the way for other hospitals at a time when majority of patients in Covid ICUs across hospitals are battling with their pre-existing ailments along with Covid-19 infection. Doctors had been pointing out that the patient profile in Covid ICUs during this wave has changed and that majority of them did not come to hospital for Covid treatment. TOI had reported how these elderly patients were found to be harbouring the virus on tests conducted prior to admission for either surgical procedure or medical management. They are being routinely moved to the Covid ICUs. The seven IPGMER patients had come to the hospital with problems of heart blockage and syncope (fainting) last week. They were immediately put on temporary pacemaker and shifted to the Covid ICU at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital after they were found positive. When the case of these seven patients was brought to the notice of IPGMER administration, it decided to send its cardiology team to SNPH. They all had the pacemaker implanted on Friday. “The procedures were conducted maintaining all protocols by a team of doctors from the cardiology department. The hospital authority and the state government was kind enough to make all necessary arrangements,” said cardiologist Saroj Mondal. Post surgery the patients aged between 64 and 80 years are now recuperating and are being looked after by both the Covid team and the cardiology team. “This kind of multidisciplinary care has become all the more essential given the fact that the Covid ICUs, during this wave, have a different patient profile where majority of patients are elderly with other pre-existing ailments,” said associate professor of infectious diseases Yogiraj Ray. “They need the treatment for these conditions along with Covid treatment. I am thankful to the IPGMER director for such a proactive decision,” said gastroenterology professor Gopal Krishna Dhali, the nodal person for the expert committee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/elective-procedures-make-a-cautious-start-7-cov-icu-patients-get-pacemakers-at-ipgmer/articleshow/88961426.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Book fair may be held from February 28 to March 13||KOLKATA: The state has given clearance for inauguration of the International Kolkata Book Fair on February 28 and the fair is likely to continue till March 13 if the pandemic situation does not deteriorate. Earlier scheduled from January 31, the book fair was deferred by a month due to the civic polls. As the state election commissioner pushed back the polls for four municipal corporations — Bidhannagar, Chandernagore, Asansol and Siliguri — by three weeks to February 12 instead of January 22, the book fair at Salt Lake’s Central Park was also deferred for technical reasons. An official said as polls of 107 municipalities are due on February 27, the state government, keeping in mind the police requirement for the elections, has given the nod for holding the fair after the polls of February 27. Moreover, he said that with the civic polls being over, there will be no model code of conduct and the chief minister can then inaugurate the book fair. Some of her books are also likely to be launched at the fair like in previous years, sources said. The book fair, which was earlier held on the Maidan grounds and later shifted to the Milan Mela ground, was subsequently moved to Central Park in 2018. The organizers had invited Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to inaugurate the fair this time. But the Covid surge upset the plans because many booksellers were in two minds about participating during the pandemic. “We cannot hold the fair till the polls are over. Civic polls are scheduled on February 12 and the administration will clamp Section 144 in the area. The prohibition measure will restrict book lovers from paying a visit to the fair. We, therefore, have no other option but to defer the fair,” said Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary, Publishers and Booksellers Guild. Chatterjee said the guild had invited the Bangladesh PM, but now it seemed that Hasina will inaugurate the fair online. Sudhangshu Dey, another organizer of the Kolkata book fair, said they had held talks with the state over the date after the government gave a go-ahead to organising the fair. Earlier, several Covid measures were announced, including mandatory double-vaccination, for visitors to the book fair this time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/book-fair-may-be-held-from-feb-28-to-mar-13/articleshow/88961427.cms||Debashis Konar

This will enable the traffic police unit, especially sergeants, to join naka checks and carry out spot fines. This safety protection is necessary, felt Lalbazar, after 146 personnel, 52 of them sergeants, were infected with Covid in the past three weeks. All traffic guard OCs are ensuring their personnel get vaccinated at the earliest. At Howrah Bridge traffic guard, 14 of the 19 personnel have been jabbed. The remaining are either on leave due to illness (including Covid) or are recovering from Covid. At East guard, of the 20 officers, nine have got the jab. At least 35-40 junior personnel at both guards too have been vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cop-booster-vaccination-picks-pace/articleshow/88961428.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Doctors said including children of more age groups under the vaccination umbrella will help the fight against the pandemic. The drive is likely to be rolled out by February-end or March-beginning. The ongoing drive for ages 15-17 was launched on January 3. “We will aim to cover those between the ages of 15 and 17 in the state with both doses by the time the next drive is rolled out,” said a health department source. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin that is being used vaccination for the kids now has been found safe and well tolerated during clinical trials in children between 2 and 18. Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV D vaccine, too, has been approved for children of 12 and above. “This was long awaited. Infection among children during the third wave is much higher. They need the vaccine protection so they can go back to school,” said Sanjukta De, paediatrician at Peerless Hospital. Doctors said not going to school has damaged kids’ psychological development and social skills. “We should also be concerned about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that can develop in infected kids three-six weeks after infection. Studies suggest chances of the virus mutating is higher when they infect unvaccinated individuals. The vaccine protection to children is the need of the hour,” said Institute of Child Health consultant paediatrician Agnimita Giri Sarkar. Schools, too, are looking forward to the drive. “We had a good response during our recent vaccination camp for the older children. So we expect students from classes VI to XII will be vaccinated before the new academic session begins,” said Birla High School principal Loveleen Saigal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/parents-schools-welcome-plan-for-12-14-vax-campaign/articleshow/88961429.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

In a bid to bring city’s elderly and ailing population under the vaccination net in the wake of a surge in cases, the KMC health department will reach out to those who will apply for such a jab at home as they can’t move out of their houses. A senior citizen, who is suffering from some kind of serious illness and can’t visit a KMC run vaccination clinic, needs to apply to mayor Firhad Hakim on his WhatsApp number (9830037493). A KMC team will reach the applicant’s place in the evening. The vaccine, however, will be administered in presence of a registered medical practitioner, said Hakim on Monday. The civic body, Hakim said, was putting stress on vaccination of the elderly as well as younger people. Besides keeping its 37 Covaxin clinics open for students aged between 15-18, the KMC health department will open some of its mega centres for them. “The students should be brought under the vaccination drive in the wake of a surge in Covid positive cases. We will appeal to all school students to take the opportunity and get vaccinated either at our clinics or at specially set up camps in the schools,” Hakim said. Hakim also expressed satisfaction over a sharp dip in Covid cases in Kolkata. “Today we have recorded 1,723 cases across the city. But we should continue to follow Covid protocols,” he said. According to sources, the civic body has reduced city’s containment zones from 44 to 33.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmcs-jab-at-home-drive/articleshow/88961434.cms||---

Error-prone Chirag went down 7-5,6-4 in a little under two hours.The top seed, in fact, seemed a bundle of nerves from the very beginning, dropping the first game with two double faults. He could never really come back from there, even though he did manage to claw back with a break. The Korean, however, broke back immediately to pocket the first set. The second was worse for Chirag, serving down four double faults and going down rather tamely.Few matches were held in the girls’ event on the opening with matches going as per the rankings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/top-seed-stunned-in-itf-meet/articleshow/88961437.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Case for mask+vax: Top 10 vaxxed districts have 78% active cases in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Ten districts of Madhya Pradesh that have the highest number of fully vaccinated individuals are also home to more than 78% of active Covid-19 patients. What explains this apparent contrast? Health experts say these two sides tell the same story —there is no alternative to Covid-appropriate behavior. On January 16, there were 30,109 active Covid patients in the state and a whopping 23,562 of these were in 10 districts — Indore, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Rewa, Chhindwara, Sagar, Satna, Gwalior, Ujjain and Dhar. Only four of these districts — Rewa (243), Chhindwara (141), Satna (166) and Dhar (289) had less than 1,000 active cases. Indore has 29.15 lakh fully vaccinated persons, Jabalpur has 20.03 and Bhopal has 19.33 lakh fully vaccinated individuals. These three districts account for over 55% of the active cases. Of the 5.07 crore fully vaccinated individuals in Madhya Pradesh (January 16), 1.77 crore were from these 10 districts. Asked to explain the numbers, health officials told TOI that the vaccine is definitely helpful in reducing severity and is the reason why hospitalization is so low during this wave, but vaccines cannot prevent infection if Covid precautions aren’t followed. Only 2.9% of active patients are in hospital, which is far lower than the second wave.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/case-for-maskvax-top-10-vaxxed-districts-have-78-active-cases/articleshow/88961475.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Bhopal||Schools make vax certificates must for online classes, parents resent||BHOPAL: Schools in the state capital after realizing that several school students in the age group of 15-17 have not come forward for the vaccination have made vaccinations mandatory even for the online classes. Notices have been send by several schools to parents and students in this regard. While the intention of the schools is good to get maximum children in the eligible age group vaccinated, parents however are vocal saying vaccinations should not hamper studies. A senior official of the school education department told TOI that several students in private schools have avoided taking the vaccination. “Despite our several requests, students in several private schools are not coming forward for vaccination. In such a situation, schools have been instructed to issue notices that they will be barred from attending online classes,” said the official without quoting his name. The department has identified around 10,000 such students including the drop-outs who have refused to take the vaccination. There are around 1.13 lakh students in Bhopal eligible for the vaccination. “Majority of the students have been vaccinated. Whosoever is left will be vaccinated soon,” said DEO Bhopal, Nitin Saxena.  Schools said that they have also made several reminders to the students, but they have made umpteen number of excuses. “After realising that students won’t turn up for the vaccination, schools are left with no option except enforcing vaccinations must for taking online classes,” said a school owner without quoting his name. Parents, however, objected that schools must not opt for such a coercive approach. “There must be several reasons wherein students have objected to the vaccination for them. School education department must consider their issue and if they have a genuine reason, they should be allowed to continue online classes with a warning that they must get the vaccination as early as possible. Barring unvaccinated students from online classes will hamper their studies,” said a mother of class 10 student, Vinita Verma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/schools-make-vax-certs-must-for-online-classes-parents-resent/articleshow/88961476.cms||---

In 2021, the apex court had given 20-point directions to the state and the central government for better functioning of gas relief hospitals of the state government and the Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC) and also constituted a Monitoring Committee to keep a tab on medical facilities being provided to the gas victims at gas relief hospitals and BMHRC and submit a quarterly report before the MP high court on the issue. It was also mandated to give suggestions to the state and the central government on steps to be taken for improving facilities in the said hospitals. A contempt petition was subsequently filed in the high court alleging that the state and the central government have not complied with the directions of the supreme court and recommendations of the Monitoring Committee are not being followed either. The court had asked the state and the central government to file a compliance report on the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee. However, the compliance report had not found the compliance report satisfactory and said that it might be constrained to give direction that the gas victims could get treatment from any hospital and the expenses would be borne by the government.In the hearing of the case on Monday, the bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Sheela Yadav asked the state and the central government to present a detailed compliance report on action taken in regard to recommendations made by the Monitoring Committee in its 18 quarterly reports and deferred hearing of the case for February 14. Senior counsel Naman Nagrath and Rajesh Chand appeared in the case on behalf of the petitioners.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-directs-centre-state-to-submit-compliance-report/articleshow/88961478.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Razor sharp, deadly for humans & birds alike||BHOPAL: Chinese manjha is made of nylon yarn with a coat of crushed glass gummed onto it, making it razor sharp. When anyone comes into contact with this plastic manjha, accidents like injuries or even death can occur in the worst situation because it is difficult to cut the thread with hands to detangle oneself. Besides, it’s made of nylon or synthetic yarn, which is non-biodegradable and therefore, harmful to the environment at large. Veterinary doctor at Van Vihar national park, Atul Gupta, when asked how does birds and sometimes people get fatally injured by Chinese manjha, said “Since it’s sharp, it cuts the skin or muscle tissues of persons or birds who get entangled into it when it’s falling after breaking off from a kite. If a vital organ like windpipe or any major vein is damaged, it may also cause death both among human beings and birds. He, however, said that he has not treated any bird injured by Chinese manjha at Van Vihar. "The birds brought to us for treatment are those entangled in a net or those entangled in a wire or birds deserted by their mothers but I never treated a bird injured by Chinese manjha.” Against the Chinese manjha, traditional manjha is safer as it’s made of cotton thread coated with a mixture of rice glue, tree gums and similar natural ingredients and finely powdered glass, Since Chinese manjha is far stronger than the traditional manjha, which doesn’t break off easily and is cheaper, too, it’s popular among a section of kite fliers who in a competitive spirit to win don’t mind using a manjha, which is not easily breakable even if it occasionally results in an incident witnessed in Ujjain a couple of days ago when throat of a teenage girl was slit by the same strong synthetic thread. Since, there is no separate statute/law to ban the sale/use of Chinese manjha in MP, collectors at places where kite flying during Makar Sankranti is more in vogue resort to banning the sale of Chinese manjha through prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC. Ahead of Makar Sankranti this year, district collectors of Indore, Ujjain, Mandsaur and Ratlam had done it. According to a new item published in 2019, collectors of 11 districts had done it including those of Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Burhanpur, Barwani, Khargone, Khndwa, Singrauli, Ratlam, Shajapur and Agar Malwa. Any violation of prohibitory orders is punishable under Section 188 of the IPC, which is normally a nominal fine. On the other hand, NGT in its order banning manufacture, storage, sale and use Chinese manjha in 2016 had stipulated a maximum punishment of five years of imprisonment or Rs 1 lakh fine or both on violation of the law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/razor-sharp-deadly-for-humans-birds-alike/articleshow/88961479.cms||---

The retired official, Shobaram Dhariwal, was last posted in Bhind and Rajnandgaon (Chhattisgarh) districts.When questioned about his assets, Dhariwal said that had acquired them from ancestors. Investigations, however, revealed that his father was a poor farmer and had no such assets, say officials.Apart from 42 properties in Bhind, Gwalior and Rajnandgaon, the Benami unit has attached 13 bank accounts and fixed deposits, say officials, adding that he allegedly has around 24 acres of land in the name of his family members. Dhariwal had opened most of his accounts in rural and cooperative banks. He tried to convince tax officers that his father was a rich farmer. When his relatives were questioned, they too failed to unveil their sources of income. After separation of the two states, Dhariwal had decided to stay with Chhattisgarh and retired in 2020. Most of the properties were acquired in cash, say officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/tax-dept-attaches-properties-of-retired-agriculture-officer/articleshow/88961480.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Police crack down on Chinese manjha sale in Bhopal||BHOPAL: The gruesome death of an Ujjain girl whose throat was slit by Chinese manjha has resulted in Bhopal Police launching a campaingn to check the sale of the string in the state capital. The police department will conduct surprise checks at kite shops and other spots. Police said, if any shopkeeper is found to be involved in selling the banned material appropirate action will be taken against them. A senior police officer said that the electricity department had also filed a complaint against Chinese manjha. The Chinese manjha is made of metallic/nylon yarn with a polished coat of crushed glass gummed onto it. In some types Chinese manjha are made of plastic thread with crushed metal gummed onto it. In such cases, the Chinese manjha made up of metal yarn or metal coating can act as a good conductor of electricity. It can prove dangerous if flown near electric installations and overhead cables causing fire and outages due to short circuits. There have been such cases reported in the state in which people were electrocuted after kite strings got tangled in power cables. Bhopal commissioner of police Makrand Deoskar said “After the incident reported in Ujjain, city police have also started a campaign to check if Chinese manjha is being sold in Bhopal. Sale of Chinese manjha is banned in the state. If any shopkeeper is found selling Chinese manjha, appropriate action would be taken against them.” The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the production, storage, sale and use of Chinese manjha or glass-coated synthetic or nylon manjha in 2016 following incidents of birds and some people getting killed or injured by them. In 2017, it asked the state governments to enact the law to implement the ban.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/ujjain-death-prompts-surprise-checks-at-shops/articleshow/88961481.cms||---
---||Bhopal||‘Birju Maharaj’s last performance in Bhopal moved audience to tears’||BHOPAL: Classical dance lovers across the world are mourning Kathak maestro Birju Maharaj’s demise. The fact that he was the royalty of Kathak and brightest gem of Lucknow ‘Kalka-Bindadin’ gharana didn’t diminish his passion to perform live. In the last few years, his health didn’t permit him to perform much on stage, but given half a chance, Maharaj would make his Bhopali fans’ day with one of his rare appearances. Not many know that he was a foodie who ‘loved rabri’ and also had a great connect with the city and remained in love with Madhya Pradesh till the end. “I was awe-inspired watching Maharaj walk on stage at Khajuraho Festival, 2004-2005. Despite his frail health, he rendered a ‘padhant, played some taals on tabla and effortlessly mesmerised the audience. He and his craft had a magical aura, which touched the souls,” said director of Ustad Allauddin Khan Academy, MP, Rahul Rastogi. One of his earliest concerts in Bhopal was held in 1981-82 and since then he had been an integral part of city’s cultural warp and weft, said his some of his oldest fans in the city. Mohd. Naeem, classical dance buff, who attended his concert in 1984 in Bhopal, got emotional describing the ecstasy of watching the guru perform. “Among the male classical dancers, nobody could match Maharaj’s calibre. I vividly remember him playing pakhawaj, tabla, singing a thumri and also leading the show as a dancer on stage. It won’t be an an exaggeration to say that Birju Maharaj and Kathak were synonymous,” said Naeem. Pt ji performed many times in Bhopal and his bond with the city got strengthened with the passage of time. PRO of Bharat Bhavan Prem Shankar said, “Pt ji was a trustee of Bharat Bhavan for several years in 80s and he performed here on several occasions including 1987, 1990 and 1995. He was also conferred with Kalidas Samman here. Bhopal was a city close to his heart.” He gave his last performance in the city in 2015 at Karunadham Ashram and those who watched him live, still get goosebumps as they remember his concert. Swapnil Joshi, who organised the event, said, “Before the event, Pt ji was a simple man, laughing enjoying his rabri, which he enjoyed the most. But on stage, he was a divine presence moving gracefully; it was like watching magic unfold right in front of your eyes. Birju maharaj played Krishna at his last concert in the city and moved audience to tears, including Rajan-Sajan Mishra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/maharajs-last-performance-in-city-moved-audience-to-tears/articleshow/88961482.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Naresh Tikait retracts ‘support SP-RLD’ statement, says can’t go against SKM||MEERUT: Hours after appealing to his supporters and khaps of western UP on Sunday to "ensure victory for the SP-RLD alliance in these testing times”, BKU chief Naresh Tikait retracted his statement on Monday and said he made a "mistake". The overnight change in stance by Tikait came, according to sources, after Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) intervened to say the farmers' group must be seen as “politically neutral”. Soon after the dramatic retraction, BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Balyan met Tikait at the BKU headquarters in Sisauli, fuelling political speculation. “BJP candidates are not (our) enemies. Anyone can come to seek baba Tikait’s blessings,” said Tikait. This is Balyan’s first visit to Sisauli after a war of words broke out between the two during the peak of the anti-farm laws agitation following which BJP leaders faced people’s ire in many west UP villages. “No one (politician) has approached us. Only these alliance (SP-RLD) people came to us, and they were gathering at the Kisan Bhawan. So I asked people to take care of them,” said Tikait, adding, “Hum bol pade faltu (I spoke unnecessarily).” Tikait said he cannot go against the decision of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farmers’ organizations. “We cannot walk alone, or else SKM will remove us from the organisation,” Tikait said. "No one should come here (BKU headquarters) to seek votes." TOI in its January 17 edition had reported that the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief -- who is also head of Baliyan Khap -- had asked people to ensure “massive” support for the "gathbandhan" (the SP-RLD combine). “Do anything to make the alliance win,” Tikait was heard announcing in a video that soon went viral on social media. He later told TOI that he did ask people to support the SP-RLD alliance. “The sentiment is against BJP and there is no doubt about it,” Tikait said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/tikait-retracts-support-sp-rld-statement-says-cant-go-against-skm/articleshow/88959127.cms||Ishita Mishra

However, there are several districts where this average is mush more than 500%. In these districts of concern, average growth rate of new cases reported daily is the average of the sum of day-to-day percentage growth in number of new cases reported between January 10 and January 16. Among the 15 districts of state that had maximum number of active patients as on January 16, it was not Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior or Jabalpur districts but districts like Dhar and Katni where this average growth of Covid-19 cases reported daily has been highest in the past seven days. While the average of the percentage growth in number of new cases reported daily between January 10 and January 16 in Indore has been 18%, for Bhopal it has been 14%, for Gwalior it has been 17% and for Jabalpur it has been 19%. But for Sagar it has been 31%, for Ujjain it has been 19%, for Vidisha it has been 27%, for Shahdol it has been 28%, for Khargone it is 37%, for Betul it has been 56% and for Datia it has been 31%. However, for districts like Dhar it is a whopping 736%, for Katni it had been 389% and for Damoh it is 140%. Among the 15 districts with highest case load, the average growth has been lowest in Ratlam where it has been 12% for past one week. Sources said that this is primarily because the rate of infection has been higher in the bigger cities earlier as it had started spreading, now the same is happening with the smaller districts where it has started to grow now. Thus, the overall average growth rate of infection in Madhya Pradesh still seems to be growing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/from-2300-to-6300-in-a-week-covid-cases-spike-in-small-towns-by-500/articleshow/88961484.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Hyper-reactive airway diseases with a combination of viral infection like Covid-19 is making people apprehensive. “There is almost 30% increase in patients with pre-existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ailments who seeking medical treatment,” said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) associate professor and pulmonologist, Dr Parag Sharma. Cold weather can trigger trouble in breathing, coughing, wheezing and spasms that feel similar to an asthma attack. For people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the pre-existing condition with viral infection with cold, can be fatal. Not all with medical condition of respiratory illness are being diagnosed with Covid-19. Some are being treated with Covid-19 infection too. Early intervention is vital in hyper reactive airway disease, he added. Anyone with chronic lung condition mimicking a severe form of COPD should watch out for triggers. It would be a collapse triggered by difference in day and night temperatures, toxic inhalation of smoke, fumes or poor air quality conditions. In aggravated conditions acute respiratory illness can cause buildup of fluid in the air sac whereby preventing oxygen from passing into the bloodstream. Any shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, blood pressure or rapid breathing should be medically examined. In Bhopal, survivors of the gas disaster still suffer from various respiratory ailments. COPD is one of the major medical condition in victims of the tragedy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/amid-cloud-of-covid-spike-cold-wave-triggers-health-concerns/articleshow/88961494.cms||Jamal Ayub

The school in the tribal-dominated Chopna village in Sheopur is being run in the house of Satyanarayan Meena, a local farmer. Ten years ago, the school had its own building but it was vacated as the place became old and dilapidated. Sources alleged that ‘Rajya Shiksha Kendra had sanctioned Rs 7 lakh to renovate the building, but the government land where the old school building once existed, was encroached by some influential people of the village.’ “For the last ten years, the government has not been able to vacate the school land. CM talks about action against the mafia but in Chopna village, there seems to be no government”, lamented Sitaram, father of a school student. Satyanarayan, the farmer, who has lent a tin shed in his house for the school said, “ At least the children are getting some education here; I don’t even mind lending even more space for educating them.” The district project coordinator, school education department in Sheopur, Dr PS Goyal recently promised the local media to inspect the schools to resolve the issue but parents are not easily convinced with such promises now. When contacted, district collector Shivam Verma said, “We have identified land for Veerpur school and a new building will soon be constructed. In Chopna, the land dispute is being heard in High Court, we will resolve this issue too to have a proper school building for the students.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/these-sarkari-schools-in-mprun-from-a-shanty-tin-shed/articleshow/88961496.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

The court had said that it won't be appropriate for the court to interfere in policy matters of the government.The petitioner organisation contended that the Corona pandemic has been notified as a calamity under the Disaster Management Act. The state is in the grip of the third wave of Corona. People are facing financial hardships and in such a situation the government in a welfare state is supposed to ameliorate the sufferings of the people. In this context, the manch had presented an application to the state government urging it to invoke powers under section 108 of the Electricity Act to restrain the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) from raising the power tariff as proposed by the discoms but there was no response on its part. In the revision petition, the manch has sought direction to the state government to decide on its application before ERA decides on revision of power tariff. Advocate Dinesh Upadhyay has filed the revision petition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/revision-plea-in-hc-against-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/88961497.cms||---

During an event at the BJP headquarters here, Rao speaking on the CM’s itinerary of its reach out campaign said, “Adarniya mukhya Mantri ji ek din late kar sakte hain, lekin 100 ghanta poora karenge. Virat Kohli ke jaise batting karenge. (Our dear chief minister may be one day late, but will complete 100 hours. He will bat like Virat Kohli).”Soon after, Congress started posting reactions. State PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja tweeted, “Amid speculations of change of leadership in Madhya Pradesh, state (BJP) in-charge Muralidhar Rao has approved a change by comparing Shivraj-ji to Virat Kohli. Meaning captaincy is about to go.Now there will be uproar over the Virat Kohli statement.” Rao has been in the news earlier too for controversial statements.“BJP is about to show Shivraj Singh Chouhan the path of retirement like Virat Kohli, that is why the comparison. There is nothing in the form of government in the state. No one knows who is running the panchayats. The government sometimes snatches away the rights from former sarpanchs and then it gives them back. This government is running like a circus. BJP is running by poaching MLAs of other parties, there is no organisation left. BJP workers are highly disillusioned,” Congress spokesman Ajay Yadav said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-takes-a-dig-as-bjp-neta-compares-cm-with-kohli/articleshow/88961498.cms||---

The order clearly mentions what triggered the department to order an immediate study by the council.Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, an autonomous college, has submitted an application to the government, seeking permission to upgrade the college to a deemed to be university. “The government has examined the matter in detail. Apparently, other autonomous colleges in the state are also likely to seek government permission to acquire deemed to the university status. In this background, the KSHEC has been entrusted with the task of preparing a report to aid the government to formulate a policy and bring in a piece of legislation in connection with deemed to be universities in the state in private sector,” the order said.Left with little room to resist autonomy to higher education institutions, in the background of the UGC Regulations 2019, the Left government had given green signal to several private colleges that sought permission to seek autonomy from the UGC. Subsequently, the government has amended the act of state universities to ensure some sort of control over the autonomous colleges without infringing on the provisions enshrined in the UGC regulation on autonomy.The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations 2019 leaves little elbow to the state government to exercise discretionary powers to resist or deny eligible institutions from seeking and obtaining deemed to be university status from the UGC. According to the regulations, an institution applying for the deemed to be university status should satisfy a set of eligibility conditions such as it should have been in existence for not less than 20 years, should have NAAC accreditation with at least 3.26 CGPA for three consecutive cycles. In case of technical institutions, two-third of the eligible programmes should be accredited by NBA. The institution should figure, at the time of application, among the top 50 ranks in any specific category or among the top 100 of overall ranking of NIRF. Among other things, it insists that private institutions should set aside a corpus fund of Rs 10 crore for an existing institution and Rs 25 crore for a de-novo institution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-plans-law-to-rein-in-private-deemed-varsities/articleshow/88961503.cms||B S Anilkumar

The girls had reportedly committed suicide after falling in love trap wherein the drug mafia has a major involvement. The police team led by the SP met the tribal chieftain and officials of the tribal welfare department in the area to find out their grievances and take inputs from them.The parents of those who committed suicide told police that the presence of drug mafia is rampant in the area. The police will extend its probe in this direction and will also launch an awareness campaign, the SP said. On Sunday, a team of excise officials led by excise joint commissioner R Gopakumar visited the colonies in Peringammala and Idinjar. The excise team had visited three houses from where the suicides were reported. “We have had discussions with all the stakeholders in the area and have decided to set up teams to provide awareness classes for the tribal population in these areas,” Gopakumar said.The excise department had earlier taken proactive steps where cases of youths falling into drug addiction were being reported. In 2018-19, the department, thinking much beyond their established task of enforcement of anti-drug laws, have been training tribal youths at Njaraneeli near Nedumangad for at least one year to equip them for facing competitive examinations for various government jobs offered by the public service commission. Five such youths who attended the coaching were shortlisted in PSC’s rank list for various jobs. The department initiated the idea after it received an alarming report from the health department, that suicides are on the rise in the area, and at least 50% of those committing suicide were drug addicts. Meanwhile, opposition leader VD Satheesan will visit the tribal hamlets in Vithura and Peringammala on Tuesday. The visit is in the wake of allegations that the excise and the police are not accepting complaints from tribal parents that drug mafia are trying to exploit their girl children pretending to be love affairs. The visit by the opposition leader will be along with Congress leaders from the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tribal-hamlets-police-to-keep-tab-on-visitors/articleshow/88961504.cms||---

It also invited criticism for a Secretariat march here last week, in which hundreds of workers participated. Congress too has cancelled all public programmes for a fortnight in view of the sharp rise in Covid cases.However, CPM leaders tried to deflect criticisms for organizing party conferences in violation of the Covid protocol by continuing to justify their act saying that the party dropped several public meetings in connection with district conferences to comply with Covid norms.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Digital divide holds poor kids prisoners of device||NEW DELHI: Chote Lal has two children. The daughter is a Class XI student and the son is in Class VIII at a Delhi government school in southwest Delhi’s Palam. His wife, who is a domestic worker, takes the only phone in the household to work. This means the two children are unable to attend online classes and Lal is worried about the disruption in their studies. This is not just the story of Chote Lal’s family. In every government school, more than 10% of the students don’t have smartphones. The devices are absolutely necessary when schools are closed and students have to attend online classes. “My children get to do only 40% of their studies. I really don’t know how they are going to get educated,” despaired Lal, who lost both his legs in an accident and cannot work anymore. A family in southeast Delhi’s Madanpur Khadar had just one phone for the two Class X students in the family. Till last year, that phone was shared by three, but the eldest daughter, Anu, passed Class XII in 2021. “My brother and my uncle’s son depend for their studies on my father’s phone,” revealed Anu, who is now working and is enrolled at Delhi University’s School of Open Learning. “They get the phone only at night because my father, a generator mechanic, carries it with him during the day.” The 2020 Annual State of Education Report said that only 8.1% of children in government schools attended online classes. In the municipal corporation-run primary schools, the situation is even deplorable. Neetin Oberoi, principal of a Delhi government school at Chand Bagh, said there were 63 students who did not have smartphones and collected physical worksheets. “The others receive pdfs of the worksheeta on their phones. But their response too is dropping because of problems related to device and data access,” said Oberoi. “Often, even those who have phones actually share one among several family members. When I called the father of two Class X students, he told me that the family’s one phone needed repairs costing around Rs 5,000. He puts up a stall at the weekly market, but with the implementation of the weekend curfew he earns hardly anything to be able to afford the cost of repairing the phone.” At the school in Subhash Nagar, a teacher claimed that of the 1,800 students there, around a thousand did not have phones. Sant Ram, teacher at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya there, said, “Just 10% of the children in classes VI-VIII join the online classes. Even for those in classes IX-XII, data cost is a huge burden. Everyone knows the problem, but there is no solution in sight.” A Delhi government official admitted, “Net access is a problem. There are varied reasons. The phone number keeps changing, the device does not have internet facility, and there is a breakdown in net availability regularly.” Earlier, the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi had called for partners to provide tablets to around four lakh class X and XII students by October 2021. According to a government official, only around 1,000 tablets were donated and distributed. Justice for All, an organisation led by advocate Khagesh Jha, too had moved Delhi high court seeking tablets and laptops for students. The high court was in favour of this and asked private schools to provide the same to EWS students. But the directive was challenged in the Supreme Court. Jha told TOI, “The Supreme Court actually widened the ambit and asked the government to provide students with the gadgets in all schools, private, government or aided and directed the central and state governments to find a solution together.” The court noted that “a practicable, reasonable and workable solution can be found in the interest of providing access to computers and internet facilities to the young citizens of India belonging to the economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups who are constitutionally entitled to free and compulsory education in terms of Article 21A”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/digital-divide-holds-poor-kids-prisoners-of-device/articleshow/88960438.cms||Shradha Chettri

Judge R Jayakrishnan pronounced the verdict against the accused Vijayakumar, 54, a resident of Kalady in Manacaud. The trial also brought to light the importance of teaching kids the difference between good touch and bad touch. During the trial, the boy told the court that the accused shall be punished because he made a bad touch and hence he was culpable. The boy told the court that he knew the difference between bad touch and good touch and he had learnt about it in school. As per the verdict, if the convict failed to pay the penalty amount, he shall do his term for an additional six months.The incident pertaining to the case happened on November 26, 2020. The boy was standing on the verandah of his house. The accused had come for household chores. He grabbed the boy and held his private part, according to the complaint. When someone else turned up, the accused let go of the hold. The boy then ran inside, scared.

The daily TPR on Monday was 44.22%. As many as 5,863 persons were confirmed with Covid-19 on Monday. The previous highest daily positive cases (4,560) was recorded on May 8 2021 during the second wave. TPR in government and private sector and all types of testing; both RT-PCR and antigen recorded above 40% in the district on Monday. In government sector, TPR from all types was 53.1% whereas for the private sector, it stood at 42.7%. RT-PCR positivity rate in government sector alone was 53.8%. Antigen positivity in private and government sector was 44.9% and 44.5%, respectively. The government sector recorded the highest positivity rate although daily number of tests is nowhere near the numbers which were being done during the second wave in the district. Since the last week of December, testing numbers in government sector crossed 10,000 only four times including on Monday when 13,260 tests were done.The high positivity rate being recorded in the government sector in spite of low testing numbers points at a precarious situation. It is cited that positivity rate could scale alarming levels once the testing in government sector is further ramped up.

But the organization cancelled the strike planned on Wednesday morning due to Covid regulations.AKTA is putting forward various demands, including workers’ welfare fund and other retirement benefits.The strike was aimed at resolving issues like discrimination against widows. The members pointed out that a woman who receives a widow pension will have to make a submission that they do not need widow pension if they are to receive tailors’ welfare pension after the age of 60. The association said that people’s representatives receive double pension and it was unfair to deny poor women tailors the same. They also pointed out issues regarding mustering. The workers were not able to complete the mustering process for 2019-2020 period in most of the Akshaya Centres in Kerala due to software problems. The government has decided to give pensions to people who retired in 2021. But there are people who have retired in between these periods. The government has not noticed that pensions have not been paid to pensioners during this period, the association said.During the software development interventions with Keltron in connection with the computerization of tailors’ welfare fund, the board incurred a huge loss though it had invested a cost of Rs 30 lakh within four years. The board also has to pay a good amount of money to the workers and other office expenses. Once the software upgrade is completed, other additional costs can be reduced. “We had to cancel the hunger strike to follow the Covid regulations. We have given appeals to the authorities. If they are not ready to consider our needs, we will surely come forward with the hunger strike,” said AKTA state general secretary N C Babu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tailors-assn-seeks-pension-benefits/articleshow/88961513.cms||---

The special council that met here on Monday approved the action plan. The cleaning drive will be held on January 30. Plastic waste on streets and public places will be collected in 100 wards from 7am. Residents, students, NCC, NSS, scouts and guide, residents’ association, youth club, non-governmental organizations, various political organizations and fishermen organizations will take part in the cleaning drive.  It has also been decided to convene ward-level committees before January 25 under the leadership of ward councillors and junior health inspectors. The committees shall decide on collection spots for dry waste and people who shall collect the dry waste. Old clothes, bags, sandals shall be brought to ward-level collection centres on January 22. Glass waste shall be collected on January 29. CFL tubes shall be collected in storage centres of respective wards on February 5. The special council also approved the recommendation to the state government to include waste management as a study subject in schools. Mayor Arya Rajendran said that the initiative would make aware the new generation about the dangerous effects of using plastic. The corporation plans to ban plastic carry bags below 100 microns by June 2022 and carry bags below 120 microns by December 2022 in compliance with the direction of ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Failure in making available proper alternatives have always affected the corporation’s anti plastic campaigns. The councillors who spoke regarding plastic ban had earlier stressed the need to ensure proper alternatives. In 2017, the city corporation had sold out more than 10,000 cloth bags manufactured from its five production units in the city. The corporation which was planning an aggressive entry into cloth bag market following ban on all kinds of carry bags had to slow down mainly owing to difference in cost of procurement and production. It was in February 2017 that the civic body had decided to introduce 30 lakh paper and cloth bags as an alternative to plastic carry bags. The project however failed to take off. Corporation health standing committee chairperson Jameela Sreedharan said that the units are being revived after maintenance of machines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-plans-mass-cleaning-drive-ahead-of-plastic-ban/articleshow/88961515.cms||---

It rose to an average of 518 on January 15 and 16, recording a spike of 28%. Likewise, the shift from homes to hospitals for Covid patients from January 10 to 14 was average 59 that increased to average 79 on January 15 and 16, a rise of 34%. “In fact, from January 15 to 17, about 50% of 2,500-odd calls on 108 services were related to Covid-19 — one of the highest after the end of the second wave,” said a senior EMRI 108 official. Call it the result of a three-day kite-flying revelry or the contentious rise in Covid cases in both city and state, the post-Uttarayan period has recorded a major spike in daily tally. For Gujarat, it was a rise of 26%, from 10,150 on Sunday to 12,753 on Monday. For Ahmedabad, the rise was 33%, from 3,264 to 4,340. It was the highest daily tally for the city in the past 258 days or since May 4. Long queues at rapid antigen testing (RAT) booths were seen across the city, whereas the private path labs also recorded spike in number of tests. At Civil Hospital, the past two days brought 37 patients, including seven suspected patients. This is 60% of the total 57 cases at the hospital. Medical superintendent, Dr Rakesh Joshi, said: “Of the total, 16 are either on ventilator or BiPAP. Several of the admitted patients have not taken either one or both doses of vaccine. We urge all to get vaccinated at the earliest.” Even in private hospitals, the number of admitted patients crossed 200 and stood at 208 on Monday. The number was 146 on January 14 — a spike of 42% in three days. ‘ According to Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association data, 21 patients were in the ICU and four on ventilator, whereas 76 were in high-dependency units (HDU). AHNA officials said that the hospitalization is still low compared to overall numbers but the number of admitted patients is steadily rising. “The majority of the number of hospitalized patients consists of senior citizens and those with comorbidities. Due to very high spread of the Omicron variant, we all must exercise caution for some time,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA. On Monday, Gujarat recorded 9.5 crore total vaccination doses including 5.03 crore first and 4.41 crore second dose of vaccination.

Tally stagnant at 264 for week||AHMEDABAD: According to the Covid bulletin released by the Union health ministry on Monday, Gujarat stood 10th among Indian states in terms of Omicron cases. The state’s tally was 236, of which 186 — about 79% — were shown discharged, leaving only 50 active cases. Curiously, on January 10, Gujarat was sixth in the national tally with the same figures of 236 and 186. The state health department’s daily bulletin recorded the last 28 cases on January 10, taking the total to 264. While no Omicron case was recorded on the subsequent two days according to the department, the count of the cases disappeared from January 13 when the active cases were 26. Repeated attempts to reach state health department officials did not yield any response. So are the variant cases disappearing from the state? On the contrary, sources aware of the developments said that 10% of genome sequencing of the daily cases — above 1,000 for the past few days — shows the prevalence of the Omicron variant as the dominant one. The variant accounts for over 50% of the cases, thus resulting in the relatively milder spread. So the state authorities’ silence on the nature of the pandemic in Gujarat is baffling many.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/no-omicron-in-state-tally-stagnant-at-264-for-week/articleshow/88961518.cms||---

Since it was his first international flight, Joshi got to the airport at 8pm so he had enough time to comply with all Covid protocols, including getting an RT-PCR test. The report was negative and the 20-year-old was glad that all he had to do now was to board the flight. So, imagine his shock when he walked to the check-in counter and was informed that he would have to pay another Rs 2,700 and undergo the RT-PCR test again. Joshi, who had chosen the Dubai route which was convenient and economical compared to the Delhi-Toronto route, said, “I already had a negative report from an RT-PCR test carried out within 72 hours of the flight, since it was mandatory. At the airport, I underwent an RT-PCR test upon entry as the certificate was required in Dubai. It had to be taken within six hours of boarding.” The report was negative and Joshi was confident that everything would be smooth sailing. However, at check-in, he was informed that he would have to retake RT-PCR test as the previous one had been conducted over six hours earlier. “I was baffled. I had not left the airport premises. Had I known the rule, I would have delayed the first test. But now I was back in a long queue. I was so worried about missing my flight that I begged the officers to allow me to go to the front of the line. I was not alone; other students underwent the same predicament,” said Joshi, who will start his civil engineering course at a Canadian university later this month. “Can’t the authorities ensure that fliers are not fleeced in the name of rules?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/got-tested-for-covid-twice-in-eight-hours-at-city-airport/articleshow/88961519.cms||---

HOEC shares the blocks with Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC). “HOEC has decided to carry out drilling at Asjol and North Balol in Cambay basin. A public hearing for the purpose has been organized on January 18 by Gujarat Pollution Control Board at Palaj village in Mehsana,” said sources close to the development. HOEC plans to drill four infill wells and six development wells at Asjol and proposes drilling of 16 development wells in the North Balol block. The project cost estimated for the proposed drilling campaign for both Asjol and North Balol blocks is Rs 345 cr, according to the environment impact assessment (EIA) report submitted to GSPC. HOEC is planning to drill each well up to 1200 metres depth for an estimated cost of Rs 13 crore each well. At Asjol, HOEC will drill ten wells. The company also proposes to lay underground pipelines and hook up to the existing gathering facility located at Asjol-5 well site. The wells shall be hooked up to the nearest existing well-site manifold for transferring the produced oil to the Asjol EPS. Discovered by ONGC in December 1972, the 15-sq km Asjol block located 25-km south-west of Mehsana is surrounded by many producing oil fields of ONGC such as North Kadi, Santhal, Balol and Becharaji. A consortium of HOEC (50%) and GSPC (50%) was awarded the block in 1994. The initial oil estimate in the Asjol oil field is about 10.7m barrels. Recoverable Reserves have been estimated to be about 0.553m barrels till March 31 (2021). The total production from the field was about 0.3344m barrels. Out of all existing wells, three wells: Asjol#5, Asjol#6 and Asjol#7 are presently on production, and the average total field production rate from these wells is around 50 barrels per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hoec-plans-to-start-drilling-in-cambay/articleshow/88961529.cms||---

As part of the move, the state higher education department has issued an order early this month engaging the Kerala state higher education council (KSHEC) to prepare and submit to the government a detailed report on the broad outline within which the deemed to beuniversities can be allowed to function. The order clearly mentions what triggered the department to order an immediate study by the council. Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, an autonomous college, has submitted an application to the government, seeking permission to upgrade the college to a deemed to be university. “The government has examined the matter in detail. Apparently, other autonomous colleges in the state are also likely to seek government permission to acquire deemed to the university status. In this background, the KSHEC has been entrusted with the task of preparing a report to aid the government to formulate a policy and bring in a piece of legislation in connection with deemed to be universities in the state in private sector,” the order said. Left with little room to resist autonomy to higher education institutions, in the background of the UGC Regulations 2019, the Left government had given green signal to several private colleges that sought permission to seek autonomy from the UGC. Subsequently, the government has amended the act of state universities to ensure some sort of control over the autonomous colleges without infringing on the provisions enshrined in the UGC regulation on autonomy. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations 2019 leaves little elbow to the state government to exercise discretionary powers to resist or deny eligible institutions from seeking and obtaining deemed to be university status from the UGC. According to the regulations, an institution applying for the deemed to be university status should satisfy a set of eligibility conditions such as it should have been in existence for not less than 20 years, should have NAAC accreditation with at least 3.26 CGPA for three consecutive cycles. In case of technical institutions, two-third of the eligible programmes should be accredited by NBA. The institution should figure, at the time of application, among the top 50 ranks in any specific category or among the top 100 of overall ranking of NIRF. Among other things, it insists that private institutions should set aside a corpus fund of Rs 10 crore for an existing institution and Rs 25 crore for a de-novo institution.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-plans-law-to-rein-in-private-deemed-varsities/articleshow/88960448.cms||B S Anilkumar

According to well-placed sources, the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX), which was to be operationalized from Monday (January 17), will now be operationalized in the first week of February. Earlier, the PM was scheduled to inaugurate it alongside the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) 2022 and it was to be operationalized a week later. However, with limited operations in other exchanges due to the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases, the launch has been postponed. “It is expected that the IIBX will now launch on February 7. Other exchanges are not functioning smoothly due to a sudden spike in Covid cases across the country. As a consequence, the launch and operationalizing of the exchange has been postponed,” said a source privy to the development. This is for the second time that the launch of IIBX has been deferred. Earlier, it was scheduled to be operationalized in October. However, due to certain technical constraints, it had to be postponed, according to well-placed sources. According to industry experts, IIBX would become a gateway for bullion imports into India, wherein all the bullion imports for domestic consumption shall be channelized through the exchange. The India International Bullion Holding IFSC Limited (IIBH) – a holding company has been specifically created to set up and operationalize IIBX, bullion clearing corporation as well as the bullion depository. Measures to notify bullion spot trading and bullion depository receipts with underlying bullion as financial products and bullion related services as financial services, have already been initiated by the Union Finance Ministry, in a bid to facilitate the smooth operationalizing of the exchange. Bullion industry players suggest that the setting up of IIBX will go a long way in building a parallel channel for gold trading on an international platform. This will put India and Gujarat on the global map of gold trading according to jewellers and bullion traders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/launch-of-iibx-postponed-again/articleshow/88961530.cms||Niyati Parikh

Appearing for the mother belonging to the Parsi community, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said the daughters were just 15 and 13 when her husband fled with them in 2019 after assuring a US court, where she had filed a divorce suit in 2017, that he would return within two weeks.  Since her husband fled to India with her daughters in 2019, it has been a struggle for the mother to even talk to her daughters over phone or video calls, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said. Appearing for the husband, advocate Sidharth Bhatnagar, told the court that one of the daughters has attained the age of majority and is studying abroad while the other is now 16. Since they do not want to interact with the mother, there is little the husband could do, he said. A bench said, "The youngest girl is 16 years old...anyone who is 16 year or above, decides what is good for her/him. You think a father can tutor a 16-year-old?" The court also asked the mother how many times had she attempted to interact with her daughters last year. "We cannot hold their hand and force them to interact with their mother. The court can only decide whether the children have taken a conscious decision," the CJI-led bench said and asked the husband whether he could arrange for a videoconference with the daughters. Bhatnagar said no orders are required to be passed and that he would arrange for it voluntarily on Wednesday. Last year, the Bombay HC too, after interacting with the two daughters, had rejected the woman's plea for custody of the children.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-we-force-a-16-yr-old-to-talk-to-her-mom-sc/articleshow/88961533.cms||---

The doctors feel they will be left out of the examination process if the exams are held on March 12. The reason for this, they say, is that many students, including those from North Gujarat University, will not be able to complete their medical internship before July 5. The minimum required eligibility is that applicants must have an MBBS degree and have completed one year of internship. Those candidates who want to take admission to MD/MS/PG Diploma and Post MBBS DNB Courses and NBEMS Diploma courses in the academic year 2022-23 will have to qualify NEET PG 2022. On Monday, the Gujarat Intern Doctors’ Association wrote to the National Board of Exams in Medical Sciences and Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya seeking their intervention into the matter. The association has also threatened to seek legal recourse if the government does not take appropriate action.

Ashish Sharma, a resident of Aditya-Antriksha flats near Chandkheda firestation, who works as the regional head of a private insurance firm, said in his FIR with Chandkheda police that his neighbour Manish Harwani used to a pick fight with him over car parking. “Harwani used to park his car in the space given to me in the parking slot in our flat. As he used to stay in the same flat, I avoided having any scuffle with him. Sometimes, the fight over parking initiated by him even reached the police station but I did not press my complaint as he was my neighbour,” said Sharma in the FIR. On Sunday night, Sharma and his family went for a dinner at a hotel in the Motera area. When Sharma’s family returned, they saw Harwani was parking his car in Sharma’s space. To sort out the issue, Sharma’s mother Kusumlata went to Harwani and told him to allow Sharma to park his car. But rather than parking his car somewhere else, Harwani began arguing aggressively with Sharma. As she tried to pacify him, he first parked his car in such a way that Sharma could not park there and later began abusing her. Sharma intervened and tried to convince him to park his car properly, but he pulled his hair and thrashed him badly. Sharma’s wife Dhara called up police control room and later Sharma filed a complaint of causing hurt with Chandkheda police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-thrashes-neighbour-over-parking-dispute-in-chandkheda/articleshow/88961537.cms||---

Employed with a private bank in Navrangpura, she was on a sabbatical to look after the baby. According to an FIR filed with Sabarmati riverfront (west) police, Manisha Vaghela left her home with her baby on Sunday morning and reached the riverfront walkway near Ellis Bridge from where she jumped into the river with the child. Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) personnel recovered the two bodies on Sunday afternoon. The deceased woman’s brother Jatin Vaghela was informed about the incident. The bodies were taken to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital for postmortem. Later, Sabarmati riverfront (west) police registered a case against Manisha’s husband Rajesh Maru and in-laws for abetment to suicide and domestic violence. Manisha had married Maru on June 20, 2020. Since Maru had married once and had the habit of drinking, her family was against the match. They snapped all ties with her after the marriage but were aware that her husband allegedly harassed her frequently. On December 8, she met her family members for the last time and narrated her ordeal. “She told us that Maru thrashed her every day after getting drunk. He was forcing her to go back to work and start earning so he could get money to buy liquor. But her baby was too young and it was not possible for Manisha to join work immediately,” said Jatin. He said that his parents comforted her and sent her back to Maru, hoping the situation would improve someday. However, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, she was again allegedly beaten up by Maru following which she left the house with the baby and took the extreme step.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/woman-jumps-into-river-with-5-mth-old-son/articleshow/88961538.cms||---

Speaking at the launch of the booklet “Sushashan Na 121 Divas” (121 days of good governance) marking the completion of 121 days in office, Patel stressed the formula of “minimum government, maximum governance”. He said all the flagship schemes of the Centre are being brought to beneficiaries in Gujarat in a time-bound manner. “The government is moving ahead with sustainable development goals to ensure that the benefits of development reach everyone, and nobody is left out,” Patel said. He said Gujarat is the only state in the country where districts have prepared reports of sustainable goals and action plans. “Focus is given to outcome and not output,” the CM added. Gujarat is committed to achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolve for ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ through ‘Aatmanirbhar Gujarat’ and work tirelessly in this direction, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/focus-is-on-outcome-not-output-says-cm/articleshow/88961539.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Geneticists decode male infertility||AHMEDABAD: What are the genetic factors behind infertility among Indian males? This question spurred one of the largest studies on male infertility involving two city-based labs. The labs randomly collected 6,142 blood samples of males, aged between 21 and 43, from eight states who had walked in between 2019 and 2021 for infertility tests. The men included Amdavadis. In the end, 787 blood samples revealed infertility issues and 167 samples had chromosomal abnormalities. But concern was stoked by the fact that of the 44 cases detected with chromosomal translocations, 20 samples were from Maharashtra and seven each from Gujarat and Delhi. In these cases, abnormality related to a chromosome breaking and a portion of it reattaching to a different chromosome. Such chromosomal translocations cause reductions in testicular volume and testosterone level, which then impact spermatogenesis or the production of sperms. The result is male infertility. Moreover, there were 15 cases in which men had Robertsonian translocation and 24 men exhibited autosome-autosomal translocations. The others had gonosome-autosome reciprocal. “Parent carriers with reciprocal translocations are at a risk of infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL),” said the study. The researchers are Nidhi Shah, Krishna Mistry, Mudra Kansara, K Sonali, Nirali Thakkar, Parth Shah, and Sandip Shah. They are all from the department of genomic medicine, cytogenetic division, Neuberg-Supratech referral laboratory. The research director is Dr Mandava V Rao, former director of the department of zoology, BMTC and human genetics, Gujarat University. The researchers emphasized the fact that geographically, Maharashtra had a high incidence of Robertsonian translocations followed by Gujarat and Delhi, indicating environmental, hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors. One’s behaviors and environment can also cause changes that affect the way one’s genes work. All these aspects were taken into consideration in this study. “In-depth epidemiological survey is called for with more sample analysis in the future,” the report said. “Few of these infertile cases were with primary and secondary infertility.” The report added: “These cases may thus serve as clinical reference for genetic counselling and assessment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/geneticists-decode-male-infertility/articleshow/88961541.cms||Paul John

Having been blocked by cattle “standing like a rock” at the entrance to the high court earlier in the day, the chief justice mulled roping in the Legal Service Authority for a comprehensive report on cattle menace in the city. During the hearing of a contempt petition on road repairs, stray cattle menace and traffic movement, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri inquired about the condition of cattle menace. To this, petitioner’s advocate Amit Panchal informed the court that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has declared certain areas as ‘no-cattle zone’ by a notification on experimental basis. Government pleader Manisha Lavkumar also apprised the court about the provisions to make heavy traffic areas free of cattle. To this, the chief justice recounted his experience, saying that when his car turned to enter the high court campus, there were 10-12 cattle that refused to move. “Even whistling policemen could not make them move. They were standing like a rock,” he said. The GP again mentioned the legislation to turn some areas into cattle-frees zones. But the chief justice said, “Legislations are all good. They are done. We agree. But enforcement agencies are not discharging their duty. That is a problem. In such circumstances, we have to rope in the Legal Service Authority also to get a comprehensive report.” The court said that it would involve the Legal Service Authority for a report and they would be entitled for feedback from any NGO or individual. The chief justice said, “They may start toll-free call service or a telephone plaza like e-plaza, where anybody can send information with photographs and you can consider them on case to case basis.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/enforcement-agencies-not-discharging-duty-says-high-court/articleshow/88961543.cms||---

He said while technology is the facilitator of change, it is the human mind alone that will remain its driver. He was speaking via video conferencing after virtually inaugurating a ‘justice clock’ that has been set up in Gujarat High Court along with its e-version on its website, as well as an e-court fees system for all the courts in the state.Gujarat High Court becomes the first in the country to have a ‘justice clock’, which is an outdoor display LED wall within the court premises to display disposal and pendency of cases, etc.“A healthy balance between the use of technology and human intervention has to be maintained. Technology, we must understand, is the facilitator of change, but the driver of change has been, is, and must continue to be the human mind. The only limitation on the human mind is human commitment to change and to adapt,” said Justice Chandrachud. “We can never forget the human face of justice which lies on the back of all technologies,” he added. Justice Chandrachud, who is also the chairman of the e-committee of the Supreme Court, said technology has taught the judiciary, which is criticized for being “oblivious to time,” to “respect time value of all stakeholders.”“Unfortunately, it is true we forget the clock while we do justice. In a way it is good we forget the clock, because judges work oblivious to the demands of time. Once you handle a case in the court, no case is big, and no case is too small, because it represents a human face behind a dispute. But equally, technology has taught us we must respect the time value of all stakeholders,” he said.The Supreme Court judge further said technology should bring about “transformation, and not just automation,” and also urged judges, members of the bar and other stakeholders to “adapt to the needs of technology, because technology is here to stay.” He said the next step should be evaluating the process of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in court processes, and appealed to the Gujarat government to use AI for better predicted outcomes of land acquisition cases as well as those related to motor accident claims.Justice MR Shah of the Supreme Court said the justice clock system will also enhance transparency and accountability, and will show the “real truth” that judicial officers are not sitting idle. Justice Aravind Kumar, Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court, called the two initiatives as “litigant-and-citizen-centric,” and said these are the results and fruits of technology, coupled with the vision and efforts of the e-committee of the Supreme Court.

Despite police instructions, court orders and Covid threat, people of East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, Vizag and Vizianagaram districts participated in the bloody game which involved large scale gambling running into over 1,000 crore in past four days. As per estimates, cockfights were held in over 1,000 baris (arenas) in various parts of the state and over 500 arenas were erected in two Godavari districts alone, which are known for hosting traditional games during Sankranti. Police said in 2021, over 1,000 cases pertaining to cockfights were booked, 4,072 people arrested, over 47 lakh in cash seized and 1,739 cocks confiscated. Cockfight organisers and punters are of the opinion that the cash seized by the police was just the tip of iceberg as major betting operations and cockfights went undetected in many parts. “Police also remained mute spectators as thousands of cockfights were conducted and crores of rupees (in betting) worth transactions held in the past three days,” they added.  Locals in Bhimavaram, a major hub for cockfighting in the state, said over 1,500 crore changed hands in the state during the past three days in betting. The betting was in the range of 2 crore and 15 crore on each fight.  The two Godavari districts witnessed a large number of cockfights during the festival. Majority of the hotels were booked by punters who came from various parts of the state and also neighbouring states. Some hotels charged over 7,000 to 10,000 per room per day.  Cockfights also provided brisk business for liquor stores, eateries and fast food centres. There were also makeshift casinos for gambling and card games near cockfight areas. Punters threw the Omicron scare to winds as large number of people were seen without properly wearing masks. “Though the game is illegal, and police warned of strict action, I don’t feel they had any impact on cockfights and gambling. The game is taking place despite all restrictions,” said a youth, G Swaroop Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/cockfights-held-in-over-1000-arenas-this-time/articleshow/88961547.cms||Nalla.Babu

He also added “insult” with a remark that the proposed roads will be smoother than the cheeks of Ranaut. Later, he profusely reiterated that he meant no disrespect to anyone, including Ranaut.Two days later on January 16, Ansari landed himself in another controversy when Singh, who is also a functionary of BJP’s Jamtara district unit, phoned Ansari and in a lighter vein first heaped praise on the MLA for working to improve the roads in his constituency. Before ending the conversation, Singh suggested that Ansari must make it smoother than ‘bhauji’s cheeks’ (referring to the MLA’s wife). After realising what the caller was trying to mean, the MLA later dialled back the number and he heaped abuses, threats and insults for “disrespecting” his wife until it dawned upon him that this call, too, was being recorded.Singh had posted both the conversation’s audio recording on social media, snubbing Congress and Ansari.On Monday evening, while speaking to TOI over phone, Singh said, “He (Ansari) is an influential person, an MLA, all the audios are in public domain and hence, I fear for my life. He has threatened to kill me which is why I have decided to file a police complaint to seek action against him for abusing a woman, who is also a Padma Shri awardee, and to seek security for myself.”When TOI contacted Ansari, he tried to downplay the whole incident. He said, “There is no need to give any mileage to such things. Anyone can approach the police station with an application. I will also take action when an FIR is filed against me.”He added that it is nothing but ploy by BJP to defame and frame him. “Singh is a relative of Ranchi MLA C P Singh and moreover, who is he to call me and say such inappropriate things and then, without my knowledge defame me on social media,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bjp-official-files-plaint-against-ansari-for-threatening-him/articleshow/88961556.cms||---

The Hemant Soren-led administration is not acting strictly on the issue.”He added, “People had voted this government into power with so much expectations but its functioning in the past two years clearly shows that it is working in the BJP style. It has no control over the bureaucracy, particularly the police administration.”“The state government had declared 2021 as the year of employment but it has failed to achieve much in that regard,” he said, adding that CPIML will continue to fight for public issues in Jharkhand.Bhattacharya was in Jharkhand to take part in the ‘Sahadat Diwas’, which is held to mark the martyrdom of CPI-ML leader Mahendra Singh, on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cpi-ml-to-contest-elections-in-punjab-up-uttarakhand/articleshow/88961558.cms||---

The audit was done in two phases —October 1-18 and October 20-30 — across all the districts. A total of 1,118 panchayats across the state were covered for the audit.According to the report, a copy of which is with the TOI, of various issues highlighted, the biggest irregularity detected was the issue of ‘fake muster rolls’ (attendance sheets). The report further highlights that in majority of instances, muster roll was still being issued despite completion of work /no works going on. “Other lapses include expenditure made on display board but no display board was found, expenditure made but work not started, use of machine at worksite which is banned under NREGA, delayed payments, no material supply despite payment made to vendor, wage payment done without work among others,” stated the report.Talking to TOI, James Herenj, member of the state steering committee (social audit cell), said that they had taken up 29,059 schemes for on-spot verification. “In 36 schemes, we found JCBs were used illegally for executing the projects,” he said, adding that of the 1,59,608 muster rolls picked up for verification, they detected that only 25% (40629) had actually worked but payment sheets were prepared for all. “This is a clear cut instance of fiscal indiscipline and forgery,” he said, adding that they also found many muster rolls generated against fake names while as many as 1,787 labourers who worked didn’t have their names in the muster rolls.“In as many as 85 schemes, we found no muster rolls were created ever but it was claimed that the work resumed or completed,” he said, adding that they have sent a detailed report to the state rural development department with their observations for legitimate action against erring officials and panchayat sewaks on the ground.State rural development minister-cum-Pakur Congress MLA Alamgir Alam as well as Manish Ranjan, state rural development department secretary, didn’t receive calls when the correspondent tried to reach over phones.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/irregularities-found-in-implementation-of-mnrega-in-state-claims-social-audit/articleshow/88961559.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Booster dose: Jharkhand’s strike rate 2%, five dists score 0||RANCHI: Out of the 24 districts in the state, as many as five — Chatra, Koderma, Pakur, Sahebganj and Simdega — have zero per cent coverage of the precautionary dose among 60 plus with co-morbidities, while the state’s overall coverage of vaccination in this target group is barely 2% out of 6.50 lakh identified beneficiaries a week after state kick-started booster doses on January 10. As per the figures available from the state health department, till January 16 night, state’s overall coverage of booster doses for 60+ with co-morbidities stand at 2% out of 6.50 lakh estimated population. In terms of numbers, only 9,972 have been inoculated with booster doses so far. Only Ranchi and East Singhbhum, having an estimated beneficiaries of 57,423 and 45,200 respectively, have the highest overall cumulative coverage of 3%. Palamu, Deoghar and Dhanbad have 2% coverage, and 12 districts jabbed 1% of their targets. Among the five laggard districts, out of 20,549 eligible people, Chatra vaxxed 79 people, Koderma 44 out of 14,113, Pakur 47 out of 17,742, Sahibganj 25 out of 22,671 and Simdega 42 out of 11,814 — putting their cumulative coverage at zero per cent. According to health department officials in Ranchi, the overall slow rate of booster dose coverage is probably due to the ongoing phase of viral diseases due to weather vagaries. “Due to the abrupt change in weather and extreme cold conditions, majority are suffering from cough, cold even if it is not effectively Covid-19 infection. Since the elderly people are more vulnerable to weather vagaries, this could probably be the reason behind the slow rate of coverage,” said Dr Rakesh Dayal, state vaccination officer. Specially talking about districts with zero per cent coverage, he said, “The elderly people must be primarily at wait and watch mode in those districts.” Agreed an official of Chatra district health department stating that in rural hinterlands, there is always lot of hesitancy for any kind of vaccination. “Even as we did and are continuing to do lots of awareness drives to motivate people to take both doses of vaccine, many are now asking why should they take third dose when the government initially said that two doses will be sufficient. We are now finding it difficult to explain to the elderly people, mostly illiterate in rural areas, why the third dose is required,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/booster-dose-states-strike-rate-2-five-dists-score-0/articleshow/88961561.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Truckers in a letter to the state finance minister highlighted the need for developing a transport hub, a parking for commercial vehicles and a logistic hub.Vice-president of All India Motor Transport Congress (West Zone) Vijay Kalra, said, “Madhya Pradesh has an advantage of central location that allows passage to multiple states, but some hurdles in the tax structure have curtailed the movement of commercial vehicles. Our sector has suggested a series of measures that can help in improving the tax structure and boost commercial movement of vehicles.” Indore is a major trade center with an estimated to and fro movement of over 5,000 vehicles a day, according to associations for truckers. To avoid tax evasion, truckers suggested making GST registration mandatory for all stakeholders.The association said that it should be made mandatory for all stakeholders, including truckers, consigners, brokers and transporters to get registered in GST. It will help in keeping a tab on tax evasion. State president of All India Motor Transport Congress (West Zone), Rakesh Tiwari said, “It is the responsibility of the client to furnish details for e-way bills and transporters should not be made liable for penalty in case of error in details filled in the e-way bill.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/dedicated-policy-for-transport-hubs-will-enhance-revenue/articleshow/88961566.cms||---

The district began to witness surge in Covid-19 infection from December 25 last year and since than only three deaths were reported due to virus against 13456 new cases. The fatality rate in district in third wave remained at 0.022% till Sunday night, showed bulletin record.In initial period last year in second wave, the district reported 90 deaths for 24,865 infections were reported from February 26 to April 14 at a fatality rate of 0.36%, showed analysis of daily bulletin.Last year Covid-19 fatality numbers however didn’t correspond to ground reality.Respiratory medicine HoD MGM Dr Salil Bhargava told TOI, “In any disease rise in infections lead to simultaneous increase in severe cases, hospitalisation numbers leading to fatalities. It remained true till prevailed in pandemic.”“For now, however, we are unable to know the exact cause breaking to this general trend in this third wave of pandemic. The evidence is not such to conclude anything from it”, said Dr Bhargava.“Whatever we are seeing, very a smaller number of patients are coming with lung involvement this time in comparison to last year. So, it might be a reason of less deaths of pandemic virus infected persons so far”, said Dr Bhargava.“Because of mix trends in disease for now and limitations to know whether we are fighting double waves of delta and omicron together for now in country”, said Dr Bhargava.“Very less samples are tested for genome sequencing to know about variant causing infection for now. The situation however will get clear only after another two weeks into this third week when trends will stabilise to say anything concrete”, added Dr Bhargava.On fatality rate of only 0.022% in district MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, “This trend is very much like that reported in third wave in USA and England. USA reported 0.003% fatality rate in third wave and countries like England, SA had less than seven percent hospitalisation.”“We have just entered into third wave. In case this trend continues, we could have very less severity rate because of better Covid-19 vaccination programme that help in cutting down severity”, added Dr Dixit.The district so far inoculated 62.59 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines including 33.14 as first dose. Around 29.15 lakh 18+ persons had taken both their doses to complete full immunisation against target of 28.88 lakh and around 1.50 lakh kids aged 15-17 had already taken their first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/big-relief-deaths-94-less-than-2nd-wave/articleshow/88961582.cms||Antriksh Singh

Baghel, who is a senior observer for Congress in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, was out campaigning door to door in Noida’s Sector 113 for a party candidate on Sunday when an FIR was registered against him for allegedly flouting Covid norms. The protocol allows only five persons to accompany the campaigner but, according to the FIR, Baghel had a larger group. On Monday, Baghel said: “Why was the FIR lodged only against me when I was there with several other candidates, 15-20 security personnel, district committee presidents and about 30-40 journalists and cops from UP police? Secondly, people are coming and meeting me, how am I supposed to carry out the campaigning? The Election Commission should come and explain how the campaigning should be done and we’ll follow that.” Why were BJP people not booked in Amroha, says BaghelWhy were BJP people not booked in Amroha or the ministers who have been campaigning door-to-door over the past five days?" the Chhattisgarh CM asked, adding that the Election Commission should be fair and transparent. "What can be expected of them in the end when they are not being fair at the very beginning itself," he remarked. Baghel participated in a door-to-door campaign on Monday in Gautam Buddha Nagar district of UP. The first phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh is on February 10 and the last on March 7. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/why-only-me-asks-baghel-after-covid-fir-in-noida/articleshow/88961594.cms||---
---||Mysuru||Mysuru’s Trin Trin set for an upgrade, to get battery power||MYSURU: The country’s first Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) system Trin Trin, that was inaugurated in June 2017, is all set for a major upgradation and modernisation. The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) and the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) are all set to use technology including the Internet of Things (IoT) to give further push to Trin Trin which is now one of the major attractions of Mysuru tourism. The PBS modernization proposal includes upgradation from conventional bicycles to battery-powered pedal-assist bicycles, the shift from beam style dock to the dock-less system, and introduction of IoT-based integrated lock system. As per the revamping and modernizing the PBS proposal, it has been planned to increase the number of bicycles to 1,000 besides increasing cycle hubs to 100. The idea behind this exercise is taping the tourism potential of the city, bringing down operational cost, wider coverage area, ease of accessibility with fully automatic system, etc. As per the proposal, PBS modernization will make way for three distinct technological interventions in the current system. These include upgradation from conventional bicycles to pedal-assist bicycles to reduce stress and impact on the rider’s knees and thighs on account of pedaling on the undulating terrain of the city. Health trip users or any other users can choose to pedal just like normal bicycles, whenever they desire. The MCC has proposed battery-powered pedal assist bicycles. The proposed shift from beam style dock to a dock-less system will make the system more flexible. The IoT-based integrated lock in the bicycle not only makes the bicycle independent from any fixed infrastructure like beam or bollard but also efficient and effective in terms of ease of operation, robust nature of the system, and low maintenance cost. MCC has invited national competitive bidding for this purpose. 1,000 pedal-assisted electric bicyclesV Manjula, commissioner, DULT, said this exercise has been taken up to further extend the network and connect more places and add more cycles. Trin Trin currently has 15,000 registered users and its usage increased from 1.4 rides per cycle per day in 2017 to 2.2 in 2019. Post Covid lockdown, the usage trend is gradually increasing, but is yet to reach pre-Covid levels. Trin Trin is based on docking technology. Now, app-based dock-less technology is available. The new upgraded Trin Trin would be dockless and would have pedal-assisted electric bicycles, she said. 1,200 rides being recorded every day  Amid an increase in the Covid-19 cases, the number of rides continues to be good. According to Trin Trin manager Asha Kerakatty, Trin Trin is recording an average of 1,000 to 1,200 rides every day now. “On weekends, the service is not available due to the weekend curfew,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mysurus-trin-trin-set-for-an-upgrade-to-get-battery-power/articleshow/88961596.cms||Shrinivasa M

---||Jaipur||Uphill task before Ravikant as Raj industries secretary||Jaipur: T Ravikant has taken over the charge of the industries department at a time when several crucial projects await key decisions to expedite industrialisation in Rajasthan. The state government is yet to set up a joint venture company with the central agency to start work on DMIC projects while other states sharing the industrial corridor have marched ahead. Speaking to TOI, a senior official in charge of DMIC projects in Rajasthan said, “A joint venture company will be formed soon. Most of the ground work between the Centre and the state has been done.”Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) with National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC) under which DMIC projects are implemented will allow Rajasthan to get equity money to develop trunk infrastructure like roads, drains, pipelines and connectivity to the dedicated freight corridor can be undertaken. The SPVs for both Khushkhera-Bhiwadi-Neemrana Investment Region (KBNIR) and Jodhpur-Pali-Marwar Industrial Area (JPMIA) have been pending for a long time.Again, the Petroleum, Chemical, Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) at Pachpadra has still not been notified by the Centre without which crucial infrastructure like railways, highways and logistics cannot be developed. The investment region is being developed over 422 hectares and expected to attract $2 billion. Third, RIICO has set up several new industrial areas and targets to open 100 more. Without a sizeable number of projects in them, developing infrastructure providing all facilities and running them without problems and financial burden won’t be possible. “The challenge is not opening new industrial areas. But the real difficulty is how you can provide all the facilities when you have 5 projects in an area that has capacity for 100. Industrial areas take decades to fill the spaces,” said a RIICO employee.Similarly, the focus of this government has been on auctioning land, which may be a transparent model but cannot be an effective one for attracting investments. “The focus has to shift from selling smaller plots in RIICO industrial areas to attracting large industries, which have bypassed the state in the past 3-4 years. If big companies come, smaller ones will tail along,” said the employee.A lot will depend on how Ravikant approaches the whole strategy while also factoring in the current cost of doing business in Rajasthan, which is among the highest in the country, compared to several states in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/uphill-task-before-ravikant-as-raj-industries-secretary/articleshow/88961620.cms||---

Currently, 1.6% of the active cases are admitted while the remaining 98.4% are under home isolation. In all, 333 patients are admitted in 32 hospitals compared to 151 patients 10 days ago. Despite marginal rise in admissions, the cause of concern is the escalating ICU admissions. Around 10 days ago, only 50 Covid patients were undergoing treatment in ICUs, but the number has now been increased to 122. Around 37% of the patients require high oxygen flow or intense care for the severity of the disease. Admissions in wards have increased by 59% while the admissions in ICUs have increased by 144% in the past 10 days. A health department official said, “Since more than 98% patients are undergoing treatment under home isolation, we have strengthened our facilities for supplying medicines at the doorstep through bike ambulances. Also, patients under home isolation can call 181 helpline to get in touch with doctors for medical advice.” Currently, while the number of beds available for Covid treatment is 3,663, occupancy is just 333, which is around 4%. Oxygen beds available in hospitals for such patients are 2,270 but only 50 are occupied.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/out-of-3-6k-covid-beds-in-city-hospitals-333-are-occupied/articleshow/88961626.cms||---

With the escalating illegal activities in Churu, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner, involving criminals from Haryana and Punjab, the dossier will help in improving the inter-district coordination in nabbing such criminals. The dossier will not only include criminal details involved in inter-state crime, but will also have information about local criminals supporting them by providing safe passage for narcotics and arms smuggling in the state and further to Gujarat. Alarmed over the rising narcotics and arms smuggling cases, IG Prafful Kumar, Bikaner range, covering Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bikaner and Churu, told TOI on Monday, “As police, we should be aware of the criminals involved in narcotics and arms smuggling. To be ahead of the criminals, a dossier with detailed criminal information will be beneficial. Thus, I have asked all four districts to do it.” “We want to identify the various narcotics and arms smuggling gangs operating in Rajasthan via our range from Haryana and Punjab. Smuggling of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) is also rampant in the region, thus the dossier will enable us to crack these cases too,” Kumar added. The team will also include a list of locals that facilitate the gangs of Haryana and Punjab in these border districts. “Local people are given money to facilitate the gangs in smuggling arms, IMFL and narcotics in the state. Thus, we have to tighten the noose and identify them,” he added. Likewise, the police will also prepare a list of criminals who are regularly into robbery, loot and extortion in these districts. The districts including Bikaner and Sriganganagar have already started the work. “We are collecting the information for the dossier and later it will be shared with other districts in the Bikaner range for better coordination,” said a senior Bikaner district police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bikaner-range-cops-to-prepare-dossier-of-inter-state-goons/articleshow/88961627.cms||Ashish Mehta

After getting administrative and financial sanctions, the board has invited bids for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode.RHB commissioner Pawan Arora said, “Eight firms participated in the pre-bid, out of which one qualified for the project. The bid will be opened on January 18. Following this, stone for the project will be laid by the chief minister.”In the budget speech, the state government announced the construction of the club in tune with the Constitution Club of India, New Delhi. Sources said, the club will be built for former and present members of Parliament and members of the state assembly. “The idea was coined after witnessing the club in New Delhi. The committee of RHB on August 19, 2021 visited the Constitution Club to study its concept and details,” said a source.As per the proposal, a six-storey club building with parking in basement has been planned with a height 26.21 metres. It has been proposed to use Jaipur pattern stone chattari, baradari, jali and kangooras in elevation to give the club a heritage look. The club will have several facilities including swimming pool, multi-purpose hall, courts for badminton, lawn tennis and squash, theatre, gym, IT room, sky lounge basement parking etc.For the same, the board has earmarked land measuring 4,948.92 sqm at Vidhayak Nagar (east) facing the state assembly building. An official said, “Conceptual planning of the club was done, and presentation was held on November 2, 2021 before the sub-committee of ministers under the chairmanship of speaker of Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha. Planning was approved for execution of the work.” RHB is already constructing 160 multi-storey flats for MLAs at Vidhayak Nagar (West).

The civic body will mention the list of approved projects in every zone. Moreover, it will display a list of illegal and sealed apartments on its website. The decision was taken in the wake of increased illegal projects on small plots in many outer colonies of the city including Jagatpura, Prithvi Raj Nagar and others. An official said, “For the last one-and-a-half years, the JDA has banned construction of flats on smaller plots. However, many were carrying out construction after installing board on which JDA approved was written. To save people from getting duped, the list of approved flats will be uploaded.” According to JDA records, in the past two years, 84 illegal buildings were sealed. “With a spurt in population and increase in illegal flats, we have taken strict decisions to curb the practice,” said an official. Recently, after blacklisting many illegally developed colonies, the JDA also uploaded the list on its website. Out of 16 JDA zones, these illegal colonies had mushroomed in 10 zones in the past 14 months. A senior JDA official said, “Our agenda is to act against the mafias who are using agricultural land for non-agricultural and commercial purpose after illegally developing a colony. We have taken strict decisions to curb the practice,” he said. The JDA has also initiated action to strip the ownership of the land owners who have illegally developed colonies on agriculture land. Zone commissioners have also written to tehsildars and sub-division officers for the same. An official said, “To discourage such practices in future, proceedings for cancelling ownership have been implemented under Section 175 of Rajasthan Tenancy Act against land holders.” The JDA in a recent meeting also reviewed the status of colonies of private developers who did not develop facilities after getting colonies approved from the civic body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/to-protect-buyers-jda-will-list-illegal-flats-on-website/articleshow/88961630.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan women panel without chief for 3 years even as crimes rise||JAIPUR: Even though Rajasthan has earned a bad name for ever rising crimes against women and children, important statutory body like the state women commission remains without a chief for more than three years. Activists and women organisations have been demanding an appointment for the last three years, but the Gehlot government has so far failed to find a chairperson and members. Times ViewDespite a high court order, the state government is neglecting statutory bodies. Out of the10 statutory commissions, only three have a chairman though the court in an order had asked the government to make the appointments promptly. Previous governments, too, had made such appointments only after the court intervened. These bodies are meant for good governance and provide a platform for target groups to redress their grievances. Instead of ignoring them, these legal bodies should be nurtured.In an earlier order, the high court had taken suo motu cognizance on the issue and said these statutory bodies are an integral part of good governance and needed to be filled up on time. The last commission chairperson Suman Sharma's term came to an end on October 19, 2018 and the body remained headless since. Sharma, who was appointed as chairperson of the commission during the last BJP government, alleged that “There is no better example of lack of sensitivity on the part of the government towards burning issues of crimes against women than absence of the statutory body to deal with women issues.” She said the heinous crimes against women are on the rise in the state but the government’s neglect is baffling. “During CM Ashok Gehlot’s first tenure (1998-2003), the women commission came in to being in the state. He used to have respect for such statutory bodies. But the inordinate delay in the appointment to such an important statutory body is quite perplexing in his current tenure,” said Prof Lad Kumari Jain, former chairperson of the commission. Jain said the commission used to provide an important forum for women to express their grievances and district-level hearings were used to be held. “These mechanisms which ensure accountability are undermined like this is shameful to democracy. Three years have gone past and no appointments. When the political message is like this, why will the bureaucrats respect these organizations, said Kavita Srivastav, state PUCL president.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-women-panel-without-chief-for-3-years-even-as-crimes-rise/articleshow/88961631.cms||---

Consider the monthly rent of a 3,000 square yard land on MI Road and a 22-room hotel near the government hostel in Jaipur. The rent here is well below one’s expectations, less than Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000, respectively. This is the fate of most of the properties listed under the Rajasthan Board of Muslim Waqf (RBMW) across the state.The non-implementation of new rent policy, unchecked encroachments and un-listing of its properties in the revenue board has made RBMW dependent on state government’s aid and donations for the release of salaries of its 50 employees.Reports say that RBMW has listed over 18,000 properties across the state, making it the richest body/board in terms of land. “The rental income is generated from over 7,000 properties, 95% of it goes into the hands of the local committees, legal cases and other developmental works leaving the Waqf board with no corpus fund,” said an officer posted at RBMW. Jaipur alone has 2,500 properties including 400 shops, but they could generate rent as low as Rs 300 and Rs 15,000 per month depending upon the size. The new rent policy introduced in 2010 is yet to be implemented and can change the face of RBMW from being a modest board to one of the richest boards in the state.RBMW members and MLA from Adarsh Nagar Rafeek Khan told TOI that he has identified over 100 properties that could generate rent of Rs 1 crore annually. “Over 100 crores could be earned by just 100 properties in the state. The excess sum can be used for development projects like hostels, commercial properties and community halls,” said Khan.Mass encroachment has been a major problem. The CEO of RBMW, Aqueel Khan said that almost every day they receive one complaint of encroachment on the properties—structures and land. “The RBMW doesn’t have the power to take action for the same. Almost every second day I write to collectors and SPs of the respective districts to take action against encroachers, implement court orders, free properties from encroachers and conduct a survey of the properties,” said Khan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/land-rich-waqf-board-eyes-govt-aid-donations-to-pay-salaries/articleshow/88961633.cms||---

During a high-level meeting chaired by the CM on Sunday, it was decided to hand over the minor girl’s investigation to the CBI. The decision was taken following BJP's threat of an agitation seeking a CBI probe after the state police expressed doubt on the chances of rape. Meanwhile the national commission for scheduled castes (NCSC) has issued notice to the Rajasthan government seeking an action taken report. Unsatisfied over Alwar police’s comment of ‘not a rape incident’ and the alleged delay in investigation, the commission sent notices to the chief secretary, DG police, the Alwar district collector and the SP. In a media release issued on Monday, the commission said it has asked the authorities to ensure justice to the victim. They have been asked to investigate the matter and to submit an immediate report through post or email, based on the facts and information on the action taken on the allegations in the matter. A 15-year old girl, who sustained critical injuries in her private parts, was found bleeding near a flyover in Alwar on January 11. The incident sparked a major political uproar from day one. Earlier, the state government had ordered a high-level investigation in the case but the opposition was not satisfied.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/need-centres-nod-for-cbi-probe-into-alwar-girls-case-home-dept/articleshow/88961638.cms||---

According to Khetri police, the girl’s mother approached them on Sunday evening with a complaint against the boy, following which an FIR under appropriate sections of the POCSO Act was lodged. “The girl’s mother said four days ago, the teen boy was asked to look after the girl in a room of the house. While the woman was engaged in some work in another room, she heard her little daughter crying. When she went there, she found the accused watching porn on his father’s mobile phone and forcing her daughter for oral sex,” said Khetri SHO Vinod Sankhla. Police added as the boy is a relative, the girl’s family was initially reluctant in lodging the FIR, but they finally went ahead. “Soon after receiving the complaint on Sunday, we took the girl for medical examination. Since she is a toddler, her mother’s statements would be sufficient. Also the mobile phone on which he watched porn has been seized. He also indulged in oral sex with the victim,” said Sankhla. Police added that a case under Section 3/4 of POCSO Act has been lodged.

My relatives and family members were pressuring me to leave active politics,” Savani told TOI. “I am not going to be in active politics. I need to focus on family and social work,” said Savani, who also runs schools and a private university.

---||Surat||Surat: Bring in discarded manja, get tasty ‘khaman’ free||SURAT: While almost everyone looks forward to Uttarayan for indulging in kite-flying fun, there are many who are pained by the injuries caused to the birds during the festival. Chetan Patel, a snack seller, falls in the latter category. And he has come up with a unique idea to save the birds from the killer manja: Exchange the discarded thread for free ‘khaman’. Every year the flight of hundreds of birds is cut short by the sharp manja. Even after the Uttrayan festival, birds are seen getting tangled or injured by manja hanging from trees and buildings. To encourage people to remove these manja, Patel offers an incentive. Patel, the 37-year-old owner of a ‘namkeen’ shop in Vesu area of the city, is offering 1kg of free ‘khaman’ for equal quantities of discarded manja.  “This year I saw an injured bird tangled in manja that was hanging from a street light pole. That’s when I decided to encourage people to remove such hanging manja after the end of festivities. Through my social media account I posted an offer about exchanging 500g of manja for equal quantity of ‘khaman’. The other offer was of 1kg of manja in exchange of 1kg of ‘khaman’ or one cheese roll along with ‘locho’,” Patel said. Though ‘khaman’ is priced around Rs 100 per kilogram, Patel doesn’t mind bearing the loss. “If my offer can save the life of a bird or a human, I don’t mind paying the price. Since announcing the offer I have received around 5kg of manja. People who came to deposit discarded manja praise my efforts. After receiving such a positive response, I have decided to announce a much bigger scheme next year,” Patel added. In the past too, Patel has done his bit for bird rescues. “Being busy in my shop, I’m not able to participate in the birds’ rescue operations. For the last four years I’ve given free meals to around 70 bird rescuers of an NGO during the Uttarayan period,” Patel said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/bring-in-discarded-manja-get-tasty-khaman-free/articleshow/88961646.cms||---

However, he said measures would be taken to expedite the work to minimise inconvenience to the public.Bhandary said Union minister Nithin Gadkari has stated that India holds the world record for fastest road construction and pointed out that in 2006, for the Shravanabelagola Mahamastakabhisheka, 100km of road work was done in just 90 days, wondering what prevented the authorities from completing 10km of road work in a shorter span.Bhandary said Shiradi Ghat road is the lifeline of coastal Karnataka with business establishments and major industries of this region like MRPL, MCF along with New Mangalore Port entirely dependent on the ghat stretch for their functioning. He said the proposed closure of Shiradi Ghat road for six months will cause huge inconvenience to people of all sections and majorly hinder the trade and industrial activities of this region. He recalled that earlier when Shiradi Ghat road was closed for six months twice, it had caused great inconvenience. To avoid this again, he has requested the CM to direct the officials concerned to complete the road work at the earliest. To achieve this, Bhandary suggested planning work strategies methodically with help of experts, using modern machinery, technologies and materials to construct the road, start the work at multiple points simultaneously and also make adequate arrangements for materials and workforce.Even stakeholders, including truck owners’ association and the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed concern over the complete closure of Shiradi Ghat for six months. They have told DC K V Rajendra that ghat closure for six months as part of the repair works will cripple the transport sector and urged the authorities to implement a working model and permit the movement of vehicles one-way. The other option entails travel via Uttara Kannada-Hubballi, which is a 200km detour to Bengaluru.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/expedite-work-on-shiradi-ghat-road-mlc-urges-cm/articleshow/88961652.cms||---

We have started drawing water from the well, to irrigate gardens on the traffic islands, median on the eastern side, and Hampankatta Junction. Similarly, plants on the western side till Clock Tower Circle, are also being irrigated by using the water from the well,” Shetty said. In addition to Hampankatta, the city corporation and MSCL have also found many old wells while digging up roads for widening and development of the circle. “The development of Rashtrakavi M Govinda Pai Circle will be taken up, by giving emphasis to the preservation of old well found at the junction. A British-era well found at Leewell in 2019 and another old well found in Dongerkery, will also be preserved. Water from all these old wells will be used to irrigate plants in parks, traffic islands, landscapes in lung spaces, and road medians in future. This will help the city corporation to reduce the use of drinking water for irrigation of plants,” the mayor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/water-from-old-wells-in-city-to-be-used-for-gardens/articleshow/88961653.cms||Vinobha K T

The bungalow reflects Mangaluru architecture — a traditional house with a spacious portico, topped with Mangaluru tiles. An engineer from the ports and fisheries department said that renovation of this house was done at an approximate Rs 30 lakh after the project got approval from chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. It is learnt the bungalow is over 100 years old and until recently it was the designated port officer’s residence. The renovation works that have been taken up include, building a false ceiling, painting, development of a garden and parking area as well as the purchase of furniture, he said. After inaugurating his new office on Monday, Angara told reporters that henceforth, he would be available at this office every Monday. Fishermen from Talapady to Karwar can reach out to him at this office. He will also be visiting Udupi and Karwar to redress the grievances of the fishermen. As many as 28 new proposals related to the fisheries department and 98 new proposals connected to the development of ports have been submitted to the Central government. These projects will help in the development of the coastal areas. The Central and the state government are committed to the development and will respond to the needs and concerns of the people. However, public support is also essential, the minister said. “This office has been set up to give an identity to the department of fisheries, ports and inland water transport. It was a British era bungalow that was in dilapidated condition and has been given a facelift, after bringing it to the notice of the chief minister,” Angara said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/british-era-bungalow-is-fisheries-ministers-new-office/articleshow/88961654.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||DC: Situation in DK schools will be monitored for a week||Mangaluru: In the wake of a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the state, Dakshina Kannada district administration has decided to keep a close watch on the situation at schools for a week, instead of instructing them to close, as has been the case in most of the districts.Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra, who chaired a meeting of stakeholders from the education sector on Monday, told TOI, “All block education officers (BEOs), and representatives of private schools are of the opinion that the present situation vis-à-vis Covid-19 is not alarming. Only a few students, and three teachers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and all of them are displaying no symptoms of the infection. Neither the BEOs not taluk health officers are in favour of an en masse closure of schools. So, we have decided to monitor the situation for another week. Schools that report three or more cases of Covid will be asked to suspend on-campus classes for a week or ten days. In the case of a particular institution turning into the centre for a cluster case, the THO, BEO and tahsildars have been empowered to recommend its closure.”Schools have been asked to convene a meeting between parents and teachers, and to collect their opinion on keeping the institutions open. “In case parents are apprehensive about sending their children to schools, they must ensure that online classes are held. Children must not be forced to attend on-campus classes. Some private colleges have decided to hold online classes, which we are encouraging,” Rajendra said.Dakshina Kannada district health officer Dr Kishore Kumar M said children in the six-15 age group accounted for only 225 of the district’s active caseload. “Around 25 children aged under five have been infected with Covid. However, these cases were not reported at schools,” Dr Kishore Kumar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dc-situation-in-dk-schools-will-be-monitored-for-a-week/articleshow/88961655.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The court was hearing a matter related to its November 15, 2021 order which said that to ensure the usability of the footpaths, SDMC engineers will traverse the entire colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair unaided. TimesViewAnyone living in the city knows that most streets and pavements are not wheelchair friendly. In fact, little effort has been made in this direction. Hopefully with the high court taking up the matter, concerned authorities will pay attention to rectifying the issue.The court said every citizen had the right to move around in the area created by the State. Taking note of the exercise being carried out with assistance and not independently as per its orders, Justice Najmi Waziri asked why the SDMC officials were not moving independently on wheelchairs. “When they moved around in wheelchairs, did they find it difficult?” the courtasked the SDMC counsel. When the counsel replied no, the HC asked how that was possible, considering the uneven pavements. The court further asked why ramps outside several houses were not built in accordance with SDMC standards and directed the authorities to remove them. “If wheelchair-bound people have to move like this, then SDMC shall have todepute one official each for every such person in thecolony so that they can move on these footpaths, whichare not properly constructed,” it remarked. The court also asked Delhi Police to ensure that cars are not parked on footpaths. The sub-inspector present in court assured that the police will take the necessary steps in this regard. During the hearing, the Delhi government counsel informed the court that the Public Works Department (PWD) has been regularly watering and washing trees from Modi Mill to the airport on Outer Ring Road and the Vasant Vihar residential area. He said 1,688 out of 1,793 trees in Vasant Vihar havebeen de-concretised andsought two weeks for theremaining trees. The court appreciated the efforts of the authorities, including SDMC, PWD and Delhi Police, in the matter relating to de-concretisation of trees and removing cars parked on footpaths. “It is heartening to see that all departments have geared up and much progress has been done,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-pulls-up-s-corpn-over-disability-audit/articleshow/88960535.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi continues to shiver as fog keeps sun at bay||NEW DELHI: The capital continued to shiver on Monday as “cold day” conditions prevailed for the fifth straight day in some areas that saw temperatures plummeting five-six degrees below normal. The weather department has forecast similar weather in isolated places on Tuesday as well. Safdarjung, the city’s base station, recorded a maximum temperature of 16.1 degrees Celsius, four notches below the season’s average, against Sunday’s 17.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum was recorded at 8.7 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal, against 8.1 degrees Celsius a day earlier. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), a “cold day” is when the minimum temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is at least 4.5 degrees Celsius below normal. While Safdarjung, Palam and Ayanagar were spared, cold day conditions prevailed at Lodhi Road, Ridge, Narela, Jafarpur and Mayur Vihar, said IMD. At Narela, the maximum temperature was 13.6 degrees Celsius, six notches below normal while the minimum temperature was 4.5 degrees Celsius. Jafarpur saw a maximum of 13.2 degrees Celsius (7 notches below normal) while the minimum temperature was 6.9 degrees Celsius. At Lodhi Road, the maximum temperature settled at 16 degrees Celsius, five notches below normal. At the Ridge, the maximum temperature was 15.2 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s average, while the minimum temperature was 6.1 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. Mayur Vihar’s maximum and minimum temperatures were 14.2 degrees Celsius (six notches below normal) and 8.9 degrees Celsius. The city also got some respite as both Safdarjung and Palam experienced shallow fog. The minimum and maximum temperature on Tuesday could hover around 10 degrees Celsius and 18 degrees Celsius, with the possibility of a “cold day” again in isolated areas and moderate fog. Weather experts said cold-day conditions are being witnessed in a very large area due to low clouds and fog blocking the sun. “Even if some isolated areas do receive sunlight, it is still suppressed as the cold-day phenomenon is happening on a very large scale. Though we expect some improvement from Tuesday, these conditions are likely to continue in some areas. Therefore, we extended the forecast for a day,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. Meanwhile, the city’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 327, slipping to the ‘very poor’ category from Sunday’s ‘poor’, when it was recorded at 264. SAFAR said air quality could improve but will likely remain ‘very poor’. “The maximum temperature and wind speed are likely to increase gradually for the next three days, i.e., January 18, 19 and 20, enhancing ventilation of pollutants and leading to improvement in air quality, but within the ‘very poor’ category. High wind speed is likely from January 21, resulting in dilution of pollutants and improvement of AQI,” SAFAR said in a statement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/city-continues-to-shiver-as-fog-keeps-sun-at-bay/articleshow/88960482.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Mangrove cover increases by 2.6sqkm in Karnataka||Mangaluru: While there has been a net increase of 17 sq km in the mangrove cover of the country compared to 2019 assessment report of Forest Survey of India (FSI), Karnataka stands third in the country after Odisha and Maharashtra in gains. While Odisha gained 8 sq km and Maharashtra (4 sq km), Karnataka’s gain was 2.57 sq km. Karnataka’s mangroves in the three coastal districts account for 12.61 sq kms and represent 0.26% of country’s mangroves. West Bengal has the highest accounting for 42.33% at 2,114 sq km and Gujarat at 23.94% having mangroves of 1175 sq km. Third in the list is the Andaman and Nicobar Islands accounting 12.34% covering 616 sq kms. What is significant for Karnataka is that, despite the low percentage of mangroves cover, the regeneration percentage is high. Forest Survey of India assesses the forest cover mapping of the country on a two-year cycle using satellite data. The main objective is presentation of the information on forest resources of the country at state and district level. Of the 12.61 sq km, the largest tract is in Uttara Kannada at 10.47 sq kms, followed by Udupi at 1.69 sq km and Dakshina Kannada at 0.45 sq km. Interestingly, Udupi has the largest tract of moderately dense mangrove at 1.54 sq km and Uttara Kannada has 10.19 sq kms of open mangroves, the highest among the three districts. Dakshina Kannada has 0.09 sq km of very dense mangroves and the other two districts have none. The current assessment by FSI shows Mangrove cover in the country is 4,992 sq km, which is 0.15 % of the country’s total geographical area. Very dense mangrove comprises 1,475 sq km (29.55 %); moderately dense mangrove is 1,481 sq km (29.67 %) while open mangroves constitute an area of 2,036 sq km (40.78 %). There has been a net increase of 17 sq km in the mangrove cover of the country as compared to 2019 assessment. The change compared to 2019 assessment is positive for all three districts in Karnataka gaining 2.57 sq km, with Uttara Kannada being the largest beneficiary at 1.97 sq km followed by Dakshina Kannada (0.45 sq km) and Udupi at 0.15 sq km. Among the southern states, Goa has the highest mangrove cover at 27.34 sq kms but the regeneration in two years is 1.34 sq km. Kerala has the least mangrove cover at 9.36 sq kms and the assessment change in two years is 0.46 sq km. The state of Forest Report has attributed the increase in mangrove cover mainly due to natural regeneration. Mangroves are important refuges of coastal biodiversity and act as bio-shields against extreme climatic events. Large populations, primarily rural, depend on Mangrove ecosystems for a wide variety of biomass dependent livelihoods.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mangrove-cover-increases-by-2-6sqkm-in-karnataka/articleshow/88961657.cms||Stanley Pinto

The passengers’ associations have vowed to fight against any change. However, they fear that the decision may already have been taken given that other trains have been allotted the time slot which was earlier for the Godavari Express.The Railways has been saying that the express train has poor occupancy between Nashik and Mumbai. The passengers refute this claim. “The Railways considers occupancy by way of reservations, while people prefer to hop on the train with current tickets. If the train, which has been discontinued since March 2020 when lockdown began, is run as a ‘special train’ even today, the occupancy reflected would be in line with the Railways expectations,” said Gurmeet Rawal, the divisional railway users’ coordination committee member and the president of city-based Rail Parishad NX.Nashik MP Hemant Godse has said he would not allow the extension of trains. “We won’t allow extension of trains. However, in the present case, I will see what the demand is and take steps accordingly,” Godse said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-passengers-against-godavari-express-extension/articleshow/88961658.cms||---

The government veterinary hospital at Ashok Stambh got 13 injured birds between January 13 and January 16. Senior veterinary doctor Sachin Vende said that most of the birds injured were pigeons. They also got four eagles, owls and Ibis birds. He added that the number of injured birds coming to the hospital was lesser this year compared to the previous years. Last year, around the same time they had 20 injured birds that were brought for treatment.This year, police commissioner Deepak Pandey came out with orders of strict action against people, who were found manufacturing, selling, stocking or using nylon manja, Chinese manja and even the other manja with glass powder coating on it. Owing to the strict instructions from Pandey, this year, the police raided a number of shops and confiscated nylon manja worth more than Rs 60,000. Three people, who were found selling nylon manja, have also been arrested from the city and the district till January 30. On this backdrop, there was subdued kite flying activity in the city this year compared to the previous years. This left lesser manja on trees and overhead wires too. This ensured that fewer birds got entangled in it.The fire brigade departments in Nashik Road, Panchavati, Satpur, Cidco and the head office at Shingada Talav also got many calls of entangled birds on trees. Birds that were not injured were simply rescued and released. Some birds were handed over to the Pakshi Mitras (groups of friends of birds), who take care of birds and release them after checking that they have no injury.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/13-birds-hurt-by-manja-brought-for-treatment/articleshow/88961661.cms||---

The residents had claimed that they had taken their jabs in Dhule — 55 km away — instead of in Malegaon. The officer added that the police have sought information from the DMC on vaccination sessions held on October 28, December 4 and 6 — when the alleged ‘fake’ sessions were held for the distribution of the certificates.Two people had allegedly created the sessions and the two senior DMC officers provided them access by sharing passwords and allowing them to create the sessions through which the certificates were generated.“We believe the dates of vaccine doses (first and second) have been manipulated. Therefore, we are aiming to bring the fact to the fore that there was no vaccination at all. For this, we have sought vaccination data for these dates. This will help us figure out the plot,” said the officer.The officer said the local court has extended the police custody of the four arrested individuals till January 19 after they were produced in the court on Monday following the culmination of the previous police remand orders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/police-to-summon-fake-vaccine-certificate-buyers/articleshow/88961662.cms||---

Once the 100-bed hospital gets the additional staff, RAT tests can be conducted on every patient arriving in the hospital for admission. The Regional Referral Hospital has patients with heart and kidney conditions, cancer etc coming for treatment from across the districts and various parts of north Maharashtra. Recently, four heart patients admitted to the hospital were found Covid positive, which led to the spread among two doctors and other health workers. Subsequently, senior officials of the hospital including medical superintendent Pralhad Ghute, medical officer Sanjay Kute met P B Gandal, the deputy director of the state health department for the additional workforce to conduct the RAT on patients. Gandal told TOI the process of giving additional lab technicians has been finalized and the hospital could soon be in the position to conduct RAT of patients arriving in the hospital. As of now, patients who do not arrive with a Covid negative report and the full vaccination certificate are accommodated in an isolation room where they are told to get the Covid test done.

This is something that people should think about protecting themselves. The administration will also have to take measures to curb the growth,” Mandhare said. The data provided by the civil hospital for Covid cases in the district showed that out of the total 10,982 positive cases, 9,971 (90.8%) were asymptomatic and 10,112 (92%) were under home isolation. As many as 870 (8%) are admitted to the hospital of which 117 required medical support and only 12 required ventilators.“The health administration is ready to take up all the challenges as it was during the second wave of the infection. But there is some limit to it and people also should take up responsibilities to cut down on the rise in infection,” the officer said. The administration is also closely monitoring the bed occupancy in the district and the moment it appears that the situation was growing bad, serious measures would be taken. “Rise in hospitalization and number of deaths will be the deciding factor of the measures that need to be taken. Since nobody knows how the virus behaves, people should not take the infection lightly and take precaution and medication (as applicable) to ensure one remains healthy or recovers quickly,” Mandhare said.“If there was acute growth in hospitalization, the administration would be forced to take serious measures that will only help in curbing the growth of cases— as in the past,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-admin-concerned-about-rising-covid-cases/articleshow/88961667.cms||---

Senior traffic officials attributed the rise in road accidents and fatalities to the Covid restrictions, which were stricter in 2020 as compared to those enforced last year during the second wave.Assistant commissioner of police Sitaram Gaikwad said the maximum number of people killed in road accidents were those riding on two-wheelers. Of the 470 road accidents, 116 two-wheelers were involved in the fatal accidents last year. Among these accidents, 124 people riding two-wheelers died in the accident. Of them, 111 people were not wearing helmets, following which the police are making efforts to ensure two-wheeler riders wear a helmet. Senior officials said rash driving was the main cause of accidents. A large number of motorists indulge in rash driving and also break other traffic rules like not stopping at signals, driving on the wrong side of the road, leaving vehicles parked on blind spots or halting vehicles on the highways without putting on the tail lamps. Meanwhile, in 2021 the road accidents also left 52 pedestrians dead and 79 others injured. Among others killed in road accidents were also three people riding bicycles. Most of the pedestrians get killed while crossing the highways or other major roads passing through the city. The speed of vehicles is too high on the highways due to which pedestrians get killed.The police also raise traffic awareness among residents of the city. However, chaotic conditions on the road continue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-city-185-people-killed-in-470-road-accidents-in-2021/articleshow/88961669.cms||---

Like the previous year, this year too only those who are fully vaccinated and adhering to Covid-19 protocols are being allowed to camp for the ‘kalpwas’.Though not a very large number of kalpwasis have turned up this time compared to earlier Melas owing to Covid-19 and strict vigil of the authorities, many have braved intense cold and pandemic to spend the entire month, which would end on February 16 on the occasion of Maghi Purnima, on the Mela campus. Along with large number of seers and thousands of kalpwasis, around 3 lakh devotees took the holy dip on the occasion of Paush Purnima, the second important day of bathing in the river Ganga and Sangam. “Although the trickle of devotees arriving in the Mela area was thin during the wee hours of Monday, predominantly because of the chilly conditions, as the bright sunshine dominated the blue sky resulting into increase in temperature, a heavy influx of devotees was witnessed. By 11 am, 1.25 lakh devotees had taken the holy dip and by 4pm, the figure had increased to 3 lakhs,” said Mela adhikari, Shesh Mani Pandey. “We have made elaborative arrangements for the kalpwasis and all the devotees with focus on adherence on Covid-19 protocol and maintaining cleanliness in the Mela area,” he added. The arrival of kalpavasis in the Mela area continued for Saturday and even Sunday. Almost all of them are associated with a seer and stay in the camps arranged by their ‘gurus’. Although some seers and kalpwasis complaint of incomplete work, including facilities like water tap, electricity, toilets and tin-sheds in sector 5A, for a major chunk of kalpwasis, it was devotion and religious belief which overshadowed the threat of coronavirus, extreme cold conditions or amenities provided by administration. From Monday onwards, thousands of kalpwasi from different parts of the state and also from other states, started their month-long religious practice of restrained and disciplined life. With the desire to be freed from the shackles of life and death, as it is believed that by practicing kalpawas, the door of heaven opens for the devotees after their demise. Along with spiritual, scientific outlook is also important in kalpawas.“According to religious beliefs, one receives virtuous results in the month of Magha on the bank of Sangam at Tirtharaj Prayag. Taking a bath during kalpawas bears the same fruit as donating crores of cows daily. Therefore, in the month of Paush Purnima, a resolution is taken for bathing and practising kalpawas,” said noted astrologer of Varanasi, Hemant Bhaduri, adding, “Inspired by a feeling of detachment with hard austerity, a kalpwasi attains self-purification.”Bhaduri further explained that there are 21 rules of kalpawas as per Hindu scriptures. These include not telling lies, staying free from household worries, bathing in the Ganga thrice a day, planting a Tulsi plant in the camp, following celibacy, taking food prepared by oneself or wife, attending sermons and sleeping on the ground. Not wearing gold, not consuming sweets or fruits, freedom from worldly worries, restraint on the senses, pind daan of ancestors, following non-violence, renunciation of luxury are also some of the rules that are followed by kalpwasis. “The kalpwas of Magh Mela 2022 would end on February 16 on the occasion of Maghi Purnima,” said Bhaduri. The noted astrologer highlighted another interesting aspect pertaining to kalpwas. “The month-long kalpwas for Dandi Sanyasi and those coming from Mithila region of the country starts from Makar Sankranti itself whereas for others, it began from Monday.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/month-long-kalpwas-begins-in-maghmela-with-paush-purnima-snan/articleshow/88961670.cms||---

At present, the supply has increased between 15,000 and 20,000 quintal a day and the demand for onions from the domestic markets has also increased, which led to the stabilising of the average wholesale onion prices, said the officials.Currently, onions arriving at the markets are late kharif onions and the arrival of fresh late kharif onions is at its peak. The average wholesale onion price was recorded at Rs 2,050 per quintal at Lasalgaon on Monday.The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 800 and 2,391 per quintal, respectively, on Monday at Lasalgaon. Around 16,500 quintal of onions were auctioned on Monday.Unlike summer onions, the late kharif onions have a shelf life of less than a month and the produce gets rotten thereafter. Hence, farmers have no option but to sell their onions at the prevailing market rates.Sometimes this leads to huge arrivals in the markets, leading to a crash in wholesale onion prices. The fresh late kharif onions are expected to continue in the market till next month and the arrivals of new summer crops will begin from March.The shelf life of summer onions is around six months and farmers prefer storing their onions with the hope of getting better prices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/avg-wholesale-price-of-onions-stabilises-in-nashik-apmc/articleshow/88961671.cms||---

He further said that on one hand, both state and central government has failed to create job opportunities for the youths, the multiple incidents of leakages of question papers has aggravated the problem of the unemployed youth. “In 2017 the BJP leadership lured the OBCs with number of promises but have not fulfilled the promises made to them because of which OBCs, that constitute nearly 55-60 percent of the electorate, feel cheated”, said the MP. On the issue of women safety, the veteran leader recollected that in last five years there have been large number of brutal atrocities and rape incidents in most districts of UP and the government did not take necessary action. The government lacked genuine intention to provide a safe and secured environment to the women of UP, he added. In addition to this, the rise in prices of edible oils, petrol, cooking gas has disturbed the household expenditure of poor, claimed Rewati.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/sp-leader-govt-failed-to-create-job-opportunities/articleshow/88961676.cms||---

If the HDMC fails to install the statue by February 19 we are prepared to intensify the agitation. We will not hesitate to hold stones in our hands,” he said.“We have been urging for a Shivaji Maharaj Museum, which was too not addressed by the HDMC. The matter of the statue of Shivaji Maharaj is being used for a political purpose by some people, but we will take the issue to the logical end and the agitation will happen irrespective of political parties, he said.Office-bearers of the Parishad, Raghavendra Kathare, Siddu Raynal, Lata Savant and Neetu Pawar and others, were present in the press conference.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hindu-parishad-sets-deadline-for-shivaji-statue/articleshow/88961683.cms||---

However, the authorities concerned appear to have learnt no lessons from the tragic experience of the first two waves as can be evidenced by the fact that the faulty system at the district hospital has not been fixed.Amid the spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in Haveri, the attention has turned, yet again, towards the faulty low-pressure oxygen supply system at the district hospital. Although the district administration set up a 1,000-litre oxygen plant on the premises of the district hospital, the faulty system has resulted in patients in the intensive care unit not getting the requisite amount of the gas. Lack of maintenance of the looping system is being cited as the cause for the persisting problem in the supply system.During the first and second waves, patients being treated in the ICU, and those who either being supplied oxygen or on ventilator, accounted for most of the fatalities in Haveri. Fear among the people of the problem recurring in the event of an outbreak during the third wave is understandable. Sources said that, a Covid-19 patient having trouble breathing may need anywhere between two to eight litres of oxygen per minute, depending on the severity of the individual’s condition. Failure to maintain the stipulated level of pressure in the supply system could result in the patient not receiving the sufficient amount of oxygen. “But the pressure is not being maintained at the new system at the Haveri district hospital although a 1,000-litre oxygen plant has been set up on its premises,” said a source.A doctor at the hospital said that most of the pipes used in the oxygen supply network had been replaced following allegations of the stipulated pressure not being maintained. “But the problem has not been solved completely, since we are unable to meet the requirement to supply 4.2 litres of oxygen per minute. Only 3.5 litres of oxygen per minute is being supplied. Patients in the ICU and on ventilator, particularly those occupying beds at the end of their respective wards are not being supplied oxygen at the required pressure,” he said.Haveri district surgeon Dr PR Havanur told TOI that he was aware of the problem at the hospital, and had intimated senior officials in the health department about it. “The problem will be fixed soon,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/poor-o2-supply-at-haveri-district-hospital-a-concern/articleshow/88961684.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

As large companies like Reliance, More, Big Bazaar and others forayed into tier-two cities, many local businessmen have suffered as they have failed to compete with them in pricing. These corporations sell groceries, vegetables, stationery and many other items at low prices, as they make purchase in large quantities. To boost business in Belagavi, the chamber of commerce is planning to set up a firm, through which traders can make wholesale purchases. The president of the chamber, Rohan Juvali, has urged traders and owners of small-scale industries to come forward in groups, to move forward with the plan. The traders have to form a group before approaching the chamber, that will act as a transit for purchases. The chamber can either find out the best source for making purchases, or traders can suggest it to them. On the final price for the lot which they are buying, the traders can transfer money to the firm’s account, which will be paid to the seller. The chamber will not be taking any commission for the trade, as its aim is to cut out middlemen in the market, who are cornering a large portion of profits. The chamber will provide a platform for buying vegetables, groceries, plastic items, stationery, sanitary ware, electronic items and others. Juvali said that the same was discussed in the traders committee meeting, and that the plan is in a nascent stage. The traders have to show interest in order for the idea to materialise, he said. He said that due to large companies entering the market, local people will suffer. “These companies have every resources at their disposal. They buy in large quantities from wholesalers, due to which they can sell for low prices. However, local vendors cannot compete in pricing with large corporations, due to purchasing goods at higher prices.” He said, “If the traders from various sectors come together to make this happen, this could revolutionise markets in Belagavi. If this idea becomes successful, then it can serve as a model for other districts.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-bulk-buying-platform-in-works-to-help-small-traders/articleshow/88961685.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Baby vaccine deaths probe shows nurse breach in SOPs||BELAGAVI: An investigation to find out what lapses had led to the death of three children after they were administered measles-rubella vaccines has found out that vials of vaccine were stored in a hotel refrigerator by an auxiliary nurse, who did not put these back in the mandatory cold storage within 12 hours of taking them out. The auxiliary nurse, identified as Salma, is untraceable, while the probe has unearthed several breaks in protocol before the vaccine was given to children in two villages. The nurse, attached to the Salahalli primary health centre, has been suspended. The investigation, headed by reproductive and child health (RCH) officer I P Gadad, has found that Salma took out the carrier of vials from the primary health centre’s cold storage on January 10. On January 11, the vaccines in the carrier were administered to children at Mallapura village. On January 12, more children were given shots from the same carrier of vaccines at Bochagala village. Of the 21 kids jabbed in two villages, three died of septic shock. Two are recovering. After Salma took the vials out on January 10, the vaccines were never put back in the cold storage, which broke the cold chain. The vaccines, if taken out, must be put back in the cold storage within 12 hours. That the vaccines never returned to the cold chain between January 10 ad January 12 was discovered in the health centre registry. Gadad, who spoke to TOI, said that the department came to know that Salma had kept the vials in a hotel freezer at Ramadurga taluk while questioning an Asha worker. The hotel is said to be owned by a close relative of Salma’s. In the refrigerator, the vials may have been contaminated from bacteria present in food and this may have caused infection among the kids. Samples from the vials stored in the hotel refrigerator will be sent to microbiology labs to know what happened to the content. The administration has also suspended a pharmacist working with the PHC for his negligence for failing to summon the vials back to the cold storage. The vaccines should be protected in the storage in a temperature ranging from 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. The storage is also equipped with an alarm system. “If the temperature climbs above 8 or falls below 2, an alert will be sent to a pharmacist to reset the temperature,” Gadad said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/baby-vaccine-deaths-probe-shows-nurse-breach-in-sops/articleshow/88961686.cms||Shreyas HS

Responding to a TOI report published on Jan 17, he said he never met industries minister Murugesh Nirani personally. “I might have just wished him on some functions or at airports. But never discussed politics with him” he added. He added that Murugesh’s younger brother Sangamesh Nirani is his close friend since 1991 and used to discuss about business issues with him. “However, I never spoke to the minister for any reason in my life” he said. He said Congress was in his blood and the party has given him good status since his NSUI days. “I was the youngest president for a district Congress unit. I even sacrificed my candidature in 2008 elections in the interest of Congress. I was approached by BJP high command in 2013 itself to contest in assembly elections. If I was hungry of power, I could have joined BJP a decade ago itself. However, I denied it politely. Seeing my dedication to the party, no BJP leader has approached me after 2013 and I have also never tried to meet them for this reason” he added. He said some people were creating false news about his future. “If someone proves that I have approached any BJP leader, I will retire from politics itself,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/wont-join-bjp-says-former-cong-mlc-chebbi/articleshow/88961687.cms||---

Artists in the city remembered their interactions with him. One of these interactions took place in 2011, during the 7th annual “Guru Madan Lal Koser - Guru Shobha Koser Award” instituted by Pracheen Kala Kendra for excellence in performing arts at Tagore Theatre. The classical dance legend was presented an award comprising a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh, a shawl, a citation and a memento for his lifetime contribution in popularising Kathak in particular and Indian classical dances in general. He mesmerised the audience with a Kathak recital. Shobha Koser, who runs the Pracheen Kala Kendra, recalls meeting Pandit Birju Maharaj when she was 18 years of age. “I met him in person when I had gone for the kathak academy scholarship. After seeing my performance, he asked me to learn Lucknow gharana but I was more interested in learning Jaipur gharana. After that also we met many times. He appreciated my dancing skills. It is a great loss to kathak dance and the entire community,” she said. Aakriti, a dance student from the Tricity who has attended many workshops of Birju Maharaj remembers him as a kathak icon who used to mesmerise students with his expressions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/tricity-mourns-passing-away-of-kathak-maestro-birju-maharaj/articleshow/88961692.cms||---

Candidates of political parties can file nominations by January 19. The authority issued orders in this regard on Monday. For the past few years, the F&CC has been formed with mutual consensus between the ruling and opposition parties. However, for the first time in the history of the MC, there are three parties in the MC. Since AAP has the maximum elected municipal councillors, it is expected to try to take at least two seats out of five. The BJP strategy is yet to be seen. With seven councillors,Congress is also likely to look for one seat.“We will look for a consensus initially as both AAP and BJP have equal number of members in the 36-member general house. But if there is no mutual understanding among political parties, we are ready for election also. The party is yet to discuss this issue,” a senior BJP leader said.On the other hand, a senior leader of the AAP said, “Since we have 14 elected councillors in the general house, we have at-least two seats in the F&CC. The matter will be discussed with senior leaders and elected councillors, after which a strategy will be decided.”Since the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) is the most important committee to take the policy and financial decisions after the general house, all three political parties, namely Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress are ready to be part of the committee. The committee has financial power of Rs 50 lakh and can discuss and approve decisions of the said amount on a monthly basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/fcc-to-be-formed-on-jan-24-nomination-filing-by-tomorrow/articleshow/88961697.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Chandigarh||Submit specific proposal for reducing misuse penalty charges, MHA tells UT||Chandigarh: The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has asked the UT administration to submit a specific proposal for reducing building misuse penalty charges. The response comes after UT's request of giving powers to the UT administrator. Last year, the ministry had asked the UT to submit afresh proposal and the UT had sought some clarifications. Presently, the UT administration has to submit proposal related to reducing in building misuse charges, which affects all traders and Industrialists, before the MHA from time to time. The traders had even moved the Punjab and Haryana high court on the issue.A senior UT official said the matter pertains to amendment in the Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulations) Act, 1952, to incorporate provisions for revision of penalty to be imposed in case of building violations and misuse of premises in Chandigarh, which was referred to the MHA in 2018. After a recent meeting of senior officials, the matter was again referred to the MHA with the request that the earlier proposal of the administration sent in March 2015, by the then UT finance secretary. It was proposed that penalty amount be decided by the administrator acting on behalf of the President from time to time may be accepted. But the MHA has now asked for a specific proposal, like which formula will be followed for reducing or fixing charges. In 2019, the UT administration had proposed to link misuse and violation charges of residential, commercial and industrial properties with lowest collector rates in a minor relief for residents. The administration had forwarded the proposal to the ministry for approval.The administration had finalised 0.75% of collector rate as misuse charges (per square feet per month) and 0.50% of collector rate as violation charges (per square feet per month). In both (misuse and violation) sections, the collector rate will be minimum in the category—residential, commercial and industrial.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/submit-specific-proposal-for-reducing-misuse-penalty-charges-mha-tells-ut/articleshow/88961699.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Chandigarh||Admn seeks report on land pooling policy||Chandigarh: UT adviser Dharam Pal has sought a report on the proposed land pooling policy before finalising it. The UT administration plans to make Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) the nodal agency for the land pooling policy to utilise available vacant land in the city as per Master Plan-2031.The draft is being prepared by Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Human Settlement (IIHS). Recently, the UT administration asked the Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) to submit a revised draft policy on village development, regularisation of illegal structures and extension of “Lal Dora.” UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit asked the administration to utilise available vacant land in the city as per the Master Plan-2031, leading the UT administration to try to overcome the constraint of land availability through the introduction of a land pooling policy. The Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Human Settlement has been entrusted with the task of formulating a land aggregation and pooling policy. The policy will help the administration utilise surplus land for development works planned in line with the master plan of the city.  The administration has asked different departments to submit details of land both available and encroached upon. A policy will be framed to utilise the land accordingly. Most of the potential vacant land is locked in different pockets, predominantly in villages on the city’s periphery. A major chunk of this land is facing serious threat of encroachments and illegal construction. To utilise the land, the administration is working on a development plan which will allow integration of villages in the sectoral plan of the city, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/admn-seeks-report-on-land-pooling-policy/articleshow/88961701.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Since that day, the infections have started dropping. Doctors are not certain if the peak has flattened, however. “We need to wait for a few more days before we can call it flattening of the curve. With data of three days, we cannot conclude that cases are declining finally,” said director health services Dr Suman Singh. On the other hand, deaths have started rising. In two weeks, 10 deaths have been reported — the first was on January 5. The two victims were a 65-year- woman from Sector 49 suffering from Renal disease and hypertension and a 63-year-old woman from Maloya suffering from leukemia and undergoing chemotherapy. Both had been fully vaccinated. The deaths have been reported amongst those who had one or more co-morbidities. The youngest victim was a 38-year-old man who was an alcoholic while the oldest an 87-year-old woman from Sector 28. She had diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease. The positivity rate on Monday was 21.42%, while the weekly rate has been 23.25%. The active cases are 9104, while confirmed cases are 78,492 including 1089 deaths. A total of 961 patients were discharged on Monday, taking the recovery rate to 87% “As the central government guidelines have been revised, those who are asymptomatic or non-risky contacts need not to get tested. This will reduce positivity rate. Moreover, this variant of concern is mostly asymptomatic,” said a public health expert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/864-new-infections-drop-of-50-in-3-days-but-2-deaths/articleshow/88961702.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Amid high drama and commotion, the BJP on January 8, had won all three seats of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.BJP candidate Sarabjit Kaur had defeated Anju Katyal of AAP by one vote as the councillors of the Congress and the SAD did not come to the house for voting. Both the BJP and the AAP had an equal number of 14 votes. Sarabjit polled 14 votes, while Katyal secured 13 votes. One vote was declared invalid as there was a tick mark on the back of the ballot paper. AAP had alleged that a voting slip, which was polled in favour of the BJP, was torn. They had said it should have been declared invalid too. They also raised doubts over the tick mark on the ballot that was declared invalid.In polling for the senior deputy mayor’s post, BJP’s Dalip Sharma had beaten AAP’s Prem Lata by two votes.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 10 of 75 samples test positive for omicron, 1 is foreign returnee||CHANDIGARH: Ten out of 75 Covid-19 samples sent from the city for whole genome sequence to Imtech tested positive for omicron on Monday. Alarmingly, except for one, the patients who were found with the new variant do not include any international returnee from a high-risk country or any of their contacts. The one positive case had a history of arrival from a low-risk country, Australia. The samples are sent by the UT health department randomly from those collected from hospitals and home isolation after every 15 days in a month. Sources said two of these samples that came positive for omicron were from PGI. “These samples were sent on January 4. But as the rate of positivity since then has been increasing exponentially, the variant will be more in the next samples as its R0 is more than one,” said a public health expert. “As there is no travel history, it is known the variant of concern has spread in the community. We had the delta variant dominant here until December. But now, the new variant is widespread,” said another public health expert. Doctors said that unlike the delta variant, omicron causes mild infection, but can be riskier for the elderly with co-morbidities or immunocompromised patients. “It is causing an upper respiratory tract infection, but the incubation period is within three days. As the transmission is faster, cloth masks do not protect in this variant,” said a doctor in PGI. The city’s first case of omicron was detected on December 11 last year, a 20-year-old man.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/10-of-75-samples-test-ve-for-omicron-1-is-foreign-returnee/articleshow/88961705.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Cold weather, rain may halve Kesar mango production||RAJKOT: Kesar mango lovers will have to dig deep into their pockets as the farmers are expecting production to be down by 50%, which may result in a spike in wholesale and retail prices. Farmers claimed that traders in Juangadh and Gir Somnath districts were offering them twice the money for the yearly contract for the sale of Kesar mangoes from their orchards. Gir Somnath, Junagadh and Amreli districts produce about 2 lakh metric tonne of Kesar mangoes every year. However, the key reasons for low production include large-scale damage to mango orchards during cyclone Taukte in May 2021. The cyclone that hit the Gujarat coast had caused devastation in Gir Gadhada and Una talukas of Gir Somnath district, which is considered to be hub of Kesar mango cultivation. Adding to the woes of mango farmers, unseasonal rains that lashed Amreli and Gir Somnath in December and early January, coupled with a dip in temperature, has delayed the flowering of mango trees. According to experts, low temperature over the past fortnight too has adversely affected the mango crop. D K Varu, head of the department of fruit science at Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU) said, “The mango crop requires night temperature between 12 and 15 degrees celsius and day temperature of 25 degrees celsius during the flowering stage which falls in December and January. However, this year, the mercury dipped to 8 degrees celsius during the night which has affected the flowering. Unseasonal rain during the same period also impacted flowering.” “Low temperature during flowering also increases the risk of disease in the mango crop. So, farmers will require more pesticides to protect the mango trees,” he added. According to farmers, 80% flowering is over by December end and the rest gets completed by mid-January or by Uttarayan festival. However, currently on 50% flowering has occurred in many orchards. In anticipation of a lean crop this season, traders are offering double the price for mangoes. Jayesh Hirpara, a Kesar mango farmer in Jamvala area near Talala in Junagadh said, “Usually, I got Rs 2 lakh for mangoes from my 120 trees, but this year I am being offered Rs 4 lakh. If I negotiate, I may get an even better rate.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/cold-weather-unseasonal-rain-may-halve-kesar-mango-production/articleshow/88961712.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The arrests and raids by ED and other government agencies against the opposition leaders have become order of the day and the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is much worse than the rest of the country,” Mufti said, addressing a tribal youth convention of her party here.Welcoming dozens of youth who joined her party on the occasion, the PDP leader said, “History gives an opportunity to play a role and people of India availed this opportunity to free the country from British rule. Today, we have an opportunity to get rid of the BJP (to save the country). This development will be much bigger than the freedom struggle against British rule as they (BJP) are hell bent to break this country.”She referred to the Haridwar “hate conclave”, she said, “The speakers openly called for genocide of Muslims and the BJP leadership preferred to remain silent and those who spoke said everyone has a right to speak their mind.” Mufti said Jammu and Kashmir had joined Mahatma Gandhi's India and “we will not allow this country to become (his assassin) Nathuram Godse's nation”.

Police said the couple had objected to the player’s relationship with their niece, which had left him infuriated. A pistol used in the attack has been recovered, senior police officers said. The arrested rugby player has been identified as Yogesh alias Kala who has played several international tournaments.

Meenakshi Rani, Tarjinder Kaur, Priya Saini and Seema Devi are a household name in Lam village courtesy their delicately handcrafted cakes and cookies prepared at the 'Lam Bakery'. Rani and Saini even travelled to Pune where they were felicitated by the Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane on December 22 last year for their contribution towards women empowerment in border villages, Jammu-based Army PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said. Their endeavour is being supported by the Army and NGO Aseem foundation. Lam, situated just four km from the Line of Control (LoC), is one of the remotest villages having seen military action in all the wars fought by India since Independence. “Despite the challenges of living in a border village, the local women have taken upon themselves to become self-employed. They have decided to take the bull by the horns and not let their situation pull them down; rather use it as a springboard to touch the sky,” Lt Col Anand said. He said the 'Lam Bakery' has become quite popular in nearby villages. Rani and Kaur are married with children and they fulfil their responsibilities as pillars of their families besides working at the bakery, the officer said, adding that Devi and Saini are the young guns who are the driving force behind the endeavour with their “never give up” attitude and relentless energy. This earnest endeavour and relentless strive by the women at a very young age is a silent reply to the odds faced by them at this border village and these women have become a role model in their village wherein many girls have been drawing encouragement from them, Lt Col Anand said.

---||Madurai||Teachers return to remote learning to engage students||MADURAI: Teachers in both government and private schools are set to turn back to remote learning to engage Classes I to IX students as schools are likely to remain closed until Covid-19 cases come down in Tamil Nadu. “It is a major setback for the children and teachers. When students returned to school, many struggled with basic language skills, we had to get them to practice reading and writing. So, we have to try our best to have them learn from home through the system we previously had by calling them up and sharing some simple activities on WhatsApp. We don’t know how the response will be,” said the headmaster of a government primary school. Teachers said that though students are now more adapted to such remote learning, the response has been poor as only less than 50% have access to smart phones and the same issue will persist now. There are also concerns that closure of schools again can lead to students not taking learning seriously as it is not sure if exams will be held. Most private schools on the other hand are planning for at least 2-5 hours of online classes depending on the level of class. Meanwhile, district education department officials said that classes under ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ scheme are planned to be continued after Pongal holidays despite closure of schools to help bridge the learning gap. In Madurai district, so far around 5,800 learning centres have been started under the scheme. However, as of now, officials and teachers are unsure on how the classes under the scheme will be conducted as there are Covid-19 safety concerns and response from children on whether they may attend.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/teachers-return-to-remote-learning-to-engage-students/articleshow/88961732.cms||---
---||Madurai||Number of deaths minimal, but doctors warn against taking severity of Covid-19 lightly||MADURAI: Even as active cases in the district nears 4,000 on Monday, the number of Covid-19 deaths in January has been only eight so far, with a death rate of 0.01%. However, doctors and health officials are keeping a close watch on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and urged the public to not underestimate the severity of Covid-19, especially when with co-morbidities or not being unvaccinated. In Madurai, just in 17 days this year, 5,293 cases have been reported. Doctors have urged the public to take Covid-19 symptoms seriously from an early stage to avoid ICU admissions and fatalities. “Especially in case of those who have co-morbid conditions or are above 60 years of age, proper monitoring is needed if they have any influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. If such patients test Covid-19 positive, they must consult a doctor and get triaged. Institutional admission is recommended for them as their vitals can be closely monitored to avoid any sudden worsening of condition,” said a senior physician at Government Rajaji Hospital. At the start of January hardly 10 ICU beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients, but now 49 beds in tertiary care centres have been occupied as per data from the state health department. Dr K Kolandasamy, public health expert and former director of Tamil Nadu public health, said that vulnerable patients taking C Reactive Protein (CRP) test along with checking of other vitals, blood sugar etc. can help better predict the possibility of lung involvement. “It will take at least seven days for oxygen saturation level to fall in a Covid-19 patient. However, through the CRP test, we can find out if a patient is prone to lung involvement at an early stage so that it can give a better chance for treatment and doctors can advise accordingly,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/no-of-deaths-minimal-but-doctors-warn-against-taking-severity-of-covid-19-lightly/articleshow/88961733.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The downward trend is being witnessed since January 14, when the state recorded the highest single-day 6,541 cases in the third wave. It came slightly down to 6,325 on January 15 and further to 5,410 on January 16. The upward surge in Covid cases was quite rapid, from December 30, when 132 fresh cases were reported. The daily count went up to 1,659 by January 5 and 4,737 on January 10, followed by the highest 6,541 cases on January 14. Though the number of cases has come down to nearly half in the last three days, state health minister Mangal Pandey claimed that the situation will become clear in a week. “The cases are either declining or static in Bihar and most of the places in the country. Experts had said that the Omicron variant of Covid cases will come down the same way as it increased. However, it is still early to say anything concretely about the trend. We will observe the situation for another week,” Pandey told TOI on Monday. The health minister said the overall severity of the third wave was comparatively less. “Of the 33,122 active Covid cases in the state at present, only around 360 people are under treatment in hospitals, which is mere 1% of the total cases. Remaining people are in home isolation and the government is providing them medicines,” Pandey said, adding that people should continue to remain cautious and follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour. Meanwhile, of the 3,526 fresh cases reported on Monday, Patna had the highest 1,035 cases, followed by 207 in Muzaffarpur, 164 in Purnia, 152 in Bhagalpur and 143 in Begusarai. Sheikhpura and Sheohar also reported 2 and 1 cases, respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/early-signs-of-downtrend-in-states-covid-19-cases/articleshow/88961735.cms||Piyush Tripathi

He was admitted to the hospital on January 13 after sustaining injury on his neck by a ‘kirpan’.The police could not ascertain yet whether the 70-year-old chief priest attempted suicide or was killed by someone. His body was found in a pool of blood in the bathroom at his residence on the gurdwara premises under mysterious circumstances. His family members had found a sword pierced through his neck. Rajendra’s son Daya Singh told the mediapersons that his father’s health was improving at the PMCH. “On late Sunday night, he complained of having difficulty in breathing. Despite best efforts of the doctors, he breathed his last at 3am on Monday,” he said and added that only a postmortem report would determine whether he had tried to commit suicide or someone had attacked him with the ‘kirpan’.After the postmortem, his eyes were donated at the PMCH. His body was brought back to the gurdwara premises for the devotees to pay last respects. His last rites were performed at Khajekalan ghat in the evening.A large number of people, including the members of the Sikh community, reached the gurdwara soon after the news of his death broke out. President of Takhat Sri Harimandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, Avtar Singh Hit, general secretary Inderjit Singh and other office-bearers and members of the committee expressed their condolences.Former general secretary of the prabandhak committee, Mahendra Pal Singh Dhillon, Sardar Raja Singh, Trilok Singh Nishad and many others also expressed condolences and demanded a high-level inquiry into the death of the head granthi of the Patna Sahib gurdwara.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/head-priest-of-patna-sahib-gurdwara-dies/articleshow/88961738.cms||---
---||Patna||Experts: Third Covid wave yet to reach its peak in Bihar||PATNA: As the state is witnessing some decline in Covid-19 cases, the third wave of coronavirus is yet to attain its peak, claim health experts. Doctors treating Covid patients along with other medical experts assert that the declining number of cases may be attributed to the declining number of tests in different hospitals and pathological labs. With most of the people getting infected with the Omicron variant, the number of serious patients has declined considerably and very few people are getting tested for Covid, they say. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said that the number of people coming for tests at the hospital has declined considerably during the last few days. “Earlier, 5,000 to 6,000 people were getting tested at AIIMS-P daily, but the number has declined to 1,700 or so. Consequently, the number of positive cases being reported at the hospital has declined, but it does not mean that the Covid cases are declining,” Kumar said and claimed that the number of active Covid cases is still rising and the peak of the third wave is yet to be attained. “It’s too early to predict the end of third wave. It is likely to reach its peak between January 22 and 30 and only then, it will start plateauing in the state,” he added. Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital pointed out that most of the Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic and get well even without visiting doctors. As the number of tests has declined and contact tracing has almost stopped, all the positive cases are not coming to light. “Even if one member of a family is found positive, all other members are bound to be positive if they are properly tested. However, in several cases, they don’t go in for any tests and take medicines on their own,” the doctor said, adding that the third wave is likely to attain its peak in the next seven to ten days. “People must maintain Covid safety protocol as any relaxation will only add to the people’s woes,” he added. Indian Medical Association’s state president Dr Ajay Kumar observed that under the existing circumstances, when active cases are still rising in different parts of the country, it is really very difficult to say when the third wave will get its peak. “The health department must continue its restrictions and people must not be allowed to gather at public places until the Covid cases subside completely,” the president said. According to paediatrician Dr Arun Shah, the third wave of coronavirus will attain its peak after two to three weeks as the positivity rate in some states is still as high as 16%. Besides, the delta variant is still infecting the people, complicating the scenario considerably. He, however, expressed the hope that the wave will start plateauing in February and it would end in March. “If there has been some decline in Covid cases, people should not be complacent and continue to stick to all the safety guidelines,” Shah said and stressed on the fast vaccination of younger people and children of all ages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/experts-third-wave-yet-to-reach-its-peak-in-state/articleshow/88961740.cms||---

When asked about some senior NDA leaders questioning the provisions of total prohibition, Singh said, “They were part and parcel of the Bihar Vidhan Sabha which passed the law for complete ban on liquor. If they are now raising questions on the same law, it is upon them to explain. They should explain whether their decision to take the pledge was wrong one.”On being asked about former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi’s recent demand for rollback of the prohibition law, Singh said he did not want to make any comment on any particular person. “I am speaking only on the prohibition law, which was unanimously passed by both the houses of Bihar legislature and the members of all the political parties took pledge by standing up from their seats. If they retreat from their pledge, it will be termed as a behaviour opposite their moral responsibility,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, a section of BJP leaders, including its state president Sanjay Jaiswal, raised questions over certain loopholes in the enforcement of prohibition law and demanded review of the law governing total ban on manufacturing and trade of liquor across the state.Two days back, Manjhi’s party HAM(S), which is an ally of NDA, asked, “If PM Narendra Modi can roll back all three farm bills, then why cannot CM Nitish Kumar rethink to withdraw the prohibition law?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-chief-rejects-demand-for-review-of-prohibition-law/articleshow/88961741.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||‘Another spell of rain likely this wk’||Patna: The state is likely to face yet another wet spell as weathermen have predicted light rainfall at isolated places on Thursday and Friday. Patna Meteorological Centre on Monday stated that light rainfall is likely at isolated places over south-western parts of the state on Thursday and western parts on Friday. The expected rainfall has been attributed to a western disturbance, which is likely to affect western Himalayan region from Tuesday night. Meanwhile, biting cold conditions are back in the state following wet spell in the last week, owing to cold westerly winds blowing in the region. Patna Meteorological Centre on Monday issued warning for cold day conditions at isolated places on Tuesday. “Cold day like conditions are likely to develop at different places in west and south-central Bihar,” said Aarti Gupta, a MeT department official. Cold day condition is declared when minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days.Weathermen have also claimed that nights are likely to be colder over the next 72 hours as night temperature is likely to fall by two to three notches during the next 2-3 days. “Cold north-westerly winds are blowing in the state, which may bring minimum temperature down by two to three notches,” Gupta said. The minimum temperature at Patna, Gaya and Bhagalpur on Monday was recorded at 8.2, 7.3 and 9.4 degrees C respectively.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/another-spell-of-rain-likely-this-wk/articleshow/88961743.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Goa||Draft coastal plans were inaccessible till Dec-end||Panaji: As Goa was struggling to meet its December 31, 2021, deadline to get its Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) notified, some delay on part of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, further added to the problem. GCZMA’s meeting minutes show that well into the month of December expert members were sent the revised CZMPs through email by the authority. But expert members were unable to access the emails as access permission was needed from NCSCM to open them. The expert members therefore requested the authority to give them hard copies of all the revised CZMPs sent by NCSCM, as they needed to compare them with the original draft of the CZMP to ascertain the changes incorporated in the plans by NCSCM. “The authority has handed over coloured hard copies of all revised maps sent by NCSCM to members. The expert members requested this Authority that they require some time to go through all maps so as to compare it with the previous draft Goa CZMP 2011. Members will put forward their comments in writing before this Authority in the next meeting. The Authority decided to request NCSCM to give Google access to all members of the Authority to open the revised plan sent by them,” read the GCZMA meeting minutes, which took place in the last week of December. Goa finally submitted its final draft of the CZMP to the Union environment ministry just a couple of days before the December 31, 2021, deadline set for the state by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The plan will be notified only once the ministry approves it. In October 2021, wary of repeated delays by Goa in finalising its CZMP, the NGT had set December 31, 2021, as the final deadline for the state. The tribunal had, however, said that if Goa fails to meet the new deadline, as a penalty, the state secretary concerned will not be paid salary from January 2022 till the time the default continues. In August 2021, Goa had sought its fourth extension in the deadline stating that it will require time to consider and incorporate the objections and suggestions received from the public on the draft CZMP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/draft-coastal-plans-were-inaccessible-till-dec-end/articleshow/88960018.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Dehradun||Dharam Sansad hate speech case: Bail applications filed for Yati Narasinghanand & Waseem Rizvi||Haridwar: Bail applications were filed on Monday for the release of Jitendra Narayan Tyagi (alias Waseem Rizvi) and Yati Narasinghanand -- both of whom were booked for allegedly making hate speeches at the Dharam Sansad conclave held in Haridwar from December 17 to 19. Advocate Uttam Singh Chauhan, who will represent both the accused, told TOI that the bail plea for Tyagi has been filed in the Haridwar sessions court and that for Narasinghanand in the chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court. He added that the date for the hearing of both the bail applications will be decided on Tuesday. Earlier on Saturday, the CJM court had rejected the bail application of Tyagi, the former chairman of Shia Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh, who was arrested from the Haridwar-Narsan border on Thursday (January 13). He was booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups and acts prejudicial to harmony) and 298 (deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). According to advocate Chauhan, a person booked under these sections need not be jailed until the charge is proved. “If an arrest has been made in such a case, the person can be granted bail,” said Chauhan while adding that offences under these sections are punishable for less than seven years. Later, on Saturday evening, the head priest of Ghaziabad-based Dasna temple, Yati Narasinghanand was also arrested for making objectionable remarks on women and alleged hate speeches at the conclave. On Sunday, fresh charges were pressed against the seer for abusing a journalist and cameraman. He has been booked under sections 295 (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feeling), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman) and 153A of the IPC and sent to 14-day judicial custody. With regard to Narasinghanand, Chauhan said, “None of these offences are punishable for more than seven years. Hence, we expect to secure a bail for Swami Ji.” Meanwhile, Adheer Kaushik, who runs Akhand Parashuram Akhada and is pursuing both these cases, told TOI, “We are confident that both Tyagi and Narasinghanand will be granted bail. In case, our applications are turned down, we are prepared to file fresh petitions in the high court.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dharam-sansad-hate-speech-case-bail-applications-filed-for-yati-narasinghanand-waseem-rizvi/articleshow/88959276.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who visited the site on Monday, said the work is progressing as per schedule despite the recent “unprecedented” rains and the Omicron outbreak. “Visited Central Vista Avenue to review progress of the project. Despite the unprecedented rains a few days ago and the current Omicron outbreak, work is progressing on schedule,” Puri tweeted. On Monday evening, the workers could be seen busy levelling the main Rajpath and carrying out cleaning work in full steam. Sources said in the next 4-5 days, the entire stretch will be decked up. They added this year there may be less than 20,000 visitors for the Republic Day parade considering the high number of Omicron cases in the national capital, though the Central Public Works Department has installed over 24,000 chairs. For the first time, the bleachers with foldable chairs have been installed along the Rajpath, which will enable the visitors to get a better view of the parade. TOI in December 2020 had first reported how the bleachers seating arrangement will be made along Rajpath to accommodate nearly 40,000 persons. But fewer such seats have been installed due to the prevailing Covid pandemic. Sources said some facilities such as the toilet blocks and the underpasses would be completed later and in all probability the stretch would be opened for public sometime in March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/revamped-rajpath-to-be-all-decked-up-ahead-of-r-day-full-dress-rehearsal/articleshow/88960525.cms||---

Due to a traffic jam, I got late. However, I was looking forward to meeting Joshi and home minister Amit Shah. Meanwhile, some media stories claiming that I was in Delhi to join Congress started circulating. Based on these stories, the party expelled me.” He added that “despite being a senior minister, no one from the BJP cared to call me and I received the news of my expulsion from social media. The state BJP leaders have made a blunder.” Harak slammed the incumbent state government for failing to deliver on the promise of development. “The BJP has no development works to project. A group of bureaucrats is running the show. Had I not come from the Congress, I would have resigned from the BJP four years ago. How is raising issues of development -- like construction of a central school and a medical college -- an anti-party activity?” He further alleged that “the national BJP leadership has allowed undeserving state leaders to run the Uttarakhand government.” “As a consequence, several issues, including unemployment, are impeding the state’s growth,” he said. When asked about his future plans, Rawat said, “I will join the Congress and no other political party. I will only work for the betterment of people of Uttarakhand and their future. I will be more than happy with whatever role the party gives me.” He added that Congress will be voted to office in Uttarakhand winning 40 out of 70 state assembly seats. Meanwhile, sources said that Congress was still not decided on inducting Harak, with the main opposition to the move coming from ex-CM Harish Rawat. Harak had rebelled against the former CM in 2016 and subsequently left the party. Harish is now insisting that Harak should “first apologise for his mistake of leaving Congress in 2016”. “Before inducting Harak into the Congress again, the party should keep in mind what transpired in Uttarakhand in 2016. The high command needs to take a call on the basis of the sentiments of the people of Uttarakhand and also the hard work put in by the Congressmen in the last five years to put the party in a strong condition in the Himalayan state,” Harish Rawat said. He added that “after Harak apologises, a decision can be taken on his induction.” “I do not have anything against him but all aspects must be explored before taking any individual into the party.” Till the time of filing this report on Monday, Harak and his daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain were in Delhi. Sources said that they held a meeting with senior Congress leaders late on Sunday and are expected to formally join the party in a day or two. While Harak is lobbying to get the Congress ticket to contest from Doiwala, an assembly seat presently held by former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, Anukriti is vying for a ticket from the Lansdowne seat, which was won by Harak in 2002 and 2007. Anukriti, who hails from Lansdowne, has been active in the hill town for the past few months. She is a former Femina Miss India who represented India in the Miss Grand International contest in 2017. On the issue of seeking a ticket for his daughter-in-law, Harak said that “there is nothing wrong with it.” “Did BJP not give tickets to Yashpal Arya and his son or Rajnath Singh and his son? So why should it be a problem?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/was-expelled-over-misleading-social-media-stories-harak-singh-rawat/articleshow/88959265.cms||Kautilya Singh

Sources said that they held a meeting with senior Congress leaders late on Sunday and are expected to formally join the party in a day or two. While Harak is lobbying to get the Congress ticket to contest from Doiwala, an assembly seat presently held by former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, Anukriti is vying for a ticket from the Lansdowne seat, which was won by Harak in 2002 and 2007. Anukriti, who hails from Lansdowne, has been active in the hill town for the past few months. She is a former Femina Miss India who represented India in the Miss Grand International contest in 2017. On the issue of seeking a ticket for his daughter-in-law, Harak said that “there is nothing wrong with it.” “Did BJP not give tickets to Yashpal Arya and his son or Rajnath Singh and his son? So why should it be a problem?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttarakhand/news/was-expelled-over-misleading-social-media-stories-harak-singh-rawat/articleshow/88966352.cms||Kautilya Singh

While five of the wetlands are natural, the others are man-made. Earlier last year, the authority had made a list of 1,040 wetlands, including ponds and lakes, and decided to notify them under Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The wetlands are owned by 16 organisations, such as Delhi Development Authority, revenue department, municipal corporations, Delhi Jal Board and forest department. The 10 prioritised wetlands include Najafgarh Jheel, Tikri Khurd lake, Bhalswa lake, Sanjay Lake and Welcome Jheel. The area of the waterbodies, many of which are braving pollution and encroachment, varies from 1.8 to 1,400 hectares. Officials said they had expedited the process and were working on the final draft notification. Delhi’s environment department is currently preparing a brief of each wetland. This would be followed by a draft notification to invite suggestions of the public, after which the Centre would notify them. “We prioritised these 10 wetlands based on factors like presence of biodiversity, richness, feasibility, etc. Once notified, the land-owning agency will prepare the action plan to maintain and, if required, rejuvenate the wetlands. So far, we have prepared the briefs of over 600 of the 1,040 wetlands. The draft notification has been made for some of the prioritised 10 wetlands. Since this is a tedious task, we have roped in third parties, like NGOs, to help us with the documentation and surveys,” said Dr KS Jayachandran, member secretary, Delhi Wetland Authority. Dr Madhu Verma, chief economist at World Resource Institute, Delhi, who is heading the technical committee on wetlands, said, “There is a lot of difference between the condition of these wetlands on ground and on paper. This makes it a huge task. That’s why we prioritised 10 wetlands based on their size, location, biodiversity, etc. We are expediting the process and hope they will be notified this year.” The Union environment ministry had in 2020 issued guidelines on implementing the Wetland Rules, 2017. Under these rules, a brief document was to be first prepared on each wetland with information like demarcation of boundaries, digital maps, coordinates, etc. Notification of a wetland can provide legal protection to the waterbody and prohibit acts like dumping of waste, discharge of untreated effluents, encroachment, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/10-waterbodies-in-city-put-on-priority-list-for-notification/articleshow/88960516.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Curiously, Dr Jaiswal has not described the Nitish Kumar government as the NDA government, but “Bihar government”. The JD(U) has maintained that Sinha has besmirched the name of Emperor Ashoka by comparing him with Aurangzeb. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan and its parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha have condemned Sinha and also issued statements dragging in PM Modi asking him to withdraw the Padma Shri award conferred on the playwright. “Stop playing Twitter-Twitter with the PM. He is the pride of every BJP worker. If anything has to be told to him, it should be done directly, face to face. If you play Twitter-Twitter with him and also ask him questions, then the 76 lakh BJP workers in the state know how to give a befitting reply,” Jaiswal said, addressing Lalan and Kushwaha, though without taking their names. “You all are big leaders – one has been Union minister (read Kushwaha) and another a minister in the state (read Lalan) … For the Bihar government (read Nitish government) to function, it is not just our responsibility, but also yours,” Jaiswal also said. Incidentally, when the controversy erupted and Sinha’s association with the BJP’s cultural cell was pointed out, Jaiswsal lodged an FIR against him at the Kotwali police station here. On Monday, he challenged the “Bihar government” to first arrest Sinha, get the charges against him framed and then punish him through a fast-track court. “After that a delegation of the Bihar government should call on the President and demand that the award should be withdrawn,” Jaiswal said, taunting the JD(U) leadership that awards have not been withdrawn in the last 74 years”.  “Be it the Dharma Sansad at Haridwar or hundreds of other hate speeches, the government has not only taken cognizance, but also has not hesitated in putting them behind bars,” Jaiswal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bjp-warns-ally-jdu-not-to-drag-pm-in-statements/articleshow/88961744.cms||Abhay Singh

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a batch of PILs for monitoring the construction or widening of the NHs in the state, directed the chief secretary to submit a feasible solution with regard to Danapur-Bihta elevated corridor to the court next week. The counsel of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Iti Suman, submitted an affidavit claiming obstructions by railways in any construction for security reasons within the periphery of five metres of the boundary line of its project comprising conversion of Danapur station into a railway terminus, entailing expanded tracks and platforms and the expansion of Danapur Rail Division head office. The NHAI counsel further stated that railways has requested for realignment of the elevated corridor project. The NHAI experts have also expressed apprehension that any realignment of the elevated road corridor may make it vulnerable to accidents and hence it can continue only in the present alignment. P K Shahi, appointed amicus curiae in the PILs pertaining to NH matters, submitted that the future of Patna township vitally hinges on this project which shall be connected with the upcoming Bihta airport and all educational institutions being established at Bihta. The court then directed to implead railways as a necessary party in this PIL and requested the railways counsel Siddharth Prasad to provide maximum assistance in ensuring a positive coordination with the NHAI. The elevated road project with an estimate of about Rs2300 crore was sanctioned in June 2020 wherein the state government is to fund Rs430 crore and the remaining cost is to be borne by the NHAI. This matter will be heard next week again when the chief secretary will furnish an affidavit regarding the positive solution to the problem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hc-to-chief-secy-find-solution-to-danapur-bihta-corridor-problem/articleshow/88961747.cms||---

The CO has also lodged an FIR against the woman for attempt to murder, obstructing government work and allegedly burning a government vehicle. The police have been probing both the cases. Bakhtiyarpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma said the woman was arrested on Sunday after which she accused the CO of sexually abusing her. “We are waiting for the orders from the higher authorities to arrest the CO for the interrogation,” he said. A rape case has been registered against the CO, he said. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh has ordered the Barh SDO to investigate the matter. Further action will be taken after the inquiry report, he said. The woman, in her written complaint, said she came in contact with CO Raghuveer Prasad when he was posted in Bettiah. She alleged that the CO came close to her gradually and one day he forcibly put vermilion (sindoor) and made a physical relationship with her. She told the police that when she protested, he threatened to defame her. Since then, on the pretext of marriage, he was having physical relations with her. “The woman claimed that she has been in contact with Raghuveer for the last eight years. The 26-year-old woman is originally from a village under Bettiah police station area. She used to visit his office during his posting in Bettiah. She lives in Patna for studies,” the SHO said.The woman also alleged that the CO snatched her two smartphones, in which many intimate photos and conversations between the two were recorded. However, Raghuveer termed all the allegations as baseless. He lodged a case against her at Bakhtiyarpur police station, alleging that she had sprinkled petrol on his car and set it on fire on Saturday. Earlier, it was said the car caught fire due to short-circuit. In his written complaint, Raghuveer said the woman attacked him, damaged government’s property and obstructed government work. “She said that Raghuveer had called her to Bakhtiyarpur and went to a mall with him. The woman alleged that the CIO was trying to implicate her by setting the car on fire and handed her over to the police under a pre-planned conspiracy. We are investigating the allegations,” Verma said.

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of PILs. Additional advocate general Anjani Kumar submitted that the said road had been constructed and repaired several times and the only remedy is to make cemented roads. The HC granted a week’s time to furnish details and posted the matter for Tuesday. Justice Kumar orally observed that it takes almost two hours to cover the distance of 20-25km. “Roads are full of potholes. Why the government is not thinking in wider perspective. Like Bodh Gaya, Vikramshila is also a world heritage site. How tourism will develop if the road to Vikramshila is not motorable?” he observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/hc-seeks-reply-from-rcd-over-utilisation-of-funds/articleshow/88961750.cms||---
