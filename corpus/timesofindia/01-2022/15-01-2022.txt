In the previous week ended December 31, the reserves had dropped by $1.466 billion to $633.614 billion. It had touched a lifetime high of $642.453 billion in the week ended September 3, 2021. During the reporting week ended January 7, the decline in the forex kitty was mainly due to a fall in gold reserves and foreign currency assets (FCA), a major component of the overall reserves, as per weekly data by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). FCAs decreased by $497 million to $569.392 billion in the reporting week. Expressed in dollar terms, the foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and yen held in the foreign exchange reserves. Gold reserves declined by $360 million to $39.044 billion, according to the data. The special drawing rights (SDRs) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) fell by $16 million to $19.098 billion. The country's reserve position with the IMF dipped by $5 million to $5.202 billion in the reporting week, the data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/forex-reserves-down-by-878-million-to-632-736-billion/articleshow/88905335.cms||---
---||Goa||Five months and over 200 sessions later, India finally feel prepared for Asian Cup 2022: Dennerby||Panaji: India will go into the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 at home without two of their more-important players, but coach Thomas Dennerby believes he still has “23 good players” who can make it at least to the quarterfinals. Dennerby will miss experienced striker Bala Devi, who has worn the No 10 shirt for Rangers FC in Scotland, and midfielder Sangita Basfore, both recovering from surgeries for an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury. The Swedish coach has shown faith in several youngsters, including three from the under-19 team – Priyangka Devi, Mariyammal Balamurugan, Sumati Kumari -- and Shilky Devi from the team that will take part in the Fifa U-17 World Cup later this year. “We have had such a long preparation, been together for more than five months and in total over 200 different sessions, games against proper teams, different styles. We finally feel we are really prepared. We can see the team has developed a lot. Hopefully we will see that when it’s time to play the games,” Dennerby told reporters during an online media interaction on Friday. India will open their campaign against Iran in Navi Mumbai on January 20. This edition of the Asian Cup has been expanded from eight to 12 teams. The top two from each group qualify directly for the quarters, while the best two third-placed teams will also make it to the next round. Dennerby believes India has a realistic chance of making it out of the group that includes seven-time champions China, two-time champions Chinese Taipei and Iran. “We aim to get into the quarterfinals which is our primary target,” said Dennerby. “If we qualify, anything can happen. The quarterfinals are knockouts and all teams will be under pressure. Looking ahead, we feel it’s a realistic target that we can achieve, but let’s take it step by step.” India’s preparations for the Asian Cup have been thorough with a long camp and several international friendlies. Dennerby’s side faced top teams like Brazil, Chile and Venezuela in November, and took on the might of Swedish clubs too. “We have played different level of teams, different styles. We learned a lot in Brazil, playing three games within a span of seven days with two days of rest, similar to the format at the Asian Cup,” said Dennerby. From among the friendlies that India played, a solitary goal win against group opponents Chinese Taipei in Bahrain should do their confidence a world of good. “Against Chinest Taipei, it will be an equal game. Definitely, it’s a game that we can win again. Iran will be tough for us. They are an organised team, defending well and they play a low block (of defence). We will have possession and will try to dominate. “China is going to be a tough one, but they are not at the level a couple of years ago when they won seven titles in a row (between 1986 and 1999). It’s the toughest game for us,” said Dennerby. Captain Ashalata Devi is the most experienced player in the team and will play her 65th international game when she leads the country against Iran in the opener. “For the last two-three years, we have had a young squad with an eye on the future,” said Ashalata. “I am guiding the youngsters, both on and off the field, sharing my experiences with them. Whichever youngster makes it to the team will not feel out of place.” The youngest in the squad is Shilky Devi, just 16, who will take the Asian Cup experience with her to the Fifa U-17 World Cup, also to be played in India later this year. The midfielder from Manipur made her senior debut against Brazil in November last year. “I’ve been the youngest and already played with seniors. This experience will help me and the under-17 team,” said Shilky, who captained India at the 2021 SAFF U-19 Women's Championship.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/five-months-and-over-200-sessions-later-india-finally-feel-prepared-for-asian-cup-2022-dennerby/articleshow/88905333.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Probably draw up a new plan and discuss it the next morning. What do you do after you’ve had a team meeting and discover two more players have been added to the “unavailable” list, only a few hours before the team sets out for the match? Derrick Pereira should know. The FC Goa coach had to draw up multiple plans and, in times of Covid-19, was without eight of his players for the clash against NorthEast United FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. The teams finished 1-1. Due to positive Covid-19 tests within Goa’s bio-secure bubble and isolation for those sharing a room with them, Pereira was without four starting 11 players and two substitutes who were part of the team that secured a 1-0 win against Chennaiyin FC. Captain Edu Bedia and defender Ivan Gonzalez were ruled out a few hours before the game. Despite not training for the last 12 days, goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari was included in the squad at the last moment as Naveen Kumar – who kept Goa’s first clean sheet in 10 games – was unavailable. Goa still dominated their opponents in a clash between two Indian head coaches – Pereira and Khalid Jamil -- for the first time in the Indian Super League (ISL), but could not translate this superiority into goals. Hernan Santana provided NorthEast United, also without three foreign players, the perfect start with a free-kick in just two minutes. Goa equalised in the 39th minute through Airam Cabrera, but could not grab the match-winner, despite 19 attempts, eight of them on target. Even given the circumstances, the draw did more harm than good for Goa. The former League winners are eighth on the table with 11 points from 11 matches, four behind third-placed Hyderabad FC and Mumbai City FC. NorthEast are tenth with nine points from 11 matches. Jamil’s side defeated a full-strength Goa in the first leg and he will be disappointed that his team could not create enough chances to grab full points on Friday. Even more worrying will be the injury to striker Deshorn Brown, who had scored five goals in two games prior to this encounter. More out of compulsion than choice, Pereira fielded an attacking side, lining up all three foreign players – Airam, Jorge Ortiz and Alberto Noguera – upfront, while opting for an all-Indian defence. NorthEast took the lead after just two minutes. It was Santana who scripted the goal as his delectable free-kick at the near post left goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh scrambling. It was just the sort of wake-up call that Goa needed to launch their moves. They settled down with passes in the middle and looked at Ortiz to deliver the goods. The Spaniard was at the heart of many chances, but every time it appeared like he had provided the breakthrough, goalkeeper Mirshad Michu was alert to avert the danger. Goa got the equaliser moments before half-time as Cabrera beat his marker and did well to head home a corner from Noguera. In the second half, Goa were even more threatening with Ortiz making life difficult for the defenders. That he could not finish is a different story. Substitute Makan Chothe did ‘score’ from inside a crowded goalmouth but his effort was wrongly ruled out for a foul on the goalkeeper. The best chance fell for Cabrera in stoppage time when Noguera sliced a ball through the defence for the Spanish striker, whose left-footed attempt missed the target.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/covid-hit-fc-goa-forced-to-settle-for-a-point-against-northeast/articleshow/88905364.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Moscow slams US sanctions on Russian with North Korea ties||MOSCOW: Moscow on Friday slammed US sanctions imposed earlier this week on a Russian citizen and a Russian company over involvement in North Korea's nuclear programme. Russia's foreign ministry quoted its spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying that the accusations were "absolutely unacceptable". "Without bothering with evidence, the United States is trying to substitute fiction for real facts," Zakharova said. She added that Washington is "throwing around far-fetched and baseless accusations that Russia is promoting the development of the North Korean nuclear missile programme". On Wednesday, the United States imposed sanctions on five North Koreans linked to the authoritarian country's ballistic missile programme. The Treasury Department said one of the North Koreans being sanctioned was based in Russia and had provided support to North Korea's Second Academy of Natural Sciences, which is already subject to sanctions. Washington also designated Russian citizen, Roman Anatolyevich Alar, and a Russian company, Parsek LLC, for having "materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery by (North Korea)." The move prohibits any dealings by US citizens with the designated individuals and foreign companies that engage with them could also be subject to sanctions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/moscow-slams-us-sanctions-on-russian-with-north-korea-ties/articleshow/88905294.cms||---
---||World||US President Joe Biden to tout infrastructure after week of defeats||WASHINGTON: The White House has been taking on water this week with President Joe Biden facing provocation from North Korea and Russia, stubborn inflation and setbacks on voting rights and the fight against the Covid pandemic. On Friday, in an attempt to right the ship, Biden is holding an event to vaunt his giant plan to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure. "The administration has made key progress towards implementing the largest long-term investment in America's infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century," the White House said. On November 15, amid great fanfare, Biden signed a bill that calls for $1.2 trillion to fix bridges and roads, change out unhealthy lead water pipes, build an electric vehicle charging network, and expand broadband internet. At his side was a smiling Senator Kyrsten Sinema. On Thursday, the Democratic senator from Arizona, in a speech on the Senate floor, torpedoed the 79-year-old president's efforts to enact voting rights bills designed to protect minority voters. To pass the bills, Democrats need the support of Sinema to change the rules of the Senate requiring a supermajority of 60 votes to bring legislation to the floor. Democrats have just 50 seats in the 100-member Senate and without Sinema signing on to do away with the rule known as the filibuster the bills are doomed. Biden personally invested much of his political capital in trying to get the voting rights bills passed, warning in a pair of speeches that democracy was in danger and lashing out at his predecessor Donald Trump and Republicans in general. Biden received another blow on Thursday when the conservative-dominated Supreme Court struck down his vaccination-and-testing mandate for large businesses. That same day, his national security advisor acknowledged that despite America's diplomatic efforts, Russia continues to pose a threat to Ukraine. And on Friday, North Korea carried out its third missile test of the year, thumbing its nose at the United States even as Washington imposes new sanctions. The dire week is a reminder that Biden, who took office a year ago with ambitious promises, has very little room for maneuver. As shown by Sinema, his control of the Senate is tenuous, and the Supreme Court has taken a hard turn to the right. On the economic front, inflation is at its highest since 1982 and shelves are distressingly empty in some supermarkets amid supply chain issues. And then there's Covid. There's a shortage of testing kits, hospitalizations are at a record high and the Omicron variant is rampant. In the latest poll from Quinnipiac University, just 33 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the job Biden is doing. Other polls have his ratings slightly higher, around 42 percent. Press Secretary Jen Psaki took a glass half-full approach from the White House podium. "Let me give you a little bit of a different take on this," Psaki told reporters. "More than 200 million people are vaccinated. We've had record job growth, record low unemployment rates. "We've rebuilt our alliances and our relationships around the world," she said. "But we also recognize when you have a small margin and threshold in the Senate, it's very difficult to get things done and to get legislation passed. "Our effort is to do hard things, try hard things, and keep at it," she said. "We could certainly propose legislation to see if people support bunny rabbits and ice cream, but that wouldn't be very rewarding to the American people."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-joe-biden-to-tout-infrastructure-after-week-of-defeats/articleshow/88905444.cms||---

The IED in Srinagar was detected in Khawjabazar area of Nowhatta area. In Punjab, IGP (border range, Amritsar) Mohnish Chawla said STF assistant inspector-general Rachpal Singh had received specific input about Pakistani smugglers sneaking drugs, explosives and an arms consignment into the Attari area. Acting on that input, the STF launched an operation on Friday morning on the Attari-Bachhiwind road and found a suspicious packet in a wheat field near Dera Baba Gulab Shah, about 2.5 km from the international border. "The sealed packet raised suspicions that it might contain explosives. So we called in the bomb disposal squad from Jalandhar, who confirmed that the packet contained an approximately 5-kg IED and Rs 1 lakh in Indian currency," IGP Chawla said. The IED was made up of 2.7 kg of explosive, 1.36 kg of iron balls, three iron containers weighing 670 grams, three electric detonators, a digital timer, two sponge caps and a polythene cover bag. Claiming that the consignment was smuggled from Pakistan, he said it was not clear whether the IED had been dropped by a drone or physically placed in the field. The J&K police, meanwhile, arrested Mohammed Ahsan Untoo of Divar Lolab Kupwara, currently living in Srinagar, who they claimed was a proactive secessionist and active participant and speaker on a Twitter space titled "Radio Resistance Kashmir" led by two known secessionists, Muzamil Ayub Thakur and Dr Asif Dar. By spreading false propaganda and disinformation and making hate speeches on these social media spaces, Ahsan Untoo is not only threatening to disturb the prevailing peaceful atmosphere of the UT of J&K but spreading disaffection, ill-will and disharmony against the Union of India, the police said, adding that he was also actively spreading the terrorist’s secessionist agenda and thus inciting youth to resort to violence. The police have registered a case against Untoo under relevant sections of the law and he has been remanded in police custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pressure-cooker-bomb-defused-in-srinagar-ied-found-near-ib-in-punjab-police/articleshow/88905590.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan launches first ever national security policy||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Friday launched the public version of the country’s first-ever National Security Policy (NSP) 2022-2026, vowing that the nation would now be headed in the right direction. As the original document signed earlier by the PM will remain classified, its public version has been described by the government as a citizen-centric policy framework, placing economic security at its core and seeking a secure and economically resilient Pakistan. It was launched a day after Pakistan’s parliament passed a mini-budget and controversial State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) amendment bill to meet the requirements of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of the release of $1-billion bailout package by the global moneylender. The package is a part of the $6-billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme that Pakistan had agreed with the IMF in July 2019. Speaking about the IMF, Imran said that a state’s security is compromised when it has to intermittently seek the support of the moneylender. “We approach the IMF under duress, as in the end, only IMF is ready to help us and provide the cheapest loans. We have to abide by their conditions, and as a result, impose burden on the people,” Khan said. He noted that when the country’s economy is weak, it weakens its defence. In the new policy, Khan said, national security has been defined in the right manner, as earlier, according to him, one-dimensional mindset prevailed in Pakistan as “we had insecurities due to wars against India in 1948 and 1965”. A peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UNSC resolutions has also been declared in the document as a vital security interest for the country. He stressed that the biggest security of a state is its people. “When the people become stakeholders of the country, it becomes the greatest national security.” On his part, National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf said the NSP has taken a broad view of the national security as both traditional and non-traditional issues impacted it. “While the NSP is centered around economic security, the geo-strategic and geo-political imperatives also feature prominently in it to strengthen Pakistan’s security and standing in the world,” the NSA said. He highlighted that this was a document finalised after complete civil-military consensus. The policy, according to the document issued earlier by the government, is aimed at addressing the economic challenges of external imbalance, socio-economic inequalities, and geographic disparities between developed and under-developed regions of Pakistan. The document emphasises the “non-negotiable” focus on defence and territorial integrity of Pakistan, strengthening space-based technology and its application, and combating hybrid warfare through enhancing information and cyber security. Regarding internal security, the policy seeks to ensure writ of the state across the country, zero-tolerance towards terrorism, extremism and violent sub-nationalisms, and fighting the menace of organised crimes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-launches-first-ever-national-security-policy/articleshow/88905610.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Nepal claims Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani area near the tri-junction with China as its own and issued a new political map earlier to justify its claim. While the Nepal coalition government has so far remained silent on remarks by PM Narendra Modi last month on expansion of the road, the main ruling party, Nepali Congress, said in a statement Friday that India's decision to further expand the road was objectionable. It also called upon India to immediately recall its troops from the area. Read AlsoNepal makes efforts to reset bilateral ties with India amidst change in top leadershipKATHMANDU: In a year fraught with political turbulence and the coronavirus pandemic tightening its grip in Nepal, 2021 saw Kathmandu making efforts to reset its bilateral ties with India with high-profile talks and visits, amidst a change in guard in the top leadership in the Himalayan nation."Nepali Congress is clear that Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani are Nepalese territory. Nepal should have its rights to use this geography. Indian troops stationed in Kalapani must be returned," it said in the statement. Modi had said at a public event in Haldwani on December 30 that India, apart from working on the Tanakpur-Pithoragarh all-weather road, had also built the road up to Lipulekh and that "it is being expanded further". While the construction of the road to Lipulekh Pass near the tri-junction with China led to one of the worst diplomatic crises between India and Nepal in recent memory, the Indian government has maintained that that the road only follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. Under the present project, as the government earlier said, the same road has been made pliable for the ease and convenience of pilgrims, locals and traders. Nepal claims the Lipulekh and Kalapani area in Uttarakhand even as the area remains under India's administrative control.

Besides attending the summit, Deuba was also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the visit.Another ruling party, CPN (Unified Socialist), had said in a statement earlier this week that any development activity conducted in the area without consultation with the Nepal government is "totally illegal and it is a flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and national sovereignty". "The Indian government knows very well that the area of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura are the sovereign territories of Nepal. We would like to request the government of Nepal to take necessary measures to protect our territory on the border," said former PM Jhala Nath Khanal, who is also heads the international wing of the party. The statement, according to Khanal, was in response to remarks by Modi in Uttarakhand that the road being "illegally built" in the Nepali territory of Lipulekh is being further widened. The main opposition Nepal Communist Party-UML has also fuelled the uproar by calling upon India to put an end to activities that violate sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-respect of Nepal.

The party has also urged the government to immediately start dialogue with India on the issue, and to ask India to stop "all kinds of bullying and to take fruitful initiative to establish practical ownership of Nepal over the encroached territories".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/outrage-in-nepal-over-indias-plan-to-widen-the-road-to-lipulekh/articleshow/88905596.cms||Sachin Parashar

Serhiy Demedyuk, the deputy secretary of the national security and defence council, said Ukraine was working to establish who obtained such access, whether it was done externally or through an insider.  The comments are the first detailed explanation of how multiple Ukrainian websites were hit by a cyber strike that left a warning to "be afraid and expect the worst", at a time when Russia has amassed troops near Ukraine's borders.  "According to the preliminary conclusions of our experts ... today's attack occurred due to the use by third parties of access to the software administration rights of a company that had an advantage in developing websites for government agencies," Demedyuk said in written comments.  "The specified software has been used since 2016 to create websites for government agencies, most of which became victims of today's incident," said Demedyuk, who used to be the head of Ukraine's cyber police.  He did not name the third party company.  Ukraine said on Friday the cyberattack hit around 70 internet sites of government bodies including the security and defence council.  Demedyuk said his statements were preliminary findings.  "But for the final conclusion, law enforcement agencies need to conduct many examinations of the seized digital evidence, as well as to establish how and who exactly received such privileged administrative access, through outside interference or as a result of the illegal activities of an insider in this company," he said.  Demedyuk did not say who might have been behind the attack, though Ukraine's foreign ministry and its state security service pointed the finger of suspicion towards Russia.  Russia did not comment, but has previously denied being behind cyberattacks, including against Ukraine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hackers-likely-used-software-administration-rights-of-third-party-to-hit-ukrainian-sites-kyiv-says/articleshow/88906325.cms||---

---||---||As ex-BJP ministers join Samajwadi Party, FIR for Covid norms breach||LUCKNOW: Former UP cabinet ministers Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini joined Samajwadi Party along with five BJP and one Apna Dal MLAs at an event in the party’s Lucknow headquarters on Friday, signalling a churning that might compel politicians to reboot their caste strategies ahead of the coming state assembly polls. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said as much, describing Maurya, Saini and the group of MLAs’ shift to his party as a move that will upset BJP’s caste arithmetic in the elections. He took a dig at BJP’s “80% vs 20% maths” with a cricket analogy: “The way wickets are falling that side, the chief minister must have realised he has dropped the catch. Now it seems … he will have to take tuition from a mathematics teacher as well.” Apart from Maurya and Saini, the six MLAs who formally joined SP on Friday are Bhagwati Sagar, Brijesh Kumar Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Roshan Lal Verma, Dr Mukesh Verma, and Amar Singh of Apna Dal, a party that is part of the government in UP. Sources said Dara Singh Chauhan, the third minister to resign from the Yogi cabinet recently, is likely to join SP on Sunday. Later, police lodged an FIR against 2,500 SP members for violating Covid curbs on public gatherings and the EC’s ban on rallies after party supporters, ex-ministers, MPs and MLAs attended the induction ceremony at its HQ. The rush led to traffic snarls. The gathering violated Section 144 of CrPC and provisions of the epidemic law that was in place in view of a surge in Covid cases. The EC has banned rallies till January 15. At the event that was supposed to be “virtual” with minimal attendance, Akhilesh said that “80% people are standing with SP” following its alliances with smaller parties and several MLAs joining it. “After listening to Maurya ji, the remaining 20% will go against them (BJP government),” he said. He was responding to CM Yogi Adityanath’s recent remarks that the political battle in UP has “become a fight of 80 versus 20”. His comments were seen as an attempt to polarise voters—80% majority community as opposed to 20% minorities. He clarified later that he was referring to 80% positive people while those backing terrorists and mafia making up the 20%. For his part, Maurya accused the government of adopting a “use and throw” policy towards scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward castes to form a government in UP that he alleged was being run by the privileged caste. The 68-year-old politician said SP is now ready with patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s “Charkha Dao” to defeat BJP in the caste arithmetic. As a young wrestler Mulayam was known for his “Charkha Dao”—a move that would let him lift an opponent off his feet, spin him around, and throw him to the ground. Maurya attacked BJP from the word go, saying the party “caters” to 5% of the upper caste, ignoring the votes from 23% scheduled castes and tribes and 54% backward classes. “BJP talks of taking along 80% Hindus when it comes to elections, but once the government is formed only 5% upper caste malai khate hain (enjoy the fruits).” He alleged that before the 2017 assembly polls, BJP leadership “used to say Keshav Prasad Maurya or Swami Prasad Maurya will become CM,” but when the time came, “they tried to drop a Skylab from Ghazipur and then eventually sent one from Gorakhpur”. Maurya joined BJP before the 2017 assembly polls.

---||India||As ex-BJP ministers join Samajwadi Party, FIR for Covid norms breach||LUCKNOW: Former UP cabinet ministers Swami Prasad Maurya and Dharam Singh Saini joined Samajwadi Party along with five BJP and one Apna Dal MLAs at an event in the party’s Lucknow headquarters on Friday, signalling a churning that might compel politicians to reboot their caste strategies ahead of the coming state assembly polls. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said as much, describing Maurya, Saini and the group of MLAs’ shift to his party as a move that will upset BJP’s caste arithmetic in the elections. He took a dig at BJP’s “80% vs 20% maths” with a cricket analogy: “The way wickets are falling that side, the chief minister must have realised he has dropped the catch. Now it seems … he will have to take tuition from a mathematics teacher as well.” Apart from Maurya and Saini, the six MLAs who formally joined SP on Friday are Bhagwati Sagar, Brijesh Kumar Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Roshan Lal Verma, Dr Mukesh Verma, and Amar Singh of Apna Dal, a party that is part of the government in UP. Sources said Dara Singh Chauhan, the third minister to resign from the Yogi cabinet recently, is likely to join SP on Sunday. Later, police lodged an FIR against 2,500 SP members for violating Covid curbs on public gatherings and the EC’s ban on rallies after party supporters, ex-ministers, MPs and MLAs attended the induction ceremony at its HQ. The rush led to traffic snarls. The gathering violated Section 144 of CrPC and provisions of the epidemic law that was in place in view of a surge in Covid cases. The EC has banned rallies till January 15. At the event that was supposed to be “virtual” with minimal attendance, Akhilesh said that “80% people are standing with SP” following its alliances with smaller parties and several MLAs joining it. “After listening to Maurya ji, the remaining 20% will go against them (BJP government),” he said.

---||India||Days before Republic Day, IEDs found in J&K, Punjab||SRINAGAR/CHANDIGARH: A pressure cooker bomb was found and defused in Srinagar on Friday, while a 5-kg IED and Rs 1 lakh in Indian currency were recovered near the international border in Punjab where assembly elections are to be held in February. The IED in Srinagar was detected in Khawjabazar area of Nowhatta area. In Punjab, IGP (border range, Amritsar) Mohnish Chawla said STF assistant inspector-general Rachpal Singh had received a specific input about Pakistani smugglers sneaking drugs, explosives and an arms consignment into the Attari area. Acting on that input, the STF launched an operation on Friday morning on the Attari-Bachhiwind road and found a suspicious packet in a wheat field near Dera Baba Gulab Shah, about 2.5 km from the IB. "The sealed packet raised suspicions that it might contain explosives. So we called in the bomb disposal squad from Jalandhar, who confirmed that the packet contained a 5-kg IED and Rs 1 lakh in Indian currency," IGP Chawla said. The IED was made up of 2.7 kg of explosive, 1.36 kg of iron balls, three iron containers weighing 670 grams, three electric detonators, a digital timer, two sponge caps and a polythene cover bag. Claiming that the consignment was smuggled from Pakistan, he said it was not clear whether the IED had been dropped by a drone or placed in the field. The J&K police, meanwhile, arrested Mohammed Ahsan Untoo of Divar Lolab Kupwara, currently living in Srinagar, who they claimed was a proactive secessionist and active participant and speaker on a Twitter space titled "Radio Resistance Kashmir" led by two known secessionists, Muzamil Ayub Thakur and Dr Asif Dar. By spreading false propaganda and disinformation and making hate speeches on these social media spaces, Ahsan Untoo is not only threatening to disturb the prevailing peaceful atmosphere of the UT of J&K but spreading disaffection, ill-will and disharmony against the Union of India, the police said, adding that he was also actively spreading the terrorist's secessionist agenda and thus inciting youth to resort to violence. The police have registered a case against Untoo and he has been remanded in police custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/days-before-republic-day-ieds-found-in-jk-punjab/articleshow/88906637.cms||---
---||Delhi||Days before Republic Day, major terror strike foiled as IED defused at Delhi market||NEW DELHI: With barely two weeks to go for Republic Day, Delhi Police and sleuths of National Security Guard averted a major terror strike by defusing an RDX-based improvised explosive device (IED) through a controlled explosion at the Ghazipur flower market in east Delhi on Friday afternoon. Around 2kg of RDX explosive was packed in a solid iron casing, equipped with a commercial charge timer, and kept inside a black bag. Traces of ammonium nitrate were found on the surface of the device. What has alarmed the intelligence agencies and the special cell is that explosives were discovered in Srinagar and Amritsar, simultaneously, indicating that a coordinated strike may have been attempted, potentially by ISI. While it was a pressure cooker IED in Srinagar, explosives and detonators were seized from a field in Amritsar. The special cell has filed an FIR on the incident and begun a probe. Two primary lines of investigation are being followed: sleeper cells of a terror outfit being activated in the capital and involvement of Khalistani operatives. The latter stems from the recent alerts issued by various agencies. In Delhi, police responded to a call of a suspicious object in a bag at Ghazipur around 10.20am. According to the control room log, the caller said that an unattended bag was kept near his scooter parked near Gate No. 1 of the flower market. The market is usually packed with people at this time. Immediately, the control room dispatched bomb and dog squads. Simultaneously, an NSG bomb disposal squad - which is stationed at Central Vista at present - was rushed to the spot. The area was cordoned off. The bag was picked up by a robot deployed by NSG and secured in a special wagon even as a JCB was brought to the spot to dig a hole for carrying out a controlled explosion to destroy the IED. "The bomb disposal squad of NSG defused the IED recovered from Ghazipur. Samples of the IED have been collected and the team will submit a report on the chemical components used to assemble the explosive," said an NSG official. By afternoon, the multi-agency centre, a nodal unit, received reports regarding recovery of explosives in Punjab and Srinagar as well. Intelligence agencies are tracking recent movements of terror modules for leads. "The imprints show that the IED is similar to the ones recovered in Punjab recently. It is being probed if the IED is the one of the dozen devices smuggled from across the border last year. Only a few have been recovered from that consignment till now," said a source in an agency. Two days ago, Punjab Police recovered 2.5kg of RDX, a detonator, five explosive fuses with wires and other weapons and ammunitions in Gurdaspur. Analysis of the bomb used in the blast at the Ludhiana court complex had revealed that 2kg of RDX was used. Delhi Police's special cell has collected CCTV footage from the stretches adjoining the spot. No camera was found focused on the spot. A team is likely to get in touch with Punjab Police on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/days-before-republic-day-major-terror-strike-foiled-as-ied-defused-at-delhi-market/articleshow/88906654.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Gurgaon||Illegal hoardings in city: MCG set to fine violators, eyes ₹94cr||Gurgaon: MCG has issued 201 recovery notices to advertisers for illegally installing hoardings across the city. The civic body has made an assessment to recover Rs 94 crore alone from these illegal advertisements. The areas where these advertisements have been put up include Southern Peripheral Road, Golf Course Road, Sohna road, DLF- 1, 2 and 3 markets, and Iffco Chowk to Sikanderpur metro station stretch.Officials said the civic body issued recovery notices to 12 illegal advertisers who displayed their advertisements on the stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Dwarka Expressway, and imposed a penalty of Rs 84 lakh. As many as 13 notices were issued to advertisers on the Udyog Vihar to Dwarka Expressway stretch amounting to Rs 1.7 crore and 13 to illegal advertisers on Golf Course Road amounting to Rs 77.3 lakh. Similarly, 14 notices were slapped on illegal advertisers on SPR with a penalty of Rs 16.5 lakh, and eight recovery notices for illegal advertisements on the stretch from Ambience Mall to IFFCO Chowk to MG Road with an assessment fee of Rs 92 lakh.Madhusmita Moitra, MCG’s chief town planner, said, “We have served the notices to the illegal advertisers and will soon make the recovery. It will send across the message that MCG’s permission to advertise is mandatory. The formula to calculate the recovery amount is that we consider the licence fee for the duration of an advertisement displayed by an advertiser. We penalise the advertiser three times the licence fee.”Explaining the process further, she said, “In case, an advertiser fails to deposit the penalty amount within 15 days, we usually get FIRs registered against the defaulter and police make the recovery. If the illegal advertisers still don’t pay the penalty to the police, we send the case to the zonal taxation officer, who holds the power to make the recovery by way of sale of their properties.”Officials also said that the civic body has been conducting drives at multiple locations to remove unauthorised advertisements. “The number of applications for advertisement permits has increased in the last two months after we launched drives to remove illegal advertisements. We have received 140 new applications since December 23 and collected a revenue of Rs 8.70 lakh out of the same,” said an official.

This is the second consecutive day that new cases crossed the 3,000-mark in the city. The last time so many people had tested positive in a single day was during the middle of the second wave on May 4 last year, when 4,475 cases were recorded.With the spike in cases, the positivity rate also shot up from 24% to 30% in the last 24 hours. There are 17,539 active cases in the city as of now, of whom only 138 are in hospitals.There were two Covid deaths in the city on Friday. A 61-year-old man, who had taken both doses of the vaccine and was admitted to a private hospital with diabetes and chronic liver disease on January 12, was one of them. Hospital officials said the man was given IV fluids, antibiotics, and other supportive measures along with remdesivir and steroids. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died on Friday.The other patient who died was a 63-year-old woman. She was suffering from chronic liver and kidney problems and was admitted to a private hospital on January 8. The woman hadn’t taken both her vaccine shots. Gurgaon had reported the last Covid death on Wednesday, when a 66-year-old fully vaccinated man was admitted to a private hospital. Doctors said the patient, a resident of Sector 4, had congestive heart failure. So far, 931 people have died in the city after testing positive. Of them, 615 had comorbidities — 269 had diabetes, 146 had hypertension, 86 had kidney ailments and 113 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Officials in the health department said the two patients who died were admitted to the hospital with their comorbid conditions. “These two deaths are Covid-related because they tested positive while being admitted to the hospitals. They already had medical issues,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer.Officials clarified that the patients without serious symptoms and an oxygen saturation of more than 93% should not get admitted to the hospitals.Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director (internal medicine and medical advisor) at Max Hospital, said, “Yes, with the surge in the number of daily cases, hospitalisations are also increasing.

---||Gurgaon||In a week, hospitalisations rose from 36 to 138 in city||Gurgaon: The number of Covid patients admitted to hospitals has increased from 36 to 138 in the past seven days, when the city has been reporting 2,500 new cases on an average.But the rate of hospitalisation, according to experts, is still low — just 0.7% of the 17,539 active cases as of Friday. The city has 2,712 ICU and oxygen beds reserved for Covid patients, but only 90 of them are occupied.This health department data, however, does not include Covid patients from other districts and states. If they are added to the tally, the city will currently have 258 Covid patients admitted to various hospitals. As of now, 45 of these patients are from Delhi, 25 from Uttar Pradesh, 23 from various other states and 27 from other districts of Haryana. Experts pointed out that in all the three waves of the pandemic, hospitalisations usually surged after 10 to 15 days from the peak of that particular phase. “Remember, the peak is yet to arrive in this wave. So, hospitalisations will go up further. We have seen that patients usually get serious 7-10 days after testing positive. So, people can’t let their guard down,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer.In the last two weeks, Covid cases have surged by leaps and bounds. “At present, we have 15 Covid patients in our hospital, of whom 10 are stable with mild to moderate symptoms. The remaining five are in ICU. But it is important to note that these five patients had come to the hospital with comorbidities such as cancer, kidney failure and heart ailments. We tested them before admission, and they were found to have Covid. People should not take this surge lightly,” said Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of the emergency department and medical services at Narayana Hospital.Only a few patients are on ventilator as of now. “We have been seeing a surge in the number of hospitalisations. But very few of them are needing ventilator support. The mortality rate is also low so far,” said Dr Sushila Katari of Medanta — The Medicity.Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, echoed her on the number of hospitalisations. “The virus affects people who are most prone, such as the elderly, those with comorbidities and those not fully vaccinated. Most of these patients have been requiring only oxygen and not advanced respiratory support. As of now, the rate of admissions in this phase is less than 25% of the previous wave.”Doctors also urged people to get vaccinated at the earliest. Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director of Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said, “The Omicron wave is well upon us. We have been seeing a 5-6% hospitalisation rate in big cities. This is definitely a disease and a dangerous one as we still don’t know the long-term effects of it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/in-a-week-hospitalisations-rose-from-36-to-138-in-city/articleshow/88906694.cms||Ipsita Pati

The area has been targeted by offenders in the past too, when several unauthorised warehouses were constructed in violation of the norms but later razed by the department.This time, offenders took advantage of construction ban and poor monitoring, and were able to develop these colonies, constructed room and sold plots to innocent investors and dupe them of their hard-earned money.District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said these colonies were served showcause notices and restoration orders but the developers neither furnished satisfactory replies not took corrective measures. On Friday, the department carried out demolition drive in the area and razed illegal construction including 70 structures and 10 boundary walls.He said the locals including few property dealers tried to obstruct the drive by locking the properties to pretend as if these were occupied and also parking their cars outside the properties. But when the department did not stop the drive, they were forced to vacate after which earthmovers razed the construction in presence of police team.Another official said these colonies were being developed without any permission from the concerned department in violation of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act 1975. He said the violation of Act is a punishable offence with imprisonment up to 3 years, therefore, the department will soon register police complaint against the offenders. We will also write to police to stop the development of unauthorized colony being done by the offenders and other offenders whose name gets associated with the offence, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/3-illegal-colonies-razed-by-dtcp/articleshow/88906696.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Gurgaon||Gang cheats many with holiday package offers; four arrested||GURUGRAM: Faridabad police busted a gang of cyber fraudsters and arrested four suspects for cheating several people across the country by posing as bank representatives and offering holiday packages to credit cardholders. Police have found four bank accounts that the criminals used, with transactions amounting to over Rs 65 lakhs in the past six months. The gang, according to police, purchased the contact details of the credit cardholders from an app, Justdial, and called them through it. Posing as bank representatives, the callers used to inform the targets about holiday packages under a scheme of their credit cards. The callers then used to take their card number, CVV and expiry date, even tricking them into sharing OTPs and making transactions from their card into their accounts. “Usually, people fall in such traps as they believe that the call has come from the customer care executive of the bank,” said Nitish Agrawal, DCP, Faridabad. Police recovered 17 mobile phones, 18 SIMs, computers and printers used for making fake documents, from the accused. A case also got registered at the cyber police station of Faridabad on the complaint of Manoj Kumar, a resident of Jawahar Colony, who lost Rs 98,976 to the fraudsters. Police identified the arrested men as Uttam Singh, Tushar, Mohammad Mubin and Maj Ahmad. Uttam and Tushar are from New Delhi; Mubin and Ahmad are from UP. Police said that the gang committed 55 fraud cases-17 in Delhi-NCR, 15 in UP, nine in Telangana, five in Haryana, three in Maharashtra, two in Gujarat, and three in Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, respectively. In Haryana, Jind, Sirsa and Faridabad have one case each and Karnal, two. “We got to know the details of the cases after scanning the mobile phone recovered from the accused,” said inspector Basant Kumar, SHO, Cyber police station, Faridabad. Earlier this month, Faridabad police had busted a gang of cyber fraudsters, who used to similarly call its targets through an app and pretend to be SBI representatives to cheat them in the name of renewing their credit cards. Police said that the modus operandi of the two gangs are similar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gang-cheats-many-with-holiday-package-offers-four-arrested/articleshow/88906697.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Fraudsters promise cosmetic companies’ products, cheat many||Gurgaon: A case has been registered with the cyber police station in the city, where it has come to light that a large number of customers of a popular cosmetic and baby-care product brand were duped by online fraudsters. The fraudsters had the data of the customers of the brand and called up people offering them schemes wherein the person would receive electronic products as gifts on purchase of items of a certain amount. To avail the offer, the customers were asked to make payment into the account details shared by the cheats. The fraud came to light when Honsana Consumer Pvt Ltd, which produces skin and hair-care products and relevant services for both adults and babies under the brand name of Mamaearth, were flooded with complaints from the customers. In a period of five days between December 15 and December 20, the company received 471 complaints from their customers. Ankita Sharma, legal representative of the company, said that the company received a lot of complaints from its customers alleging that they were contacted via call, WhatsApp and email for a promotional offer. Under this offer, consumers were asked to purchase products worth Rs. 4,999 to get cashbacks and free gifts such as television, mobile phone, refrigerator, laptop, air conditioner, etc. The company claimed that they have no such offer and that this was the doing of the scammers. “The fraudsters had personal information of customers like their name, shipping address, order number and other details of the customer’s previous purchase with the company, which they were using to gain the trust of the customers,” she said. In order to gain the trust of the customers, the fraudsters first asked the target to visit the company’s site and add products to the cart. “Thereupon, the fraudsters informed the customers of the lucrative offers and cash-backs that they could avail and made them pay through UPI or net banking into their accounts,” she wrote in the complaint filed with the police.The company alleged that the scammers also forged fake ID cards and letters in the name of its founder and director to gain the trust of the consumers. These forged documents were being shared with the consumers via WhatsApp chats. “The magnitude of the fraud is evident from the fact that the company has received 471 complaints in just 5 days,” she added. Based on the complaint a case was registered at Cyber police station under section 420 (cheating) of IPC and section 66D (impersonation through computer source) of IT Act. “We are trying to track the fraudsters,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/fraudsters-promise-cosmetic-companies-products-cheat-many/articleshow/88906698.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||Road crashes rise by 10% in 2021, over 400 died in accidents in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: As the traffic volume on the city roads increased in 2021 due to the easing of mobility restrictions and offices beginning to call back employees, road accidents saw a jump of around 10% year-on-year. The number of road accidents in the city rose from 796 in 2020 to 874 in 2021, according to the official data. As per the month-wise data, maximum accidents occurred in October and December, when the public places were bustling with people and normalcy was beginning to set in before the Omicron-led third wave resulted in evening curfews. The number of fatal road accidents also increased from 347 in 2020 to 389 in 2021, a jump of 10%. While fatal road accidents killed 375 people in 2020, some 409 people died last year. The comparison of the proportion of fatal accidents to overall accidents also highlights an increase in the fatality ratio. While in 2020, around 43% of total accidents were fatal, it was 45% in 2021. Police and road safety officers, meanwhile, attributed the rise in accidents to the increase in the traffic volume as 2021 saw the government easing restrisctions on public movement. These claims are substantiated by the monthly analysis of the data, which reveals that the maximum number of accidents occurred in the second half of the year. “The increase is largely because of the rise in traffic volume. From private to public transportation like buses, the overall mobility increased in the second half of the year when businesses started to function full-fledged, corporate offices started calling 50% of their staff to office, and schools and colleges opened up. However, the rise in road accidents was still subdued,” said a road safety officer. While the overall accidents data was still lower in 2021 than the pre-pandemic times (1073 in 2019), road safety experts said it could largely be attributed to the fact that a section of people was still working from home and the traffic volume had yet not reached the 2019 levels. “The increased number of deaths suggest that the severity of accidents increased. This is not surprising because the vehicles on the roads were still less and that would lead to speeding,” city-based road safety expert Sewa Ram told TOI. “A deeper analysis of data would, most likely, suggest that things have largely been the same in terms of the conditions of the black spots in the city.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/road-crashes-rise-by-10-in-2021-over-400-died-in-accidents-in-city/articleshow/88906699.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Debt-ridden BSF man used NSG posting to commit Rs 125 crore fraud||GURUGRAM: A deputy commandant of the BSF, who was arrested on Thursday for allegedly swindling Rs 125 crore after promising real estate companies construction contracts on the NSG campus in Manesar, had applied for voluntary retirement and was planning to flee the country soon, police have learnt. Praveen Yadav, the police said, had realised that the companies from whom he had taken the money and awarded bogus contracts had become suspicious of his motives as no construction had begun on the NSG campus even after two months. Some of them had even started to ask for a refund. On Thursday, Yadav was arrested from the city along with his wife Mamta, sister Rituraj and a property dealer, Dinesh. “He had applied for voluntary retirement from the BSF and was planning to get out of the country somehow. His application was under process,” said a senior police officer. Originally from Nuh, Yadav had joined the BSF in 2012. As deputy commandant, he was posted on deputation in the construction wing on the NSG campus in 2019. There, he was responsible for supervising all the construction work that took place in the compound. His deputation, however, ended in May last year. But by then, Yadav was neck-deep in debt. After joining the BSF, Yadav had started to invest in share trading. It soon turned out to be an addiction. Despite making losses, he continued with his investments after borrowing money from people. When he left the NSG campus last year, Yadav had to pay around Rs 50 crore to his debtors. That is when he hatched the plan of cheating real estate companies with fake construction tenders. Having worked in the construction wing on the NSG campus, Yadav was familiar with the process of issuing tenders. Dinesh, the property dealer, allegedly helped him identify real estate firms and Yadav got in touch with the owners with construction offers. Since he already had access to the NSG compound, Yadav mostly met his targets on the campus, giving them the impression that he was indeed responsible for all constructions that happened there. Yadav also prepared fake documents and got the contractors and firms to sign on them before taking the advance money. With the help of his sister Rituraj, who works with a private bank with its branch on the NSG campus, Yadav allegedly opened an account in the name of “Office of GC (Garrison) Station HQ, NSG Manesar”. This account was used for receiving the money from the companies. The entire amount was then transferred to the current account of another company that Yadav had opened with his wife and sister. Yadav, the police said, splurged on luxury vehicles and maintained a lavish lifestyle. He is also learnt to have bought a few properties with the money. The veil started to lift off the well-hatched plan when the companies began enquiring about the constructions on the campus. After a point, Yadav stopped receiving their calls and went off the radar. On January 9 and 10, four of the companies filed complaints at Manesar police station, claiming to have paid Yadav Rs 125 crore in total. Since the amount involved was huge, a special investigation team (SIT) was formed under ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan, and with the in-charge of the crime unit at Manesar, Sandeep, and officials of the economic offences wing in it. On Thursday, Yadav, his wife Mamta and sister Rituraj were nabbed from the city. Dinesh, the property dealer who helped Yadav, was also picked up. The police have recovered Rs 13.8 crore from them along with 10 luxury vehicles. Rituraj’s husband, who is in the ITBP, is currently on deputation on the NSG campus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/in-debt-bsf-man-used-nsg-posting-for-125cr-fraud/articleshow/88906700.cms||---

Little did she know then that her question, "Why do we suffocate trees by leaving no area for them to breathe?" would soon culminate into a community drive by a group of precocious schoolkids to preserve greenery in Delhi-NCR.During that walk, Saanvi learnt from her father about a Delhi high court order that called for community participation and assistance of schools in protecting trees. Within a few days, Saanvi, a Class 4 student at Pathways School, teamed up with some of her peers to form a 'watch and ward' army. The group has 20 other schoolkids.The kids have geotagged images of areas of concern, collated data and incorporated inputs from local residents welfare associations (RWAs) and are ready to make a presentation to the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG). They have covered areas such as DLF 1-5, Golf Course Road and Sector 29.In December, the kids would meet to discuss their action plan but the third wave of the pandemic has shifted their meetings online. They rely on WhatsApp, Zoom and Padlet, which they use to upload and verify data and track progress.“Our teachers have helped make us comfortable with digital tools. So, we talk on a WhatsApp group, hold Zoom meetings and collect data on Padlet. If anybody has inputs or suggestions, we incorporate that too,” said Fateh Jahan Singh Dhaliwal (12), a student of The Shri Ram School.The kids recently submitted a presentation on the issue of concrete around trees in the capital to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) commissioner, seeking immediate corrective measures. Now, they want to do the same in Gurgaon.“It is not just a Delhi problem. I see so many trees in my city with concrete around them, which is why they decay and die. We need trees because air pollution is such a big problem. My teachers motivated and helped me understand the subject. They also showed me how to collate data,” Saanvi said, adding that she takes inspiration from Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg.“Saanvi is a curious and motivated kid. When I told her what happens to trees with concrete around them and the court saying school kids could make a difference, she became excited and wanted to fight for this cause,” said her father Suhail Sehgal, a lawyer.Daneya Choudhary (12), a Vasant Valley School student and a 'Watch and Ward' member, said, “We are putting all the data on a common link. We will meet with the MCG commissioner and request him to launch a drive against laying of concrete around trees.”A few other kids, who are learning to code, plan to launch an app to track the areas of concern. The app, the students said, could be handled by the community and used by civic bodies to take swift action. “A few of us already know the basics of coding, and we know a few people who can help in developing the app,” said Aryan Mago (12), a student of The Shri Ram School.Supportive parents have made all of this possible. "As parents, we can only answer their questions and believe in them. The rest depends on their efforts and their education at school. All we can do now is help them organise the meetings and document their findings and suggestions,” said Kapil Mago, Aryan's father.The parents are also helping kids identify some of the areas of concern, but said that most of the work thereafter is done by the kids. “These kids are self-driven and have developed an eye for places where trees have concrete around them. We also help by identifying the spots where the problem exists,” said Shivangini Chaudhary, Daneya’s mother.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/little-eco-warriors-team-up-to-free-trees-of-concrete/articleshow/88906701.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||MCG yet to start repair work of Pataudi Road||GURUGRAM: For over three years now, hundreds of motorists have been forced to travel on the broken, battered stretch of the Pataudi Road near Harsaru village. Last month, after repeated pleas, the MCG finally decided to start the repair of this 650-metre stretch, but just when the work began, it had to be halted due to the ban imposed on construction activity owing to increasing pollution in the city. However, even though it has been over 20 days since that ban has been lifted, the work has not resumed and the MCG has failed to provide any credible reason for the delay. This has led to an increase in the misery of daily commuters, who have no other alternate route. In fact, after the weekend rain, the condition of this road has gone from bad to worse. Earlier this week, there was a huge traffic jam on this stretch of the road, as vehicles moved at a snail’s pace due to the non-existent road. A majority of the residents living in this area are heavily dependent on this pot-holed road and have raised numerous complaints demanding a re-carpeting of the road. The MCG has also sanctioned Rs 1.13 crore for this revamp. The Pataudi Road is one of the crucial stretches which provides connectivity to newly developed sectors along the Dwarka expressway and connects it with the rest of the city. The residents of the area say that the road has been in terrible shape and motorists have also gotten injured after falling down due to potholes on the road. "This road is a lifeline for us but it is in a really bad shape and now with the movement of heavy dumpers, it is no longer motorable. The entire stretch has developed huge craters and potholes that make travel difficult and many motorists have fallen and injured themselves. If the civic body is carrying out some work then it should ensure that it is done in a time bound manner," said Bhupinder Narula, a resident of Pyramid Urban Homes-2. "Travel on this stretch is nothing but a nightmare as the poor condition of the road leads to frequent traffic congestion, besides causing damage to our vehicles. It becomes more dangerous after sunset as the stretch is poorly lit as well," Shantanu Mukherjee, a resident of Sector 90. On its part, the MCG says that they will resume the work soon and it will take around 2-3 months for it to be completed. "We had started the work in December last year, but due to the ban on construction activities the restoration work stopped. Even when it was lifted, there was a shortage of construction materials and hike in prices due to the operational halt of crusher units, which took a few days to streamline. In the last few days, the weather condition was not conducive to carry out the road repair work. We will begin the work soon and it will take another 2-3 months to complete it," the MCG official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mcg-yet-to-start-repair-work-of-pataudi-road/articleshow/88906702.cms||---

According to the police, the incident took place on January 9 and the accused, who has been identified as Pramod, was on a run since then. Both the girl and the arrested man live in the same village. Uttam Kumar, SHO of Sector 142 police station said, “The complaint was given at the station by the minor girl's brother who stated that his sister had gone to a shop in the village on January 9 in the evening when Pramod, who lives in the same village, abducted and raped her. The minor girl later came back home and narrated her ordeal to her family members.” The case was registered on January 12 and the police had received an information regarding the accused’s location on January 13. “After registering the case, teams were formed to nab him. A team carried out a search at his house but he was absconding. On Thursday evening, we received a tip-off regarding Pramod's movement following which teams were sent and he was arrested from Sector 143 metro station area,” the SHO said. The investigation revealed that Pramod is an electrician and a native of Sambhal district in UP. Further, he has another case registered against him in Ghaziabad. “He had a kidnapping case registered against him at Vijay Nagar police station in Ghaziabad. The incident had taken place in February and Pramod was later out on bail,” police informed. On January 12, he was booked under Section 376 (punishment for sexual assault) of the IPC as well as under relevant sections of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act.

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Vax drive-ins on Sunday for teens, booster shots||GURUGRAM: The health department will hold drive-throughs at Ambience Mall and Cyber Hub on Sunday to vaccinate those aged between 15 and 17 years as well as people eligible for booster shots. The drive-in will start from 10am onwards and jabs will be administered on a first-come-first-served basis. Recipients will need to register on the CoWIN portal and bring a document along for age proof. “The protocol will be the same as followed in the previous drives in the city. There will be 300 slots in each category, i.e., for teenagers and booster doses, at each site,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Recipients will be inoculated at the entry of the parking point after they show the valid document to the vaccinator. They will have to remain in their vehicle for about 30 minutes in the parking areas of the mall after receiving the injection. In case of any adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI), recipients can blink their vehicle indicator light to inform the officers present at the spot. An ambulance will be kept on standby near the session site. The lift lobby in the parking basement will be turned into an AEFI room. Meanwhile, as many as 2,236 people in the 15-17 age group were vaccinated in Gurugram on Friday. A total of 11,679 people in the 18-44 group took the shots. In the 45-59 age category, 1,203 people were inoculated while 1,174 people aged above 60 years got jabs. A total of 654 healthcare workers and 263 frontline workers also got vaccinated. The fifth day of the booster vaccination drive in the city was similar to Day 1 with a low turnout as only 1,682 recipients got the jabs. The health department had opened 10,000 slots — 5,000 for CoWIN-registered recipients and 5,000 for walk-ins — at 77 session sites. Nearly 38,000 healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities are eligible for the booster dose in Gurugram.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/vax-drive-ins-on-sunday-for-teens-booster-shots/articleshow/88906705.cms||---
---||Noida||Milne bhi nahi aaya? Pulls & pitfalls of digital campaign||Noida: If followers were as intangible as blessings, this would be a breeze.Striding out with hands folded, knocking on doors, hugging wellwishers and touching the elderly’s feet, soaking in the adulation of cronies shouting ‘zindabad’ slogans, and feeling blessed by the voter. This is a politician’s comfort zone, a campaign routine they know thoroughly. However, the same ‘meet and greet’ through a mobile screen is throwing up an array of challenges before contestants, aspirants and campaign managers of parties with only digital rallies allowed in the state, as of now till January 15, because of the current surge in the Covid pandemic.First is the need to have a healthy follower count and up the digital game on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, which is not a task many candidates who are not as active on digital platforms as they are on the ground can achieve at such short notice. Next comes tracking analytics – impressions, likes, retweets, time spent, etc. Digital marketing firms, which promise to reach more people than anyone else whose proposal you listened to, are there to make life easy but at a cost. The packages can be in the Rs 20-40 lakh bracket, according to campaign sources.Candidates who don’t possess the digital savvy are re-working their budget for social media amplification. Some others are relying on their support base and tech acumen of friends and relatives to handle their social media out of ‘control rooms’, often the living room of a house or a desk at a party office.An assembly poll candidate from the Noida constituency told TOI that an agency approached their team with an offer of designing their digital outreach. “Managing political campaign is a business now. People think politicians have a lot of money, so they come up with figures like Rs 40-50 lakh. ”We have seen these pitches being exaggerated before. Someone will promise that you will reach 10 lakh people in two days by sending bulk messages to each house in one area. But later, you find out the data is fake. Many people are paying a lot of money for these things. Candidates who are not very tech-savvy will fall into this trap,” the candidate said, adding, “There are also companies offering paid followers on different online platforms. One can get a follower for Re 1-1.50.”But contestants are already finding out that noise in cyberspace won’t necessarily convince a voter. Kripa Ram, the BSP candidate from Noida, told TOI, “People want to see me at their doorstep. The Election Commission has banned physical rallies, so we are relying on WhatsApp groups and phone calls. But those who know me are asking questions. In one village I was asked, ‘Tu itna bada ho gya ke milne bhi nahi aya (Have you become so big now that you won’t even meet us?) I had to pay a personal visit,” he said. Agencies involved in political campaign management said rates are pre-decided based on the needs of a candidate. “We are handling the campaign of several candidates in UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab. We use one-to-one messaging via Whatsapp, etc, to help the candidate go live, bulk messaging and other specialised applications which we cannot reveal,” said an IT head of a company based in the city.While campaign strategies are many, the campaigning style is mainly ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. Positive campaigning focuses on a candidate’s personal branding. The negative one targets rivals. “We are associated with different surveyors who provide data about winnable candidates. This election will remain virtual, so our target is to increase a candidate’s reach. Grouping is done according to the taste of an audience and education, caste and aspirations. There are positive and negative campaigns,” said Ritesh Ranjan, the founder of a Delhi-based company IT solutions provider, which claims to have handled the campaign of a successful BJP candidate from Bihar. Each company has different teams for handling tech, data of voters, content, UI (user interface design) /UX (user experience) design, etc. UI/UX are designs, layout and elements of banners, posters, etc of a campaign. There are pitfalls to the digital gold rush if an agency is not chosen carefully. “We cannot be sure about the delivery of such agencies because many of these followers vanish during clean-up drives and algorithm changes by online platforms because they are fake followers. The real reach of a person is their organic reach and one should not get into the follower count issue,” said Pankhuri Pathak, the Congress candidate for Noida, adding she is supervising her campaign herself.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/milne-bhi-nahi-aaya-pulls-pitfalls-of-digital-campaign/articleshow/88906706.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Noida: Despite Covid curbs, FIRs in 2021 almost same as 2019||NOIDA: Police in Noida registered 12,609 cases in 2021 — an average of 34 a day, data sourced from the cops showed on Friday. In the last five years, Noida had seen more cases only once, in 2019. There were 9,130 FIRs registered in 2020, 12,610 in 2019, 10,048 in 2018 and 9,929 in 2017, the data showed. The number of crimes in 2021 is a cause for concern, considering that many stayed indoors because of the lockdown because of the second wave. Officers, however, claimed there was a declining trend in serious crimes across the city. In 2021, there were 41 FIRs in connection with rape, 79 for murder, 52 for loot, 125 for rioting, 143 for burglary and 110 for breach of peace. In comparison, 2020 saw 42 FIRs in cases of rape, 81 for murder, 75 for loot, 129 for rioting, 181 for burglary and 143 for breach of peace, among others. The data showed there were no FIRs registered for dacoity and kidnap in 2021 while there were two cases lodged in each category in 2020. It’s been two years that the police commissionerate has started functioning in Noida. In January 2020, the Yogi Aditya-nath government had approved the commissionerate system for Noida along with the state capital Lucknow, considering the size and population of the two districts. Additional director-general Alok Singh had become the first police commissioner of Noida.  In a police commissionerate, the head of the police, usually an IG-rank officer, gets some of the magisterial powers too. Other policing systems are usually headed by an SP or SSP, and the head of the police has to work in association with the district magistrate in ceryain cases. Apart from Noida and Lucknow, Varanasi and Kanpur are the only two other districts that have a commissionerate system of policing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/despite-covid-curbs-firs-in-2021-almost-same-as-2019/articleshow/88906707.cms||---
---||India||Delhi, Mumbai cases fall: Peak in Covid infections or dip in tests?||NEW DELHI: Daily Covid-19 cases dipped sharply in Delhi and Mumbai on Friday but it was unclear whether the decline was on account of falling infections or a discernible drop in testing in the two worst-hit cities during the current wave. India recorded a marginal rise in cases with just under 2.70 lakh infections detected on Friday as compared to 2.64 lakh the day before. Testing across the nation too dropped to 17.87 lakh, down from 18.86 lakh on the previous day. Delhi reported 24,383 fresh cases on Friday, dropping from an all-time high of 28,867 on the previous day. In Mumbai, cases fell for the second day running, with 11,317 new infections emerging on Friday, a dip of 17% over Thursday’s numbers. Both cities saw a significantly lower number of Covid tests conducted on Thursday as compared to the peak in the past eight days. Yet, there was an important difference in the Covid data of the two cities. While the test positivity rate (TPR — the percentage of tests turning positive for Covid) was generally declining in Mumbai, it has been consistently rising in the national capital. Mumbai’s highest TPR (in the last eight days) was 28. 95% recorded on January 7, which had fallen to 20. 6% on Friday. Delhi, on the other hand, returned a TPR of 30. 64% on Friday, the highest in recent months in the capital. Friday’s case count in Delhi came out of 79,578 tests, the second lowest in the past eight days. In Mumbai, 54,924 tests were recorded, the lowest in the past eight days. Data suggests that a rise in the number of tests would lead to higher detection of cases in both cities. But a drop in TPR indicates that Mumbai may have reached its peak in infections while that doesn’t seem to be the case in Delhi. In the national capital, nearly every third sample tested positive for the viral infection on Friday and daily TPRs have consistently risen from 17. 73% on January 7 to 30. 64%. Meanwhile, both cities saw a relatively high number of deaths on Friday although the numbers remained far fewer than those in the second wave of the pandemic. At 34 fatalities, Delhi’s toll on Friday was the highest among all states. Mumbai reported nine deaths, the highest daily toll in the city in five months. The country reported 217 deaths from the virus on Frid ay, the third consecutive day of over 200 fatalities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-mumbai-cases-fall-peak-in-infections-or-dip-in-tests/articleshow/88906708.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||Noida||Noida: Fever patients flocking to OPDs, most testing Covid positive, say doctors||NOIDA: Hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad have been witnessing a surge in patients flocking to OPDs with mild symptoms such as fever, cough and cold and body ache. Most of them, said doctors, were testing positive for Covid. At the District Hospital in Noida, the number of such patients had gone up three times since the last week of December, doctors claimed. “Till last month, we had 100-150 patients coming with complaints like fever, sore throat and body ache. But now, we have been getting anything like 400-450 patients a day. Many of them are testing positive for Covid,” said Dr Vikas Kheria of the hospital. As of now, only those with comorbidities and breathing problems are being advised hospitalisation, added Dr Kheria. The situation is no different at Jaypee hospital. “In the latest phase of the pandemic, the virus is spreading much faster, but it is less virulent. This means it will not go deep down and affect the lungs, but will infect the upper body airways. This will lead to symptoms like fever, sore throat and body ache. Over 60-100 patients are coming to us with similar mild symptoms and a majority of them are testing positive. Hospitalisations are only for patients who have fever for over three days along with comoribities like diabetes and hypertension,” said Dr Shovana Veshnavi, consultant at the department of internal medicine at Jaypee hospital. At Sharda Hospital, doctors are attending to 40-60 OPD patients every day. “We have started a flu clinic near the entrance to the hospital to ensure our staff and other patients are safe. In a majority of the cases, the symptoms are mild. Such patients are being advised medication and a week of home isolation,” said Dr Ajit Kumar of Sharda Hospital. At the hospitals in Ghaziabad, a similar situation is being faced by doctors. “The number of patients complaining about fever has increased to around 100 a day. However, the fear among people is quite less this time compared to the previous wave. Along with proper counselling, most people coming to OPDs with mild symptoms are being prescribed medicines and home isolation,” said Dr Upasana Arora, the director of Yashoda Hospital in Ghaziabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/fever-patients-flocking-to-opds-most-testing-positive-say-docs/articleshow/88906709.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Police have recovered 20 two-wheelers from their possession.  According to the police, the accused have been identified as Salman, a resident of Mathura and Sumit Chand, a resident of Delhi. “On Friday, a team from Sector 24 police station where carrying out a routine check at Sector 12-22 roundabout, when a suspect vehicle was stopped. The two failed to show documents of the vehicle and were taken into custody. The bike was found to be stolen,” Ranvijay Singh, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida said.During sustained interrogation, they disclosed about 19 more two-wheelers in their possession. “The accused revealed that they used to steal the motorcycles from Delhi NCR and hand them over to Sanjay Arora, a native of Hisar in Haryana. Arora used to change the chassis number, number plate and engine number of the vehicle and sell the vehicles in different states,” Singh said.Police said that the gang has been active since 2012 and has sold over 100 vehicles. “Apart from Arora, involvement of another accomplice identified as Pintu has also come to light. The vehicles which have been seized were also going to be handed to Arora,” the ADCP said. The accused were paid hefty amount in return from Arora and loved having a lavish lifestyle. “The accused enjoyed the act of stealing and wanted to make quick money. The accused would break the locks of the vehicles within seconds and flee with them. They kept changing their whereabouts in order to avoid arrest. We are getting in touch with Haryana police to nab Arora and Pintu,” Singh said.  Arrested accused Sumit has 12 cases against him while Salman had 8 cases against his name. Police have recovered 20 two-wheelers, two fake number plates and three hooks,which they used to break the locks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/gang-of-two-wheeler-thieves-arrested-20-vehicles-seized/articleshow/88906710.cms||---

Mysuru saw 803 cases, followed by Tumakuru 796, Hassan 654, Dakshina Kannada 639, Mandya 554 and Kolar 502. Only four districts — Bagalkot, Haveri, Koppal and Yadgir — reported cases in two digits. The spike comes on the back of the state conducting the highest number of tests ever in a day: 2.2 lakh. The state's daily positivity rate was nearly 13%. BBMP area alone saw over one lakh tests and the test positivity rate stood at 19.6 %. Over 1.7 lakh of the day's tests were RT-PCR, said to be the gold standard for Covid. The active caseload in Karnataka crossed 1.4 lakh on the day, of which more than a lakh cases are in Bengaluru. Across the state, 2,195 patients are in hospitals as of Friday. Of them, 105 are in ICU and 35 on ventilator. The state's daily case count was the highest in nearly eight months, after May 22, 2021 when it reported 31,183 cases in the thick of the second wave. Bengaluru's tally was the highest in 250 days. The city had reported more cases -- 20,897 -- on May 9, 2021.As per the state war room data, the test positivity rate on January 13 in Bengaluru Urban (inclusive of BBMP) was 21%, followed by 19.5% in Bengaluru Rural, while the state's test positivity rate was 14.1 %.

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court reinstates CISF man arrested in Pocso case||MUMBAI: A 32-year-old CISF constable dismissed from service in April 2018 after his arrest in a Pocso case for allegedly sexually assaulting a four-year-old, was reinstated by the Bombay high court on Friday. His lawyer said the FIR was mala fide and no disciplinary inquiry was conducted before dismissing him. The HC judgment by a bench of Justice P B Varale and Justice N R Borkar said, “Dismissal from service is the harshest punishment and it is akin to an economic death penalty for an employee. Therefore, a more objective approach was required to be adopted by the disciplinary authority while dispensing with the inquiry. However, it appears from the order impugned that the disciplinary authority had got swayed away by the fact that the petitioner is involved in a heinous crime and conducting of a disciplinary inquiry may hurt the sentiments and emotions of local residents and fellow members of the force. None of the circumstances, which the disciplinary authority has taken into consideration, can be said to be sufficient to dispense with a disciplinary inquiry.” The constable was served his dismissal order while in judicial custody. He has been out on bail since. The department had invoked CISF rules that permit not holding an inquiry. The CISF disciplinary authority had decided that it was not practicable to hold a disciplinary inquiry after considering that it "may hurt the sentiments and emotions of local residents and fellow members of the force" and "producing the victim as a prosecutor witness in a disciplinary inquiry is not feasible. The victim cannot be further subjected to trauma of cross-examination". It also said the constable was already under arrest and would be in custody for a long period and had "committed a heinous crime". The bench, after hearing the constable's lawyer Rajeev Kumar and Ashok Shetty for the CISF, quashed his dismissal order and reinstated him in service "with all consequential benefits". Kumar said the "mala fides'' on part of an assistant commandant, who allegedly in the past was "angry with the petitioner (constable)", was writ large as an order of suspension was passed even before registration of the crime and the medical report of the child showed no alleged injury on her private parts. The HC, though, made it clear the CISF is not precluded from initiating a departmental inquiry against him or even suspending him after reinstatement, during pendency of disciplinary inquiry in accordance with law. HC said, "Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, the orders impugned cannot be sustained." The FIR was filed in March 2018. A preliminary inquiry was conducted and on April 4, he was dismissed.

She was brought to your police station but you allowed her to go. What is in the report is absolutely irrelevant. The senior PI has not understood what we want... you have failed in your duty,” said the HC bench while hearing the woman’s two sons through advocate Shehzad Naqvi, who sought its intervention to have the police produce her, adding if it should ask the police commissioner to form a SIT (to locate her). The HC bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav said to the prosecutor, “Your DCP said he would move heaven and earth to find her. Why are you taking a doctor’s opinion now and submitting opinion on the woman? How is all this relevant? Who is asking you now to take medical opinion. A woman suffering from dementia is missing from police station. The officer is just trying to shift the blame,” the bench said. The prosecutor sought some time for the police to continue its search for her. The HC has posted the matter to the end of the month after being informed by additional public prosecutor Sangita Shinde that the DCP who had assured that police would try and trace her tested positive for Covid-19 and is in quarantine. “He can appear before us on the next date via video conferencing, doesn’t have to appear physically,” said the bench, not accepting the prosecutor’s offer of bringing in the senior PI instead. “The report is not at all satisfactory. Instead of stating what steps have been taken to trace the lady, the report makes an attempt to show that the lady was not taken care of by her family. The issue pertains to what steps did police take to trace her as assured by the DCP. Your senior inspectors need some training,” said the bench, asking testily “how is this man even a senior PI?” When Naqvi said “he (the PI) is from Kasarvadavli police station”, the bench, unhappy with the report, retorted saying it is “shameful” and told the public prosecutor, “You should have gone through it…Please see the last two paras. It is about conduct of family members.” On February 13, 2021, the woman went missing from her home in Kasarvadavli, Thane. Her sons filed a missing persons complaint the next day. She was found on February 16, in Kherwadi area and brought to Kherwadi police station at 10am. The court was, however, informed that by 8pm, she had left the police station on her own and has been missing since.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/failed-your-duty-hc-slams-cop-over-missing-sr-woman/articleshow/88906732.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||OBC, EWS quotas cut PG medical seats for general category by 42%||MUMBAI: Competition for post-graduate medical seats just got intense. The implementation of the 27% other backward classes (OBC) and 10% economically weaker section (EWS) quota in the all-India seats has had a huge impact on post-graduate seats for the 2022 academic year. As the seat matrix was released by the medical counselling committee on Friday, student intake in the general category has seen a 42% reduction, or 2,747 seats. In 2021, the all-India quota had 6,556 spots for open merit students. This year, those numbers are down to 3,809. Moreover, what will make the admission process even tougher is that a general rule that was applicable till last year will no longer be possible now: If a particular branch in a public medical school has four seats, of which 50% or two will be for the all-India quota (AIQ), an open category candidate will now get a chance to join it once in two years, as rotational reservation will be put in place. Earlier, if any department had two seats in the all-India quota, we made sure that one seat was available for an open category candidate. The other seat would be rotated among the reserved categories, just SC (scheduled castes) and ST (scheduled tribes) till last year. Now, the general category candidate will get that chance once in two years,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, former head of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research. For instance, at BJ Government Medical College, Pune, there is no seat for a general category candidate who may want to pursue MD in physiology. Of the two seats available, one opened up for OBC and the other for ST. The wait for an open category candidate just got longer and despite the scores, there won’t be an open spot. Several colleges which have fewer seats in certain branches will not be able to offer any seat to general category candidates this year. “Candidates have the scores but seats have reduced. Cut-off scores will go several notches higher,” said Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/obc-ews-quotas-cut-pg-med-seats-for-gen-category-by-42/articleshow/88906729.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Mumbai||Waive property tax, charges for 1 year: Covid-hit hoteliers to Maharashtra CM||MUMBAI: The Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) has requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to offer the industry at least a one-year waiver of property tax, water charges, electricity charges and excise licence fee to cope with “a series of business losses” due to Covid-related restrictions since March 2020. The hotel and restaurant industry in the state contributes 35% to the country’s overall hospitality sector turnover. “The first lockdown and restrictions that followed thereafter had brought the sector to a standstill for almost eight months. Even as the industry was hoping for some revival after November 2020, the second wave stormed in by April-May 2021, thereby totally deflating the business and the industry’s hopes. According to industry estimates, financial losses from these two waves were so severe that around 30% of hotels and restaurants in the country shut permanently and the remaining continue to run losses even today,” said Gurubaxish Singh Kohli, vice-president, FHRAI, in his letter to the chief minister. The hospitality industry has estimated business losses totalling Rs 1.4 lakh crore, leaving around 5 crore employees jobless in the country. Kohli said the industry was looking forward to the new year and the current wedding season for some damage control. The sudden surge in Covid cases due to the Omicron variant and subsequent restrictions and closures, though, “have shattered all hopes of the industry... the business in hotels and restaurants is less than 10% in all major locations. This situation will multiply the extensive damages of the sector and it would take nothing less than 5 years for the industry to return to the pre-pandemic levels,” the letter stated. In this backdrop, the federation has sought “life-saving support” in the form of waiver of property tax, water charges, electricity charges and excise fees for minimum a year. Meanwhile, the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) has requested Thackeray to extend the operating hours for dine-in services in restaurants and bars from 10pm at present to 12am, saying the current timings are financially unviable for the industry to operate. It has also requested specific guidelines for round-the-clock food services. In another letter, to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, AHAR has stated that frequent disruptions have hit the industry, and has requested a 50% reduction in licence fees. The AHAR representation, led by president Shivanand Shetty, also called on NCP chief Sharad Pawar and requested his support as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-hit-hoteliers-to-cm-waive-property-tax-charges-for-1-yr/articleshow/88906756.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Soon, similar drives are expected to be conducted in schools and junior colleges across the city. Educational institutions are urging teenagers, especially class 10 and 12 students, to get the jabs before physical board exams begin in March. Over six lakh Mumbaikars, aged 15-18, are eligible to be administered Covaxin—the second dose is to be taken 28 days after the first jab. Principals said that parents are reluctant to take children to the jumbo centres for inoculation. “We have around 1,700 students eligible for vaccination. If a camp is set up in the school, parents will be at ease. Also, they are looking for free doses,” said the principal of a Goregaon school and junior college. The principal of a Santacruz school, which has around 200 eligible students, pointed out that BMC students have been vaccinated. “Now private and aided school students should also be given the shots at the earliest,” the principal added. The state education board is drawing up the list of exam centres. Details of vaccinated students will be key while deciding on adding more centres. “The number of students writing class 10 and 12 exams will be high. While exam centres will have to be increased, students’ vaccination will help in allocating centres,” said an official. —Sandhya Nair Watch Mumbai: BMC, NGO launch teenagers’ vaccination drive at St John’s Universal School before board exams||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/goregaon-school-to-host-vax-camp-for-teens-today/articleshow/88906759.cms||---

On January 7, the BMC Covid update showed that one of the highest number of tests — 72,442 — were conducted in the city. On Friday, the corresponding number was 54,924 tests. Till the Omicron wave began on December 21-22, the city’s daily test score was around 35,000, but the exponential rise in cases forced the authorities to more than double the volume of tests. However, with the health ministry advising against testing asymptomatic people, the BMC has had to revise its strategy. A senior BMC public health department official said, “We have been told to not test people at railway stations and markets, but we plan to collect some random samples to keep ahead of the virus.” The plan, said officials, is to conduct around 60,000 tests a day. “Mumbai is too crowded a city to not test people. An asymptomatic person can still infect many others, hence it is important for this person to stay in isolation or home quarantine,” said a senior official. Civic health officials said the Covid test positivity rate has been dropping in Mumbai—from 28% on Sunday to 20.6% on Friday. “The test positivity rate could increase now that we will focus on symptomatic people who may all test positive,” the official said. At present, the daily positivity rate for rapid antigen test has dropped to 5% as against 30% for RT-PCR. “RT-PCR positivity rate had risen to 72.4% last week, but it has also dropped by more than half,” said a doctor. Even the home testing rate is around 4%. Over 1 lakh people have reported their home testing reports to the BMC so far. “Home tests were 900 on January 1, but their numbers has increased to over 2,000 now,” said the civic official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/civic-body-wants-to-conduct-60000-tests-daily-in-mumbai/articleshow/88906762.cms||---

The Centre, meanwhile, said on Friday the state does not have any shortage of Covaxin and added that Maharashtra has over 24 lakh unutilised doses. The state has an estimated 60.6 lakh people in the 15-17 age bracket, of whom 24,32,718 have taken their first shots already. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said there is enthusiasm among the group to get vaccinated, but footfall is low since schools are shut now. An average of 1.5 lakh children are taking the shots every day. Friday, though, saw a slight drop due to Makar Sankranti. The state has also administered 2,68,596 booster doses till now, including 66,212 in the city. In Mumbai, more than 1.2 lakh teenagers have got vaccinated. In Thane and Pune, where vaccination turnout has been good since the first day, 2.16 lakh and 2.24 lakh children , respectively, have got vaccinated already. Civic officials said their numbers will see an uptick once the drive is started in colleges and schools. Reacting to media reports that districts that are seeing a faster uptake of doses among the teenage population are running out of Covaxin, the Centre said that Maharashtra has over 24 lakh unutilised doses of Covaxin. “An additional 6.35 lakh doses have been received on Friday. As per their weekly consumption data available on CoWin, the average consumption by Maharashtra for Covaxin to cover the eligible beneficiaries for the 15-17 years and for precaution dose is almost 2.94 lakh doses per day. Therefore, the state has adequate vaccine doses for about 10 days to cover the eligible beneficiaries with Covaxin,” the Centre said. It added that the state had 1.24 crore unutilised doses of Covishield as well. “With an average consumption of 3.57 lakh per day, this will sustain for more than 30 days,” the Centre said in a release. State officials, though, said there was no shortage of Covaxin anywhere at present, but if the vaccination of teenagers picks up pace, they could quickly run out of these doses. “Stocks are getting replenished, so we are not worried as of now,” said Dr Desai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/40-teens-vaxxed-in-maha-24l-doses-still-to-be-utilised/articleshow/88906765.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai cases dip 6 days of week, Omicron wave’s likely peaked||MUMBAI: The January 9-15 week is most likely to be the peak of the Omicron Covid-wave in the city, said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force. As case peaks are followed by a rise in severe cases and deaths, Joshi said the next two weeks would be important. The point of concern is the presence of the Delta variant that is leading to lung involvement and severity. “We cannot relax yet and need to wear an N95 mask,” he added. Genome sequencing results declared on Friday revealed 238 more Omicron patients in the state, taking the total to 1,605 so far. According to state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, two of these patients are from Mumbai, three from Navi Mumbai, 197 from Pune municipal corporation region, three from Pune and one from Akola. While cases in the Mumbai region have been increasing over the last fortnight, cases in Pune and Nagpur are only beginning to post sharp rises. “The Omicron peak is going to be geography-centric. The peak for Mumbai will be different from Pune and Delhi. The peaks for various municipalities within the Mumbai metropolitan region itself will be at different times,” explained Joshi. The weekly trend shows Mumbai’s test positivity rate has been hovering between 20% and 22% and hospitalisations haven’t been going up. “We need to separate the number of people admitted with Covid (people who get admitted for a procedure and are diagnosed with Covid) as against the number of people admitted due to Covid to get a correct picture of severity,” he said. With Friday’s cases, the total caseload of the state rose to 71.2 lakh with 1.4 lakh deaths. In the last one week, the state has reported a decline in cases on three days, while Mumbai has reported a drop on six days. Active cases in the state rose to 2.6 lakh but Mumbai’s active cases dropped to 84,352 from over 1 lakh two days ago. State officials said the state’s decline is being slowed down by the surge in other districts which has just begun. “Once the cases reach districts where vaccine coverage is low, we will get a clear idea regarding its severity. Districts have been asked to ensure implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour and increase vaccine coverage,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-cases-dip-6-days-of-week-omicron-waves-likely-peaked/articleshow/88906768.cms||Bhavika Jain

The award was declared after reviewing performance of 29 power distribution companies across the country. Apart from infrastructure and reforms in power systems, MSEDCL has been at the forefront with the use of modern technology in its day-to-day operations.MSEDCL chairman and managing director Vijay Singhal said, “The state power utility firm has made effective use of new concepts, rendered quality services to consumers and during challenging times such as cyclones and floods, we have worked 24x7 to restore power to maximum consumers.” MSEDCL was also adjudged third in the “performance improvement” category at the same event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. The power firm was also appreciated for its work during the Covid pandemic. During the 2020 lockdown, MSEDCL consumers were given concessions, deferment of fixed charges for high-end consumers and an instalment facility to pay bills pending for several months from March 2020.MSEDCL provided power to a 650-bed Covid centre set up by the Panvel civic body at Kalamboli at a cost of Rs 1 crore. The huge costs involved were due to replacing old infrastructure with new cables, distribution transformers and substations. Officials said it was instrumental in enabling maximum consumers to pay power bills online. Despite the coal shortage, there was zero load shedding, said Singhal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/msedcl-beats-28-cos-to-win-best-state-power-utility-award/articleshow/88906770.cms||Somit Sen

Though the names of drug dealers from the valley often crop up, this time the crime branch team went all the way to Kashmir to arrest Khan.Police have not recovered anything from his possession but said he is a big catch as he may spill the beans on other drug syndicates. Khan’s name figured during investigation in a case where four members of a family from Powai were arrested at Dahisar toll naka with charas worth Rs 14.4 crore. Police had recovered charas from the false cavities of the car’s door and boot panel.The four members of a family were identified as Bandu Udanshive, 52, his wife Clera, 52, daughter Cynthia, 23, and son-in-law Jasar Jahangir Shaikh, 24. During interrogations and scrutiny of their mobile phones, police stumbled upon a few audio clips where they were heard discussing drugs and the money trail. Police had also arrested an income tax staffer, Satish Bapu, in the case who would regularly buy charas from the gang and sell it to various clients in Mumbai.Police said the modus operandi of the gang was to travel to J&K with the women to evade checking at toll nakas. During their interrogations, the accused told police they would procure drugs from Gulzar, Shafi and Rahman in Kashmir; in Mumbai, they sold drugs to Yashwant Patil, Uzair Khan and Rosy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/peddler-arrested-from-kashmir-in-14-4cr-drugs-case/articleshow/88906771.cms||Ahmed Ali

If technology is not used by the general public, then that technology is of no use. BMC is providing facilities to common man using technology. Citizens should be informed about what the BMC does every day,” Thackeray said.“Citizens always feel that my BMC, my government, should communicate easily with me.

Initially, ATS was probing the case, however, subsequently, it was entrusted to the NIA. The role of NIA us under suspicion,” Khan said after the meeting. Khan alleged that NIA is making efforts to weaken the case at the behest of the NDA government led by PM Narendra Modi. “An anti-Hindu image of the ATS is being created to defame the state government and ATS in view of the crucial assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. In such circumstances, we demand that senior ATS officials be present in court to ensure a fair trial...,’’ Khan said. While meeting Agarwal, Khan submitted that the then ATS chief Hemant Karkare had probed the case and arrested Pragya Thakur, Colonel Purohit among others. After the probe was given to NIA, charges under MCOCA were dropped without assigning reason, efforts are being made to secure acquittal of accused. As per official records, of 223 witnesses, 16 have testified and testimony of 100 has not been recorded yet. “In certain cases, relief has been granted to some accused, it was expected that NIA will appeal against the relief, but so far, there is no movement in that direction,” Khan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/let-ats-be-present-in-court-for-malegaon-trial-cong-demands/articleshow/88906782.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘Bulli Bai’ trio part of ‘Sulli Deals’ too? Mumbai cyber cops seek re-custody||MUMBAI: Seeking re-custody of the three arrested accused in the ‘Bulli Bai’ app case, the Mumbai cybercrime police on Friday alleged that they are suspected to be involved in the ‘Sulli Deals’ case in July 2021 registered with Delhi police, and hence the agency wants to question them further. The Bandra court, however, granted judicial custody to Mayank Rawat (21), a BSc student, and Shweta Singh (18), a class XII passout, from Uttarakhand as their police custody ended Friday afternoon. Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a Bihar youth studying engineering in Bengaluru, is already in judicial custody till January 24. The bail applications of all three accused will be heard on January 17. In court, Singh’s lawyer Chittaranjan Das alleged that his client was slapped by a cyber police officer and forced to confess to crimes she had not committed. DCP (cyber) Rashmi Karandikar has refuted the allegation. A source from the Mumbai cybercrime police said: “This is a false allegation...Singh has told in open court that she was not harmed by anyone during interrogation. She has been provided with medical aid, mask, sanitiser, and other necessities.” But Singh’s sister Manisha told TOI over the phone from Uttarakhand: “The police have mistreated my younger sister. She is innocent and they are trying to make her an accused in the case.” Manisha added: “Her only fault was that she followed the social media account operated by the main accused [Neeraj Bishnoi] who is in Delhi police’s custody. Even he [Bishnoi] has said that my sister has no role in the crime. Das has brought the issue in front of the court after learning that the police slapped her three to four times while in custody.” On Friday, Rawat tested positive for Covid. He has been admitted at Kalina’s Covid Care Centre, where Jha, who had tested positive five days ago, is put up. Rawat’s lawyer Sandeep Sherkhane claimed that his client has been falsely implicated in the case. “He has a very limited role; he had just followed the link which was forwarded to him by the main accused who had misguided and brainwashed him. Rawat did not create the app or the link,” Sherkhane said. Jha’s lawyers, Arti Deshmukh and Shivam Deshmukh, pointed out that though their client has been in custody for almost a week, the cybercrime police now claim that they want more time to recover data from the seized phones and laptops and have submitted an application to deny his bail plea, which is not understandable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bulli-bai-trio-part-of-sulli-deals-too-cyber-cops-seek-re-custody/articleshow/88906785.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Thane||Maharashtra has 1,324 black spots where maximum road accidents occur||MUMBAI: The state government on Friday ordered a review of 1,324 black spots (accident-prone sites) for 2022, of which 628 have been identified by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 381 by the state PWD and 315 by urban local bodies across Maharashtra.  State transport commissioner Anil Parab, while addressing the State Road Safety Council's 11th meeting at Sahyadri guest house this week, directed government officials to ensure that “saving lives should be the main concern while planning new road safety measures for this year”. “Due to crashes, several innocent people are killed and it is a financial and mental trauma for their families for life. So, it is imperative that we focus on saving lives and reducing fatalities on the road,” Parab said at the meeting, adding that officials should seek cooperation from local NGOs in curbing mishaps on highways.  Of the 1,324 black spots where maximum accidents are reported, the state government has completed permanent road safety measures at 931 locations, while temporary measures have been completed at 359 locations. “All the black spots will now be reviewed to ensure that mishaps don't recur,” said joint transport commissioner (road safety) J B Patil.  Parab said road signs on traffic rules, especially speed limits at various locations, should be conspicuous. He said there should be trauma centres and healthcare facilities close to highways so that victims can be rushed during the golden hour and lives can be saved. “Vehicles such as tractors should have radium stickers on the rear side so that they are visible to oncoming vehicles and there is no collision,” he said.  Additional chief secretary (transport) Ashish Kumar Singh, who was present at the road safety council meeting, said that though there was a dip in the number of mishaps across the state as compared to a year ago, there was still a need to reduce fatalities and injuries in road crashes.  A decision was taken at the meeting to start a web portal for regular updates on crashes on the road — with details such as type of mishap, location, time and cause — and this will be accessible internally to officials from departments which play key roles in road safety. The meeting was attended by representatives from PWD, the health and transport departments, MSRTC, and non-profit organisations such as SAVELife Foundation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maha-has-1324-black-spots-where-maximum-road-accidents-occur/articleshow/88911306.cms||Somit Sen

---||Mumbai||Coconut palm base had gone weak: BMC report||Mumbai: A day after a teenager, Aniruddh Machad, was crushed to death under a coconut palm Andheri (east), an internal report of BMC said that the base of the tree had internally weakened which couldn’t have been identified by visual inspection. Aniruddh (13), a class 8 student of Our Lady of Health School, was the younger of two children. He was flying a kite at Sahar Village around 5.30 pm on Thursday when the palm was uprooted and landed on his head. Aniruddh’s autopsy was carried out on Friday. The report gave his cause of death as "haemorrhage and shock due to multiple injuries." Aniruddh's family is upset that no authority has taken responsibility for the tragedy. Aniruddh’s father, Sujith, said that no representative of any of the authorities concerned had approached the family to make inquiries. He added that the family is too numb with grief to lodge a complaint at this point. “We still don’t know the reason for the crash. Whose job was it to look after the upkeep?,” asked Sujith. The child usually played at Tony Compound the area where he lived with his family. But on Thursday evening, he wanted to fly a kite for Makar Sankranti. “Children often head to the site [of the crash] to play cricket as the road nearby is out of bounds for Metro work. Aniruddh loved playing outdoors but we weren’t sending him out much. On Thursday, we made an exception as he wanted to fly a kite,” said Sujith. Sujith was away from home when the incident took place. His wife called him up about their son being injured. “Other children who saw the palm crash took him to hospital. I reached there around 7pm. When I wasn’t allowed to see him immediately, I sensed wrong,” said Sujith, breaking down. TOI accessed an internal report drafted by the assistant superintendent of gardens, K/East civic ward which said that the tree was “'healthy” and had a girth of approximately 2.5 inches and height of 30 inches. “It cracked from the base and fell on the road. At the time of site inspection, it was seen that the base of the tree was internally weakened and it was impossible to identify by means of visual inspection. The fallen tree has been cut and removed from the road,” the report said. BMC officials said that the road where the tree crashed was in possession of airport authorities who handed it to MMRCL for Metro Line 3 work. “It was observed that the road was barricaded and closed for vehicles. We have requested airport authorities to carry out trimming of overgrown trees and remove dead and dangerous trees,” said the civic report. “The trunk of the palm had rotten and some branches appeared dead... Had the authorities posted a guard, children wouldn’t have been allowed to play and a life could have been saved. We will take up this matter,” said former corporator Nicholas Almeida.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/coconut-palm-base-had-gone-weak-bmc-report/articleshow/88906792.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||RBI may tweak norms for valuing bank investments||Mumbai: In an overhaul of the norms governing the valuation of investments made by a bank, the RBI has proposed a new category for classifying securities — ‘Fair value through profit and loss account (FVTPL)’. This will enable banks, while drawing up their results, to properly value securities such as units issued by bad loan companies in consideration of non-performing assets sold to them. The securities held in FVTPL shall be fair-valued and the resultant gains/ losses shall be directly credited/ debited to the profit and loss account.The RBI has proposed the new category to include securities that currently cannot be classified as long-term holdings under the ‘held to maturity’ category and neither are they part of a bank’s trading portfolio which are held in the ‘available for sale’, or AFS, category. Categorisation of securities has an impact on the net profit that a bank declares. For instance, if the market value of a government security in the AFS category falls by 5%, banks will have to set aside that much money from their profits. However, if the same security is in the held to maturity category, the bank need not make provisions as the bank will get the full amount on maturity. The new category has been proposed in a discussion paper floated by the RBI on Friday. These will be made into regulations once all industry stakeholders submit their feedback. Current norms on classification and valuation of investment portfolio by scheduled commercial banks are largely based on a framework introduced in October 2000 drawing upon the then prevailing global standards and best practices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rbi-may-tweak-norms-for-valuing-bank-investments/articleshow/88906793.cms||---

However, environmentalists have stated that local villagers are using JCBs to simply crush mangroves and make agricultural farming plots, while bunds are being created to do shrimp farming by making smaller water tanks. Times ViewKharghar residents have complained frequently to state authorities for protecting mangroves and wetlands, but it seems there is no fear of the law among land sharks. The only way to protect the precious environment is for the authorities, including forest department and Cidco, to sit up and take stock of the situation. Otherwise, the varied wetland birds and even golden jackals spotted here will soon vanish due to rampant destruction of the wetlands.While a Bombay high court-appointed panel is looking into the issue, the state forest secretary has received the complaint as it is happening on a large scale. Activists said they may resort to a “peaceful” protest as they cannot see further environmental degradation that will directly affect wetland birds and wildlife like golden jackals seen in these parts. “In the last few weeks, vast stretches of mangroves in the intertidal zone have been flattened using JCBs, and agricultural farming is being done on them while shrimp farming has started on natural wetlands by first killing fish found here. Forest officials and other departments must look into our complaints or the entire coastal biodiversity will be finished,” said activist Nareshchandra Singh. Some locals, including activist Seema Tank, spotted greater flamingos and painted storks near sector 17 on Friday, which highlights the point that the intertidal areas must be protected. Member of court-appointed Mangroves Protection Committee, D Stalin, said: “I inspected the damaged Kharghar sites last year, after. It is surprising that no government action was taken in spite of personally reporting this matter...” “A massive land grab is going on at Kharghar node. We have sent an urgent complaint to the chief minister’s office which emailed back to us that the forest secretary has been told to also look into this issue. So, we are hopeful,” said B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation.

The police said that accused, Aditya alias Navush alias Tanmay Mhatre, cheated women from Mumbai, Thane , Kalyan , Raigad, Navi Mumbai, said additional commissioner (crime) Ashok Morale. The police said that a woman had posted her profile and the accused contacted her through the matrimonial site. He befriended her but told her that he needed money and asked if she could lend some. The woman gave him Rs 14.3 lakh and again he asked for Rs 25 lakh. The woman later lodged a complaint at Khadakpada police station in Kalyan. The crime branch was carrying a parallel probe using technical and human intelligence inputs and got a tip-off that the accused was to come to Navi Mumbai to meet another prospective bride where he was nabbed. The police said that during interrogation, they found that he used the same means to cheat other women some outside the state. Morale said, “The accused is married and has a child. He is unemployed so he devised this modus operandi to earn quick money. He would target women, mostly over 30 years of age, and would study a profile in depth. Once he got the confidence, he would pose as a well-settled man to imspress and would then lure the woman into marriage, asked for money under the pretext of a business problem or some financial issue and then cheated them.” The police have appealed to citizens to be wary of such cheats on matrimonial sites, especially those asking for money or insisting on physical relations.

---||Thane||After receiving Rs 4.3 crore waiver, Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik goes on the offensive||THANE: Two days after the MVA government’s controversial decision to waive a penalty of Rs 4.3 crore levied on Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik for regularising his illegal construction in the Chhabhaiya Vihang Garden complex, the emboldened legislator held a press conference protesting his innocence. He blamed a retired IAS officer, saying he had unfairly tagged the project as illegal in a bid to settle scores with Sarnaik during his tenure as commissioner of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).  But the urban development department’s proposal to the cabinet for the waiver clearly outlined the flagrant violations in Sarnaik’s project. It pointed out: He had sought construction TDR for building a school for the TMC; he built the school before building permission was given; he utilised the construction TDR before it was granted and without making an application for its use in the Vihang Garden complex; he went ahead and built four illegal stories each in two buildings in the complex and post-facto applied for regularisation.  On Friday, Sarnaik claimed that every inch of his housing project was accounted for and claimed he would resign if his claims were found untrue. He said his company had followed rules after the urban development department (UDD) allowed builders to get transfer of developmental rights (TDR) if they parted with reserved land and also developed reservation on it.  “We surrendered a reserved plot and also constructed a school for which we were rightfully deemed to get TDR, but the corporation surprisingly delayed transferring the facility into its fold and granting us the benefit. Assuming the TDR would be made available later, we raised additional floors to our project, but to our surprise, the corporation took this opportunity to target us. Surprisingly, several builders who used the system aren’t being questioned at all,” said Sarnaik.  Meanwhile, the BJP’s Thane unit questioned the largesse granted by the state government to its MLA and sought a similar waiver for penalty on all pending property tax dues of residents. “What is the fault of the common tax payer and why should he be burdened with penalties when big netas can go scot free?” questioned BJP group leader Manohar Dumbre.  The cabinet had cleared the waiver to Sarnaik despite strong opposition from the finance department, which said it would serve as a precedent to other such cases. The UDD proposal said Sarnaik had applied to build the municipal school for TMC through construction TDR in 2008. However, he went ahead and built it without building permissions and only later submitted the plans for approval which was granted in 2012. The TDR for this accrued in 2013. But he had already built four illegal floors in two buildings in the Vihang Garden complex in 2012, on the grounds that he was using construction TDR which would later be granted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/after-receiving-4-3-cr-waiver-sarnaik-goes-on-the-offensive/articleshow/88906797.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Many times while issuing e-challan it is difficult to read the number plate and issue proper challans. Safety-wise also, the proper number is required. Also, the standard number plates are required to curb the criminal activity. Along with the drive the original number and documents are also verified,” said Balasaheb Patil, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). The police said that the drive will continue with the usual enforcement on roads.The drive will intensify in the next few days. In the meantime, the police also fined nearly 1,788 rickshaw drivers for carrying passengers over their capacity in view of the current pandemic.The police officer said that for front seat Rs 11.8 lakh fine was collected from the offenders in the first 10 days of 2022. “The offending autos take front seat and hence they have been fined in the special drive,” said the officer.Patil added “It is mandatory for the autos to put up plastic sheet partitions in the auto rickshaw due to the pandemic situation.”The Thane traffic police has urged the motorists to roll back the fancy number plates to original and standard number plate so as to avoid any inconvenience on the road. The cops have fanned out in the streets to take on such offenders, Patil told TOI.The traffic police will also take action against those not wearing helmets or invovlved in other traffic-related offences.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/641-fined-in-drive-against-fancy-number-plates/articleshow/88906798.cms||---

The party has called for a CBI investigation into it. Thane party president and TMC corporator Vikrant Chavan has alleged that a huge racket could be operative in the rental housing scheme wherein flats could be put up for sale in the black market in connivance of a few local political leaders and administration officials who could be illegally selling flats by forging documents.Against the backdrop of cases filed against buyers and some agents for allegedly selling off rental home units in Daighar area, Chavan told the media, on Thursday, that the corporation had failed to keep tabs on the developer opting for the scheme. “The scheme was okayed by the state government several years back wherein private builders would be given additional FSI for constructing these structures and hand them to the local authority. The developers would have to first construct the rental flats and then saleable flats but the party alleged that in several cases, the developers failed to construct the rental tenements even after exhausting the saleable components,” he said. Also, several flats in these rental schemes spread over across the city were being sold in the black market by forging documents. “The documents and the keys to these flats are kept in the headquarters but there is a possibility that some of them are pilfered due to possible connivance of civic officials also. We have demanded a thorough CID or CBI probe in the matter,” said Chavan. Civic officials remained unavailable for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/cong-hints-at-scam-in-rental-hsg-scheme/articleshow/88906799.cms||---

After all, Samanvi was riding pillion on her mother’s scooter when a tipper-truck hit the two-wheeler near Vajarahalli Cross on Kanakapura Road.Her devastated husband Roopesh Naidu has been chanting the same sentences for over 12 hours, “Samanvi get up please…get up Samanvi my child.”The couple was sitting inside the ambulance that left Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences where the girl’s postmortem was carried out on Friday morning. The ambulance travelled straight to Banashankari crematorium where the girl was cremated. Samanvi was the couple’s only child.KS Layout traffic police have arrested the truck driver, Manje Gowda, 45. Investigation revealed that Gowda, in a bid to overtake an autorickshaw, had suddenly swerved to his left and brushed against Amrutha’s gearless scooter moving on the left lane.Ironically, Roopesh, a private firm employee, has been a very active traffic warden, first with KS Layout traffic police and now with Hulimavu traffic police. The entire staff of the police stations was present during Samanvi’s cremation. Roopesh lives near Raghuvanahalli, off Kanakapura Road. Amrutha is a film and TV serial actor. The grand-daughter of legendary Harikatha exponent Gururajulu Naidu, Amrutha is herself a Harikatha artiste. Amrutha and Samanvi were a big draw in a TV reality show till recently. Small and big screen actors were present at the Banashankari crematorium.Tara Anuradha, well-known cine actor and a judge in the reality show where Samanvi had participated, told media over the phone: “Samanvi was an adorable child and it is difficult to digest the news of her death. We had worked with her for eight weeks. She was a natural and was performing well with the other 11 kids. Finally, Samanvi was eliminated only because Amrutha is pregnant and the show demanded the participants to dance,” Tara said.“We were at a meeting with senior police officers when the walkie-talkie beeped a message saying a woman and girl were injured in the accident on Kanakapura Road and were taken to hospital. We rushed to the hospital and were shocked to learn that the girl was none other than the daughter of our traffic warden Roopesh Naidu,” a staffer from KS Layout traffic police station said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/kin-others-bid-adieu-to-reality-shows-child-contestant/articleshow/88906810.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Guest lecturers’ pay hiked, to be appointed on academic-year basis||BENGALURU: In a major relief for guest lecturers, the government increased their salaries and decided to appoint them for one academic year instead of a semester. Minister for higher education CN Ashwath Narayan announced the benefits in a press meet at Vidhana Soudha on Friday. As per the new strategy, four types of classifications have been formulated to fix the salaries. Earlier, guest lecturers with UGC-prescribed eligibility were paid a salary of Rs 13,000 per month and others Rs 11,000. The salaries have been increased from a minimum of Rs 26,000 per month to a maximum of Rs 32,000. Those who have been serving as guest lecturers for more than five years and have UGC-prescribed qualification will get Rs 32,000 per month. Those with less than five years’ experience and UGC-prescribed qualification will be paid Rs 30,000. Guest lecturers with over five years’ experience but not having the qualification will earn Rs 28,000 per month and those with under five years’ experience and no UGC-prescribed qualification will get Rs 26,000. It was also decided to pay the salaries before the 10th of every month and to appoint guest lecturers on academic-year basis (10 months’ duration) instead of semester basis as was the case earlier. Narayan added the workload of lecturers will be readjusted in cases where there’s a shortage of it. As UGC-prescribed eligibility conditions will be made mandatory for recruiting guest faculty in the coming years, a three-year time limit has been set for them to clear the required tests/examinations, the minister added. Weightage to be given to seniority of serviceIt has been also decided to give weightage to seniority of service while appointing guest lecturers. To ensure this, a selection list will be prepared based on the existing parameters of the department. Based on the parameters, an online portal has been set up and candidates can apply from January 17. They can mention five colleges of their choice while submitting applications and they are required to submit them within seven days. The government had constituted a three-member committee headed by additional chief secretary to the higher education department on December 15, 2021, and it submitted a report within one month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/guest-lecturers-pay-hiked-to-beappointed-on-academic-yr-basis/articleshow/88906811.cms||---

Two-wheeler riders accounted for most of the victims — while 328 were riders, 76 were pillion riders. The deceased also included 161 pedestrians. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said, “The study reveals that lack of awareness on road safety among motorists and rash and negligent riding contributed the maximum to fatal road accidents involving two-wheelers. The next reason is riding without helmet. Other reasons include lack of rear view mirrors.” During 2020, 657 people, including 332 riders, 80 pillion riders and 164 pedestrians, had died in road accidents. In 2019, such mishaps claimed 832 lives — 408 riders, 76 pillion riders and 273 pedestrians.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/651-died-in-roadaccidents-inbluru-last-year/articleshow/88906812.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Veggie prices drop, lending cheer to Sankranti||BENGALURU: In a welcome news during the harvest festival of Makar Sankranti, vegetable prices — which were northbound for over a month — are gradually dropping and are likely to fall further. “There was a deficit in growth and supply during the rainy season. Now that the weather has cleared up, vegetables are arriving in the market in adequate quantities, causing prices to drop,” a Hopcoms official said. The official said the festival phenomenon of vegetable prices spiking has been absent this Sankranti. “In the wake of Covid-19 cases increasing, only a percentage of people are celebrating the festival. When the demand does not go up, the prices remain the same.” The price of carrot, which was exceptionally high in November and December, touching Rs 190 a kg, dropped to Rs 94 this week. “Most of the carrots sold here are grown in Ooty. Given that Tamil Nadu received a significant amount of rain in October and November, most of the produce was destroyed and so the supply chain was cut, causing the price to shoot up,” the official said. The price of beans had crossed Rs 100 a kg a month ago, but is now Rs 40-45. Greens were costing Rs 80-90 a bundle, but are now available for Rs 10-15. “Greens perish fast during rain. It’s the same with tomatoes. Now that the weather has stabilised, their prices have come down,” the Hopcoms official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/veggie-prices-drop-lending-cheer-to-sankranti/articleshow/88906813.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Furthermore, a homemaker has come under police scanner for her alleged role in provoking the men to fight with the dhaba employee. The accused are Manu Kumar of Channarayapatna, Hemant Kumar of Mahalakshmi Layout and Manjunath of Hegganahalli. Manu is facing eight criminal cases and Hemant is involved in 12.

He asked them to speak to the owner. The owner is said to have not received the calls made by them. Threatening to teach Manoj and the dhaba owner a lesson, the three left the place. Around 12.30am, Manoj came out of his room on hearing a noise. He saw two men spraying petrol on the dhaba walls and setting it on fire. It was thrown on him too and Manoj, who sustained severe burn injuries, succumbed four days later. “It was Hemant and Manjunath who threw the petrol and set the dhaba and Manoj on fire.

The deceased is Akshay BS, who was a resident of Kengeri Satellite Town and doctor with a hospital in Kengeri area. His body was found between 9.30am and 10.15am on August 13 last year. Akshay, son of a retired bank official, had completed MBBS in 2019 and joined a private hospital as junior doctor. His elder brother works as a software developer in the US. City railway police had initially taken up a case of unnatural death. Later, on August 16, they converted it into a case of cheating, extortion and abetment to suicide on the basis of a complaint filed by Akshay’s father. Police said Akshay had left a note explaining the reason behind his death. “We retrieved data from his mobile phone and found his nude videos sent by the accused. It corroborated the allegations made in the note,” a police officer said. Walking into a trapAkshay stated in the death note that he had lost Rs 67,000 in 10 days to the scamster. He provided details of the Telegram and Instagram accounts created in the name of one Kranti Singh and claimed he had lost money to him/her. Police learnt that the person behind the accounts had claimed to be a woman and had beautiful profile pictures. Singh befriended Akshay and shared porn content with him. He also persuaded the victim to share his nude photographs.The accused video-recorded the calls and sent them to Akshay in a bid to blackmail him. Fearing that the videos would be uploaded on social media, Akshay transferred Rs 67,000 to the bank account mentioned. He decided to kill himself after more demands for money were made. Sethi is said to have confessed to the crime and told police that he had played a video of a girl removing her clothes and managed to convince Akshay it was a live call. He got Akshay to reciprocate and used the recording to extort money from him. A railway police team headed by circle inspector V Shivakumar and sub-inspector Jagadeesh R identified the bank account to which Akshay transferred the money as that belonging to Sethi. The team rushed to Bhopal and arrested him. Police produced him before a court and got his custody for further probe. They also seized his mobile phone and other gadgets. Investigation is on to find out if anyone else was involved in the crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sextortionist-from-mp-arrested-for-abetting-doc-suicide/articleshow/88906815.cms||---

His yearly photo calendars, themed on various aspects of old Bengaluru, are a big draw. Last year, his calendar featured photographs of old hospitals in the city in honour of Covid-19 warriors. This year, he has turned his gaze on school buildings, some thriving and others ravaged by time. Ajaz, a grocery-cum-stationery shop owner in Gandhipuram, was born and raised in Whitefield. A collector of old photographs related to the city, the 39-year-old started issuing his calendars with a twist of history in 2016. “I was visiting my daughter’s school, St Thomas in Whitefield, where I too had studied, and it suddenly struck me that my 2022 calendar must be based on the city’s old surviving schools with beautiful colonial buildings and should be dedicated to teachers,” he said. Ajaz then began collecting photos of old institutions and placed the iconic Fort High School in Chamarajpet, recently renovated to its original glory, to adorn the month of January in his online heritage calendar. He also placed building photographs of various schools, including National High School in Basavanagudi, Bishop Cotton Boys’ School on Residency Road, St Teresa’s in Anandapuram, Sacred Heart Girls’ High School on Museum Road, Mitralaya Girls’ High School on Mission Road, Tunbridge School in Tasker Town, Model School in Chamarajpet, and Middle School in Basavanagudi, for the 12-page calendar. “I sourced all the photographs from various history groups online and the credit entirely goes to the city’s history lovers who clicked them,” Ajaz added. For October, the calendar features the Rao Bahadur Municipal School in Ashok Nagar that is sadly on the verge of closure. “The beautiful colonial school structure is over 90 years old and is being shut down because of lack of care from the authorities, who claim there are very few students. Wish the government was taking steps to restore it instead of leaving it to be razed,” the history lover lamented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/online-calendar-celebrates-citys-iconic-school-buildings-teachers/articleshow/88906816.cms||---

Projects like Mekedatu reservoir will only help contractors.” Patkar said she decided to take the lead since the project would result in submergence of 1,200 hectares of forest and the displacement of thousands of tribals in the surrounding areas. “ ...The project will also displace people living in the forest area and put farmers under distress,” she added. Patkar also attacked the Congress and BJP for their intent to use the project for vote-bank politics. “The BJP is not following the Gandhi model, but is following the Modi model that aims at enhancing the vote bank through projects like this,” she said.Various social and green groups have come together to form a federation — Karnataka Nela Jala Parisara Rakshana Samithi (KNJPRS) — to support her. Chetan Kumar Ahimsa, actor and convener of KNJPRS, said the federation had initially planned a march in Bengaluru and a meeting at Freedom Park on Friday, but it had to be cancelled because of Covid case surge.Meanwhile, quoting the detailed project report, KPCC chief DK Shivakumar said the project also plans to conserve and restore the ecosystem. “It has been assessed that there will be submergence of 5,000 acres, of which 4,500 acres are forest land and 500 acres revenue land being cultivated. Measures have been taken to provide alternative land on a 1:2 basis for the submerged land...,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/activist-medha-patkar-to-lead-stir-against-mekedatu-project/articleshow/88906818.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Many leaders irked by delay in cabinet rejig||Bengaluru: With the onset of the third wave of Covid-19, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s plan to undertake a cabinet rejig to induct some new faces ahead of the 2023 assembly polls has taken a back seat.Given the fact that experts have predicted the third wave will wane only in March and that the party high command is busy with the elections to five states, including the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, a cabinet rejig is unlikely before March-April. This has left several MLAs aspiring to become ministers disappointed and increasingly impatient. Honnali MLA and chief minister’s political secretary MP Renukacharya on Friday expressed frustration over the delay. He said the party and Bommai must take up cabinet expansion, and if possible a complete reshuffle, at the earliest to infuse new, young faces into the ministry. “Those who have become ministers 2-3 times must be dropped. People are fed up of seeing those faces. If we continue with the same cabinet, it will be difficult for the party to face elections,” he said. Another senior MLA, former Union minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who also has an eye on a cabinet berth, has been saying the rejig will happen soon and everyone except the CM will be replaced. At present, there are four vacancies in the cabinet and Bommai is keen to fill them to speed up his administration as the assembly polls are fast approaching. The party high command has given him the green signal to go ahead with the expansion. Some MLAs have been putting pressure on the CM and the high command to effect a restructure of the cabinet. “We think the need of the hour is to weed out non-performers and those enjoying power whenever the party comes to power,” an MLA said.

---||Bengaluru||HCL 3rd quarter revenue rises 15% year-on-year||Bengaluru: HCL Technologies’ revenue was up 15% in constant currency in the December quarter, compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Sequentially, it rose 7.6%, its highest in 12 years, and faster than that of peers TCS, Infosys and Wipro. But this is partly a reflection of the weakness in the products and platforms business in the second quarter. CEO C Vijayakumar had then told TOI that the products and platforms business had declined by 8% in the September quarter because some of the deals that were to be signed had slipped into the December quarter. This time, the growth was led by the products and platforms business that grew 24.5% sequentially, driven by digital engineering, industry 4.0, IoT works, and telecom modernisation, followed by engineering R&D services that grew 8.3%. The services business grew 5.3% sequentially. “Digital engineering, cloud transformation, and application and data modernisation continue to remain the win themes in the quarter, positioning us very smartly for the opportunity. We had success in products and platforms business with very good renewals and the growth led by significant net new license sales,” said Vijayakumar.In the December quarter, the company won eight large services deals and eight significant product deals. Vijayakumar said the net new deal wins at $2.1 billion represented growth of 64% year-on-year. For the full year, HCL has forecast its revenue to grow in double-digits in constant currency, while EBIT margin is seen between 19% and 21%.EBIT margin was flat at 19% sequentially, reflecting wage revision, lower utilisation, and lower billing days.Vijayakumar said the demand environment is robust as every company is leveraging tech intensely to run their business. “Second element is, customers are optimising cost across various aspects of their operations so that they can reinvest in areas that can create a much better business impact in the future,” he said.Net income was up 3.8% to $458 million sequentially, but was down 15.2% year-on-year. "We closed the quarter with gross cash at $2.7 billion and net cash at $2.1 billion, despite higher dividend payout, purchase of shares by the RSU Trust and acquisition of balance shareholding in Actian during the quarter,” said CFO Prateek Aggarwal.Actian is a US software company that HCL has acquired together with Sumeru Equity Partners. The acquisition adds intellectual property to HCL’s capabilities and enables HCL to execute digital transformation initiatives better.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hcl-3rd-quarter-revenue-rises-15-year-on-year/articleshow/88906820.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s effort pays off as Hyderabad tops green chart||Hyderabad: A massive effort yielded fruit with Hyderabad topping all mega cities in the country in green cover developed over the last one decade. If the increase was as much as 147% — from 33.15 sq km to 81.81 sq km — as per Indian State of Forest Report (IFSR) 2021, it was because of the many measures that were taken. Plantations along the 158km ORR, at road intersections, along highways, development of parks, and also turning graveyards green, were what contributed to the city emerging in the top position. While Haritha Haram, a programme of planting saplings, was what mainly led to the improvement in the city, the development of urban forest parks has been another huge contributor. Principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) R Shobha, who participated in a video conference with union minister for environment, forests, and climate change, Bhupender Yadav on Thursday told TOI a highlight of the achievement was development of 188 forest blocks in 129 locations in HMDA limits. A total of 1.60 lakh acre was being rejuvenated. In all, 59 urban parks located in HMDA over 59,522 acre are being rejuvenated. Of these, 16 urban reserve forest parks are almost ready. One of them at Pedda Amberpet was inaugurated by minister K T Rama Rao on July 1, 2021. This urban park is also the biggest. Amberpet Kalan forest urban park is spread over 1,075.64 acre and has 2.89 lakh plants. “It was about not leaving any space unutilised. The plantation was done in a scientific manner,” a forest official said. Currently, Warangal highway has been ‘saturated’ up to Raigir and in two or three months plantation is to be completed up to Alair. Similarly, Rajiv Rahadari, Kurnool Road and Shamshabad airport to Srisailam road have all been ‘saturated’. “We left nothing, except sheet rock where we could not plant saplings,” the forest official said. The ORR interchanges have been another place where dense plantation has been done. Greenery was also developed along the Musi, in addition to 150 parks in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/states-effort-pays-off-as-city-tops-green-chart/articleshow/88906833.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The state government has reportedly identified about 540 acres belonging to the housing board in Kukatpally, Pocharam, Raviryal and left-over plots in various locations in the city such as Vengal Rao Nagar. The state government is learnt to have asked the housing board to hand over certain land parcels owned by it to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) for holding auctions. Sources in the government said the target is to earn Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 crore immediately by way of sale of land. It has earned about Rs 3,000 crore through land auctions in the financial year 2021-2022 till now by sale of plots in Kokapet, Khanamet, Uppal Bhagat and Poppalguda through HMDA and TSIIC. “Discussions were held on auctioning Kukaptally housing board land and will be done through HMDA as it has experience in e-auctions and also development of layouts. The government will take a final call on it (auctioning) as board does not have powers,” a senior THB official told TOI. The THB will hand over 32 acres belonging to it in Kukatpally to the HMDA for development of bigger plots — each about one acres to one and half acres, mainly for commercial and mixed-purpose development. The auction will take place only after layout development. “As the land is close to Hi-Tec City and has connectivity to metro and other transports, it is likely to fetch a minimum Rs 1.50 lakh per sq yard,” an official source said. The government has already instructed the Rajiv Swagruha Corporation to sell the left-over areas at Pocharam and is also planning to sell some left-over plots in villages which it is also developing as IT hub in the eastern part of the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-now-eyeing-housing-board-land-for-auctions/articleshow/88906845.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: GHMC reeling under 12,000 pending cases for years||HYDERABAD: With over 12,000 court cases pending, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has been reeling under litigation for the past several years. According to an official data, the majority of them (8,424) are pending in the high court, 3,317 of them are pending in the city's civil courts, 317 cases pending in Lokayukta, 121 under HRC, 21 under Supreme Court and another 21 at NGT. From land disputes and PILs to fee disputes, the civic body is struggling to get any work done around them. A review meeting headed by the GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar was held recently and noticed that counters were pending to be filed in several of these cases. Sources said that several developmental works have been halted due to stay orders put forth by the courts several years ago. “Some of them are pending for 25 years or more. Many of them are related to encroachment of government lands and once evicted, they would stake their claim on the land,” a senior official said. The second highest litigations that GHMC deals with include trade license fee disputes and the pendency rate amongst these cases has resulted in severe loss to the exchequer. The GHMC commissioner, after reviewing the cases, ensured that counters were filed in over 5,000 cases. The department-wise breakup of the data shows that majority of cases are linked with the town planning department, followed by the health & sanitation, engineering, advertisement, revenue and land acquisition wings. A substantial amount of contempt of court cases is also pending and GHMC has been responsible for the delay as they have failed to file counters for many years now. Officials said that there are lawyers who argue these cases on behalf of GHMC and get paid 15,000 per month and 5,000 per case for the high court lawyers. When it comes to Supreme Court cases, lawyers charge their own fees. However, GHMC is now keen on vacating stay orders in various land acquisition and other property disputes to complete long-pending projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ghmc-reeling-under-12k-pending-cases-for-years/articleshow/88906846.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Handwoven, the 5.5 m long and 46 inch wide silk saree has been crafted by Nalla Vijay, a weaver from Sainagar in Rajanna Sircilla district, and easily packed in a matchbox 5 inches by 3 inches. It weighs 100 gm. The 33-year-old met IT and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao and showcased his work before ministers E Dayakar Rao and V Srinivas Goud in Hyderabad, and later gifted it to education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy.Vijay said he learnt the skill from his father Nalla Parandamulu. “I started helping out my father at his work at the handloom unit. It came naturally to me, but had to work on my skills to weave magic like my father.” Parandamulu passed away in 2006, but the son has done him proud by doing what he could not do in his lifetime. The handwoven sarees were showcased to Barack Obama, Sonia Gandhi, Narendra Modi and K Chandrasekhar Rao and presented to them, winning their appreciation for the exquisite work. “You cannot work for more than two to three hours at a stretch when you are weaving the saree by hand. It is tough on the hands and body. One can go back to working on it only the next day,” Vijay told TOI. At that pace it would take at least six days to complete and the handwoven saree costs around Rs 12,000, he said. A machine-made saree takes about two days and costs Rs 8,000, Vijay said.“But many prefer the sarees weaved on the handloom maggam,” he said. Apart from local sales, some are even being exported to the US, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, he said. But how does the saree fit into a matchbox? Vijay said the saree is made from silk yarn sourced from a mill in Jangaon catering exclusively to their requirement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-weaver-crafts-saree-thats-a-perfect-fit-in-matchbox/articleshow/88906848.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The Congress, meanwhile, citing Centre’s report, accused the state government of not implementing the crop insurance scheme for farmers.Various crops, especially chilli in hundreds of acres, was damaged due to hailstorm in Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Warangal and few other districts.

The responsibility of the state government does not end with just the Rythu Bandhu sop being given to the farmers,” Venkat Reddy said.Elsewhere, while speaking at Nereducherla in Suryapet district, Nalgonda MP and former TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the central government, in a reply to his question in the Lok Sabha, has informed that that Telangana was the only state which was not implementing crop insurance scheme in the country.

---||Hyderabad||Telugu Aseel rules the roost in Thailand||HYDERABAD: The magnificent Aseel (or Asil) has become synonymous with Sankranti, thanks to organised cock fights during the festival of harvest. But the breed native to Telugu states and considered to be the world’s first chicken breed is now, however, more popular worldwide as a Thai game bird. A study by the National Bureau of Animal Genetics reveals that all the present day breeds of poultry have their origin in the Aseel. Unfortunately, it is now endangered in India itself due to genetic erosion and faces extinction threat. Thailand, which obtained the germplasm from Andhra Pradesh, has standardised Aseel and developed another equally lovely fighter breed, Shammo (or Shamo), from it. Thailand has hundreds of breeding centres for Aseel where genetic purity is maintained. Even an internet search on fighter or game birds returns the result as Aseel, the Thai fighter bird, despite it being a native of Telugu states. Apart from Thailand, it is popular in Vietnam, Australia and Europe. The breed became popular in Telugu land during the Kakatiya and later Qutub Shahi period when it got its name Aseel, which in Arabic means pure or undiluted. City poultry researchers fear that the Telugu states will lose the Aseel breed if its purity is not maintained. Pakistan, which got the Aseel from AP via Punjab, has already lost the breed thanks to cross-breeding with imported birds. It is now dependent on Thai Aseel for fighter birds and poultry needs. Apart from Shammo, bred from Aseel by Thailand, several breeds in Europe have their ancestry in Aseel. Ironically, the British Poultry Standards does not recognise the Telugu Aseel, but has given a thumbs up for the Thai Aseel, regrets Dr MN Khaja, senior geneticist. According to scientists, the "home tract" of Aseel is AP, though it is present in parts of Odisha, MP, and Rajasthan. A study by a team from the Directorate of Poultry Research said "genetic erosion is occurring because of the introduction of improved hybrid chicken varieties in the breeding tracts". "This is leading to dilution of genetic purity or replacement of the breeds, which has brought them under threat of extinction," the researchers said, adding that efforts are on to improve the productivity without compromising the breed characteristics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telugu-aseel-rules-the-roost-in-thailand/articleshow/88906853.cms||Syed Akbar

Even though the first batch of Covid-positive medics had returned to work at most hospitals this week, more have tested positive subsequently, keeping the gap intact. Several hospitals said they plan to rope in more from other departments and appoint medics and technicians on a temporary basis for they see no change in situation for another two weeks. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), around 150 healthcare workers remain infected with Covid and are in home isolation. This includes doctors, nurses and support staff. “So, providing seamless care has become a major challenge. To overcome the crisis partially, we are planning to expand the clinical team for Covid management. We have requested clinicians from anesthesia, neuroscience, cardiac and internal medicine to provide support in Covid critical care till the series of infection amongst healthcare workers somewhat comes to an end,” said zonal head R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals have decided to rope in resident medical officers (RMO) from across departments and appoint doctors on a temporary basis to fill in for those in home isolation. The hospital now has 12 doctors, including consultants and RMOs, in home isolation after testing positive. Several technincians, too, at AMRI are in home isolation. They are being temporariliy substituted as well. “We have decided to use our RMOs and appoint doctors temporarily to fill in the gap. Technicians are being hired on a temporary basis due to the crisis. The decision has been taken since we expect more of our healthworkers to test positive and go into home isolation over the next few weeks,” said an AMRI spokesperson. At Ruby Hospital, six doctors are now in home isolation but services at the Covid ward has not yet been affected. “Fortunately, we have enough consultants in internal medicine who cater to Covid patients. But with groups of doctors and nurses being constantly affected, a shortage is not ruled out in the near future and we are preparing for it,” said general manager (operations) Subhashish Datta. At other hospitals, like Medica Superspecialty and Belle Vue Clinic, the first group of infected doctors have just joined work. “At the moment, we don’t have a crisis of doctors. But this seems to be an ongoing process with so many being infected every day. So, exigencies may happen any time,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-rope-in-consultants-to-deal-with-rise-in-cov-leaves/articleshow/88906860.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Change ICU norms to treat ‘incidental Cov’, say experts||Kolkata:A team of doctors will start visiting Covid critical care units (CCU) from Saturday and prepare a report, suggesting changes in the management protocol of Covid-positive patients requiring intensive care treatment. The state health department’s decision to send doctors to the Covid CCUs comes in the wake of a changing profile of patients during this wave. Officials intend to collect data on the profile of these patients before making a change in the protocol.“We have received reports that Covid-19 infection is incidental to a majority of patients admitted in Covid CCUs. They were originally admitted for treatment of other comorbidities but tested positive. They have no symptoms. Therefore, we need to see how prevalent this trend is across ICUs, prepare a data and submit it to the health department,” said IPGMER gastroentorology professor Gopal Krishna Dhali. The head of the School of Digestive and Liver Diseases has been appointed the nodal person of the expert team.TOI had on Friday reported how the profile of Covid patients this time differ from the second wave and that Covid was only a chance detection in majority of these patients who had come to the hospital for other illnesses.On Saturday, the six-member committee will visit three hospitals — Sambhunath Pandit Hospital (SNPH), RG Kar Medical College and TL Jaiswal Covid-19 Hospital in Howrah. IPGMER’s Covid unit is located at SNPH. Two doctors will form a team and each team will responsible for one hospital. The teams will fan out across other hospitals in phases. The teams will be going inside the CCUs and HDUs to find out how many patients had come primarily come for Covid treatment, how many had come for existing ailment but Covid detection was incidental, the age and comordity profile, how many require oxygen etc. “Most of these patients had come for treatment of issues like nephrology, heart, kidney, liver, neurology or trauma injury. Therefore, taking care of their primary illness makes sense than putting them under Covid care,” said Dhali.During the second wave, the health department had set up a committee to oversee management of Covid critical patients across all hospitals. “In addition, we will also be trying to find any lacuna, suggest ways for improved management and submit our findings,” said Sourav Datta, head and neck oncosurgery consultant at IPGMER.Apart from Dhali and Datta, the committee include Abhik Ghosh from Apollo, Tamonas Chauduri and Sanjib Banyopadhyay of Burdwan Medical College and Abhimanyu Basu from IPGMER.“The second wave was about the virus causing conditions like hyper immune response, cardiovascular irregularities, hypoxia leading to damage of lung and other organs that sent patients to ICU where oxygen was the main therapy. This time, it is mainly the elderly whose primary illness is not the infection. Hence, treatment management has to be targeted on their primary illness,” said IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/change-icu-norms-to-treat-incidental-cov-say-experts/articleshow/88906862.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||India||Ex-bishop acquitted in Kerala nun rape case||KOTTAYAM: A sessions court on Friday acquitted Franco Mulakkal - former bishop of Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic Church - of charges of raping a nun multiple times in a convent, evoking sharp reactions from various quarters. A visibly relieved Mulakkal burst into tears and hugged his lawyers after the verdict. "Only the trees that bear fruits are stoned. I am just proud of that. Praise the Lord," he said. Save Our Sisters (SOS), the organisation formed to support nuns after they launched protests in Kochi, Kerala, demanding bishop Franco Mulakkal's arrest, said its central committee decided to appeal in the higher court against the sessions court's verdict on Friday. "The verdict acquitting bishop Mulakkal is disappointing and unexpected. It was indeed a shock. Only after getting a copy of the verdict can we comment on the legal aspects of the judgment," said Felix J Pulladan, convenor of SOS. He added that an elaborate meeting of SOS will be held on Saturday to discuss the fight forward. "The words of the nuns who were on the forefront of the protests that they will fight for justice till their death is a powerful message. Their conviction gives confidence to everyone who works and prays for justice," said Pulladan. Sister Lucy Kalapura, who had been in the forefront of the protests against the bishop, said that the verdict was totally unexpected. In a Facebook post, she said it was a day when the goddess of justice got murdered in the courtroom. "When a person, who was considered to be an accused on the basis of circumstances and evidence, is acquitted by the court through a single line, I'm expressing my regret to sisters who waged an agitation for justice," she said on Friday. She added that the verdict has heightened the threats for people like her to live with dignity. Sr Lucy expressed hope that the government would file an appeal against the verdict in the high court and added that the court will at one stage find him guilty. She pointed out that in the Sr Abhaya murder case, the accused were found guilty after 28 years and called upon the other sisters and all the people who have come out in support of the nun to take forward their fight for justice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-bishop-acquitted-in-kerala-nun-rape-case/articleshow/88906863.cms||---

They travelled 1,680 km and reached straight at a Covid testing tent opposite Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Kewat underwent a mandatory rapid test and was positive for Covid. His relations were also positive. All three were sent to a Kolkata Municipal Corporation-run Covid safe home at a commercial building located close to Science City. All three woke up early on Friday morning and had to be content watching the holy dip at Gangasagar by devotees sitting at the safe home live on their mobile phones. Kewat, who on arrival had mild symptoms like that of a running nose and bouts of cough is now fully fit and has appealed to the civic officials running the safe home for an early release. According to a KMC health department official, around 130 pilgrims tested positive for Covid on their arrival in Kolkata from UP, Bihar and Jharkhand and have been spending their isolation period at two KMC-run safe homes. Some pilgrims from south India too were lodged in the safe homes. In fact, the Gangasagar pilgrims have outnumbered Kolkata’s local residents at city’s major safe homes. According to a source in KMC, of 200 Covid patients with mild symptoms, who have been kept at the safe homes, 140 are pilgrims who had come from far-away places. “Besides Gangasagar pilgrims, our safe homes are being occupied by a section of positive patients from slums,” said a KMC health department official. The civic official said they were receiving requests from pilgrims for an early release to be able to participate in Makar Sankranti festival at Gangasagar. “But we were following government rules and could do nothing. Now we will be releasing some of them from Sunday onwards,” the official said. Some pilgrims, who headed for Gangasagar after their swab samples were taken at Kolkata, were not allowed to enter Sagar Island after testing positive. “As they advanced near Kachuberia, the reports were sent to the district administration. The positive patients were refused entry to Sagar Island and sent to different safe homes in places such as Diamond Harbour, Kakdwip, Kachuberia or Sarishahat,” said a civic official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gangasagar-pilgrims-outnumber-locals-at-covid-safe-homes-plead-for-early-release/articleshow/88906864.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 25,000 booked for flouting night curbs in a fortnight||KOLKATA: Cops have prosecuted more than 25,000 people in the past fortnight ever since the new phase of night restrictions was reintroduced on January 2 and special drives were launched by the administration to ensure that citizens wore their masks. When it comes to the compliance with night restrictions, cops said that they had observed some changes in the past 15 days. With cops cracking down on motorists post 10am, the number of people complying with the restrictions increased. “When we resumed night restrictions this month, we nabbed over 850 violators each night. At present, this number has come down to 700,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. However, cops said violations increase by 25%-30% in the weekend, especially Friday and Saturday. In some pockets of the city, there are repeat offenders flouting the norms several times. The East traffic guard that comprises a part of Park Street and Park Circus has been logging the highest prosecutions, sometimes over 200 a day. The East and Ultadanga traffic guards reported the maximum violations, accounting for over half of the cases. The South guard and headquarters guard also reported good numbers of violations. Cops are facing problems to enforce the mask rule. The number of prosecutions and arrests in this segment increased steadily. The past three days, though, saw a fall in prosecutions. On January 5, 543 people were arrested for breaking Covid norms and another 389 were booked for not wearing masks. Within the next three days, this prosecution figures went up multifold. There were 844 arrests for the violation of Covid norms and 396 prosecutions for not wearing masks. By Friday, the numbers have dipped — there were 522 arrests for non-compliance with Covid norms and 242 prosecutions for not wearing masks. While the average night violations remained between 700 and 750 on weekdays and 750 and 800 on weekends, the daily mask violation number was around 500-550. Around 140 people are being pulled up for spitting on the road every day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/25000-booked-for-flouting-night-curbs-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/88906866.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Micro-containment zones rise from 29 to 44, stricter norms in place||KOLKATA: A day before the review on the possible extension of the stricter Covid measures, the twin cities of Kolkata and Bidhannmagar saw a major jump in micro-containment zones. This indicates that the government may continue with stricter restrictions for some more time due to the rise in Covid cases. The number of micro-containment zones in Kolkata has gone up from 29 to 44, an increase of 15 more micro-containment zones. Similarly, micro-containment zones under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area have increased to 15. There are also four micro-containment zones in New Town. According to the revised list, there are now 125 micro-containment zones in North 24 Parganas. With the new Covid cases being 22,645 on Friday and the positivity rate still hovering over 31%, the Nabanna officials are planning to continue with most of the existing restrictions. The gated complexes formed the majority of these micro-containment zones. At least six addresses from Jodhpur Park and Lake Gardens made it to the new list. Similarly, Ganguly Bagan and Patuli are on the list for the first time during the third wave. A few addresses in Garfa, Kasba and Anandapur have also featured on the list. Diamond City West continues to be on the list too. One new zone has come up in Salt Lake’s BJ Block. Around 1,500 fresh Covid cases are getting reported daily from the BMC area. New Town is recording around 500 to 600 daily cases. Panihati Municipality area tops the list in the district with 32 zones. Kamarhati Municipality has nine zones.

---||Kolkata||‘Diamond Harbour model’: Stop sparring, warns Partha||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress secretary-general Partha Chatterjee on Friday cautioned party leaders against making public statements and social media posts on other leaders, saying undermining anyone in the party was unacceptable. Chatterjee made it clear that issues should be discussed in the party, not in public forums. His warning came in the wake of statements and counter-statements by senior MPs and party leaders. On Friday, Trinamool state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh wrote a “Chapter closed” post on his Twitter handle along with a smiley in an attempt to put a lid on his war of words with party Lok Sabha chief whip Kalyan Banerjee over “Diamond Harbour model”. Kalyan had questioned party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s “personal views” that all political and religious mass gatherings should be stopped for the next two months — a step he has announced in his Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency — since these were contrary to the Bengal government’s stance against banning Gangasagar Mela. Kalyan argued this undermined the party and the state. His statement led to reactions first by Ghosh and on Friday by Arambagh MP Aparoopa Poddar, who even questioned why Kalyan wasn’t resigning as Lok Sabha chief whip before questioning Abhishek.The issue, Trinamool leaders said, owes its origin to Abhishek’s meeting with the South 24 Parganas administration on January 8 after which he told reporters: “In my personal opinion, everything should be deferred for the next two months. Vote can be held later. If people survive, everything can be done.” According to leaders close to the developments, Abhishek’s statements were made in the backdrop of announcing widespread curbs on political and religious meetings in Diamond Harbour constituency till February 28. His announcement had received backing from medical experts, who wanted this replicated across Bengal.The leaders indicated that handling a potential Covid surge in Diamond Harbour — after Gangasagar Mela concludes this weekend — would be critical in the days ahead. Sagar Islands fall within the Mathurapur Lok Sabha constituency but a bulk of the 2 lakh-odd pilgrims will reach the Islands though Diamond Harbour, which has the most densely populated urban sprawl in South 24 Parganas district. They argued there was a certain immediacy in announcing strict curbs in Diamond Harbour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/diamond-harbour-model-stop-sparring-warns-partha/articleshow/88906869.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj passed the order after hearing out a PIL. “The DM’s order (asking for shutdown of markets, gove-rnment and private offices) clearly reveals that the Covid situation in Jhargram is very serious. Hence we are of the opinion that it may not be in public interest to hold the mela from January 17,” the bench observed. State counsel Samrat Sen submitted that the fair was being held for eight years and this year the Jhargram administration had planned to hold the mela in a decentralized manner spread over several spots. The bench, while taking note of the state’s submission, pointed out in the order on Friday that there was no past practice of holding the fair on a particular date or in reference to any lunar or solar position.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hc-to-jhargram-dm-decide-on-jangalmahal-utsav-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88906871.cms||---

The tractor’s canopy fell on Sanjit Roy, crushing his head. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered a thorough probe and directed that responsibility for this accident be fixed.Initial probe pointed to driver error. Roy, a tractor operator with airport ground-handling agency AIASL, was driving along the service road. “There are two sharp left turns — one near the Coast Guard hangar and another near the Air India hangar. At the speed he was going, the vehicle toppled at the first turn, leading to the fatality,” an airport official said. He was taken to a private hospital where he was declared dead.Though there were suggestions that the driver had taken the turn in panic after seeing a Coast Guard plane in front, officials at the airport said the plane had touched down after the accident and had come to a halt while taxiing to the hangar on seeing the toppled tractor.Sources said ground equipment handling staff in the operational area often drove recklessly. In the past, too, there have been accidents on account of driver error here. In November 2018, a water tanker hit a Qatar Airways aircraft; in May 2018, an oil tanker overturned; in December 2015, a Jet Airways passenger coach crashed into an Air India plane, wrecking it. Though drivers have to pass a test before being permitted to operate in the airport, given the vast expanse of the airport grounds and lack of obstacles, they tend to speed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tractor-driver-dies-in-freak-accident-at-airport/articleshow/88906878.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cyclones, infra plans rob Kolkata of 30% green cover in 10 years||KOLKATA: The city had the least forest cover among the metros of India, revealed a recently published report by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. Kolkata used to have the second highest green cover among all the other cities in the country but it lost the position over the past one decade, owing to successive tropical cyclones that hit the city, uprooting trees, wreaking havoc on city’s environment. The green cover plays a big role in the betterment of the ambient air and for its climate resilience. Trees also help neutralize the heat island effect. Without a thick green covers, a city’s overall environment deteriorates faster. The recently conducted study showed that Kolkata lost 30% percent forest cover between 2011 and 2021. This is the second highest forest cover loss after that in Ahmedabad, which saw a loss of 48% forest cover in the corresponding decade. “The loss is quite abysmal, compared to that in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, which have gained forest cover of 11%, 9%, 15% and 26% in the same period,” said Ajay Mittal, director, climate change, India and South Asia, Earth Day Network. “It’s high time we recognized it and took up remedial measures, like intensive plantation without wasting any time,” he added. “Apart from heightened real estate and other infrastructure projects, fiercest successive cyclones, such as Aila, Amphan and Yaas, have robbed us of the green covers. The loss is irrecoverable and we now need intensive plantation to improve the green cover,” said an official of urban and recreational forestry wing of the forest department, responsible for urban forest covers. Environmentalist Bonani Kakkar pointed out the city was growing grey because of low survival rate of compensatory plantation done against felling trees because of infrastructure projects. “Most of the time, trees are planted shoddily, planted just for the heck of it. The post-plantation care is completely missing. Most of them have premature deaths for the lack of basic care,” said Kakkar of People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC). But civic officials claimed they took care to plant trees. “It is not that we did not plant enough saplings against the loss of forest covers during the cyclones. But most of the plants will take a few more years to be mapped by satellites. But of course, there is no denial that the city has inadequate green cover, compared to most other metro cities,” said a KMC official of the parks and gardens department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cyclones-infra-plans-rob-kol-of-30-green-cover-in-10-yrs/articleshow/88906880.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Pongal, Bihu, Makar Sankranti: Families keep it a homely affair||Kolkata: Thursday’s muted Lohri celebrations set the tone for other harvest festivals, including Pongal, Magh Bihu and Makar Sankranti and Uttarayan. While the various curbs imposed to check the spread of the novel coronavirus forced Calcutta Punjab Club to restrict participation to a symbolic bonfire, festivities of other communities also followed suit, with most celebrating at home with families.Celebrations of Pongal—a festival of particularly the Tamil community—that started on Friday were stalled at Calcutta South India Club. The former canteen caterer to the club, T N Balasubramanian, lamented the festivities had to be put on hold this time, owing to Covid case surge and the restrictions to check the surge . “Even last year, there were large-scale community events, but this year everything is mostly closed because of safety concerns. Given the travel restrictions, I won’t be able to visit my extended family in Tamil Nadu. This year, my wife made some traditional food at home so that we can keep up with our heritage.”Kolkata’s Assamese community also had to make do with small-scale celebrations at home as cultural organizations, like Assam Bhavan, curtailed Magh Bihu festivities. Restaurant owner Sanker Prasad would usually organize a Bihu dance at his restaurant, Jaluk: The Taste of Assam. “Usually, on the eve of Magh Bihu, which we call Uruku, the Assamese members of my neighbourhood would get together, light a bonfire and eat together,” he said. “That was not possible this year. I could not arrange for the Bihu dance in my restaurant as it would violate social distancing protocols. This year, I am actually busy with the restaurant as many Assamese people are ordering food to be delivered to their homes.”Bengali festival Makar Sankranti, which is essentially a domestic festival, also remained low-key. Most families, including that of food blogger, Pritha Paul, limited their festivities to making the beloved sweet dish, pithe. Behala resident Ashmita Saha said, “Every year, our relatives and neighbours come to our house to eat our homemade sweets, many of which have been passed down generations. This year, too, my mother and grandmother are making sweets, but we are not having guests over.” Asked about the additional measures maintained to prevent Covid spread, Ashmita added, “We have given a holiday to our help to prevent spread of the virus.”Research scholar at Presidency University Arghya Pratim Bala enjoyed being able to celebrate on a slightly larger scale with his family and neighbours in Habra, as the number of cases there seems fewer than that of Kolkata. “My whole family met up at my maternal uncle’s house and all the women cooked together. The preparations started two days before Makar Sankranti and many of the sweets were prepared through the night.”From Magh Bihu and Pongal to Uttarayan of Gujaratis, Lal Loi of Sindhis, and Ghughuti of the people of Uttarakhand, all the harvest festivities remained close-knit, family celebrations this time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pongal-bihu-makar-sankranti-families-keep-it-a-homely-affair/articleshow/88906881.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Two held for killing Amherst Street trader||KOLKATA: A special team from Amherst Street police station and the detective department has arrested the two main accused allegedly involved in the murder of a 26-year-old trader inside his office in a complex on Keshav Chandra Sen Street on Wednesday. Police said the accused were nabbed from the Jamui area of Bihar less than 48 hours after they fled with gold ornaments belonging to the victim, Dipak Das. “Raids were conducted in the jurisdiction of Adarsh police station in Jamui district and the FIR-named accused — Rakesh Kumar Das (23) — was arrested on Friday from his ancestral residence. From his possession, we recovered a gold chain looted on the day of the murder,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “We also arrested Rakesh’s associate Manish Das (19), a resident of Kotrangpara in Uttarpara. “We have come to know that Manish, too, was directly involved in the commission of this offense. A gold locket that was missing from the victim was recovered from his possession. The apparel which the accused used during the crime were seized from their possession. Both accused will be produced in a local court on Saturday with their remand prayer to ascertain the reason for the crime, recover the murder weapon and ascertain how they laid their hands on it,” said Sharma. Sources said, prima facie, Rakesh has said the victim owed him some money. “While this might be part of the Rs 60,000 that Rajkesh was demanding from Dipak, there is a possibility the amount was larger, borne out of a business deal. The accused claimed Dipak was paying back a fraction of his debt every month. However, Rakesh said, lately, Dipak refused to pay any more. But this claim needs further verification,” said an officer. Sleuths said Dipak removed Rakesh from a job on suspicion of theft six months ago, a point TOI reported in its Thursday edition. “But this was not the only reason behind the enmity. Rakesh had also taken a bike from Dipak and gave the victim Rs 60,000. Of late, Rakesh had returned the bike and was asking for his money back. Dipak reportedly refused to pay,” a source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/2-held-for-killing-amherst-st-trader/articleshow/88906883.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police have claimed that main accused Biki Halder alias Vicky (26) and his mother Mithu (42) had carried out the murders last October in a bid to rob Chaki. The cops have explained the sequence of events, stating it was Rabin who was murdered first. “We have submitted the charge sheet against Vicky, Mithu, Bapi Mondal (27), Jahir Gazi (25), Sanjay Mondal (34) and Subhankar Mondal in the AJM Court of Alipore. All of them have been charged with IPC sections pertaining to murder, criminal conspiracy, dacoity with murder and common intention. The charge sheet runs into 500 pages and we have cited 80 witnesses,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Police said they might file a supplementary charge sheet if new evidence emerges. According to police, Chaki had advertised his flat for sale. “Mithu and Vicky approached him to buy it and came to see the flat. They contacted Chaki again, but with a different identity. They came prepared for the crime and had enlisted the help of their four associates,” said an officer. Vicky and Subhankar were the last ones to be arrested, from Mumbai, almost two weeks after Mithu was first picked up by investigators. The charge sheet mentions how Vicky and his associate fled the city on October 18, a day after the crime, and reached Mumbai. They knew a few people from the Diamond Harbour area who were working as labourers there and the duo took up jobs as watchmen at an under-construction building.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/charge-sheet-filed-in-kankulia-case/articleshow/88906884.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Focus on Salt Lake drainage, water supply & roads in civic poll season||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress released a 10-point vision document for Bidhannagar ahead of the civic polls with thrust on three major areas – drainage and sewerage, water supply and roads. Calling it ‘Bidhannagarer 10 Diganta’, Trinamool senior and MP Saugata Roy held that the party once voted to Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation would focus on sprucing up drainage and sewerage network system for Salt Lake and Rajarhat, improvement of roads and work for further augmentation of water supply. Nirmal Bidhannagar, civic friendly Bidhannagar, are among the promises in the Trinamool manifesto released on Friday other than education, health, social welfare, governance and culture & tourism. The Trinamool manifesto also talks about introducing a uniform rate for car parking in Bidhannagar municipal area. Roy said that improving the drainage and sewerage network was a top priority in the vision document keeping in the mind the severe waterlogging in the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area during the last monsoon. “We will consult experts and take necessary measures to improve the drainage system,” Roy said. The vision document also envisages a solid waste processing plant to be set up in the next five years along with phasing out of open vats. The Trinamool manifesto also envisages innovation in waste segregation and disposal. Security for Bidhannagar citizens was among the major highlights in the Trinamool manifesto. It promises installation of 400 CCTVs across Bidhannagar to enhance safety measures. Road is another focus area in the Trinamool manifesto. Trinamool planned to give new black topping to a total 69.5 km of unpaved roads along with regular maintenance and upgrading of the existing road network using micro surfacing technology. Bad roads in Salt Lake had a concern for the civic body. Bidhannagar MLA and fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose said that the BMC would also focus on augmenting water supply. “The New Town water treatment plant now produces 20 MGD water and its capacity will be soon increased to 100 MGD. Bidhannagar will get 34 MGD of water,” Bose said. The vision document aims at consulting international experts over ways to put in place a water supply master plan for Bidhannagar. The Trinamool minister said a comprehensive development plan was already in place for Bidhannagar along with the added areas. “We will start work for the added areas once we are voted to BMC,” Bose said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/focus-on-salt-lake-drainage-water-supply-roads-in-civic-poll-season/articleshow/88906888.cms||---

According to RBU sources, the frauds targeted the salary accounts of two professors using an identical modus operandi. The fraudsters, claimed sources, tried to trick other professors too, but they were on their guard. “Fortunately, we could limit the losses to two persons. The teachers’ union has demanded an independent probe into the incident stating that since names of the senior administrative officers were used, the RBU cannot remain a mute spectator,” said a source in the university. Bengali department professor Deblina Seth and visual arts department professor Pala Sengupta lost Rs 5 lakh and Rs 3.5 lakh, respectively. The fraudsters used the name of a senior RBU functionary and asked both Seth and Sengupta to update their salary accounts. The accused used the name of a bank employee who handled their accounts and were asked to click on a link.

Among the dead, six persons have been identified. Three were residents of Bengal, two of Assam and one of UP. The others are yet to be identified.The state also released a list of 46 more injured passengers who are under treatment at Jalpaiguri Superspecialty Hospital. Only a few are critical, officials said following the visit of railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to the hospital.Survivor Rufia Khatun, the mother of seven-year-old Shahida who is among the nine deceased, was inconsolable. “We were returning home from Bihar. A big jolt woke me up; my head hit something hard and I lost consciousness. When I opened my eyes, I was lying beside the tracks, but my daughter was nowhere near me. I kept looking for her in the dark, but in vain. They brought her lifeless body out from a coach late in the night. What will I do without her?” the resident of Assam’s Barpeta said.United in grief was hexagenarian Jogesh Chandra Roy who had to take home the body of his 38-year-old nephew Subash — the victim whose image went viral on television channels on Thursday as his lifeless, blood-caked corpse leaned against a window crunched between two coaches. “He has left behind a month-old daughter. He was coming home to see her for the first time. How can god be so cruel?” said Roy, a resident of Cooch Behar.Liton Roy, a friend of 23-year-old Chiranjit Burman, a daily labourer from Bengal’s Putimari killed in the accident, said they panicked after seeing the news on TV. “I frantically called Chiranjit, but there was no response. Later in the evening, a policeman picked up the call and told me my friend was dead.”Agra resident and civil engineer Kuldeep Rawat, who is admitted to the surgical ward with multiple hand and leg fractures, recalled the nightmare. “I was standing near the door of the S5 compartment when there was a sudden jerk. I was flung out of the train and landed on the tracks. I immediately knew I had broken my limbs, but somehow managed to pull out my brother and a lady before I lost consciousness,” he said. Among those admitted to hospital here are Bihar resident Kundan Kumar Singh and Rajasthan native Jagdish Prajapati. The father of one of the injured has lodged an FIR against the engine driver, citing negligence on his part.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/2-more-bodies-found-in-wreckage-toll-rises-to-9/articleshow/88906890.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Management of churches, gurudwaras, mosques and temples also appeared to be alert in observing the Covid protocol. Most religious places are taking the lead in offering sanitisers and taking care to maintain social distancing among the devotees.Priest at Birla temple, K K Pandey, said that the number of devotees coming to temple, which had gone up during the period when Corona cases had dipped, has declined again as the Corona cases are going up in the city. "We shall keep the temple open from 6.00 am to 8.30 pm on Friday and the next day because of Makar Sankranti. We are expecting more people to come for darshan on these two days. But, there is so much space in the temple that even if there are 100-150 people inside the temple at a time, it doesn't look crowded. On-an-average, 500 to 600 devotees come to the temple everyday and everything goes off smoothly. We make sure that people come into the temple wearing masks and social distancing is maintained."Gurucharan Singh of Bittan Market gurdwara said, "Not many people are inside the gurdwara at one time. A maximum of 25 to 50 people. We sanitise the hands of the visitors and also sanitise the place where they kneel down and pray with their heads to the floor. People come to a gurdwara one after another, they can be given sanitiser, the place where they put their forehead to the floor can be sanitised, their masks can be checked but what about the market. I see overcrowded markets and crowded shops with nobody offering sanitisers or very few people in masks. You have to have an identical situation everywhere. Otherwise, the spread of Corona can't be checked." Fr. Maria Stephen, spokesperson for the Catholic Church in MP & Chhattisgarh, said "We want a minimum crowd to be there in churches. That's why we try to hold programmes online. We are very particular about Covid protocol and ensure that people coming to churches are in masks and they maintain social distancing. At a time, we allow a maximum of 25 persons and children & elderly persons are not allowed in the churches in the wake of the threat of Covid." Irfan, when asked about the crowd at the mosque where he had been to offer Friday's namaz, said "It was like any other Friday prayer, but more people are wearing masks now while offering prayers. There are notices on the walls of the mosques requesting namazis to come wearing masks and maintain social distance, which is having an impact other than awareness among people themselves."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/amid-covid-surge-footfall-drops-at-religious-places/articleshow/88906915.cms||---

Singh has wrtitten that according to information he has received, this committee — comprising 13 officials from different organizations — will formulate new rules and policy for acquisition of world-class agricultural produce. “These so-called agricultural experts held three meetings on February 18 and 26 and March 17, 2021, and imperiled the livelihood of 15 crore farmers of the country. They have proposed anti-farmer changes in the policy meant for the benefit of farmers. These changes will put farmers in major difficulty,” Digvijaya has written. He demanded to know how “a few officials can decide the policy of paddy-wheat purchase from 15 crore farmers in the country”.  “Neither was the Union agricultural minister part of this committee, nor the agricultural ministers of the states. There were no agricultural experts appointed in the committee and the decision has been taken to implement the proposed anti-farmer recommendations,” his letter alleges. “I feel that like the three black-laws, this transformation will damage the livelihood of crores of farmers,” Singh said. “I want that before the change of policy in the next Rabi and Kharif season crops, discussions should be held with farmers from across the country and then a decision taken for the benefit of the agrarian community. If the guidelines are changed, then farmers will be dejected and enraged,” Digvijaya wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/diggy-writes-to-pm-to-annul-agri-policy-framed-by-officials/articleshow/88906918.cms||---

More than three dozen petitions including those filed by former supreme court judge P P Naolekar, former high court judge Justice S S Jha and former advocate general A Agrawal challenging the mode of land acquisition by Jabalpur Municipal Corporation (JMC) are being heard by the court.

Even the Master Plan does not provide for construction of a road more than 80 feet in breadth there and it's for this road private land is being acquired. Land is being forcibly acquired in areas from Damoh square to Madan Mahal Marg, they said. Notices have been issued by the JMC for acquisition of land but it has no reference as to how much land is being acquired. Petitioners further alleged that on the one hand, JMC in court says that the issue will be settled with mutual agreement with the parties concerned, at the same time they continue with the demolition of property on the land in question despite a court stay.

Over half a dozen people were injured in the incident and were rushed to hospital where the 28-year-old uninvited guest died while the party host and his father sustained severe stab wounds in their eyes and are undergoing treatment. They are said to be in critical condition. Ashoka Garden police registered counter cases on charges of murder and attempt to murder on complaints filed by both the groups. Five accused were arrested in the case while one of the accused was on the run. SHO Ashoka Garden Alok Shrivastava said that Pramod Sharma, a resident of Sundar Nagar, works as aluminum section fitter. His wife gave birth to a baby boy recently for which he had organised a party at his home for close family members and some invited guests. Harsh Sharma, who resides in the neighbourhood, was also invited in the party but his friend the deceased Vinay Sharma alias Monu Matka, 28, and Neeraj Sharma were not invited. Shrivastava said that Harsh brought Monu Matka and Neeraj along with him to the party. They had dinner and drinks and then started dancing. Around 10.30pm, somebody pushed Harsh while dancing and he started hurling abuses. Monu and Neeraj also started abusing them. Pramod tried to counsel them and asked them to stop shouting. This led to a dispute and it escalated. Monu along with Neeraj rushed to his home from where he returned to the party with swords. SHO Shrivastava said that Monu and Neeraj attacked Pramod, his brother Vishal and their father Prakash with swords. Pramod, Vishal and Prakash too retaliated and attacked Monu and Neeraj with knives.

Deposed president of the council Dr Vijay Chaudhary and 13 members of his executive had filed a petition in the MP high court challenging the process through which Vijay Chaudhary was removed. The petitioners contended that they had opposed the proposal brought in the general body meeting asking for resignation of Vijay Chaudhary from the post of president of the Bar Council. Chaudhary didn't resign from the post either. The president of the State Bar Council can only be removed through a no-confidence motion or if he resigns on his own.Neither Chaudhary resigned nor a no-confidence motion was passed against him. Yet, Shailendra Verma was declared as the president of the council in place of Chaudhary and he formed a new executive as well. During hearing of the petition, the bench of chief justice R V Malimath and Justice Purusendra Kaurav was told that the Bar Council of India was informed about the recent developments in the State Bar Council in MP, which had formed a five-member committee to resolve the dispute between warring factions and reinstate the old executive and the president. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court decided to go with the decision of the Bar Council of India and ordered reinstatement of the old executive and the president. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-reinstates-choudhary-as-state-bar-council-prez/articleshow/88906925.cms||---

As soon as news of urea availability broke, farmers reached the cooperative society and joined the queue. They need the fertilizer for wheat crops, but it is in short supply. At the crack of dawn when the minimum temperature was 5 degrees Celsius in Sheopur, the farmers on Friday were forced to join a queue to fetch a bag or two of urea, a fertilizer immediately required to boost wheat crops. Raja Gurjar, a farmer said, the fertilizer was available after a waiting period of over 20 days; “we could not afford to miss this chance”. He said that a few months ago he had experienced the scarcity of DAP and urea both. Officials involved in the supply of urea in cooperative societies said that, “there is a yawning gap between the demand and supply and quantity of urea received for distribution was much less than our quota.” Officials claimed that they had distributed 900 metric tons of urea. Farmers said that long queues have been observed since Tuesday. Farmers were desperate to fetch urea as the standing crops of wheat required I before second watering of the crop. Winter rain which were bad for mustard crops may prove beneficial for wheat which has been sown in a record 66,000 hectares of land in the district bordering Rajasthan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/in-gwaliors-biting-cold-farmers-queue-up-for-urea/articleshow/88906929.cms||---

In a letter to the Bhopal civic chief, Singh said Murad should be dropped as brand ambassador as his contribution in the field of cleanliness was not known.“A brand ambassador should be such a person who has contributed in a major way in the field of cleanliness or who is well-versed with Bhopal's culture. Therefore, the order in this regard should be cancelled with immediate effect. Instead, nominate a prestigious person/institution who has made noted contributions in the field of cleanliness,” the minister’s letter said.Murad told PTI: “No one can be a bigger Bhopali than me, as my mother, wife and many other members of the family belong to Bhopal. I did my schooling from Cambridge School here. I am well versed with the city, its roads, its typical language, its tea, paan and gutkha, so the charge that I don’t know the culture of the city holds no ground.” Murad said he had already started work on Thursday in Chowk area by telling people to segregate solid and liquid waste. “If the minister doesn’t want my services, so be it, as they are maalik,” he said.Congress criticized the BJP government on this and said Murad being dropped as brand ambassador was “Sanghi thinking”.

The latest order, in this regard, was issued after several cases were reported from Kasaragod, where natives died of Covid-19 in hospitals of Mangaluru and they were unable to obtain a certificate stating that their deaths were due to Covid-19 infection.Kasaragod collector had told the government that till October 21 last year, 50 such cases had come up where individuals died of Covid-19 in Mangaluru hospitals and all their relatives had a Covid-positive certificate and a death certificate.As per the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Covid death certificate is required for receiving ex-gratia compensation of Rs 50,000 for close relatives of the dead. It is under these circumstances the government issued an order that such cases also can be considered for compensation, provided they also give an undertaking that they have neither applied or accepted compensation from the other state, where the death occurred.The applications for compensation must be submitted through an online portal to process and disburse the financial relief for relatives of those who lost their lives due to Covid.When applications for financial relief are submitted at www.relief.kerala.gov.in, there are a series of documents that are to be submitted along with the application, including death certificate (death certificate issued by ICMR that the person died due to Covid and the death declaration document), copies of his/her ration card, Aadhaar card and bank passbook and heirship certificate, if available.Meanwhile, with Covid-19 cases rising once again in Kerala, state disaster management department has once again begun preparations for undertaking activities to control the pandemic.As an initial measure, the department has granted Rs 22 crore to districts to begin work immediately.

In addition to this, a special messenger from the chief minister’s office handed over a letter to the Raj Bhavan on Friday.During the telephonic conversations and also in the letter the chief minister has asked the governor to continue as the chancellor of the universities. The chief minister is also learnt to have communicated about his US visit for treatment.There were speculations that the chief minister is likely to meet the governor on Friday since Pinarayi Vijayan is leaving for the US on Saturday. It is customary for chief ministers to visit the governor before they leave for a foreign visit.However, Vijayan chose to speak to the governor and also to send a letter to pacify Khan, who is at loggerheads with the government on the university issues. The governor has been keeping away from the chancellor’s duties and has been forwarding all the files to the government.The tiff between the governor and the state government began when Kerala University denied the recommendation of the governor to confer DLitt on the President of the country during his visit to the state last month.After that, the governor came out in the open flaying political interference in the appointment of vice-chancellors in universities. He was also irked over the government’s decision on the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor. The governor had also written to the chief minister asking to enact an ordinance to take over the powers of the chancellor from the governor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-urges-guv-to-remain-chancellor/articleshow/88906937.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘China not doing enough to resist imperial forces’||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Friday accused China for not going full throttle against the oppressive imperialist forces. “As a socialist country, China is not doing enough to resist the imperial forces as it should,” he said. Pinarayi’s critical comment on China comes at a time when another politburo member and his close confidant S Ramachandran Pillai has courted criticism for eulogizing China in party conferences.Pinarayi explained that he was only repeating the stand CPM’s last party congress adopted on China. “We still stand by that opinion,” he said. Stopping short of saying that the Chinese Communist Party was not a model to emulate, Pinarayi said the Chinese Communist Party has acknowledged the inequity and corruption that nagged that party.However, socialist political forces were making a comeback in several countries and Communist countries such as China, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Vietnam have proved themselves successful in the equitable distribution of resources among people, he said.“China has managed to maintain a minimum standard in education, health and housing sectors. The ambitious project to take out 19 crore people out of poverty announced by the Xi Jinping government has been successfully achieved,” said Pinarayi.Both BJP and Congress have come out against Pillai’s China eulogies at several CPM district meetings. The party delegates in Kollam had themselves questioned SRP’s China love.Pinarayi said fundamental Islamist forces that claim themselves to be the real alternative of imperialist world order were the making of the United States of America. The uprising such as the Jasmine revolution against oppressive regimes could not sustain as they failed to propose a credible alternative, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/china-not-doing-enough-to-resist-imperial-forces/articleshow/88906939.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CM: Anti-BJP forces in other states hold key||Thiruvananthapuram: The attempts to form a national, political alternative force to take on BJP can wait for the time being. What is required now is the formation of anti-BJP forces in as many states as possible. The political resolution of the 23rd CPM party congress in Kannur in April will be centred on this proposition, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan while inaugurating the Thiruvananthapuram district conference of CPM at Parassala on Friday.CPM feels that Left forces, at this point of time, should be focussing on harnessing the political forces opposing BJP in every single state. “Our focus should be on forming anti-BJP alliances in every state. By cornering BJP in states, we can scale up possibilities. If we can defeat BJP in states, it would naturally lead to alternative political formation at the national level. The recent political developments in UP, where anti-BJP forces are gaining traction, are encouraging,” he said.Vijayan criticized the Congress by accusing the grand old party of sharing the same policies and outlook of BJP. He raised doubts over Congress’ ability to lead an alternative political combine against BJP at the national level. “Congress has been reduced into a B-team of BJP. Their policies aren’t different. No wonder, Congress supremo Rahul Gandhi has openly declared that Congress was trying to establish a Hindu Rashtra,” said the chief minister.Vijayan’s statement that CPM would join hands with anti-BJP forces in other states is seen as a tactic to resolve the identity crisis and deflect criticisms the party encounters when it acts as the foe of Congress in Kerala and its friend in other states, where the presence of CPM is insignificant.The latest central committee meeting too had decided to build talks on alternative options by focusing on anti-BJP forces as one single block.Vijayan also continued his attack against IUML by repeating that the League has shed the cloak of a political party because it has put on the cloak of religious fanatics. “IUML is speaking in the language of Jamaat-e-Islami and SDPI,” he said, adding that both minority extremism and majority extremism were peddled in state. Vijayan also justified the semi high speed SilverLine project and rubbished the criticism against it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-anti-bjp-forces-in-other-states-hold-key/articleshow/88906940.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Six suicide cases reported in two months from tribal areas||Thiruvananthapuram: The law enforcement authorities in the district have taken note of the rise in alleged suicides among sexual abuse victims in tribal settlements in the rural district. While new Rural SP Divya V Gopinath has sought a report on these deaths from her subordinates concerned, the excise department has initiated talks to launch an awareness campaign among tribal youths as it has been noticed that substance abuse was also a factor in many of these deaths.On Tuesday, an 18-year-old Dalit woman had allegedly died by hanging herself at Vithura after she felt cheated by her boyfriend of four years. The police have arrested her boyfriend in connection with the case. Similarly, Vithura police had arrested two youths last month for allegedly sexually abusing two minor girls belonging to backward communities and eventually leading them to suicides. The parents of one of the victims have now alleged that the harasser of their daughter had even made her a substance abuser.Social activist Dhanya Raman, who works among Dalit and tribal youths, said that there had been eight cases of attempted suicides among teens belonging to the SC and ST communities in the past two months. Among them, six died and two survived. A 17-year-old boy is also among the deceased.‘’While in the case of girls, sexual abuse is a factor that drove them to suicide, in the case of the boy, we suspect that mental problems caused by substance abuse was the reason,’’ Dhanya Raman said, adding that it is a matter of concern that drug peddlers from other regions are luring the tribal youths into the trap of substance addiction.Most of the recent deaths were reported under Palode and Vithura police station limits. The Palode police station limits with as many as 192 tribal settlement colonies is the most vulnerable region. It is a difficult task for the law enforcers or activists to cover all these colonies regularly, she said.Dhanya said that on Friday, she reached out to excise minister M V Govindan Master, who has agreed to launch an anti-drug campaign targeted at tribal youths in these regions.‘’We believe that the last two years during which the children were restricted to their homes had an adverse effect on their mind-sets,’’ Dhanya Raman said. At schools, regular interactions with peers and counselling sessions with teachers help them relieve stress. But, the kids were robbed of this chance during the past two years. This might be a reason for the alarming rise in the number of suicides, she said.Speaking to TOI SP Divya V Gopinath said that most of these cases occurred before she took charge in the rural district. However, she has directed the officers concerned to produce details regarding similar cases reported in the recent past.‘’The police will definitely be taking steps to address the issue once I go peruse those reports,’’ she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/six-suicide-cases-reported-in-two-months-from-tribal-areas/articleshow/88906941.cms||---

The report also severely criticised the CPI for being politically arrogant beyond their means.The report, sources said, painted the CPI as a party which enjoys the fruits of CPM's labour. Though it cannot win even a panchayat seat on its own, it nurses the arrogance that they could spoil the chances of the CPM in many seats, the report said.The report presented by incumbent district president Anavoor Nagappan on the first day of the district conference on Friday also contained some self-critical observations regarding the organisational work. The report also accused former MP A Sampath for not being enthusiastic about organisational work.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who interacted with the delegates said youngsters in the party should not mistake social media as the platform for political work. Pinarayi also asked the district leadership to indulge in an introspection to ensure that they did everything right in the ‘peroorkkada case’, in an apparent reference to the child adoption row involving a party member. Pinarayi also said the PSC mass copying and the tax money swindling charges against the city corporation sullied the image of the party. He also warned of strict action against those who try to create division in the district unit.The district unit has passed a resolution supporting K-Rail, which it said was necessary for the development of the state. The resolution termed the opposition to the project as political. It is the BJP, UDF and Jamaat-e-Isami that oppose the project, the resolution said. The delegates’ meeting also witnessed severe criticism against police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/rss-bjp-support-base-worries-cpm/articleshow/88906943.cms||---

Both the deceased happened to be in their late forties and were masons by profession. While one of them died on the way to work, the other died while returning from work.The first accident was reported under Pozhiyoor police station limits on Friday early morning.

---||Visakhapatnam||Research findings may aid sepsis detection, treatment||VISAKHAPATNAM: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, have shown the role of specific immune cell markers on the outcomes of severe infection and sepsis. The findings of this study, funded by the department of biotechnology, will help in detecting the stages of sepsis and appropriate treatment. Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages are white blood cells that act as scavengers of dead cells and foreign bodies such as bacteria and other pathogens. They move from the blood to the site of infection to mop up the disease-causing foreign matter. However, in uncontrolled and severe infections, commonly called as ‘sepsis’, there is abnormal activation and localisation of these immune cells. As a result, these cells form ensembles, move around the body, and get deposited in important organs such as the lung, kidney, and liver. This could lead to multi-organ failure or even death. Prof Pranita P Sarangi of the department of biosciences and bioengineering, IIT Roorkee, who led the research, said that it is important to understand the mechanism of the migration of such cells to detect the stages of inflammation and sepsis. “When these immune cells travel from the blood vessels through tissue spaces to reach the infected or inflamed site, they bind to proteins such as collagen or fibronectin,” said Prof Sarangi. In this study, Prof Sarangi’s group used two mouse models of sepsis to show the role of integrins in sepsis. When there is an infection, monocytes move from blood circulation and bone marrow towards the infected/inflamed tissue. Once inside the tissues, these monocytes further mature into macrophages. And by sensing the signals from the septic environment, these cells gradually switch their functions from inflammatory to immunosuppressive subtype that correlate with their integrin expression profile. Director of IIT Roorkee Prof. Ajit K Chaturvedi said that the work advances the current understanding of sepsis biology and may be helpful in the development of therapeutics against this life-threatening condition. The results from this research work has been published in The Journal of Immunology, the official journal of the American Association of Immunologists and presented at the international conferences organised by the Indian Immunology Society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/research-findings-may-aid-sepsis-detection-treatment/articleshow/88906949.cms||---

Of these, 215 lives were lost in Maharashtra, 143 in Uttarakhand, 55 in Himachal Pradesh, 53 in Kerala and 46 in Andhra Pradesh. Thunderstorms and lightning killed at least 780 people in different parts of the country in 2021. Rayalaseema and Nellore districts witnessed a massive scale of floods in November 2021. Though there is no data for decades, the Central Water Commission (CWC) says that the recent floods in AP could be the worst in the past two decades. Heavy rains in November in 2021 due to the depression in the Bay of Bengal caused massive flooding in parts of Andhra Pradesh, especially in Chittoor and Kadapa districts. Tirumala and Tirupati were hit by floods on an unprecedent scale. The IMD data also show that in 2021, five cyclones formed over the north Indian Ocean. These were: extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae, very severe cyclonic storm Yaas, severe cyclonic storm Shaheen (remnant of Gulab), cyclonic storm Gulab and cyclonic storm Jawad. Of these, three cyclones (Yaas, Gulab and Jawad) formed over the Bay of Bengal and the remaining two cyclones (Tauktae and Shaheen) formed over the Arabian Sea. Among these five cyclones, Gulab (September 24 to September 28), formed during the southwest monsoon season and crossed north Andhra Pradesh–south Odisha coasts on September 26, claiming 19 lives from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Maharashtra. The IMD says that 2021 was the fifth warmest for India in the last 121 years — after 2016, 2009, 2017 and 2010. The mean air temperature in 2021 was 0.44 degrees celsius above the normal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/floods-in-21-claimed-46-lives-in-ap-fifth-highest-toll-in-country/articleshow/88906950.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Ranchi||‘Deceptive’ fall in Koderma Cov cases||Ranchi/Koderma: Koderma district that surpassed even Ranchi in terms of new Covid-19 cases during the beginning of the current phase of infections in last week of December has started reporting fewer cases.It has recorded the lowest number of cases among the 24 districts in the last three days, from 670 on January 11 to 396 on January 13. In the last week of December, around 80-90 new cases were being reported from Koderma which climbed to 180 on December 28, even higher than that of Ranchi where the number of active cases was 174. It was because of this situtation that a central team visited Koderma to take stock of the preparedness and Covid management. The surprising drop in new infections has less to do with Covid management and more about underreporting of tests and sharp decrease in the number of samples being tested in the district.On Friday, the number of active cases suddenly went up to 560 as the district managed to obtain the pending test reports. Out of 5,916 samples sent and pending for RT-PCR testing, 164 were found positive. The results of these samples were pending for the past three days.Civil surgeon Dr DK Saxena admitted that the testing of samples was delayed at the laboratory in Delhi where the samples are sent by the state government if the laboratory at Ranchi is overburdened. Earlier, samples from Koderma were tested in Hazaribag but since the RT-PCR laboratory is no longer functional there, samples are being sent to Ranchi from where they are sent to a private lab in Delhi. According to data, 1,719 swab samples were tested on January 8 out of which 107 were positive. On January 9, of the 1,827 samples tested, 86 were found positive; followed by 1,329 samples on January 10 of which 89 were found positive.The number of new cases dropped suddenly from January 11 when 299 samples were tested and 14 were found positive followed by nine positive cases on January 12 and three on January 13. During this period, several samples were pending to be tested. On Friday, the backlog of 5,916 samples were tested out of which 164 were found to be positive for Sars Cov-2 virus.The district has been given a target of conducting 3,000 RT-PCR tests every day, but the average daily test figures are as low as 1,500. The district is conducting on an average 275 True-Nat tests per day against the target of 1,500.Dr Saxena said things have been streamlined and in a couple of days test numbers will be increased. He said, “All CHCs, including Satganwa and Jainagar CHC which were not performing well, have been given targets and MOs have been instructed to meet the target. The administration is cooperating in the testing drive and soon things will be in better shape.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/deceptive-fall-in-koderma-cov-cases/articleshow/88906958.cms||---

The winter fairs start from Makar Sankranti and end on Basant Panchami covering different areas of the district. This year due to surge in Covid-19 cases, Rajrappa Temple Nyas Sammittee has decided not to organise any fair. During fairs, thousands of people take a holy dip at the confluence of Damodar and Bhairvi rivers in Rajrappa temple early in the morning amid biting cold. The fair is held in Koya-Kamta in Gola, Chitarpur, Larikala and Ramgarh Sanichara bazaar in Ramgarh district till Vasant Panchami.Subhashish Panda, secretary Rajrappa Mandir Nyas Sammittee, said following protocols issued by the state government and guidelines by district administration, the committee has decided not to organise Makar Sankranti fair on January15.Ramgarh deputy commissioner Madhavi Mishra said the fair as well as any kind of procession has been restricted and there would be no Makar Sankrati fair in Rajrappa temple while other winter fairs in various locations of the district have also been restricted.All block officials have been directed to strictly execute the protocol and inform fair organising committees not to hold any event which may attract crowds, said an official.People of Ramgarh, neighbouring Hazaribag, Bokaro, Ranchi wait for a year to attend these fairs, said Ajay Panda, a senior priest of Rajrappa temple.Villagers too will miss out on income as they bank on these fairs to sell their products. Women buy cosmetics, traditional toys for kids and traditional sweets while farmers purchase tools used in agriculture and wood craft along with kitchenware from the fairs.Parasnath Mahto, a villager, said his family had plans to visit the winter fair to enjoy fun and food with “desi mithai’, but it seems that “we have to wait for 2023”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/rajrappa-temple-steers-clear-of-fairs-this-year-amid-corona-scare/articleshow/88906959.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Virus impacts sale of sweets, kites on Makar Sankranti||Ranchi: Makar Sankranti, a harvest festival observed across different communities remained a low-key affair with correlated businesses suffering due to the impact of Covid and partial closure of markets. Kite flying and sale of special sweets like “tilkut” and “til ladoo” took a hit as people remained indoors. Traders also blamed the inclement weather for dismal sales. With low sale and no profits, shopkeepers are focused on at least recovering the invested amount.Talking to TOI, Sachin, a sweet seller at Lalpur, said, “Sales dipped considerably in comparison to the previous years. Right now, we are basically focusing on the sale so that at least we could recover the amount we had invested. With corona at its peak, we can hardly expect any profit. As we hire workers from Bihar who are engaged in the production of the sweets manually, we are just trying to sell as much possible so as to pay their wages.”Sale of tilkut and other sweetmeats is seasonal and with the conclusion of Makar Sankranti, temporary shops have to pull down the shutters.Most of the tilkut makers get set for the business by December every year. “We start making tilkuts and other products which are winter favourites. We mainly put up the stalls during Makar Sankranti. However, the sale begins from December itself,” said Shankar Kumar Chauhan, who sells sweets by the roadside at Lalpur.With the sale of sweets seeing a plunge in sale during Covid, the seasonal business of kites, too, has seen a sharp downfall. With a chilly breeze blowing and intermittent rainfall since the past few days, customers are preferring to stay in the comfort of their homes. The weather has added to their woes, feel shopkeepers.Nitin, a Lalpur-based shopkeeper, said, “The price of kites has changed a lot over the past years. With Covid, people are avoiding social gatherings. Makar Sankranti, a festival where people do gather to fly kites, has been hit hard, resulting in huge losses. This year, sales have dipped to about half the previous year.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/virus-impacts-sale-of-sweets-kites-on-makar-sankranti/articleshow/88906960.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad while hearing the petition online ordered the agency to produce reports of the narco test conducted on the two accused who have been arrested in the case.

There is a greater conspiracy which needs to be unearthed, the court said. The court will again hear the matter on January 21. The high court had earlier pulled up the CBI for having submitted a stereo typed charge sheet in the case. Though the charge sheet has been submitted of murder, there is no investigation to prove murder as there is absence of motive in the charge sheet.

Mandsaur collector Gautam Singh said the administration has received 221 applications for financial assistance of Rs 50,000 under the state government’s scheme to families of those who died due to Covid. As per Mandsaur health department’s official records, however, there were 130 Covid deaths in the district. “While examining the applications, we came across two RTPCR reports furnished by applicants Prakash and Ambugir on the death of their next of kin. Both reports have the same patient ID 11121051, which was issued by Indore-based Dr Agnihotri’s Path Lab and Diagnostic Centre. When the QR code was scanned, it turned out the report was ‘negative’ and that of a 22-year-old named Shobharam,” Singh said. Prakash had applied for compensation for his father’s death, reported on May 1, 2021, and Ambugir had applied under the scheme for the death of his wife, reported on June 3, 2021. Both are residents of Jhirkan village in Afzalpur area, around 30km from the district headquarters. The two deaths indeed happened but there is no proof they had Covid, say sources. After verifying with the laboratory, officials felt that the report with patient ID 11121051 was tampered with to get the compensation fraudulently and cause financial loss to the government. On the collector’s instructions, Dhumdhadaka naib-tehsildar lodged an FIR against both applicants. Asked about the mismatch in number of applications and deaths, senior administrative officials said that some deaths would have been in home isolation or in other districts, reports of which didn’t reach the health department. “We are examining all the applications. If all the criteria, including the patient’s Covid RT-PCR report and death certificate match, we sanction such cases for the compensation,” collector Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/2-booked-in-mandsaur-for-rtpcr-fraud/articleshow/88906972.cms||---

The operators will have to verify the mobile number as well as address of the person undergoing the test with his photo identity proof like Aadhar card, driving licence etc,” order issued by district collector reads.

Some of the organisations TOI spoke to said they are witnessing absenteeism of the same order witnessed in the second Covid wave. JK Group president (group HR) Prem Singh said time-tested HR processes like multi-skilling, multi-tasking and job rotation have proved handy. "As a large manufacturing organisation, we also follow a practice of flexi-workforce, which allows for in-built contingency. We also follow a flexible manning system wherein we engage a skilled temp workforce, which can be deployed against absenteeism," said Singh. RPG Group president (HR) S Venkatesh said, "When team members get infected, colleagues rally around them and help with their work as well." Marico CHRO Amit Prakash said the company prioritises work in case more than one team member get infected. "Focus shifts on 'must do's' while 'good to do' can wait. Our members are empowered to take decisions," said Prakash. Deloitte India partner & chief talent officer S V Nathan, however, said the firm hasn't see any blip in absenteeism. "We have given leave for Covid over and above the normal and, so, people use this leave. There is a business continuity plan in place, which will get triggered if we see a major uptick in Covid cases," said Nathan. But given that the symptoms are mild in most cases, Nathan said people do work when they can. Organisations said they are certainly better prepared this time round. "We have become adept at managing these disruptions. We are at ease and quite efficient now in managing work in both hybrid mode and in 100% remote working mode, without losing productivity, response time and quality of work delivered," said Venkatesh. Prakash said, "In order to ensure the business continuity and production of essential goods for our consumers while also taking cognisance of the well-being of our members in the units, we have implemented shift-rostering that further limits the members' exposure internally. Members are restricted only to their allotted work zones and wear approved PPE kits and N95 masks, while following strict sanitisation and social-distancing norms at all times. We have also implemented staggered entry and exit times for members to avoid gathering at the gate."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-covid-cases-rise-offices-face-staff-crunch/articleshow/88906975.cms||---

The man, Kuldeep Dige, a resident of Akola district of Maharashtra had killed his wife Shardabai Denge (38) and step-son Akash Gurjar (11), after he found that she was having an affair. The police said that the accused was fifth husband of the woman and they were married for two years. “The woman was having an affair with her previous husband, Mangesh Gawande with whom she had been married for six months,” officials said. Mangesh had later moved to Indore and started working in a factory. On January 1, the woman contacted Mangesh and asked him to find a job for Kuldeep. Mangesh invited both of them to Indore and assured to help find a job for Kuldeep, the police said. On January 9, Kuldeep, his wife and step-son came to Indore and stayed temporarily at Mangesh’s house. The woman then started having an affair with Mangesh and decided to leave Kuldeep, but he did not agree. Due to this, they used to have arguments, said the police. During interrogation, Kuldeep said that he had caught his wife in bed with Mangesh, following which he killed both the woman and her son, while they were asleep on January 12. The accused had hit both the mother and son on head with an LPG cylinder and then slit their throats with a knife. He had also stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth, and fled after locking the door from the outside. The police also retrieved last phone conversation of Mangesh and Kuldeep, in which the accused was heard blaming Mangesh for calling him and his family to Indore and betraying him by having an affair with his wife. He also threatened to kill him and later end his own life. “The accused was arrested from a village in Akola district of Maharashtra by our team, and a case under IPC section 302 has been registered against him,” DCP Dharmendra Singh Bhadoria said on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/husband-held-for-killing-woman-step-son/articleshow/88906976.cms||---

Across the Tibetan settlement, 77 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of whom 34 are children. Sources attributed the rampancy in the infection at the settlement to the frequent visits that the residents make to the nearest towns and cities, where they were likely to have contracted the infection.Odeyarapalya is one of the biggest Tibetan settlements in the Old Mysore region, and his home to more than 2,000 families. Roughly 95km from Mysuru, Covid cases have been spiralling upwards since the past week, keeping the officials in the district administration on their toes. Officials have barricaded entire streets, which have been declared containment zones.Since residents at the settlement were apprehensive about visiting their designated Covid Care Centres (CCCs), the taluk administration has arranged for them to be treated at their community hall, where beds have been placed and other necessary facilities set up, said Hanur tahsildar GH Nagaraj. “We have deployed staff from the district health department. Most of those who have contracted the infection are asymptomatic, including the children. The camp has been sealed, and all Covid patients have been effectively isolated,” Nagaraj told TOI.He added that directions had been issued to officials at the settlement, and to the local leaders, to contain the spread of the infection.Chamarajanagar district health officer Dr KM Visveswaraiah said, “The authorities have kept one unit ready at the Kollegal Government Hospital to treat patients, the condition of whom is serious. Directions have been issued to the local authorities to monitor the situation constantly, and to subject those who have returned from towns and cities to the RT-PCR test. Such measures will help check the transmission of the virus.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cnagar-admin-tightens-measures-at-tibetan-settlement-in-odeyarpalya/articleshow/88906977.cms||---

He told reporters that the government should close primary and higher primary schools, stating that children aged below 15 are yet to be vaccinated in the state. Vaccination for teenagers above the age of 15 is on. But it is kids below 15 years who need to be protected, he said. Offline teaching should be continued for SSLC and II PU students only, he said even as he asked the government to consult experts. Vishwanath opposed a state-wide lockdown saying it will impact people in districts which are relatively safe. He also opposed weekend curfew saying it has failed to curb movement of people. “What we need is strict ban on inter-district and intra-district movement of people,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/close-schools-across-state-ahv/articleshow/88906978.cms||---

But, this year, the birds appear to have relocated to the Irani Bommanakatte Lake in Ranebennur in Haveri district. While a huge flock of the bar-headed geese is now nesting at the lake in Ranebennur, the other birds, albeit in smaller numbers, that have flown into Bommanakatte Lake include pratincoles, Brahminy Ducks, black ibis and the painted stork. With the lake reverberating with the cries of various birds, locals are flocking to it to drink in the sight of the feathered visitors. The lake, which is administered and maintained by the wildlife wing of the forest department, is spread across 11 hectares, and is framed by verdant hills in the midst of which it is nestled. Copious rainfall in Ranebennur in 2021 has left the lake brimming with water, ensuring that the migratory birds have enough food and water. The bar-headed geese have been visiting the lake for the past three years, while the remaining species of birds are mostly on their maiden visit to Bommanakatte. The bar-headed goose stands out even among the various birds at the lake, with its grey plumage and the white crown striated by two black bars. The bar-headed geese fly to India from Mongolia, soaring over the Himalayas to reach their destination. Avid birdwatcher Praveen Pujar said that the temperature nosedived in Mongolia during the winter months, prompting the birds to seek shelter in warmer climate. “These birds visit Karnataka between November and December, and nest here for three or four months before returning to Mongolia. The bar-headed geese are naturally equipped to fly across the Himalayas, using the jet stream. These birds are now attracting birdwatchers from across Haveri,” said an excited Pujar. Ravindra K, range forest officer in the wildlife wing of the forest department, said that the bounteous rainfall the district had received over the past three years had resulted in lakes and ponds across Haveri brimming with water. “Consequently, there is ample food for the birds, which are flocking to lakes in the district. The Bommanakatte Lake now has more than 300 migratory birds, which has turned it into a local attraction,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bommanakatte-lake-in-ranebennur-draws-migratory-birds-in-droves/articleshow/88905125.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Physically challenged, aged, pregnant women have to climb up or come down 54 steps. An elevator that was installed is defunct. Bus platforms are shifted often. Drivers struggle with entry and exit as the bus stand is surrounded with narrow, crowded roads. Malamma Kurubar, a senior citizen from Gadag, told TOI that she wanted to go to KIMS Hospital. “According to the conductor’s suggestion, I got down at Hosur Bus Stand and had to climb 54 steps. There was no lift or ramp. Those steps took me 15 minutes. Now I have decided not to go to the Hosur stand,” she said. There is a ramp for those who cannot negotiate stairs, but there is no signage that could guide a commuter to the facility. A wheelchair is kept in a corner but no information is available about it. Zakir Hussain, a physically challenged passenger from Karwar, said he climbed the steps using hands as he had no information regarding the wheelchair or the ramp. “This is the worst bus stand I have seen in my life,” he said. Srinath TL, the divisional controller of the Hubballi Moffsil Division of the NWKRTC, said: “We have taken charge just two days ago. We will check and address all the grievances soon.” Many drivers and conductors alleged that they do not have a place to eat. “In the old bus stand, we used to sit in a hotel and eat. Here, no place is available. Only one Darshini eatery can’t feed all the passengers and staff. If we want tea, we have to leave the bus stand for at least half an hour” a driver said. A woman conductor said that two toilets. “These are not enough for such a big bus stand. Sometimes, water supply is not there for 2-3 days,” she said. Sunita Naduvinamani, a homemaker, said the bus stand was not safe for women or single passengers after 8pm. “When a bus drops passengers at the moffsil platform, neither staff nor security personnel is present after 8 pm,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hosur-bus-terminal-hi-tech-stand-that-falls-short-on-service/articleshow/88905012.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Hubballi||Spurt in Covid cases add to HDSCL’s woes||Hubballi: The recent spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, which experts have pointed out is but the precursor to the third iteration of the pandemic, has only added to the problems that the Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Ltd (HDSCL) and Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) have been grappling with for some time now. HDSCL officials have been at the receiving end of much criticism for the delay in completion of several projects. Senior HDSCL officials have repeatedly attributed the delay to the Covid-induced crisis, and the third wave of Covid will make it much harder for the agency to meet the deadline for its projects. Responding to complaints from the public, the Dharwad district in-charge minister revised the deadline to February. The fear of the infection spreading to workers has added to the pressure the officials are under. A HDSCL engineer said that they were intent on completing work at the earliest. “While working on the Chitaguppi Hospital last year, many of our labourers contracted the infection, and work on the project was suspended for 45 days. Thankfully, that is not the case this time around. However, owing to the curfew during the weekend, many of our labourers are unable to come to the worksite owing to restrictions in their localities,” said HDSCL deputy general manager Basavaraj. HDSCL managing director CW Shakeel Ahmed said that they had adopted all precautionary measures to ensure that Covid norms were being enforced at the worksite. “In Hubballi, there is ongoing work on projects cumulatively worth Rs 500 crore, and we have issued instructions to all contractors to ensure that work is completed before the deadline. Measures have been initiated to vaccinate all our labourers,” Ahmed said. Besides the projects undertaken by the HDSCL, the third wave may delay the completion of many of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation’s (HDMC) projects, which include repair of roads, pavement, drains, et al, estimated to cost Rs 60 crore. Labourers at these worksites are equally worried about the threat of the infection, said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/spurt-in-covid-cases-add-to-hdscls-woes/articleshow/88905209.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar wrote to defence minister Rajnath Singh urging him to construct a multipurpose indoor stadium on 16 acres of defence land at Vishweshwar Nagar. Shettar said that 16 acres of vacant defence land on Rajnagar Road in Vishweshwar Nagar has remained unused over the years. As the land is situated in the heart of city, it cannot be used for purposes of defence. Currently the open land has turned into a garbage dump and is not being maintained properly or cleaned by defence people. “I managed to clean the land using HDMC personnel,” he said. “As the land is situated in the heart of the city, it may not be possible to use it for a big project or for sports activities. However, there is a need of an indoor multipurpose stadium in Hubballi which can be constructed in the vacant place of defence department. In this regard, I wrote to the Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and had a one-to-one meeting during a visit to Delhi recently. I also discussed the issue with Union minister Pralhad Joshi. I will take this matter up with the state government,” he added. According to sources, during the discussions Rajnath Singh has said there is no provision for the construction of a sports complex through defence department. Then Shettar requested them to hand over the land to HDMC or to the district administration. There are chances of exchange of land in which alternative land can be given to the defence, sources said. Union minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Pertaining to vacant defence land in Hubballi, I have already discussed with Union minister Rajnath Singh two-three times. I recently met him along with former chief minister Jagadish Shettar in Delhi. Singh has agreed to give defence land if equivalent alternative land is given to the defence on the outskirts of Hubballi-Dharwad.” “I will urge that state government to send a proposal to the defence department after identifying an alternative land, and I will follow up the matter in Delhi,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/jagadish-shettar-pitches-for-indoor-stadium-on-defence-land/articleshow/88904835.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The company has pared its issue size to Rs 680 crore from Rs 800 crore and has fixed a price band in the range of 166-175 per share. At the upper end of the price band, the IPO values the company at Rs 2,107 crore. The IPO will be open for subscription between January 19 and 21. Promoter Ravi Goyal will sell shares worth nearly Rs 678 crore and use the proceeds to repay the company’s debt. “This will benefit the shareholders as the company’s debt will fall from Rs 1,100 crore to Rs 500-550 crore and create future value,” he said. AGS Transact is the second-largest company in terms of ATM managed services revenues. It also has a share of around 5% of the total credit card swipe machines in the country and a dominant position in payment acceptance at petrol pumps. The company reported a net profit of Rs 55 crore in FY21, a decline from Rs 83 crore in FY20. Goyal said that the ATM business was set to grow in line with the currency in circulation and withdrawals were around 1.6 times the total currency in circulation. With banks moving towards leaner branches the dependency on ATMs was increasing with many banks going in for cash recycling machines that accept deposits and dispense the same under withdrawals. “Around 88% of our revenues are recurring in nature,” said Goyal. Last month CMS Info Systems, a cash management company, listed on the stock exchanges at a premium to its issue price of Rs 216. The company’s Rs 1,100 crore initial public offering was subscribed 1.95 times. The stock is currently trading at Rs 294 which values the company at Rs 4,364 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-of-atm-mgmt-co-ags-to-be-1st-in-2022/articleshow/88905537.cms||TNN

The weeklong certificate course is aimed at encouraging self-employment among the inmates. The academy, run by a Mumbai-based MNC Asian Paints Ltd, will commence the training session for around 50 prisoners next week. Half of the inmates at the jail are undertrails and the rest are convicts whose conviction terms are nearing completion. The prisons department has identified the inmates so they stand to benefit once they walk free. A similar programme was first conducted at Parappana Agrahara prison in Bengaluru in 2013, and in Ballari prison recently. Now, the Belagavi jail is hosting the session under the leadership of Krishna Kumar, chief superintendent (prisons). As part of corporate social responsibility, the company has been training unskilled labourers since 2005. Krishna Kumar told TOI the academy will send 4-5 trainers to the prison. Apart from certificates, which the trainees get at the end of the session, the trainees will get ID cards and licences to get painting jobs after stepping out of the jail. “The weeklong session will happen inside the jail, and the academy will get materials needed for the session. The inmates are enthusiastic to attend the sessions,” he added. Repairing appliances Rudset (Rural Development and Self-Employment Training Institute) and Syndicate Bank will hold a training programme for select inmates on repairing electronic appliances like washing machine, refrigerators, TVs and others.

---||Business||RBI may tweak norms for valuing bank investments||Mumbai: In an overhaul of the norms governing the valuation of investments made by a bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has proposed a new category for classifying securities — ‘Fair value through profit and loss account (FVTPL)’. This will enable banks, while drawing up their results, to properly value securities such as units issued by bad loan companies in consideration of non-performing assets (NPAs) sold to them. The securities held in FVTPL shall be fair-valued and the resultant gains/ losses shall be directly credited/ debited to the profit and loss account. The RBI has proposed the new category to include those securities that currently cannot be classified as long-term holdings under the ‘held to maturity’ category and neither are they part of a bank’s trading portfolio which are held in the ‘available for sale’, or AFS, category. Categorisation of securities has an impact on the net profit that a bank declares. For instance, if the market value of a government security in the AFS category falls by 5%, banks will have to set aside that much money from their profits. However, if the same security is in the held to maturity category, the bank need not make provisions as the bank will get the full amount on maturity. The new category has been proposed in a discussion paper floated by the RBI on Friday. These will be made into regulations once all industry stakeholders submit their feedback. According to the RBI, illustratively, investments in securitisation receipts (SRs) issued by asset reconstruction companies, mutual funds, alternate investment funds, equity shares (excluding certain exceptions), derivatives (including those undertaken for hedging) which do not have any contractually specified periodic cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on principal outstanding (‘SPPI criterion’) shall be classified as FVTPL. Current norms on classification and valuation of investment portfolio by scheduled commercial banks are largely based on a framework introduced in October 2000 drawing upon the then prevailing global standards and best practices. “In view of the subsequent significant developments in the global standards on classification, measurement and valuation of investments, the linkages with the capital adequacy framework as well as progress in the domestic financial markets, there is a need to review and update these norms,” the RBI said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-may-tweak-norms-for-valuing-bank-investments/articleshow/88905551.cms||---

As a result, the excise department has dashed off a directive asking hotels to stop serving liquor after 8 pm though the night curfew starts at 10 pm. This has forced around 80 hotels and restaurants to suspend operations as only takeaway orders will not earn them much given that operational costs are higher than the earnings.C Narayanagowda, the president of the hotel owners’ association, said the industry was already facing huge losses since the Covid outbreak. Adding to this, the notice of liquor service stopping at 8 pm has taken a toll on many hotels.Hoteliers were unhappy because liquor outlets were allowed to do business till 10 pm the previous week, while hotels were restricted. Hence hoteliers are reluctant to do business, Narayanagowda said.Deputy commissioner of excise B Madesh, however, clarified that due to confusion on the timing of the curfew in the government’s order, previously hotels were asked to stop serving liquor after 8 pm. “After the government issued a revised order, we have allowed hotels and liquor outlets to remain open till 10 pm,” he said.He said that the excise department has not issued any fresh order on the revised timings. The government order in this regard holds true and applies to all. According to the officer, Mysuru has about 550 liquor licences, including hotels and restaurants, of which 330 are in urban Mysuru.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/confusion-over-last-drink-timing-shuts-down-hotels-in-mysuru/articleshow/88906981.cms||Lawrence Milton

The JD(S) supremo inaugurated the taluk office of newly set up Saligrama taluk. Referring to Mekedatu padayatra by Congress, he said the issue is pending in the Supreme Court. “Do Congress leaders think if they do not take out the padayatra, the court will not adjudicate the dispute? I have fought against the injustice meted out to Karnataka in the Cauvery dispute. But I have never taken out a padayatra because the issue needs legal solution,” he stated. Meanwhile, former minister and BJP MLC AH Vishwanath asked the opposition leader Siddaramaiah if he thinks street fight will help resolve the Cauvery dispute. Referring to Siddaramaiah’s padayatra taken to Ballari against the mining barons, he said it helped him come to power. “But it was former SC judge and Lokayukta Justice Santosh Hegde’s probe that led to the arrest of accused in illegal mining and seizure of crores of properties,” he told reporters in Mysuru.

He had earlier this month announced he would submit his resignation only after February 5, considering his party leadership had failed to get him disqualified. Earlier this month, Raghurama Krishnam Raju threw an open challenge to the party leadership to get him disqualified before January 7 and announced that he would quit if the leadership failed. He reiterated his demand to his party leadership on January 7 and set February 5 as the new deadline, asking the party to get him disqualified from the Lok Sabha. While the reasons are not known, it is said that Raju has decided to wait for a few more weeks and give a fresh deadline to the party. It is said that he would wait till the last week of April or the first half of May. Raju also said he would seek re-election from Narasapur Lok Sabha seat after his resignation and win by a huge majority. He said he would go to the voters on the Amaravati issue and ‘failures’ of the state government. Meanwhile, the YSRC has been trying for his disqualification, accusing him of anti-party activities. The party has also submitted several sets of representations to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, seeking his disqualification.

The court stated that it does not have any reason to pursue the contempt proceedings any further.The senior civil judge and additional chief judicial magistrate of Sojat in Pali Garima Sauda had moved this petition in the high court, citing a Facebook post by advocate Goverdhan Singh, aggrieved by 25 adjournments of the hearing in her court, which read “Had asked for justice and got only unlimited adjournments”. She stated in her petition, “In relation to a criminal case which was pending before her, the respondent advocate Singh had made highly objectionable comment on his Facebook page. Several people responded to this comment, which were also objectionable and contemptuous”.Taking this post as contempt of court, she had moved the high court seeking action against the advocate, who argued in the court that his case just required to be decided whether a complaint had to be registered as FIR or not and after 25 adjournments, no justice was being done.Interestingly, the matter had later been transferred to other court where an instant decision came with direction of filing the FIR. After hearing the case, the division bench of chief justice Akil Kureshi and justice Rekha Borana observed that the action of the respondent advocate did not amount to contempt of court in any manner clarifying the Section 2© of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971.In its order, the court stated “the remarks of the respondent were in the nature of stating that a particular proceeding had lingered on before the court for unduly long period of time. That by itself in isolation cannot be seen as contemptuous”.It further observed that the reference to the remarks of several other people in response to this post which may be highly objectionable would not render the action of the present respondent contemptuous, unless a specific design or plan is shown to be in existence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/hc-junks-officers-plea-for-action-on-advocate/articleshow/88906997.cms||---

The bird’s helpline, which is very limited due to pandemic, received the highest number of calls in recent years. Long queue of injured birds — pigeons, owls, kites, eagles, peacocks and even exotic species like Brahmani kites and Eurasian Sparrowhawk — was a common sight during the day at the makeshift hospitals in the city. Those killed after getting tangled in glass-coated manjha included both domestic and foreign breeds in Jaipur.An Eurasian Sparrowhawk, a migratory bird from Eastern Europe, was rescued by a volunteer at 1.30pm at C Scheme hanging from the tree. It was rushed to the makeshift bird hospital being run by RAKHSA, an animal rights group. “The bird got tangled with the glass-coated thread mid-air and then hit a tree. It has sustained injuries in the vertebra and marks on the head. She has been injected with anti-infection drug and pain killers in the makeshift operation theatre,” said Rohit Gangwal of RAKSHA. The only fear is that the bird has lost her flock. Throughout the day, the helpline numbers receive calls from across the city, the maximum from the Walled City — Johri Bazaar, Kishenpole, Hawamahal etc. Like always, the maximum casualties were pigeons. Covid has restricted the bird camps and each volunteer handling 2-3 cases at a time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/glass-coated-manjha-turns-deadly-for-birds/articleshow/88907005.cms||---

The day concluded with the bursting of firecrackers and releasing sky lanterns. The kite festival was celebrated with a lot of joy and excitement in the state as the winds were comparatively conducive for the kite lovers. Since morning, people of all age groups thronged their terraces with colourful kites, manjhas and home-cooked snacks. As it was a foggy morning, the kite lovers were praying for favourable winds that started at 10.45am. "Amid all negative thoughts surrounding Covid-19, the festivals rejuvenate us and bring families and friends closer. Makar Sankranti overall was like a masala Hindi film having ups and downs as winds were mostly favourable, also weak at times. The first two sessions were good. But the climax from 5.30pm to 6pm was the best with favourable," said Saurav Bansal, a banker who was seen flying colourful kites with his friends and families. However, Digvijay Bhandari, a 45-year-old kite enthusiast from Malviya Nagar, was not so happy. "For Makar Sankranti, winds should be favourable for the kites throughout the day. However, it was favourable only in a few sessions. But we enjoyed the day with home-cooked delicious food and sweets." A few kite lovers were spotted playing commentators on loudspeakers on their terraces.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/covid-takes-back-seat-hopes-soar-this-sankranti/articleshow/88907010.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Budget cuts leave PWD in a fix over execution of crucial projects||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has made big cuts in the Public Works Department budget, worrying the construction and maintenance agency. Cuts totalling Rs 471 crore have been made in the revised budget estimates for infrastructure construction and maintenance work, though the allocations for the national flags project and a new secretariat building have been increased. Rs 120 crore has been chopped from the maintenance and repair budget of 22 hospitals. The 60 crore denoted for the upgradation of dispensary builds has been reduced to Rs 40 crore and that for the construction of public health centres from Rs 60 crore to Rs 22 crore. The Rs 3.5 crore set aside for development of homoeopathy healthcare infrastructure is now a crore rupees less. The budget for the renovation of existing education department buildings has been revised downwards from Rs 30 crore to Rs 10 crore and Rs 6 crore chopped off the allocated Rs 11 crore for repair of school buildings. However, the sum demarcated for building new classes has been enhanced by Rs 50 crore to Rs 200 crore. School safety has also seen a slash in terms of money allocated, with the funds for installation of CCTV cameras in schools reducing from Rs 150 crore to Rs 50 crore. Money for the infrastructure projects of government-run colleges and universities too has been pared from Rs 130 crore to 35 crore. The government has also taken the knife to allocations for road construction projects. According to the revised allocation, the budget for the Barapullah Phase III project has been halved from Rs 150 crore to Rs 75 crore, while the funds for the construction of a flyover and elevated road at Karawal Nagar, Ghonda and Brijpuri junction on Mangal Pandey Marg in northeast Delhi have halved from Rs 100 crore to Rs 50 crore. The earlier allocation of Rs 20 crore for the construction of a new Wazirabad-DND bypass parallel to Ring Road has been revised to just Rs 1 crore. The amount for repair and maintenance of bridges and flyovers has also been reduced to Rs 15 crore from Rs 30 crore and for pedestrian overbridges from Rs 50 crore to Rs 40 crore. In contrast, the finances for the installation of national flags jumped from Rs 45 crore to Rs 60 crore. Rs 20 crore has been set aside now for a new project — the construction of a new Delhi government secretariat. Funds for the construction of a Haj House have, however, been reduced to nil from Rs 10 crore earlier. While the allocation for Delhi Forensic Science Laboratory has surprisingly been slashed from Rs 10 crore to Rs 7 crore, the budget for the Installation, operation and maintenance of CCTV cameras in jails has risen by Rs 10 crore. The budget for Delhi Fire Service has seen cuts of Rs 25 crore and is now down to Rs 10 crore. The excise department repair work money has also been slashed from Rs 9.5 crores to a mere Rs 15 lakh. The PWD director (works) also accordingly issued fresh instructions as per the new allocations on January 10 and asked officials to observe the austerity directives of the finance department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/budget-cuts-leave-pwd-in-a-fix-over-execution-of-crucial-projects/articleshow/88905902.cms||---
---||Jaipur||BJP seeks CBI probe into Alwar rape case||JAIPUR: Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena has demanded a CBI probe into the alleged gangrape of a specially abled girl in Alwar on Friday. Meena told reporters that the incident has highlighted that the law and order situation is at an all-time low in the state and it’s a complete failure of the Congress government. “The state government is trying to cover up the matter and cannot be trusted anymore. The statements given by women commission chairman Sangeeta Beniwal and state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra is a clear indication that government cannot do justice in the case. A CBI probe can only bring justice to the victim,” said Meena. State BJP president Satish Poonia has questioned the intention of the state government for completing probe without SIT. “Is the Gehlot government fearing insult in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh and Punjab trying to suppress the case? What was the prima facie observation of the doctors? Why the government has given compensation to the family of the victim?” Meanwhile, Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari visited JK Lon Hospital to inquire about the health of the victim. She also met her relatives and assured them of all help. Expressing her anguish, she said, “The heinous crime is unforgivable. The Congress government is not taking any action and the perpetrators of the crime are roaming scot-free.” Taking a dig at Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi’s state trip, she said, “The Congress high command is in Rajasthan to celebrate her birthday but has no time to visit the victim in Jaipur.” A three-member delegation of the BJP visited Alwar on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-seeks-cbi-probe-into-alwar-rape-case/articleshow/88907011.cms||---
---||Jaipur||12 helipads to be built in Rajasthan on Delhi-Mumbai expressway||JAIPUR: Twelve helipads will be built in Rajasthan on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway for medical emergencies, defence-related activities and other purposes. Of all the helipads, four will be developed in Dausa, six in Sawai Madhopur and two in Kota, said Pawan Kumar, chief general manager (CGM), RO-Jaipur, NHAI. Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had recently said the Centre was planning to develop helipads along major highways so that accident victims could be evacuated using helicopters from the spot. Under the 1,380-km Delhi-Mumbai expressway project, 374 km will be in Rajasthan covering Alwar, Bharatpur, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Tonk, Bundi and Kota districts. The first phase of the Rs 95,000-crore project - Delhi-Dausa-Lalsot (214 km) and Vadodara-Ankleshwar (100 km) - will be made open to traffic by March 2022. After the completion of the project, the distance between Delhi and Mumbai will be covered in 12.5 hours, the distance between Delhi and Jaipur will be covered in 2 hours. “The helipads are being developed mainly for the purpose of air-lifting people grievously injured in accidents. It will be used for multipurpose activities as it is a government property,” said Kumar. However, there’s no direct connection between Jaipur and Jodhpur under the expressway project. Jaipur is connected to Jodhpur through Pachpadra on Amritsar – Jamnagar Economic Corridor, which is 40 km from Jodhpur. To ensure wildlife protection so the animals don’t get disturbed due to this project, it has been decided to use the sound of Indian musical instruments for horns and sirens. This will also decrease sound pollution. Earlier, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had said his ministry was in talks with a foreign company to construct an electric highway between Jaipur and Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/12-helipads-to-be-built-in-raj-on-delhi-mumbai-expressway/articleshow/88907013.cms||---

Dotasra said if action was not taken, BJP central leaders will face the same treatment from Congress workers during their visit to the state. Priyanka Gandhi was in Ranthambore with family to celebrate her birthday. Meena, a Rajya Sabha MP along with hundreds of supporters, protested outside the hotel against the gangrape of a deaf and mute minor in Alwar following which the police took them into custody. Meena accused Priyanka of lying to the people of UP and also targeted her for the slogan ‘Mai ladki hun, lad sakta hun’ ( I am a girl, I can fight). Dotasra asked BJP national president JP Nadda and state chief Satish Poonia to expel Meena from the party. He alleged that Kirori Lal had malaigned the image and tradition of Rajasthan.

---||Jaipur||State has 2nd largest area under tree cover, Maharashtra tops list||Jaipur: With 8,733sqkm of forests, Rajasthan has the second-largest area under tree cover in the country, says the recently released forest survey report. Maharashtra tops the list with 12,108 sqkm of tree cover. While tree cover is significant in Rajasthan, it is only 2.5% of the total geographical area of 3,42,239 sqkm.Head of forest force (HoFF) DN Pandey said, “Rajasthan has always been in the top three when it comes to tree cover mainly due to two reasons. One is that historically, people of the state have always believed in conservation of trees and second, there has been regular distribution of saplings for plantation which is not something that has been introduced recently but has been happening for decades.” The National Forest Policy 1988 mandates that 33% of the geographical area of India should be under forest or tree cover. FSI has been assessing forest cover since 1987 and tree cover since 2001. For this purpose, isolated trees and small patches of trees which are less than 1 square-hectare in area and found outside recorded forest areas (RFA) are considered for assessment. The total tree cover of the country has been estimated at 95,748 sqkm. There has been an increase of 721 sqkm in tree cover compared to the previous assessment of 2019. The standard error in the tree cover estimate at the national level has been assessed at 4.01%. The standard error at the state level varies from 2.23% to 16.49%. Tree Cover and Trees Outside Forest (TOF) are two different entities but are closely related. TOF refers to all trees outside RFA irrespective of size of the patch. Tree cover, on the other hand, means patches of trees as well as isolated trees outside RFA on areas less than one hectare. TOF of Rajasthan has been calculated at 12,828 sq km.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/state-has-2nd-largest-area-under-tree-cover-maharashtra-tops-list/articleshow/88907017.cms||---

Out of the total geographical area of 3,42,239sqkm, the present forest cover is 16,655sqkm, which is 4.87%. The forest cover in the state two years ago was 16,630sqkm. According to the report, the state’s forest cover has seen a marginal increase of 0.15sqkm compared to 2019. While the moderate forest cover area has increased by 27sqkm, the open forest cover area has witnessed a slight reduction of 2sqkm in the last two years. In the previous report, the open forest was reduced from 12,210sqkm to 12,208sqkm. In 2019, the state’s forest cover had seen marginal increase of 57.51sqkm compared to 2017, when the moderate forest cover area and open forest cover area declined, though the former has started to show improvement. According to the report, while very dense forest (VDF) area remained unchanged from 2019 with 78sqkm, the moderately dense forest (MDF) witnessed a small increase from 4,342sqkm in 2019 to 4,369sqkm in 2021. Experts claimed that while the survey report is robust in terms of data, it does not take into consideration few other parameters including the quality of the vegetation and biodiversity, i.e., even though the forest cover might not have increased considerably, it has improved in terms of quality. IFSR said the reasons for increase were plantation and conservation activities as well as improvement in interpretation. The forest cover is broadly classified in four classes — very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and mangrove. The classification of the cover into dense and open forests is based on internationally adopted norms of classification. It has not been possible to further segregate the dense forest into more classes owing to enormity of work of ground validation and limitations of methodology. However, there are certain limitations also to the report including non-availability of appropriate season data which sometimes leads to misinterpretation of the features owing to poor reflectance of data.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/raj-forest-area-increases-by-25km2-in-2-yrs/articleshow/88908288.cms||Ajay Singh

---||Mangaluru||More people apply to open homestays in DK||Mangaluru: The tourism department in Dakshina Kannada is recording an increase in applications seeking permission to start homestays. About 60 homestays are already registered in the district and the majority of them are in Mangaluru. Deputy director of tourism department Manikya told TOI that there is certainly a rise in the number of applicants seeking permission to start homestays since the past four months. “We are also receiving applications from Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur. More people are coming from bordering areas in Sullia because of its proximity to Madikeri. This is also an opportunity for the unemployed. Many find hotels expensive, in case the family on tour is big and hence look out for homestays. Beachside homestays are always in demand,” he said, adding that it takes about a month for the applications to be cleared. It is mandatory that every homestay have CCTV cameras. Another official said they are receiving at least three new applications a week. During World Tourism Day celebrations, deputy commissioner KV Rajendra had sent out a message requesting unauthorised home stays to register at the earliest. This could be responsible for the increase in applications, he said. Yathish Baikampady, former CEO, Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project, said that if people are coming forward to convert their homes into homestays, then it is a good trend to take tourism to the next level. “Owners must not treat homestays only as a guest house, but must convert tourists into brand ambassadors of the coast. They must offer home cooked local food and take them to enjoy Kambala, bootha kola and other unique festivals and celebrations of the region. In case a tourist falls in love with the place, he definitely becomes a regular customer and also reviews and recommends the place. From the administration side, we only hope that the process to get permits is simplified and completed within a month,” he said. “There is definitely an increase in demand for homestays which could be due to the pandemic, as tourists prefer less crowded places. The district certainly does not have enough accommodation. The demand even during monsoon is high these days,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/more-people-apply-to-open-homestays-in-dk/articleshow/88907023.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

This seva is one of the most sought-after sevas in the temple. On Ashlesha Nakshatra, the demand is for nearly 2,000 sevas, and devotees stand in queue on the previous evening itself, for the tickets. The plan is to double the number of sevas.Temple managing committee president Mohanram Sulli told TOI that as part of the third phase development works to be taken up at a cost of Rs 300 crore, the masterplan’s blueprint has included the construction of four Ashlesha mantapas, which can accommodate nearly 500 devotees to perform around 250 ‘Ashlesha bali’ seva at a time, in one mantapa (hall), has been finalised. Currently, an average of about 1,000 to 1,300 sevas are performed in a day, in four batches of 250 sevas each. Once the mantapas are ready with a separate section for ‘sankalpa’, the temple will be able to conduct 1,000 sevas in four batches in one hall. The works are expected to be completed in two years, he said. Due to the pandemic, all sevas have been stopped at the temple temporarily, yet people throng in large numbers for darshan. From an average of 25,000 devotees visiting the temple, the footfall has reduced to 2,000-3,000 on weekdays, due to the restrictions. The online bookings of the Sarpa Samskara puja are full for the next two months, Mohanram said. Under the third phase of the Kukke Sri Subrahmanya Temple Master Plan, new seva counters, guest houses, shops for ‘hannu kayi’ and silver offerings, information centre, museum and other infrastructure will be developed on Car Street. A three-storey dasoha bhavan (dining hall) with a seating capacity for 3,000 people will be constructed following the traditional architecture. An auditorium with a seating capacity for 1,000 people and other amenities like parking facilities will be built at Injadi near Subrahmanya. A new power station will be set up exclusively for the temple, at an estimated cost of Rs 11 crore, and the bathing point will also be developed, he said. Minister S Angara has expressed confidence in getting the cabinet nod for the Rs 300 crore master plan. “The works will begin once we receive approval. Minister Shashikala Jolle is expected to hold a meeting at the temple soon, following which we will seek the cabinet approval,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/ashlesha-bali-seva-at-kukke-temple-to-be-increased-to-4000-per-day/articleshow/88907026.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said they have received several complaints regarding illegal sand mining. “The district administration needs drones to keep a tab on illegal sand mining, especially in places that cannot be accessed easily and quickly. It often happens that on receiving information, and by the time the team reaches the spot, miscreants escape through alternative routes,” he said.“They have informants on the road side,and hence easily escape on noticing officials arriving to conduct raids. Often, the officials only seize the boats used for illegal sand mining, and getting them to the shore is another challenge,’’ the deputy commissioner said.“Hence, we have decided to increase surveillance on the riverine side. Drones and speed boats or jet skis will be hired or purchased, to curb illegal sand mining,” he said A few weeks ago, reacting to complaints on rampant illegal quarrying in Dakshina Kannada, the deputy commissioner told officials at a meeting, to conduct a joint survey to check whether quarries are functioning legally, and asked the revenue department to use drones to locate stone quarries and crushers.High-mast lights to be installed on beachesThrough the District Tourism Committee, the administration is considering procuring high-mast lights. Rajendra said that six beach stretches in the district, including Someshwara, Batapady, Tannirbhavi, Panambur, Surathkal-iddya and Sasihithlu have been identified to install high-mast lights. Based on available funds, in the first phase, the administration hopes to have at least one high-mast light on every beach. Tourism department officials have been asked to submit a report on the same, the DC said, adding that there should be no dark place on any beach in the district. The issue has been discussed during the District Tourism Committee meeting, with the elected representatives. “We want all the beaches in the district to be well-lit, so that the beaches can be utilised from 7pm to 11pm gradually,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/jet-skis-drones-to-monitor-illegal-sand-mining-in-dk/articleshow/88907028.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The new plan is aimed at increasing the vaccine coverage in areas where people are reluctant to get inoculated, at a time when the district is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases. The communication plan will include audio and video clippings with appeals by religious leaders, influencers and prominent family physicians in the district. In addition, the district will also insist upon religious shrines to make announcements through the public address system on vaccination. Interpersonal communication activities are planned through village level task forces, to reach out to families who are refusing to get vaccinated. Similarly, plans have also been prepared to immediately cover all children in the age group of 15-18, beneficiaries in the healthcare sector, frontline workers from the government departments, and all others who are above 18.The district has set a goal to administer vaccines to 17.2 lakh beneficiaries, including healthcare workers, frontline workers from the government, and others who are above 18. In addition, a target to vaccinate 1 lakh beneficiaries in the age group of 15-18 has been set. The district also has a target to administer precautionary doses to 3,37,447 beneficiaries.Dr B V Rajesh, RCH officer, Dakshina Kannada, told TOI that a communication plan to address vaccine hesitancy will be launched soon. “We have already achieved 96% of the target to administer the first dose of vaccine for beneficiaries who are above 18. Meanwhile, 80% of beneficiaries who are above 18, who have received the first dose, have received the second dose too. We have administered the first dose of vaccine to 95% of those in the age group of 15-18. The new plan will help the district achieve targets in each category soon,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/communication-plan-to-address-vax-hesitancy-on-cards-by-dk-dist-admin/articleshow/88907029.cms||Vinobha K T
---||Mangaluru||Impose curfew on Monday and Tuesday: Merchants||Mangaluru: Various merchant organisations in Dakshina Kannada have demanded that the district administration allow them to conduct business on weekends. They said that shops can be closed for the first two days of a week, instead of weekends. They said that this will reduce their financial burden, as most of the textile, ready-made garment, footwear and mobile phone shops as well as beauty parlours and fancy stores do maximum business on weekends. Merchants also demanded that the expert committees that suggest Covid restrictions, should comprise representatives from merchant organisations and economists who have studied the problems businessmen face due to lockdowns and curfews.Karavali Textile, Readymade and Footwear Dealers Association president Santhosh Kamath told the media here on Friday, that merchants in the coastal districts are not able to sustain their businesses, due to losses incurred during curfews and lockdowns. “Most of the medium and small businessmen are struggling to repay bank loans, pay salaries to employees as well as rent and electricity bills. This unscientific weekend curfew is not a solution in fighting the pandemic, and businessmen are affected, who are already facing a financial crunch. Though political gatherings, festivals and elections are allowed on the one hand, merchants are punished in the name of weekend curfew and night curfew,” he said, and suggested that merchants are ready to close down their shops for two days, in the beginning of every week. Mangalore Ladies Beauticians Association president Babitha U Shetty said that beauty parlours are also affected due to the weekend curfew. “Beauty parlours do a lion’s share of their business during weekend holidays. Closing down beauty parlours on Saturdays and Sundays has caused several women entrepreneurs to sustain losses,” she said. Social activist M G Hegde said that the district administration should invite representatives of merchant organisations before taking decisions regarding weekend curfew and lockdowns. “We will have to launch a protest, if the district administration continues to take decisions without taking into consideration the problems faced by merchants,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/impose-curfew-on-monday-and-tuesday-merchants/articleshow/88907031.cms||---

The PG first-year classes will begin on January 17.The commencement of postgraduate first-year classes were reportedly postponed due to delay in the UG results. According to the university’s plans, the post-graduate classes were supposed to start in the second week of November. However, now it is already delayed by two months. During pre-pandemic days, the post-graduate courses used to start in August. “I did not get admission to a private autonomous college in the city as my results were not declared. The last hope I have is Mangalore University,” said a commerce student who wants to pursue MCom and had appeared for a special examination.According to the university, the new provision was made so that under-graduate students who missed getting admission elsewhere because of the delay in the announcement of results will be given an opportunity carry on their studies.Mangalore University registrar Kishore Kumar CK told TOI the university decided on this change at the recent meeting. The rules are applicable to all categories, including SC/ST and candidates who have appeared for special examinations held in December. If the seats are filled in a post-graduate course, there is a provision to allot additional seats to allow candidates. “The MU has made these special provisions so that those students who wish to pursue higher studies are not deprived of the opportunity,” Kishore said.Entrance exam fee waivedThe university has waived the entrance examination fee for all post-graduate courses. This move comes after the start of post-graduate courses was postponed more than five times.Sources from the university added that the admission to some of the courses is low in number. The science post-graduate courses on the Mangalagangothri campus or MU Konaje campus received 619 admissions, whereas commerce, arts, education received 127, 126 and 64 students, respectively.

The civic administration had tabled a proposal for giving an extension to the existing garbage collection contractors for two months — till March 31 at a total cost of Rs 17 crore. The civic body had already given a one-month extension, till January 31, after the contract expired on December 31. Accordingly, Gite approved the two-month extension proposal tabled by the the civic administration. He also directed the officials to complete the tender process and finalize the contractors at the earliest. The NMC had recently floated bids to appoint contractors for collecting and transporting solid waste from all six divisions of the municipal corporation.The civic body received poor response for two divisions — Panchavati and Satpur. Hence, the NMC floated fresh bids for these two divisions. Still, the response from private agencies for the other four divisions — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road and Cidco — was good. But the NMC did not open the tenders as they had planned to open the bids for all six divisions at one time.Gite, therefore, directed the administration to open the bids for other four divisions where they got good response from the contractors.

We hope that the bridge will be in place before next monsoon.”A PWD officer said that the work has been handed over to the department by the town development department.“We will now replace the swept away structure with a bridge that will match the Ordinary Flood Level (OFL), and it will have more height than the previous one,” said Rahul Cholke, an engineer with the PWD.The bridge will have more height and a strong foundation so that it is not inundated during the floods.Even if the bridge is inundated due to the unprecedented rains, it will be open to the public within a few hours and will ensure the safety of the bridge users.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/state-sanctions-2cr-for-new-bridge-in-nandgaon/articleshow/88907045.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Covid crisis keeps numbers down at Magh Mela||Prayagraj: The bright sunshine and elaborative arrangements made by the district administration for the devotees coming to Magh Mela 2022 on the occasion of Makar Sankranti were overshadowed by the Covid-19 crisis. Till 4:30pm, around 5.5 lakh people had taken holy dip whereas in previous years, these numbers were around 10 lakhs.Even the mela administration had made arrangements for keeping a strict vigil on devotees coming to the mela area as thermal scanning was being done at all the 16 entry points of the mela area and there was free distribution of mask and sanitiser from the covid help desk made by the authorities are several points. “We had stationed our teams at all the 16 entry points of the Magh Mela 2022 and ensured that every visitor had to pass through thermal scanning. Besides, a team of doctors too were deployed at these entry points and they were conducting rapid antigen test to every devotee who was showing any symptoms of coronavirus”, said district panchayati raj officer (DPRO), Alok Kumar Sinha. Besides, face masks were provided to each devotee entering mela area who was not having one, he added.The apprehension because of Covid-19 was seen on almost all the ghats of the mela area. Although, the concentration of the devotees, arriving at the ghats and taking the holy dip in river Ganga and Sangam was not seen because of the long stretch of ghats made by the authorities but, at the same time, pandemic did act as a deterrent in terms of attendance at the mela. The authorities had made covid-help desks near different ghats of the mela area. “Our prime aim was to see that none of the devotees arrive at the mela area without a mask and for those who were seen without masks, were given the same. At the same time, we have been trying to tell the devotees that they would be fined if they continue to show laxity in wearing mask”, said Mela Adhikari, Shesh Mani Pandey. Covid-19 also had its impact on the ‘bhandara’ organised by locals and social organisations in the city on occasion Makar Sankranti. There were less number of bhandara organised and almost all of them had less attendance as compared to last year. “We went to mela but were apprehensive of Covid-19 because of which we bathed at a remote place besides the river and came back straight to our home, without stopping at the bhandara”, said Pradeep Mishra, one of the retired railway staff.The less numbers of devotees arriving at the mela on Makar Sankranti is also because of the fact that many households would be observing the festival on Saturday. The mela authorities, their counterpart at Indian Railways and roadways have decided to provide all arrangements on January 15 too in apprehension of the fact that many devotees would take holy bath on January 15.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/covid-crisis-keeps-numbers-down-at-magh-mela/articleshow/88907052.cms||---

Sankranti is celebrated in almost all parts of the country in myriad cultural forms, with great devotion, fervour and gaiety. It is a harvest festival. Sankranti is perhaps the only Indian festival whose date always falls on the same day every year on the 14th of January. Sankranti signifies that one should turn away from darkness of delusion in which we live and begin to enjoy a new life with bright light within us to shine brighter and brighter. People had planned to go to Neersagar Lake, Kelgeri Lake, Gokarna, Murudeshwar and other places near water bodies and have delicious food on Makara Sankranti. Since the state government and local administration has banned gathering of people at picnic spots, the families, particularly in rural parts chose to go to agricultural fields with variety of dishes that included sajje roti, pot curd, shenga holige, maadli, gurellu-shenga chatni, brinjal bhartha, fried chillies, yellu-bella and much more. The customary gettogether of likeminded persons which used to be organised by the Janapada Samshodhana Samsthe of Dharwad on every Sankramana day was cancelled this year as the main organizer and noted folk singer Basalingayya Hiremath passed away recently. For the past several years Basalingayya along with his artist wife Vishweshwari had come up with a unique idea to display the rich tradition and the importance of festivals in one’s life. A group of like-minded women from different communities used to gather at a park or lakeside on the eve of Sankranti and celebrate the festival in an ethnic way. More than a hundred women dressed in traditional Ilkal sarees and ornaments used to welcome the first festival of the new year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/pandemic-casts-shadow-on-sankranti-festivities/articleshow/88907053.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Spurt in Covid cases further delays completion of HDSCL, HDMC projects||Hubballi: The recent spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, which experts have pointed out is but the precursor to the third iteration of the pandemic, has only added to the problems that the Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Ltd (HDSCL) and Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) have been grappling with for some time now. HDSCL officials have been at the receiving end of much criticism for the delay in completion of several projects. Senior HDSCL officials have repeatedly attributed the delay to the Covid-induced crisis, and the third wave of Covid will make it much harder for the agency to meet the deadline for its projects.Responding to complaints from the public, the Dharwad district in-charge minister revised the deadline to February. The fear of the infection spreading to workers has added to the pressure the officials are under.A HDSCL engineer said that they were intent on completing work at the earliest. “While working on the Chitaguppi Hospital last year, many of our labourers contracted the infection, and work on the project was suspended for 45 days. Thankfully, that is not the case this time around. However, owing to the curfew during the weekend, many of our labourers are unable to come to the worksite owing to restrictions in their localities,” said HDSCL deputy general manager Basavaraj.HDSCL managing director CW Shakeel Ahmed said that they had adopted all precautionary measures to ensure that Covid norms were being enforced at the worksite. “In Hubballi, there is ongoing work on projects cumulatively worth Rs 500 crore, and we have issued instructions to all contractors to ensure that work is completed before the deadline. Measures have been initiated to vaccinate all our labourers,” Ahmed said.Besides the projects undertaken by the HDSCL, the third wave may delay the completion of many of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation’s (HDMC) projects, which include repair of roads, pavement, drains, et al, estimated to cost Rs 60 crore. Labourers at these worksites are equally worried about the threat of the infection, said a source.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/spurt-in-covid-cases-further-delays-completion-of-hdscl-hdmc-projects/articleshow/88907054.cms||---

Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar wrote to defence minister Rajnath Singh urging him to construct a multipurpose indoor stadium on 16 acres of defence land at Vishweshwar Nagar. Shettar said that 16 acres of vacant defence land on Rajnagar Road in Vishweshwar Nagar has remained unused over the years. As the land is situated in the heart of city, it cannot be used for purposes of defence. Currently the open land has turned into a garbage dump and is not being maintained properly or cleaned by defence people. “I managed to clean the land using HDMC personnel,” he said. “As the land is situated in the heart of the city, it may not be possible to use it for a big project or for sports activities. However, there is a need of an indoor multipurpose stadium in Hubballi which can be constructed in the vacant place of defence department. In this regard, I wrote to the Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and had a one-to-one meeting during a visit to Delhi recently. I also discussed the issue with Union minister Pralhad Joshi. I will take this matter up with the state government,” he added. According to sources, during the discussions Rajnath Singh has said there is no provision for the construction of a sports complex through defence department. Then Shettar requested them to hand over the land to HDMC or to the district administration. There are chances of exchange of land in which alternative land can be given to the defence, sources said. Union minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Pertaining to vacant defence land in Hubballi, I have already discussed with Union minister Rajnath Singh two-three times. I recently met him along with former chief minister Jagadish Shettar in Delhi. Singh has agreed to give defence land if equivalent alternative land is given to the defence on the outskirts of Hubballi-Dharwad.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/shettar-pitches-for-indoor-stadium-on-defence-land/articleshow/88907055.cms||---

But, this year, the birds appear to have relocated to the Irani Bommanakatte Lake in Ranebennur in Haveri district. While a huge flock of the bar-headed geese is now nesting at the lake in Ranebennur, the other birds, albeit in smaller numbers, that have flown into Bommanakatte Lake include pratincoles, Brahminy Ducks, black ibis and the painted stork. With the lake reverberating with the cries of various birds, locals are flocking to it to drink in the sight of the feathered visitors.The lake, which is administered and maintained by the wildlife wing of the forest department, is spread across 11 hectares, and is framed by verdant hills in the midst of which it is nestled. Copious rainfall in Ranebennur in 2021 has left the lake brimming with water, ensuring that the migratory birds have enough food and water. The bar-headed geese have been visiting the lake for the past three years, while the remaining species of birds are mostly on their maiden visit to Bommanakatte.The bar-headed goose stands out even among the various birds at the lake, with its grey plumage and the white crown striated by two black bars. The bar-headed geese fly to India from Mongolia, soaring over the Himalayas to reach their destination.Avid birdwatcher Praveen Pujar said that the temperature nosedived in Mongolia during the winter months, prompting the birds to seek shelter in warmer climate. “These birds visit Karnataka between November and December, and nest here for three or four months before returning to Mongolia. The bar-headed geese are naturally equipped to fly across the Himalayas, using the jet stream. These birds are now attracting birdwatchers from across Haveri,” said an excited Pujar.Ravindra K, range forest officer in the wildlife wing of the forest department, said that the bounteous rainfall the district had received over the past three years had resulted in lakes and ponds across Haveri brimming with water. “Consequently, there is ample food for the birds, which are flocking to lakes in the district. The Bommanakatte Lake now has more than 300 migratory birds, which has turned it into a local attraction,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/bommanakatte-lake-draws-migratory-birds-in-droves/articleshow/88907056.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

An elevator that was installed is defunct. Bus platforms are shifted often. Drivers struggle with entry and exit as the bus stand is surrounded with narrow, crowded roads. Malamma Kurubar, a senior citizen from Gadag, told TOI that she wanted to go to KIMS Hospital. “According to the conductor’s suggestion, I got down at Hosur Bus Stand and had to climb 54 steps. There was no lift or ramp. Those steps took me 15 minutes. Now I have decided not to go to the Hosur stand,” she said.There is a ramp for those who cannot negotiate stairs, but there is no signage that could guide a commuter to the facility. A wheelchair is kept in a corner but no information is available about it.Zakir Hussain, a physically challenged passenger from Karwar, said he climbed the steps using hands as he had no information regarding the wheelchair or the ramp. “This is the worst bus stand I have seen in my life,” he said.Srinath TL, the divisional controller of the Hubballi Moffsil Division of the NWKRTC, said: “We have taken charge just two days ago. We will check and address all the grievances soon.”Many drivers and conductors alleged that they do not have a place to eat. “In the old bus stand, we used to sit in a hotel and eat. Here, no place is available. Only one Darshini eatery can’t feed all the passengers and staff. If we want tea, we have to leave the bus stand for at least half an hour” a driver said. A woman conductor said ,”These are not enough for such a big bus stand. Sometimes, water supply is not there for two to three days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/hi-tech-hosur-bus-terminal-falls-short-on-service/articleshow/88907057.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Braving the heavy rush, pilgrims waited for this moment for hours. Makaravilakku ceremony, after the sacred ‘Thiruvabharanam’ was placed on the idol of Lord Ayyappa, was performed under the leadership of the tanthri in the presence of melsanthi around 6:35pm. Immediately after that, the devotees saw Makara Jyothi on the eastern horizon. Earlier, the ceremonial procession carrying ‘Thiruvabharanam’ from Valiakoikkal Dharma Sastha Temple in Pandalam, was accorded a traditional reception at Saramkuthi, while on its way to the hill shrine, around 5pm. Devaswom officials accompanied the procession till it reached the 18 holy steps of the temple by 6:35pm. Devaswom minister K Radhakrishnan, president of Travancore Devaswom Board K Ananthagopan, ADGP S Sreejith and others were present there. Melsanthi and tanthri received the ornaments and adorned the deity, following which ‘deeparadhana’ was held. While puja was progressing inside, thousands of devotees chanted ‘Sharana mantras’ at various locations of Sannidhanam. Sopana Sangeetham was performed in front of the temple. The doors of the sreekovil reopened after deeparadhana around 6:48pm after which the Jyothi was seen at Ponnambalamedu, located 8km away from the temple, at 6:51pm. ‘Swamiye Saranamayyappa’ chants intensified when Makara Jyothi flickered across the horizon.

The hill shrine will be closed on Jan 19, marking the conclusion of the pilgrimage season. Devaswom officials said over 50,000 devotees visited the shrine on Friday. The heavy rush of people forced the policemen on duty to block thousands of devotees, on their way to Sabarimala, at Pamba. There was a strict ban on the entry of devotees at Pullumedu this time as part of Covid restrictions. The TDB president had clarified that the decision on Covid-related restriction, to be imposed on visitors in the following days, would be taken only after Makaravilakku.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sabarimala-thousands-witness-makara-jyothi/articleshow/88905595.cms||TNN

No store in the complex has been opened, and the NWKRTC’s aim of generating revenue by allowing commercial activities at the complex remains a dream still.The bus terminal cum commercial complex set up by the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) in Shanthinagar was the model that the authorities in NWKRTC hoped to emulate. The five-storey building boasts a spacious parking lot, in addition to three enormous halls among others. Furthermore, each floor of the building has a spacious office, dedicated restrooms for the staff and public, with each floor connected by a lift.Sources said that disinterested officials were to blame for failing to transform the complex into a thriving hub for business. The e-tender was issued on five occasions, but no trader expressed interest to set up shop at the complex. In addition to mismanagement, the beating that the economy has taken in the wake of the Covid-induced crisis has made many entrepreneurs and retailers apprehensive about setting up a new store in NWKRTC’s complex, where the rent is expected to be exorbitant.Hubblli-Dharwad city division controller for NWKRTC Vivekanand Vishwajanya told TOI, “We have been grappling with problems aplenty ever since the complex was inaugurated. The Covid-induced crisis is one of the reasons why we have not been able to utilise the complex. We have already issued a tender inviting traders to set up shop at the complex.”Vishwajanya said that, they had drawn the attention of the NWKRTC managing director to the issue, and it had been decided to reduce the rent. “We hope this will encourage traders to set up stores at the complex,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/11-months-since-inauguration-nwkrtcs-commercial-complex-remains-unutilised/articleshow/88907059.cms||---

He specifically mentioned the failure of banks in providing funds for housing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. “Applicants are complaining that they are harassed by the banks which are delaying the release of funds on one or the other pretext. The bankers should introspect and work with honesty and sincerity to implement the government schemes,” Patil told the bankers.He said the delay by banks was forcing needy, deserving people to borrow from moneylenders. Patil requested bankers to be people-friendly.Patil asked the lead bank to launch a drive to assess the quantum of loan borrowed from moneylenders and banks and ensure that the poor do not borrow from lenders. He said the district administration had received complaints that banks were adjusting the amount credited to beneficiary accounts for working under Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) , for crop insurance and compensation for crop loss. Patil said that banks should stop doing this according to the direction of the Reserve Bank of India. He warned that action will be taken against a bank if the administration receives a single such complaint.Zilla panchayat CEO B Susheela expressed her displeasure at the undue delay by banks in extending facilities to women entrepreneurs and self-help groups.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/banks-in-dharwad-to-be-ranked-on-rural-scheme-services/articleshow/88907062.cms||---

The issues were mainly related to the health and hygiene of area residents, diseases caused by the garbage dump and related problems.Councillor Kuldeep Singh said, “90 percent of the people are sick because of this dumping ground. There is a dire need of 24×7 hospital in Daddumajra with proper arrangement of emergency services and facility of round the clock ambulance. Medical examination of Daddumajra residents should be done by setting up regular medical camps.”The councillor demanded that Daddumajra residents be given employment by starting the garbage processing plant with new technology. “There should be regular spraying of soil and medicine in Daddumajra.

Delhi’s first prototype electric bus is also set for a launch and a total of 300 electric buses are likely to hit the city’s roads by April. “We are dedicating 100 new AC low floor buses to the people of Delhi today. These buses will be put to use from today itself,” the CM said. He said the buses would be stationed at a new depot developed in Ghumanhera and would primarily ply on rural routes. “Overall, there are about 6,900 buses running on the roads of Delhi today. This is the highest number ever achieved by the state transport department. There used to be around 6,000 buses during the Commonwealth Games,” he said. “In the coming days, we’ll see infusion of buses at a larger scale into the system. Electric buses are about to arrive, CNG buses are in the process, and DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) is getting its own fleet too,” he said, adding that the whole process of procuring buses takes two to three years. “There was a dearth of buses when we came to power and we initiated the process of procuring buses right back then itself. Ever since then, we’ve been seeing buses being rolled in from time to time,” he said. “The Delhi government is committed towards taking the bus transport system of Delhi to the highest standards and will provide the best frequency on every single route,” he added. The 100 buses, which have been deployed on nine additional cluster routes, are Bharat Stage VI emission standard compliant. They are equipped with the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, bus kneeling with foldable ramp for differently-abled persons. The buses have CCTV cameras and panic buttons for the safety of women passengers as well. “We are also making a huge transition to electric, the first bus of which is already in Delhi and ready to start running on our roads,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “Delhi’s buses now stand out as an example of a safe, accessible and convenient transport system in the country and we are in the process of expanding our paratransit systems to ensure safe last mile connectivity to every Delhiite at any time of the day,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cm-flags-off-100-low-floor-ac-buses-fleet-up-to-6900/articleshow/88905910.cms||---

Though rainfall has not been predicted in Bihar, but partly cloudy skies are likely over Patna and several other places in south Bihar as adjoining Jharkhand is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall on Saturday. Mohammad Zeeshan Ansari, an official at the Patna Meteorological Centre, said partly cloudy skies are expected in the state over the next 48 hours. Meanwhile, clear skies following rain earlier this week have led to plunge in minimum temperature. Valmikinagar in West Champaran, Motihari in East Champaran and Jiradei in Siwan recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 9.0 degrees C on Friday morning. The highest maximum temperature, on the other hand, was recorded at Khagaria at 23.7 degrees C. "The night temperature will continue to drop,” Ansari said. The Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted that minimum temperature at Patna will be around 9 degrees C over the next four days, 9-10 degrees C at Gaya and 10-11 degrees C at Bhagalpur. Weather remained mostly dry in the state in the last 24 hours. Few places in northeastern parts of the state witnessed dense fog in the morning hours.

However, going by the astrological calculations, many people will celebrate it on Saturday. There were very few people at the important Ganga ghats in the urban areas, which in normal times witnessed huge congregations of devotees for taking a holy dip in the river on this auspicious day. Policemen were seen maintaining vigil at the ghats while NDRF and SDRF personnel carried out river patrolling. There were neither roadside fair, nor get-together of political leaders on ‘dahi-chura’ bhoj or cultural programmes to mark the occasion. Dr Nikhil Kumar Singh, principal of JNL College at Khagaul, said, “Our long family tradition of holding ‘Bramhan bhoj’ and offering them donations had a brake this time due to Covid fear. Not even the people in neighbourhoods stepped out of their homes to exchange greetings.” Vijay Kumar of Naya Tola said it was the first time that his family members did not go for ‘Ganga snan’ due to the fear of virus infection. Meanwhile, deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad celebrated the Makar Sankranti with a ‘dahi-chura bhoj' with NDA workers at his Katihar residence. He also extended greetings to people of the state on this occasion. Former health minister Tej Pratap Yadav reached Delhi to celebrate the day with his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad and others there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/makar-sankranti-a-low-key-affair/articleshow/88907086.cms||VK Tripathi

According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Delhi Rajdhani Express (12309) has a total of 1,134 berths. However, the passenger occupancy rate on this train is extremely low, hovering around 40% to 50%. Similarly, the Rajgir-New Delhi Shramjeevi Express (12391) and Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Delhi Sampoorna Kranti Express (12393) are operating with a low occupancy rate due to an exponential increase in Covid cases in Bihar. “The Patna-Bilaspur Express (22844), Patliputra Junction-Chandigarh Express (22355), Barauni-Ernakulam Express (12521), and Patna-Bandra Express (22972), which were previously operating at 100% occupancy, are now running at a reduced capacity due to Covid fear. Likewise, the Raxaul-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express (15331), Darbhanga-Ahmedabad Express (15559), and Danapur-Anand Vihar Express (13257) are long distance trains with a very low occupancy rate,” the CPRO told this reporter on Friday. He added, “Due to the surge of Covid-19 cases, the occupancy rate of passengers travelling by the Rajendra Nagar Terminal-Howrah Express (12352), Darbhanga-New Delhi Express (12565), and Jaynagar-Sealdah Express (13586) has also decreased. The Danapur-Pune Express (12150), Jaynagar-Amritsar Express (14649), Muzaffarpur-Ahmedabad Express (19084), Danapur-Secunderabad Express (12792), and Danapur-Bengaluru Express (12296) have a similar fate.” Meanwhile, an official of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) claimed that the effect of Covid on passenger occupancy was so noticeable that nearly 20,000 tickets were cancelled daily across the country. “The IRCTC was booking at least 15 lakh tickets online per day on normal days. However, the number has come down to 9 to 10 lakh due to Covid fear among the passengers,” the official said, adding that the IRCTC, which was to start catering services in long distance trains, had been forced to drop the proposal for the time being.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/occupancy-rate-in-trains-plummets-drastically/articleshow/88907087.cms||Kumod Verma
---||Patna||Bihar: No corona variant should be taken lightly, cautions doctor||PATNA: Even though the number of Covid-19 cases in the state has increased dramatically in the last few days, a vast majority of the patients are recovering within a week or two. Most of them appear to be infected with the Omicron variant. According to health experts, people infected with the Omicron variant typically exhibit mild symptoms and are cured in home isolation. This is largely because the majority of them have already been immunised against Covid-19 and developed immunity. Sanjay Kumar Singh, the executive director of the State Health Society, told this reporter, “Of the 32 samples sent to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences for genome sequencing, 27 were of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Altogether 96 more samples have been sent to the hospital for genome sequencing, with results expected in three to four days.” He added, “It is premature to conclude that all Covid cases identified via RT-PCR test are of the Omicron variant alone. People are also contracting Delta or other variants.” Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), stated that no variant should be taken lightly and that infected individuals must get adequate rest and medication in home isolation to avoid further complications. “At the moment, at least 55 Covid patients are being treated at the AIIMS-P, with several of them being critically ill. People who have comorbidities require specialised medical care,” the doctor explained. Dr Satish Kumar of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) admitted that the majority of positive cases being reported these days appeared to be of the Omicron variant. He said, “A person infected with Covid must be isolated at home for at least seven days, the last three of which should be fever-free. If the patient develops a fever on his or her seventh day of isolation, he or she must remain isolated for an additional three days.” Approximately 50 patients are currently receiving treatment at the NMCH’s Covid ward, but none of them is in critical condition. “Only those who are already suffering from another serious disease before contracting Covid exhibit severe symptoms. For those who have tested positive despite receiving both doses of vaccination, the infection will act as a sort of booster dose,” Dr Satish claimed. He did, however, urge people to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour in order to protect themselves.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/no-corona-variant-should-be-taken-lightly-cautions-doctor/articleshow/88907088.cms||---

These will be staffed by female police officers.According to sources, the state has 1,196 police stations. In Phase I, women help desks will be set up in around 500 police stations with the help of the Nirbhaya Fund. The second phase will cover the remaining police stations. The state government has approved an administrative budget of Rs 5 crore for the establishment of the desks, with each police station receiving Rs 1 lakh. An official told TOI that separate vehicles, cellphones, and other means of transportation would be provided to female officers assigned to the women help desks, allowing them to travel anywhere if necessary. “Each police station will have a separate room dedicated to the women help desk,” he said. Besides, women police officers will soon be equipped with scooters that will enable them to perform patrolling duties more effectively and arrive at crime scenes without delay. Each police station will have at least one scooter, so that if there is information about molestation, eve-teasing, or assault, the officers can respond immediately without waiting for a vehicle. Additionally, the scooter will make it easier for them to reach their destination without encountering road congestion.JD (U) leader Sanjay Kumar Jha lauded the state government’s decision, saying, “In yet another novel initiative inspired by chief minister Nitish Kumar’s vision, policewomen in Bihar will soon be seen on scooters.

---||Patna||No major hitch likely among GA partners over 24 vacant legislative council seats||Patna: The bigger constituents of both the ruling NDA and the RJD-led grand alliance (GA) in the opposition are seemingly sanguine that the claims of Lok Janshakti Party (National) led by Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras and the Left parties will not prove to be bugbear for their respective political combine during the seat-sharing talks for the coming elections to the 24 seats of the legislative council from the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and the urban local bodies.The LJP(N) has asserted that it would contest the Hajipur seat, making it clear at the same time that it has no intention to contest other seats – like Saharsa, Supaul, etc. In fact, Nutan Singh was elected to the council on the undivided LJP ticket from Saharsa, but later switched over to the BJP.LJP (Ram Vilas) faction led by Chirag Paswan has been trying to regroup itself at the base and, accordingly, has announced that his party would be in the fray without being in any of the two major political alliances. As for the party position in the outgoing 24 council seats, the BJP had 13 MLCs, followed by eight of JD(U), two of RJD and one of the Congress. The elections were held in 2015. Clearly, the NDA’s bugbear is its smaller constituents – like the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Vikashsel Insaan Party (VI) and LJP (N), and also the major ally the JD(U).As for the RJD-led grand alliance, Congress has ambitiously laid claim to seven seats, which has irritated the RJD, but the Left parties have been pragmatic enough to keep their claims realistic. The grand alliance’s party position in the state assembly is: 75 RJD, 19 Congress, 12 CPI(ML), two each of CPI and CPM. CPI state secretary Ram Naresh Pandey told media persons that his party had won the Begusarai and Bhagalpur seats in the past and can also contest a few other seats, but would like to go by the outcome of the joint seat-sharing talks. “There is no rift in the grand alliance. Even the Congress claim to seven seats has not been made officially by the party’s state president Madan Mohan Jha,” he added.While the CPM is also mulling over to be in the fray and is in the process of shortlisting the seats that it can contest, the CPI(ML) is desirous of contesting three seats: Bhojpur, Patna and Jehanabad. In 2015, the CPI(ML) had unsuccessfully contested Bhojpur, Darbhanga and Siwan constituencies. “Till now, we have held one round of talks with the RJD. Our representatives Dhirendra Kumar Jha and K D Yadav stressed on unity and understanding in the grand alliance. All the constituents should sit together and find an amicable solution to the seat-sharing tangle, looking at the things comprehensively,” party’s state secretary Kunal said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/no-major-hitch-likely-among-ga-partners-over-24-vacant-legislative-council-seats/articleshow/88907092.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||JD(U) to contest 15 seats, RLJP six in Manipur polls||Patna: At least two Bihar-centric political parties have decided to try their luck in the forthcoming assembly polls in Manipur, scheduled to vote in two phases on February 27 and March 3 this year.While Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has decided to field its candidates in around 15 assembly constituencies, out of total 60 in Manipur, Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras-led Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party (RLJP) is planning to field its candidates from those six constituencies where the erstwhile LJP candidates had performed well in the 2017 assembly polls.In 1917, the erstwhile LJP’s Karam Shyam had won Langthabal seat and also became a cabinet minister while its other five candidates had performed well in Saikot, Naoriya Pakhanglakpa, Bishunpur, Wangkhem and Nungba constituencies. The JDU), as part of a policy decision, had not contested the 2017 assembly polls in Manipur. After a split in the erstwhile LJP at the national level, majority of the party leaders in Manipur went with the Paras-led RLJP. Paras is younger brother of late Ram Vilas Paswan.RLJP national spokesperson Sharvan Kumar Agrawal on Friday said Paras had visited Manipur in the last week of December to take stock of the political scenario in the northeast state in the wake of the coming assembly polls there.“After holding a series of discussions with the leaders of the Manipur state unit, the RLJP has decided to contest the assembly election. But our first priority will be to contest the election as part of the NDA. If the NDA fails to accommodate the RLJP in the seat-sharing, the party may decide to contest alone. Final decision will be taken by the party’s national president Paras,” Agrawal told TOI.He also said in the 1917 polls, the erstwhile LJP, then led by Ram Vilas, had fielded its candidates from 17 seats. Nominations of three candidates did not materialize due to different reasons. Thus, the rest 14 candidates contested on the LJP symbol. The party performed well in at least six constituencies. Sources in the JD(U) said the party is planning to contest around 15 seats. “We have decided to focus mainly on those seats where we have chances to win,” JD(U) national general secretary and party’s northeast in-charge Afaque Ahmad Khan told TOI over phone.Khan said JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh and other central leaders visited Manipur in December and held a mega rally to strengthen the party’s support base in the northeast state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-to-contest-15-seats-rljp-six-in-manipur-polls/articleshow/88907093.cms||Madan Kumar

They accused the doctors and staff of the nursing home of negligence in treatment. On the complaint of family members, police have filed an FIR against the nursing home operator and the doctor concerned for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

---||Delhi||Delhi: January-end target for Pragati Maidan tunnel||NEW DELHI: Although the Public Works Department is targeting the end of January for the completion of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, there actually are serious challenges still in the way. In the main, the agency is not unable to procure adequate bitumen for road carpeting, without which the underground road will be unusable. According to a PWD official, when pollution in the city hit a high, the authorities imposed a ban on the operation of hot-mix plants producing bituminous road construction material, leading to a shortage at Pragati Maidan. “We somehow got permission for one hot-mix plant in Palwal, Haryana, to function and we are procuring bituminous material from there, but it is simply not enough for the work at hand,” said the official. “It will take us more days to finish the tunnel if we are unable to get more road carpeting material. We have requested that other hot-mix plants be allowed so that we can finish the work on time.” PWD earlier procured bitumen from plants in Sahibabad and Ghaziabad too. Bringing the macadam material from such distances is a problem because the night temperatures have dropped when a minimum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius is necessary to spread the material on the road evenly before it solidifies. Covid-19 among workers is another challenge. Two project officials are down with the infection. The project aims at decongesting the roads around Pragati Maidan. The tunnel road goes beneath Pragati Maidan, starting near National Sports Club of India on Purana Qila Road and ending on the other side on Ring Road near the Pragati power station. The 1.2-km tunnel and the six underpasses — five on Mathura Road and one on Ring Road —will reduce snarls for the estimated one lakh motorists using the ITO intersection every day. The Bhairon Marg section will also face less traffic congestion after the opening of this tunnel. Two of the five underpasses on Mathura Road are near Sundar Nagar and three are between Pragati Maidan and Supreme Court. The underpass on the Ring Road connects it with Bhairon Marg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/january-end-target-for-pragati-maidan-tunnel/articleshow/88905914.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||FSI report: District’s forest area decreases by 6.20 sq km||Ludhiana: There has been a decrease in the forest area of the district. As per the latest Forest Survey of India (FSI) report, which was released by FSI, Dehradun, the forest area of the district in 2021 was 52.72 square kilometres. As compared with the 2019 report, when it was 58.92 square kilometres, there has been a reduction of 6.20 sq km. The report shows that among the various types of forests in the district, there is a fall in the area under moderate dense forest to 22.86 sq km in 2021 from 25.18 sq km in 2019 report. As per the 2017 and 2015 reports, the area under moderate dense forest was 26 sq km and 33 sq km, respectively.The area under open forest, too, fell from 33.74 sq km to 29.86 sq km. In 2017 and 2015 reports, the area under open forest was 29 sq km and 35 sq km, respectively.The forest cover of the district is low at just 1.47% of its geographical area, which is 3,578 square kilometres. As per the 2019 report, the forest cover of Ludhiana was 1.65%, so the present value is 1.8% less. The district doesn’t have very dense forest.With 6.20 sq km fall in forest cover, the report puts Ludhiana at third spot in the state in the negative change. Hoshiarpur is at the top with 7.10 sq km decrease in forest cover, followed by Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar that recorded a fall of 6.39 sq km. Ferozepur had the highest positive change in the state, with an increase of 20.98 sq km.The news has not gone down well with the residents.“The decrease in forest area is because of many reasons. First, fully-grown trees have been cut in commercial and residential areas. Those cutting the trees are not penalised. Also, wherever there is deforestation, there is no afforestation. The government has a proposal to construct an industrial park in Mattewara that has 4,000-acre patch of forest. This step will prove disastrous for the Mattewara forest as industry there will damage trees,” said Dr Amandeep Bains, founder member of RBS (Rajguru, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev) roots that champions the cause of clean and green Ludhiana.Divisional forest officer (DFO), Ludhiana, Harbhajan Singh said, “There have been many road widening projects for which trees were felled. It could be a reason for decrease in forest area. Afforestation has been done in the past three to four years. Satellite imagery will capture that and show increase in area under forest in Ludhiana. We have carried out plantation in new areas after removing encroachments on them.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/fsi-report-districts-forest-area-decreases-by-6-20-sq-km/articleshow/88907104.cms||Shariq Majeed

As they cannot take stringent action against the defaulters in the election season, the officials have been told to only send reminders to those who are yet to pay property tax for the current year. Besides, with the staff deputed on election duty, recovery has come to a standstill. The officials said there were over 1 lakh owners who were yet to pay property tax for this financial year, but they could not take action as they have time up to March 31. This year, MC has to recover Rs 110 crore in property tax, but till now they could generate only Rs 76 crore. A few days before the imposition of the model code of conduct, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had asked the officials to expedite the recovery and also serve sealing notices on the previous years’ defaulters. But it did not work. One of the officials said they have been told to recover dues with an advisory and not to go harsh on people because of the assembly elections. He said MC has taken a loan of Rs 100 crore and in case of no recovery of pending dues, they would not be able to pay back. “The outstanding water supply and sewerage dues were waived and even the current bill is only Rs 50 per household. So the only hope is to get the dues from commercial and industrial units,” he added.However, sources said at the moment the officials were only worried about paying the salaries to the staff and over Rs 40 crore payment is pending towards contractors, who have executed various developmental works. MC superintendent Vivek Verma said, “We are trying our best to recover pending dues, but most of the staff is on election duty. Still, we have been asking people to pay their taxes.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/elections-bleed-civic-bodys-coffers-dry/articleshow/88907107.cms||---

Some are in favour of giving personal touch to the election campaigning with door-to-door meetings, some are preparing for the virtual meetings keepings in view the situation. However, all are waiting for a word from the election commission about rallies, as there is ban on the them till January 15. The Akali Dal candidate from east constituency, Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “As the cases are still increasing, I do not think we will get permission for the rallies. So I have already started covering the areas while moving door-to door. Moreover, the rallies waste a lot of time and energy in making arrangements. These days people do not want to come out to their houses because of pandemic.” He also said party workers connect with voters through social media.On the other hand, BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said, “We are already preparing for virtual meetings. On January 16, we are expecting at least 3 lakh people to take part in one. We have our IT cell and if required we will organise virtual rallies in the city like we had done in Himachal. We will get big screens installed in chowks where we will telecast leaders’ speeches.” He also claimed that rallies were a waste a lot of time, as is better if candidates could reach out to the voters personally. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party district president Suresh Goel said, “AAP is the first party that started the trend of campaigning through social media as we succeeded in Delhi with the help of social media. In Punjab, also we have a grip. The party is also training the candidates to use social media.” He said the situation right now does not allow for organising rallies instead AAP is keen on meeting people door-to-door and in small gathering because it gives a feel of personal touch. Goel said recently Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also carried out door-to-door in Punjab so other candidates can follow him. However, Congress district president Ashwani Sharma said, “We have called up the IT teams here and they have started working as well but still we believe we need to reach out to the poor people we need to go to them as they do not use mobile and internet.” He said they will do nukkad meetings and rallies, dependimg on the decision of the election commission. Meanwhile, rural candidates are having different point of view. SAD candidate from Dakha, Manpreet Ayali said, “I have covered the entire constituency once and if we do not get permission for rallies, it will not make any difference. Here in villages we have lots of programmes daily. On Friday, I participated in Maghi celebrations in gurdwaras so in a way this is also giving me a platform to meet the voters.” He said they will plan something virtually as well but after seeing the directions from ECI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/amid-covid-curbs-politicians-bank-on-virtual-door-to-door-campaigns/articleshow/88907109.cms||---

However, the mayor is left with no answer but to blame the code of conduct for not issuing the letters to the employees. Municipal Karamchari Dal had staged protest for over 10 days in November last year with a demand to include the sweepers and sewer cleaners in the list of employees who were going to be regularised. However, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi even announced that these employees will be regularised and when he came in city for inauguration of a few projects he handed over letters to over a dozen of the employees but even they did not get posting anywhere. The mayor said final letters of employees could not be signed as chief secretary got busy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi security breach issue. Meanwhile, the election commission imposed code of conduct after announcing the election dates. Meanwhile, BJP councillor and member of Municipal Karamchari Dal Yashpal Chaudhary said, “It was actually a plan that they made announcement but never fulfilled. Over 3,000 employees were supposed to be benefited by this but now they are again hopeless because there is no guarantee that Congress will come back to power and after elections whichever government comes to power they will take their own decision.” However, mayor Sandhu said, “We got approvals but final signatures were pending when the code was imposed. The employees need not worry as soon as code will be over we will get this work done on priority.” He said resolution was put up in the MC house only then MC employees could have been considered and from here everything was done, the delay was only at Chandigarh level.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/hopes-of-mc-sanitation-staff-for-regularisation-dashed/articleshow/88907111.cms||---

---||Pune||Cold, dry weather drives up flu cases amid Covid in Pune||PUNE: A consistent difference in the city’s day and night temperatures has triggered a surge in flu over the last few days, doctors have said. Some of these flu cases go on to test positive for Covid as well, with mild to moderate symptoms, the doctors said, adding that many patients are coming in with weakened body states. Weather may not have an outsized role in the spread of Covid-19; the matter is still under investigation. But studies show coronaviruses tend to generally survive longer in environments with low sunlight, decreased humidity and colder temperatures. Lower temperatures often force people to spend more time indoors. This reduced access to sunlight can impede the body’s fight against viruses in circulation. Asenior Met official said, “Mornings have mostly been either hazy or overcast. The evenings too have been overcast. Some areas of the city even had light rainfall last week. So, weather conditions have been volatile and may have caused health issues. ” Physician Avinash Bhondwe said, “We have noticed a threefold increase in patients with extreme weakness, fever, runny nose and respiratory diseases since the last week of December. Some tested positive for Covid with mild symptoms. Usually, we do not get patients in these numbers in January. But we have observed that the consistent temperature variations during the night and day have caused health issues for many in the city. ” On Friday, the Shivajinagar observatory recorded day temperature of 27. 1°C, which was below nor mal by 2. 5°C. The Lohegaon observatory recorded 26. 3°C, which was below the average by 3. 4°C. And the night temperature readings from Shivajinagar and Lohegaon were 13. 8°C and 14. 3°C — above normal by 2. 4°C and 2. 3°C, respectively. Met officials said this meant the variations between day and night have not been much (mostly in the range of 10-14°C), which further suggested that people were not feeling the difference between night and day temperatures. Such conditions can apply stress on the body. Bhondwe said, “People with weak bones due to the lack of calcium have pains. Blood circulation does not take place properly due to the cold. ” Physician Prakash Mahajan said there has been a rise in the patients with upper respiratory tract infections. He said that finding a difference between Covid and non-Covid patients was now almost impossible. “Most patients have sore throat, sneezing, stuffy nose and cough. Some patients first reported a dry cough that later tur ned wet. So giving the apt medication in this situation is a challenge for physicians. Adhering to Covid norms is key,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cold-dry-weather-drives-up-flu-cases-amid-covid-in-city/articleshow/88907113.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Autorickshaws’ registration hits 4-year low in PMC, PCMC areas||PUNE: Regional transport offices in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad recorded the lowest autorickshaw registrations in the last four years in 2021. Officials claimed that the number of people opting for autorickshaw permits has gone down since 2020, and was the lowest since 2017 in 2021, with the state government withdrawing the open permit system for acquiring three-wheelers in 2017. “Far too less permits are being issued, which is directly related to registrations. There are cases where people got their permits but couldn’t buy an autorickshaw. Until 2019, revenue generated from autorickshaw registrations was among the highest in Pune and came only second to two-wheelers,” an official with the regional transport office (RTO) said. There was around 11% decrease in autorickshaw registrations in 2021 compared to 2020. The drop compared to 2019 was around 69% in Pune. In Pimpri Chinchwad, too, there was a decrease of around 12% in registrations in 2021 compared to 2020. The drop, when compared to 2019, was around 61%. The total number of autorickshaws operating in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad is more than 1 lakh now. “It’s been a week I have been getting not more than four to five short-trip passengers. I have not been able to find passengers willing to take long trips. I pay Rs3,000 EMI for the vehicle every month and with Covid-19 cases surging again, I doubt if I would be able to pay the EMI this month,” said autorickshaw driver Ibrahim Inamdar. In 2017, the state government had opened up permits for autorickshaws, resulting in several people buying the three-wheeler. “Once a person gets the permit, he has to go to an autorickshaw manufacturer with the permit and within 90 days, the person has to buy an autorickshaw else the permit goes null and void,” said Nitin Pawar, the convenor of Rickshaw Panchayat, the largest autorickshaw union in Pune.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/autorickshaws-registration-hits-4-year-low-in-pmc-pcmc-areas/articleshow/88907114.cms||Joy Sengupta

Equipped with all the necessary equipment, the total capacity of the hospital, which has two buildings, is 288 beds. Dr Ambadas Deomane, head of the sub-district health office in Manchar, under whom the hospital is, told TOI on Friday, “We shall start with 24 ICU and 120 oxygen-equipped beds. Since the hospitalization of Covid positive patients is still under control, we are not reopening the other 144-bed facility at this juncture.” The fresh cases are mainly from Khed, Shirur, Ambegao, and Junnar tehsils. According to the district administration, 85 Covid patients were active in Ambegaon tehsil. Of them, only 12 were admitted in hospital and their health conditions were better. “Although, positive cases are on the rise in rural Pune, the situation is still under control. In Ambegaon and the neighboring tehsils, the number of critical patients is still under control,” Deomane said. The jumbo hospital had to close because of lack of Covid patients in August, the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/corona-jumbo-hospital-to-reopen-in-ambegaon/articleshow/88907115.cms||---
---||Pune||No antivirals, antibacterials if it’s mild Covid-19, says experts||PUNE: At a time when all guidelines are advising cautious use of antivirals and antibacterials against Covid, experts, including those from the national task force, are becoming increasingly concerned about the heavy use of molnupiravir and azithromycin by doctors treating those with mild illness. The experts said paracetamol and other supportive care are good enough to recover from mild disease. Only those patients who are unvaccinated and with underlying conditions can be considered high-risk. These patients need to be monitored for progression towards severe symptoms and can be treated cautiously with the antiviral molnupiravir, the experts added. “Molnupiravir is currently not recommended for mild illness due to modest benefit in an unvaccinated population. In the only molnupiravir study, a modest benefit was seen only among unvaccinated patients with obesity,” said Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force. “Similarly, antibacterials, including azithromycin, are also being unduly prescribed to mild Covid patients,” Pujari added. Mumbai-based critical care expert Chandrashekhar T, director (critical care) at Fortis Hiranandani, said, "In many mild cases we know it's pure viral. They can be treated symptomatically." He said, "Molnupiravir and Azithromycin have not been included in WHO guidelines and in the UK. Similarly, they have not been included in ICMR guidelines. Even our country's task force has not listed molnupiravir and azithromycin for use. The Union health ministry has also raised the red flag as molnupiravir is not free from adverse effects. It’s also not indicated in pregnant women due to the chances of foetal defects." Molnupiravir is commercially available and can be bought with a doctor's prescription.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/no-antivirals-antibacterials-if-its-mild-covid-19-experts/articleshow/88907116.cms||Umesh Isalkar

PMR added 10,076 cases of Covid-19 on Friday, including 5,480 from the Pune municipal limits, 2,562 from the Pimpri Chinchwad area and 2,034 from the rural and cantonment parts. Besides, as many as 4,272 people recovered in the region in the last 24 hours, including 2,674 discharges from the PMC limits alone. A report by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar stated that 38,692 samples were tested in the region on Friday. More than 20,000 tests were conducted in the PMC limits, while 11,512 samples were checked in the PCMC limits. Health officials said despite a rise in positive cases since the last few days, the cases in hospital care haven’t risen significantly and a majority of patients (48,020) were in home care. Only 1,897 patients in the region were in hospital care till Friday evening, the health officials said. Experts said with a majority of the patients in home care, the health infrastructure is sufficient at the moment. “This also shows that the vaccines and natural immunity is working in favour of the people and keeping the infection mild in most. But, the authorities should stay ready for any dramatic rise in hospitalised patients to avoid a repeat of second wave, whcih happened due to the delta variant of the virus,” a health expert said. The active case count in the PMC limits increased to 28,542 on Friday, while the PCMC areas have over 12,500 active patients. The region reported two deaths due to Covid on Friday. One patient each died in the PMC and rural parts. No fatality was reported in the PCMC limits. The region’s progressive tally of positive cases reached 12.29 lakh on Friday evening, while recoveries increased above 11.60 lakh. 235 more Omicroncases in district A total of 238 Covid-19 positive samples, including 235 from Pune district, were found infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the state on Friday, taking Maharashtra’s new strain case tally to 1,605 and the district’s tally to 677.

About 1.1 lakh residents, including healthcare and frontline workers, and senior citizens, in the district received both the doses of either Covishield or Covaxin by March 31, 2021. Thus, they have completed the requisite gap of nine months from the second shot to qualify for the third dose, termed “precaution dose”, in January. Of them, a total of 11,788 residents opted for the third dose on Friday. With this, the total number of residents availing the benefit of the precaution dose in the district went up to 33,828.  “A total of 1.1 lakh of the total 7.73 lakh eligible residents in the Pune district can get the third dose of the Covid vaccine this month as they have completed the nine-month gap from the second dose,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region. The officials are vying to finish the vaccination of all these 7.73 lakh beneficiaries with the third dose within a month or two, provided the availability of doses remains steady. Healthcare and frontline workers were among the priority categories, who started getting the shots when the nationwide mass vaccination began on January 16, 2021. As of now, over 90% of the workers have received both doses of the vaccine in the district. Dr Deshmukh said, “A total of 10,903 teens in the 15-17 years’ age bracket got their first dose of Covaxin in Pune district on Friday.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/30-immediately-eligible-people-avail-precaution-jab-in-district/articleshow/88907119.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||NGO writes to Delhi govt, says none of 62 schools checked distributing rations||New Delhi: Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA) on Friday wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding non-distribution of ration to those without ration cards at a time when Covid-19 cases are rising and several restrictions have affected their livelihood. DRRAA checked the status of distribution at 62 out of the 282 schools designated as distribution points and found that not a single one was distributing ration. After receiving information about non-availability of ration under the non-Public Distribution System scheme, DRRAA volunteers either visited these schools or contacted them over phone between January 11 and 13. “We found that none of the schools was distributing rations as they stated that they had no stock of foodgrains,” said the network for securing food security. “People were being repeatedly returned empty handed. This denial of ration is extremely concerning and will lead to hunger and food insecurity for lakhs of people in Delhi,” it pointed out. In its letter, DRRAA said, “The failure to stock and provide ration through designated distribution centres constitutes a violation of the orders of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court regarding providing foodgrains to migrant workers and economically vulnerable people who do not possess ration cards during the ongoing pandemic.” At a time when the government is increasing restrictions on economic activity to curb the spread of Covid, it must also ensure basic support to those most impacted, it demanded. DRRAA said the condition of daily wagers and informal sector workers was particularly precarious as their ability to earn and provide adequate food for their families had been severely affected due to the restrictions. A government official said, “The distribution has started at some of these centres and the process will be normalised at other centres by Tuesday.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ngo-writes-to-delhi-govt-says-none-of-62-schools-checked-distributing-rations/articleshow/88905928.cms||TNN
---||Pune||Airfares from Pune nosedive during current Covid surge||PUNE: Airfares from Pune to many cities have nosedived amid the current rise in Covid cases, a trend not witnessed during the first and second waves of the pandemic. One-way airfares from the city to several destinations revealed that the decrease in the current tariff (see graphic) was between 40% and 60% on an average from what it used to be in the recent past and the trend was likely to continue in February. The one-way fare for the Pune-Goa sector, which was almost Rs6,000 to Rs7,000 during the New Year Eve, has dropped to Rs3,500-Rs3,700 now. Similarly, the one-way fare between Pune and Delhi, which until late last year was Rs6,000-Rs6,500, presently rests at less than half. “Airfares never really reached the pre-pandemic levels, mainly due to the cap and uncertainty related to travel. In 2019, a Pune-Goa one-way ticket would cost anything between Rs13,000 and Rs14,000 during the Christmas and New Year Eve period. We are witnessing a new low in terms of airfares, something which is a rare trend,” a travel company representative said. Another travel company representative said, “The country has witnessed two major waves of the pandemic since 2020. But the airfares had not gone down then as seen during the ongoing third wave of the pandemic. Fresh bookings for vacations have drastically gone down. The decreased fares are, however, helping holidayers take some risks and book tickets for a trip to their favourite destinations during the coming summer months.” However, the airfares in sectors such as Kolkata, Ladakh and Chennai continued to be high in the range of Rs7,000 to Rs9,000, or even more. “These are places where the demand is more than supply. Kolkata, for example, has limited flights from Delhi, Mumbai and Pune,” a travel operator said. A source associated with the industry said during the earlier surge in cases, there was an extended cap on airfares fixed by the government. “After airlines resumed operations in May 2020 , the cap on airfares was fixed for three months (until August last week, 2020). It was in September last year only that the cap on airfares was reduced to 15 days. But at that time, travel had picked up due to the relaxed norms and fewer Covid cases,” an airline source said. “As a result, the fares were high after 15 days at any given month. But this time, the situation is different. Despite the 15-day airfare cap, the subsequent 15 days (of a month) are witnessing very few flyers,” the source added. Almost all airlines have floated schemes such as free meals and no charges for rescheduling/cancellation on certain sectors, seats with extra leg room and preferred seats to attract flyers. “We want people to take advantage of the current low fares and book their tickets for the upcoming summer months. The situation will improve in sometime and travel will resume in full form,” an airline official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/airfares-from-city-nosediveduring-current-covid-surge/articleshow/88907120.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Across classes, teachers focus on here & now to bridge learning gaps||PUNE: Educators are beginning to feel a deeper shade of despondency, helplessness and despair as they worry about more learning loss in students as schools have shut again after a rise in Covid-19 cases. Teachers, stuck again in the online mode of teaching, said they now focus on what will help their students cope with this academic year and concentrate on core areas of knowledge. From focusing on activity-based learning in primary students to ensuring that those in higher classes are able to complete their answers on time, teachers at different levels are employing diverse techniques to help students. Some said they get students to draw what they know about a subject, others look at games to test knowledge, and yet other educators are encouraging pupils to participate in writing and spelling games and taking up quizzes to recall past learning. Vijay Kombe, a primary school teacher from Wardha, said they were teaching many things at the same time and it was not easy. “Std I students are okay because we had to teach them from the beginning. But since there was no anganwadi for them, making them sit is a task. Std II and even Std III students are being taught almost from the beginning, which means many have to be made aware of the alphabet and numbers. So, after we re-teach them the basics, we also have to cover the syllabus for their own level, which will be another herculean task. We have realised that being strict with them won’t work. They are too used to cellphones, and their attention span is weak in in-person classes.” Kombe has made some lessons into games or activities. He said the children enjoy the learning process which is essential in these times when there is so much to learn and so little time. “We are also appealing to parents to make the children revise the lessons and complete the homework,” he added. Assessments reports by various government and non-government agencies indicate that all students have experienced learning gaps during the pandemic when schools have been closed for in-person classes. Komal Somaiyya, who works as domestic help and is a parent of three children, said, “My youngest son was in Std I last year and now he is in Std II. He doesn’t know the alphabet, never mind how to read and write. I am illiterate. His elder sister and my second child is in Std V. Her teachers used to say she was a good student. My eldest son is in Std VII and has hardly touched his books since the lockdown. All our hopes are on the teachers. Only my husband owns a smartphone, and all three cannot uses it at the same time.” Some groups, especially students in rural areas and in urban-poor areas were disproportionately affected because of the lack of online devices as well as the lack of supporting structures around them. This disparity is a daily struggle for teachers across the state. For primary teachers, the effort to get students to read, write and do simple maths has become an uphill task. The Annual Survey of Education Report 2021 has said that smartphone availability among children aged 6-14 in rural Maharashtra has doubled in the past three years, but the increase in numbers doesn’t necessarily translate to an increase in access. Teachers say that the hardest part is making children in younger classes sit and write. Their associations want the education department to start classes in areas where there are not many Covid cases so that the slide in learning can be salvaged. For those teaching the higher classes and Std X where pupils appear for the board exam, it is a battle to complete the syllabus despite a 25% cut, in time for the prelims and the board exam in March. Students need at least a month to prepare for the exams. Teachers in higher classes said weaning children off cellphones is another challenge. Shamshuddin Attar, a secondary school teacher from Konkan, said that he had conducted a preliminary examination for his secondary students and found that a majority had performed poorly. “It looks like we would need to revise so many topics which we had already completed online because students have not understood them. Writing speed has dropped because many have not been able to complete answering the questions. Mock tests/ prelims need to be taken multiple times and students need to be encouraged to attempt them before appearing for term-end examinations. Also, students seem to be addicted to cellphones. Parents must be specifically told to keep the devices away from children, now that we have very little time,” Attar added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/across-classes-teachers-focus-on-here-now-to-bridge-learning-gaps/articleshow/88907121.cms||Ardhra Nair

The changes announced recently by the state education department states that only ration card, driving licence, Aadhaar card, voter’s card, passbook of a nationalised bank, water bill, property tax, passport, registered rent agreement (in case no other document is available) as address proof. Mahesh Palkar, director, in charge of the primary education directorate, said, “The only change in the address proof documents is that we will not accept gas connection book or passbook of a private or cooperative bank for admissions. The passbook must be from a nationalised bank. These changes have been done because we have been getting a lot of fraud applications in this category. It is not easy to probe the income if the account holder has submitted a private bank passbook. Hence, the changes.”The state education department had announced the tentative schedule for admissions for free education in entry-level classes of private schools under the Right to Education Act 2009 in December last year. As per the schedule, the schools’ registrations and verification will be done between December 28 and January 27, online forms for admissions will be open from February 1 and the lottery rounds will be held on March 8 and 9. The admissions in 2020-21, went on till December 21 and 9,432 schools registered in the state with 96,684 seats available of which 72,132 seats were claimed by the students. Officials have requested interested candidates to apply for all documents such as income certificates, caste certificates in advance so that they do not lose out on admissions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/address-proof-norms-for-rte-applications-tweaked/articleshow/88907122.cms||Ardhra Nair

The workers are engaged in the cabling work, required for signaling and other networks, in the coaches. The rake has trips on the 5km-long route almost daily. Occasionally, it even runs at a speed of 80kmph as part of the trials. However, the MahaMetro said that when introduced for the commuters, the speed of the rake would remain around 40kmphr. The MahaMetro has ordered a total of 34 rakes. Two more rakes are expected to arrive soon. The rake comprises three coaches, with each one having a capacity of accommodating as many as 320 passengers and a total capacity of 970 passengers. Use of aluminum has reduced the weight of the rake and thus it will save more energy. The rake will also have all advanced facilities such as CCTV camera network, air-conditioned coaches, separate space for people with physical challenges, automatic door closing system, electric display boards, announcement system, the MahaMetro stated. An official said, “Thorough checks of the rake are underway on various technical parameters. Some vital points being checked by the team of experts include the pick-up of the rake, acceleration and reduction in speed, riding index of the rake, noise levels of coaches at various speeds, jerks, braking system, application of emergency brakes. The checks are also being done on the load carrying capacity of train. This means how the rake will run at full capacity of passengers. Many checks are being conducted through simulation techniques to check the performance and set the parameters”. According to the MahaMetro, the checks and inspections will continue for a month as minute detailing is required of every aspect. The certification will be issued by the Research Designs & Standards Organization (RDSO) and then by the railway board. Hemant Sonawane, the general manager (PR) at MahaMetro said, “Inspection and certification of the rake is a long and technical process. The teams are working all through the day”. The rake will receive a certification from the RDSO and railway board while the tracks and safety aspects are being certified by the commissioner of metro rail safety (CMRS). Another official said that the process of inspection of the rake and track was started last month on the priority stretches since all the works had reached at final stages.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/metro-rake-trial-runs-on-5km-vanaz-garware-college-route/articleshow/88907124.cms||Sarang Dastane

Another tunnel boring machine (TBM), digging a separate tunnel, is expected to reach Budhwar Peth station by March.The MahaMetro (Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited) officials claimed that 90% tunnel work had been done so far and a target had been set to complete the remaining work in two months. The underground Metro stretch is aligned from Shivajinagar (Agriculture College) to Swargate. It will have five stations — Shivajinagar, Civil Court, Budhwar Peth (Kasba Peth), Mandai and Swargate.An official from MahaMetro said, “Two parallel tunnels, one each for Up and Down trains, are being excavated. Of these, the excavation of a 6km-long tunnel was completed on Friday with the TBM achieving a breakthrough at the Budhwar Peth site. From the total 12km stretch of tunnels, excavation of 10.8km (90%) has been finished so far. The tunnel-digging work started from Swargate, crossed Mandai, and then reached Budhwar Peth.”Brijesh Dixit, managing director, MahaMetro, said, “The works have been expedited on both underground and elevated stretches. Without the active support of the citizens of Pune and the administrative bodies, the work on the underground stretch of the Pune Metro project wouldn’t have been achieved swiftly and successfully”.Another MahaMetro official said, “Works like installing overhead equipment, signals and communication gadgets have begun in the underground section because the tunnel work is nearing completion. The initial level of track work has also started.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tunnel-on-swargate-budhwar-peth-stretch-ready-in-4-months/articleshow/88907125.cms||---

Nearly three months after this extension was proposed, approval for it is awaited from the general body (GB) of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The scheme was launched for appealing to citizens with illegal water connections to pay a one-time penalty and get their connections regularised. The civic areas have nearly 4.5lakh such water taps. “It is a policy issue, so approval from the GB is needed. The reintroduction will be done once we get the requisite nod,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water supply department. According to civic officials, the extension was sought as the first attempt did not get an adequate response. Only 500 out of around 4.5 lakh illegal connections came forward for the payment. Interestingly, not a single commercial establishment stepped up to avail of the benefits of the scheme. “Appeals were made by PMC, but people with illegal connections are not giving an adequate response to the scheme. Now, we shall have to ensure that enforcement of other action takes place,” said Ganesh Bidkar, the leader of the house in PMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/amnesty-plan-for-illegal-water-connections-stalled/articleshow/88907127.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The online connect also resulted in number of campaigns initiated by the department, based on suggestions from citizens through the social media. Pune Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta has been instrumental in steering his department’s focus towards social media with an aim to making policing more citizen-friendly. He has appointed a small in-house team with a mission to- shed negative public perception and don a youthful, witty and approachable identity by interacting with citizens online through a variety of memes, motivational messages, on-the-job selfies, and so on. “None of our posts is self-appreciative or promotional. All of them are informative, packaged in a fun and interactive way through memes, riddles, wordplay and tongue-in-cheek comments for self-criticism,” he said. In an ‘Ask Me anything’ campaign on Instagram stories, Gupta disclosed his mobile number for citizens who want to get in touch with him directly. Since 2020, the Twitter handle of Pune Police has seen an increase of over 2.5 lakh followers. Its Instagram account has over 16,000 followers. Head constable Praveen Ghadge, a member of the Pune Police’s Twitter team, said, “Citizens have responded well to our initiatives, such as Know Your Police, awareness of patrolling spots, and a ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’-themed cyber awareness campaign.” The current initiative of #MySafePune resulted in an addition of 98 patrolling spots, he said. However, not all are impressed. A working professional from Baner, said, “It is commendable how quickly the Pune Police responds online, but there is often a lot of delay when it comes to taking actual action.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-police-create-buzz-online-via-campaigns-memes-riddles/articleshow/88907130.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Suspects pose as deputy CM’s secretary, held on charge of 20 lakh extortion attempt||PUNE: The city police crime branch on Thursday arrested six persons on the charge of attempting to extort Rs20 lakh from a realtor. The suspects were caught red-handed when they had come to the realtor’s office to collect the first instalment of Rs2 lakh. One of the arrested suspects had threatened the realtor by misusing deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s cellphone number. “One of the suspects Kiran Kakade had downloaded a fake call app on his smartphone. By using it, he used to contact the complainant by posing as Ajit Pawar’s secretary. The complainant used to answer the calls, as the deputy chief minister’s cellphone number would get displayed on his smartphone screen,” said senior inspector Shailesh Sankhe of the crime branch. He added, “In August 2021, the Pimpri Chinchwad police had arrested Kiran Kakade for imitating NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s voice, contacting a senior Mantralaya officer and then recommending transfer of an official.” Besides Kakade (26), Navnath Choramale (26) of Vade Bolhai, Saurabh Kakade (20) of Hadapsar, Sunil Waghmare (28) of Theur, Chaitanya Waghmare (19) of Phursungi and Akash Nikalaje (24) of Vade Bolhai were arrested under sections 384 (extortion), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act. The suspects were produced before the court on Friday and remanded in police custody till January 17. Sankhe said the realtor had purchased six hectares of land for development in 1997 from Choramale’s grandfather and nine others. “The matter is currently in the civil court. Choramale hatched the plot to extort the money from the realtor,” he said. Sankhe said Choramale took help of Kiran, who had used the fake call app and contacted the realtor by misusing Pawar’s cellphone number. He posed as Pawar’s secretary and told the complainant to solve the land dispute in Vade Bolhai. “The ‘secretary’ also threatened the complainant that he would not allow the complainant to start any of his projects and would not allow him to enter the village,” Sankhe said. He said the “secretary” also demanded Rs20 lakh from the realtor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/suspects-pose-as-dy-cms-secy-held-on-charge-of-20l-extortion-attempt/articleshow/88907131.cms||---

The suspects took away the victim’s debit card and its PIN. They transferred Rs20,000 online using his debit card on Thursday. The victim, an employee of Bhugaon gram panchayat, on Thursday filed a complaint with the Warje Malwadi police. “When he reached near the Dukkar Khind, he stopped his scooter along the bypass to answer nature’s call,” said senior inspector Shankar Khatke of the Warje Malwadi police. He said three men approached him and threatened him with a sharp weapon. “They snatched his smartphone, Rs2,000 from his wallet and his gold ring. They also took away his debit card and forced him to share the PIN,” Khatke said. The officer said the suspects then threatened the complainant and told him not to disclose anything about the incident. They removed the ignition key from the victim’s scooter and threw it away before fleeing. “The complainant traced the key and went home,” Khatke said. On Thursday morning, the suspect received an SMS alert from his bank stating that Rs20,000 was transferred from his bank account to some other account.

---||Pune||23 merged villages out of gunthewari scheme ambit||Pune: The property owners from the 23 villages merged into the Pune civic limits will not be able to regularise their unauthorised properties under the civic body’s gunthewari scheme as the PMRDA is the planning authority for these villages as far as building permissions are concerned.Yuvraj Deshmukh, a senior Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official, said, “The sanctioning authority for building permissions for the properties in these villages is different. Hence, the civic body will not be able to regularise illegal constructions there.”The civic body started accepting proposals from property owners with unauthorised constructions from Monday. A dedicated software has been developed for the initiative.The 23 villages were merged into the PMC in July. But the state government in an order issued later stated that the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) would work as the “special planning authority” for their development plan. The government’s notification stated that the order was issued under sections 40 (1) and 40(1)9[D] of the MRTP, said another PMC official.“The PMRDA is the planning authority for 23 merged villages as far as building permissions are concerned. So, the civic body has appealed to applicants from these villages to approach the PMRDA. Even if the villages are under the administrative control of the PMC, it will be inappropriate for the civic body to consider the regularisation proposals,” said Ganesh Bidkar, the leader of the house in the PMC.According to the PMC’s estimate, around one lakh properties across Pune civic areas can benefit if the gunthewari scheme proves to be a total success. It will help in legalising commercial as well as residential properties. Construction on gunthewari land till December 31, 2020, can be regularised under the scheme. The previous cut-off was January 1, 2001. According to the PMC, applicants will have to pay three times more charges compared to the ready reckoner rates for getting the proposals approved.As per the law, gunthewari development means plots formed by unauthorisedly sub-dividing privately owned land with buildings on such plots, including excess vacant land under Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, not vested in the state government but excluding land under encroachment. Such land is governed by the Maharashtra Gunthewari Development (Regularisation, Upgradation and Control) Act, 2001.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/23-merged-villages-out-of-gunthewari-scheme-ambit/articleshow/88907135.cms||---

Rana also demanded that an FIR be lodged against the senior leader and threatened to immolate himself outside the house of BSP supremo Mayawati in Lucknow if he did not “get justice”. "Tamasha bana diya (they made a joke out of me)," said Rana in a video that has now gone viral and shows him bawling. “I have given advertisements daily in papers and put up hoardings across the constituency mentioning that I am the BSP candidate. Now I have become a laughing stock. I would not have objected had they told me that I would not get the ticket, but they did it at the last minute. I want my money back,” Rana told TOI on Friday. Rana said he had to sell the jewellery of his wife, who is a doctor, and also family land to arrange the money. He said he paid the amount in cash during several meetings with the senior BSP leader, but has no receipt as "such things are not recorded". SHO (Kotwali city police station) Anand Dev Mishra said a complaint has been received from Rana and “an initial probe” initiated. Commenting on the allegations, BSP district chief Satish (who goes by his first name) said he has no idea what went wrong between Arshad Rana and the senior party leader. “Rana has been actively working for the party for many decades now. I have conveyed his message to the party high command in Lucknow. It would be better if he settles the dispute internally,” said Satish. When TOI contacted the senior BSP leader whom Rana has accused of taking money for a party ticket, the former didn’t respond despite repeated attempts. BSP state spokesperson MH Khand also refused to comment on the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/bsp-man-demands-fir-against-senior-says-paid-67l-for-ticket/articleshow/88907139.cms||---

The examination is scheduled to start from January 20 and continue till February 8.In the memorandum submitted to the chief minister, the candidates said many of them have tested positive for Covid-19 and it will not be easy for them to appear for the examination. “If the Odisha Public Service Commission (OPSC) allows the main exam to go ahead as schedule, it could end up in being a super-spreader,” said a candidate. They said the government has closed schools, colleges and universities the state after Covid cases skyrocketed in the state. “Now, the state reports more than 10,000 Covid cases every day and nobody knows when the peak of the third wave will come. Why is the government adamant on holding the exam now? It can be conducted later when the situation gets better,” said another candidate. The candidates said the municipal corporations of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack have been declaring several areas as containment zones every day. “If this situation continues for a few more days, more such zones may come up and we won’t be able to step out of these zones to appear in the examination,” a candidate stated. Besides, many candidates have started an online campaign to put pressure on the government to postpone the examination. A woman candidate, in a video posted on social media, said, “I have tested positive for Covid-19 and am undertaking medicines for this. My husband needs hospitalization for treatment of Covid.

---||Bhubaneswar||‘Visit hospitals only in emergency’||Bhubaneswar: The state health authorities have appealed to the people to avoid hospital visits unless absolutely necessary following a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in healthcare facilities.The outpatient department (OPD) in most of the government and private hospitals are flooded with patients and their attendants despite daily spike in Covid cases. While doctors and paramedics have been infected, the health authorities apprehend that people who visited the hospitals contracted the virus and spread to others in the community. The state has reported close to 300 cases in healthcare institutions so far, including around 25 infections among the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) staff. “We have appealed to people to refrain from coming for routine check-up in the OPDs as the virus is spreading very fast and visiting hospitals in such situations will pose further challenge to the health machinery. During the first and second waves of the pandemic, OPDs in several hospitals had been closed. For diagnostic services and other examinations, which are not urgent, people can defer it given the prevalent situation,” said Bijay Mohapatra, director, health services.The appeal comes on a day the state reported an infection count close to Thursday’s figure with 10,000 plus cases. It reported 10,273 new cases from 75,731 samples registering a test positivity rate (TPR) of 13.56%. While the state’s TPR remained close to 14%, Khurda’s is 27.12%, the highest among 30 districts. Nine other districts reported a TPR above 10%. The ideal TPR should be below 5%.On Friday, the state’s active caseload also crossed 50,000 (50,955) with 2,216 fresh recoveries and four fatalities confirmed by the government. While Khurda district reported the highest single day spike of 3,496 cases, Bhubaneswar registered 1,148 new infections. The health department also urged the infected people to stay away from hospitals if the symptoms are mild. “In case of mild symptoms, people shouldn’t panic. Hospitalisation is not required in mild cases. They should take help of telemedicine facilities and take medicines as prescribed by the doctors. Hospital admission unnecessarily will invite secondary infections and may complicate the matter,” Mohapatra added. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said visiting hospitals at this juncture should be the last option considering the fact that the virus is less virulent and doesn’t lead to any complications.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/visit-hospitals-only-in-emergency/articleshow/88907146.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rs 181-crore multilevel parking lot to free up Karol Bagh stretch gets corporation go-ahead||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday approved a proposal for constructing a Rs 181-crore multilevel parking project at Bank Street in Karol Bagh to decongest the area. The parking-cum-commercial complex will have space for at least 500 vehicles. According to the proposal, efforts are being made to provide more planned parking facilities in the area. Though the commissioner gave the in-principle approval in 2019 for utilising the 4,115-sq-metre vacant space, it could not be implemented due to some reasons, it added. The site will now be developed on a freehold basis as the civic body earlier failed to receive any bid when tenders were invited on a 99-year leasehold basis. “The corporation will get 75% of the parking lot after one year of the completion of the project,” an official said. The proposal has been passed in the standing committee, and will now need the House approval, he added. Recently, a tender was called again as per improved norms and the new reserve price was kept at Rs 175 crore. “The bidder who gave the highest rate of Rs 181 crore was recommended in the standing committee for final approval. The same contractor is also building the Gandhi Maidan parking project,” said the official. The civic body has also invited tenders for multilevel parking lots at other off-street sites in the Karol Bagh zone after converting these properties into freehold. For the Bank Street project, the corporation, on January 4, sealed 45 tehbazari shops around the site on the ground of alleged illegal extension. The official said they were allotted shops on Ajmal Khan Road. But the shopowners questioned the drive when the matter was already in court and claimed to have filed a fresh petition after the sealing. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain, however, claimed, “We are doing things with the consensus of all.” AAP opposed the move, alleging that the corporation was selling everything.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rs-181cr-multilevel-parking-lot-to-free-up-karol-bagh-stretch-gets-corpn-go-ahead/articleshow/88905935.cms||Vibha Sharma

Besides, some more private hospitals in Bhubaneswar and one in Rourkela have been empanelled by the government to provide free treatment to accident victims under the Free Treatment for Trauma Fund (FTTF) scheme. Earlier, only three hospitals in the state — Apollo and AMRI Hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Ashwini Hospital in Cuttack — were partnered by the government under the FTTF scheme.As per a notification, featuring guidelines of the FTTF scheme, issued by the health department on January 9, Medicover Hospital in Visakhapatnam, Ramakrishna Care Hospital in Raipur (Chhattisgarh), Ashwini Trauma Centre in Cuttack, J P Hospital in Rourkela, and AMRI Hospital, IMS & SUM Hospital, SUM Ultimate, KIMS Hospital, Hi-Tech Hospital, Kalinga Hospital and Utkal Institute of Medical Science (all in Bhubaneswar) will provide free treatment to accident victims in the first 48 hours of the mishap.FTTF scheme has been operational since October 2019. While the transport department used to provide the funds for free treatment of the accident victims in private hospitals, the health department will now foot the bills. The government has sanctioned Rs 147.2 crore for five years for the FTTF scheme from the state budget, a senior transport official said. As per the new guidelines, an FTTF technical committee has been formed to look into different issues of treatment and its cost, which would be reimbursed by the government. An FTTF cell will function in the office of the DMET to supervise, regulate and coordinate the smooth functioning of the scheme.Hospitals should strictly adhere to 48 hours of treatment from the time of admission of the accident victims. Treatment is also applicable to BSKY beneficiaries, the notification said.Though the FTTF scheme was launched to provide timely treatment to accident victims and minimise fatalities, two private hospitals in the recent past complained of delayed release of payments by the government towards the free treatment cost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/govt-to-partner-with-pvt-hospitals-for-trauma-care/articleshow/88907147.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The virus can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer and even death.It is an important test for the patients who are suffering from jaundice and liver-related diseases. Many of the microbiology diagnostic services have been stopped in the hospital. “The HCV test is not a big thing for a hospital like AIIMS. The government should appoint a regular director and resolve the issues,” said a doctor of the institute. There was a shortage of kits for complete blood count (CBC) test too. The CBC test, including Hb, TLC, DLC, platelet count was not available from January 12 due to shortage of reagents. Because of this, online request raising of CBC tests was blocked for a few days. But the hospital administration started the testing from Friday onwards.“It is unfortunate that basic investigation is not available for patient care in the hospital. Even some departments do not have gloves for the staff. Basic stationery like paper and cartridges of the printer are not supplied to us,” said another doctor.AIIMS Bhubaneswar medical superintendent Sachidananda Mohanty said they have started conducting CBC tests from Friday. “We are taking necessary measures to resume the HCV test as soon as possible,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/shortage-of-test-kits-for-hepatitis-at-aiims/articleshow/88907149.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

Election for zilla parishad seats in the three-tier panchayat polls will be fought on party tickets.As results of the panchayat polls will set the tone for the 2024 general elections, the BJD plans to continue the momentum by winning most of the zilla parishad seats.“All the MLAs of our party have been asked to ensure BJD’s victory in 100% of zilla parishad zones in their respective assembly constituencies. Performance in the panchayat polls will determine the future of the MLAs in the 2024 general elections,” said a senior party functionary.Senior leaders and observers from western and northern districts, where the BJP had done well in the 2017 panchayat elections, have been asked to ensure BJD’s victory in the rural polls.

---||Bhubaneswar||Bhubaneswar: Govt appeals to stop visits to hospitals||BHUBANESWAR: The state health authorities have appealed to the people to avoid hospital visits unless absolutely necessary following a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in healthcare facilities. The outpatient department (OPD) in most of the government and private hospitals are flooded with patients and their attendants despite daily spike in Covid cases. While doctors and paramedics have been infected, the health authorities apprehend that people who visited the hospitals contracted the virus and spread to others in the community. The state has reported close to 300 cases in healthcare institutions so far, including around 25 infections among the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) staff. “We have appealed to people to refrain from coming for routine check-up in the OPDs as the virus is spreading very fast and visiting hospitals in such situations will pose further challenge to the health machinery. During the first and second waves of the pandemic, OPDs in several hospitals had been closed. For diagnostic services and other examinations, which are not urgent, people can defer it given the prevalent situation,” said Bijay Mohapatra, director, health services. The appeal come on a day the state reported an infection count close to Thursday’s figure with 10,000 plus cases. It reported 10,273 new cases from 75,731 samples registering a test positivity rate (TPR) of 13.56%. While the state’s TPR remained close to 14%, Khurda’s is 27.12%, the highest among 30 districts. Nine other districts reported a TPR above 10%. The ideal TPR should be below 5%. On Friday, the state’s active caseload also crossed 50,000 (50,955) with 2,216 fresh recoveries and four fatalities confirmed by the government. While Khurda district reported the highest single day spike of 3,496 cases, Bhubaneswar registered 1,148 new infections. The health department also urged the infected people to stay away from hospitals if the symptoms are mild. “In case of mild symptoms, people shouldn’t panic. Hospitalisation is not required in mild cases. They should take help of telemedicine facilities and take medicines as prescribed by the doctors. Hospital admission unnecessarily will invite secondary infections and may complicate the matter,” Mohapatra added. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said visiting hospitals at this juncture should be the last option considering the fact that the virus is less virulent and doesn’t lead to any complications.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/govt-appeals-to-stop-visits-to-hosps/articleshow/88907163.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

Its leaders attacked the farmers of Punjab and filed false cases against them, but still some political parties of Punjab have joined hands with BJP, he added.Kejriwal had launched the phone number as part of the ‘Janata chunegi apna CM’ drive on which, he said, people could give their suggestions till January 17.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-on-partys-cm-pick-got-8l-replies-in-a-day/articleshow/88907171.cms||---

SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, in a letter to the EC, said the panel’s ban on election rallies, pad yatras, corner meetings up to January 15 was causing great hardship to candidate of all parties. He said it was not possible to cover all voters of the assembly constituency in digital mode as there were many backward areas where internet networks were not working properly. Old people, which constitute a major part of the population, rarely use digital methods and people from poor sections of society also have little access to digital technology, he added. Therefore, a major part of society will remain uncovered if only digital campaigning is allowed, said Cheema. “This will deny equal opportunity to all voters. This will also affect the percentage of polling,” said the SAD leader, adding that they agreed that big rallies could be banned, but small meetings were a must.

Manshahia on Friday wrote a letter to AICC former president Rahul Gandhi, urging him to allot the party ticket to him and he will win by a bigger margin. A retired senior executive engineer from Punjab Pollution Control Board, Manshahia had contested the 2017 assembly ticket from Mansa on an AAP ticket and had won by a big margin. Later, he sided with Sukhpal Singh Khaira-led Punjab Ekta Party and then had joined Congress. Now, he has written to Rahul, saying that it was being said the party ticket would be given to Moosewala, but the ticket should be alloted to him. Manshahia said, “I am regularly in touch with people of Mansa and will win the seat for Congress.”Persons close to the MLA said he had hinted at using other options if denied the party ticket. In the meanwhile, Moosewala is said to have met Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and learnt to have discussed the opposition from within the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/aap-mla-now-in-cong-give-ticket-to-me-not-singer/articleshow/88907173.cms||Neel Kamal

He said the seizure of a huge quantity of RDX in Pathankot and Amritsar in the last two days indicated that there was a serious threat to national security that the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government in Punjab has been trying to push under the carpet.The BJP leader said it was time Channi government provided details of the live “lunch bombs” as well as drones coming from Pakistan, where Punjab Congress president Navjot Sindhu’s friend Imran Khan has been calling the shots. He added that the manner in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was deliberately left stranded by the Channi government during his visit to Ferozepur indicated that there was indeed a big threat to the nation. “After putting the life of the PM at stake, the Channi government is putting the entire state in danger,” he said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjab-needs-white-paper-on-border-security-bjp/articleshow/88907174.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Delhi govt rejected petition for Bhullar’s release in Dec 2020||Jalandhar: At a time when Sikh groups are urging Arvind Kejriwal’s government to take a decision for release of Devinderpal Singh Bhullar on the basis of a notification issued by the Union government on the eve of Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary in 2019, it has come out that the AAP Delhi government’s Sentence Review Board (SRB) had already rejected the plea in December 2020. The SRB is headed by Delhi home minister Satyendra Jain. Meanwhile, Bhullar’s counsel has pointed out that the decision of rejection was taken when Supreme Court had already ordered status quo following a petition by All Indian Anti-Terrorist Front leader Maninderjit Singh Bitta in December 2019. The papers about SRB’s decision were released by Sikh Political Prisoners Release Morcha in Delhi on Thursday. “We have been demanding and different Sikh organisations have been writing to the Delhi government to release Bhullar but it did not tell in response to our pleas that decision had already been taken,” said Parminder Pal Singh of the Morcha, releasing the papers to media on Thursday. “Only a week back, we called on minister of home and jail Satyendra Jain and even submitted a written memorandum seeking Bhullar’s release and for shifting Jagtar Singh Hawara to a Punjab jail, but he did not disclose that decision had already been taken over a year back by a board headed by him,” he added. The minutes of the SRB meeting held on December 11, 2020, mentioned that Bhullar had undergone imprisonment of over 23 years and nine months in actual, while home town police (Punjab Police in Bhullar’s hometown) had not opposed his premature released in its report but deputy commissioner of police (legal) had opposed his release in the meeting. While Punjab social welfare department neither recommended nor opposed his released, Delhi social welfare director did not support the release. Rejecting the premature release plea, the SRB had commented on “involvement in anti-national/terrorist activities, gravity and perversity of the crime, having previous criminal history”.Over a month back, Bhullar’s counsel Jaspal Singh Manjhpur had written to Kejriwal to order his release after the apex court on December 9 last dismissed a petition filed by Bitta opposing the release following a notification issued by the Union government on the eve of Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary. He had also urged Kejriwal that till the final disposal of premature release case, Bhular should be granted permanent parole as he had already undergone imprisonment for 26 years.“It is surprising that Delhi government decided to reject the plea for his release even as SC had ordered status quo. The minutes of the meeting also make it clear that concurrence of the Union government for his release was not even placed on record. The decision was never communicated to Bhullar or his family,” said advocate Manjhpur on Friday.Several Sikh activists have sent messages for release of Bhullar on the mobile phone number released by Kejriwal asking people of Punjab to tell their choice of CM face of AAP and have posted the screenshots on social media.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/delhi-govt-rejected-petition-for-bhullars-release-in-dec-2020/articleshow/88907175.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Congress 1st list anytime now, screening panel works on tricky ones||CHANDIGARH: Even as the screening committee of Congress for Punjab polls tried to arrive at a consensus on a few seats on Friday, the first list of names approved by the central election panel on Thursday could be released anytime soon. The first lot is likely to include names of sitting MLAs or leaders about whom the party has already made its choice obvious. Meanwhile, speculations have been rife about Congress planning to drop a few of its sitting MLAs in the first list. According to party sources, since the candidature of Malavika Sood, sister of actor Sonu Sood has reportedly been assured a ticket from Moga, sitting party MLA Harjot Kamal could face the axe. Similarly, the party may field AAP MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby, in place of Ajaib Singh Bhatti, from Malaut. Ruby had won in 2017 on an AAP ticket from Bathinda Rural but later joined the Congress. Meanwhile, party sources say cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra has been seeking a party ticket for his son from Patiala Rural, while there have been reports that Rajinder Kaur Bhattal wants to field her son in this election. However, Bhattal is likely to be fielded again from Lehraga by the party leadership. “There was also a dispute over fielding former minister Raghunath Sahai Puri’s son Naresh Puri as the three state leaders – PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sunil Jakhar and CM Charanjit Singh Channi could not reach a consensus. Similarly, the leaders could not arrive at a consensus on Garshankar, where Punjab Youth Congress president Amanpreet singh Lalli is seeking candidature,” said a party leader.  It is believed that Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa too wants to return to state politics but the screening committee is yet to take a call.

---||Chandigarh||Covid vaccine coverage: Punjab a straggler in region & poll-bound states||CHANDIGARH: Punjab is trailing behind neighbouring states of Haryana, Himachal and the UT of Chandigarh in achieving Covid-19 vaccination coverage in the region amid a shar acceleration in the pandemic outbreak. Even among the five states where assembly elections are scheduled to be held next month, Punjab has the lowest vaccine coverage after Manipur, where only 60% of recipients have been partially and 45% fully vaccinated While the Covid situation has been more or less similar in three states and UT, vaccination in Punjab’s neighbouring states is much ahead . Since the beginning of the drive on January 16, Punjab has been struggling to improve its vaccine coverage and even after a lapse of one year the state has managed to administer the first dose to 86.4% -- 1,78,33,934 out of 2,06,55,301 -- of eligible beneficiaries in the age group of 18 and above. The All-India average of the first dose stands at 92%. In contrast to Punjab, all its neighbours feature among the top performing states/UT with 100% coverage of the first dose. Against the national average of 68% for the second dose, the hill state of Himachal Pradesh has provided both the mandatory doses to 99.9% of its eligible population while 97% have been fully immunised in City Beautiful and 78% in Haryana. Punjab, on the other hand, has administered both the shots to only 51% of eligible beneficiaries. As vaccines reduce the severity of infection, hospitalisation and chances of death, the central government and health experts have been stressing upon bringing the eligible population under the vaccine coverage. The emerging trends have pointed out that in most cases, Covid infection in vaccinated people is mild. "Vaccines have proved to be a very effective lifesaving tool against Covid. To be comfortable placed, there is need to cover at least 70% of the population with two doses," said Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (SIPHER). He urged all eligible to get vaccinated and the authorities to cover the left-out population at the earliest proactively. Among the poll-bound states, UP, which has a manifold higher population than Punjab, has managed to provide both the shots to around 53% of its population and first dose to over 90% of the eligible population. In Uttarakhand, 99% have been given first and 82% second dose while in Goa all the eligible beneficiaries have been given first dose and 97% both the shots. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has been laying stress on increasing vaccination coverage in all the poll-bound states for conducting 'Covid safe' elections. However, after employees of the National Health Mission (NHM) called off their two-month long strike, the daily vaccination count has improved, after a special focus on immunising the rural population. In the last few days, the number of people getting jabbed in rural areas has been considerably higher than people residing in urban areas. As many as 1,54,057 doses were administered in rural areas in comparison to 1,13,199 in urban areas on January 10 while on January 11, the count of doses in rural areas was 1,54,737 and 1,07642 in the urban areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/vax-coverage-punjab-a-straggler-in-region-poll-bound-states/articleshow/88907182.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Chandigarh||No special budget outlay for Rakhigarhi onsite museum||Chandigarh: The Union government has not earmarked any special budget for the development of an onsite museum at Rakhigarhi village, a site of pre-Indus valley civilization settlement in Haryana’s Hisar district and four other such sites in other parts of the country.While announcing to develop five archaeological places, including Rakhigarhi, into “iconic sites”, the Union finance minister, in her budget speech in February 2020, had announced an allocation of Rs 3,150 crore for the ministry of culture under which the sites fall.However, the documents accessed by TOI now have revealed that “specific budget has not been earmarked to the development of these five sites, initial development work of five sites may be carried through existing budget allocation of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)”. The information further revealed that the building of the state government for its museum at Rakhigarhi would be utilised for display of ASI’s artefacts.It has also been revealed that ASI is preparing a comprehensive development plan for five sites and will ensure enough safeguards so that further excavation activities are not hampered at these sites during its development and construction of the onsite museum.Four other sites which the Centre had announced to develop as “iconic sites” include Hastinapur in UP, Dholavira in Gujarat, Adhichanallur in Tamil Nadu and Sivasagar in Assam.A close examination of these documents reveals that the Haryana government would not get any specific allocation from the Union government for Rakhigarhi, as was projected after the announcement made by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the budget for 2020-21 for the development of on-site museum at Rakhigarhi and four other sites. After this much hyped announcement, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also hailed the Union government during his speech in the state assembly in February 2020 for the “allocation” made by the Centre for development of Rakhigarhi site.1 of the 4 largest townships of Indus valley civilization Excavations at Rakhigarhi have indicated that the settlement witnessed all phases of the Harappan civilization. It is a unique Harappan site which promises to reveal new civilization contours by pushing the Indus Valley civilization by a thousand years or more. Rakhigarhi is one of the four largest townships of the Indus valley civilization that flourished between the mighty rivers Saraswati and Drishadvati. Others include Mohenjo-daro, Harappa in Pakistan and Dholavira, Kutch, Gujarat.4 ex officio members In team of 5, 1 inducted by nameIn another surprising development, the central government has appointed Neeraj Daftuar, a private individual, as an aide (principal OSD) to the Haryana chief minister as member of a coordination committee constituted by it to coordinate the integrated development of Rakhigarhi site. Three other members of this four-member committee include the secretary of the Union ministry of culture, the chairman of the National Monument Authority, and the director general of ASI. Interestingly, all other members have been made members by virtue of their positions, except Daftuar, who is neither an All India Civil Services nor state civil services or an official of the state’s archeology department. He has been made a member by name. The committee was constituted on October 22, 2021. Dr Sanjay Manjul, joint director, ASI, who is the licensee for the Rakhigarhi excavation, shall assist the committee in its proceedings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/no-special-budget-outlay-for-rakhigarhi-onsite-museum/articleshow/88907185.cms||Ajay Sura

Upadhyay, who had been with the party for the last 25 years, is a four-time MLA and represented Sadabad constituency in Hathras district. He is set to join BJP. In his resignation letter to party supremo, Upadhyay, once considered Mayawati’s right-hand man, said he was quitting from the party’s primary membership because BSP had veered off the ideals and principles of its founder Kanshi Ram. His letter reads: “When I had apprised the party chief that our defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls was due to the loss in our cadre votes, instead of accepting the reality, the party expelled me. My supporters’ sentiments were hurt.” Upadhyay’s disenchantment from the party is not new.

---||Kolhapur||Alert in Satara to avoid any over-aggressive treatment||Kolhapur: The Satara district administration has started to impart training on all general practitioners and registered medical practitioners to avoid over-aggressive treatment of Covid patients.The aim is to avert possible post-Covid complications among the recovered people. An official in the administration said such complications had claimed quite a few lives during the second wave of the pandemic last year. The district administration recently conducted training workshops, both in the online and offline modes, guided by top medical experts. Satara district collector Shekhar Singh told TOI “It is now an accepted fact that the overuse of steroids had led to mucormycosis last year. Similarly, overuse of antibiotics triggered long-term ill effects on human body. Most of the times, the doctors working in public hospitals adopt a conservative approach and stick to the guidelines. However, excess use of drugs had been witnessed in the private hospitals due to some reasons or perhaps pressure from the patients’ relatives.”He said, “Keeping all this in mind, the doctors are being training on the types of medicines to be administered and the quantity and the conditions during which the drugs should be used. They are also being trained on when to stop the use of the medicines.”The Satara administration is not just providing training the doctors, but also getting all other stakeholder involved in the process to avoid any over-agressive treatment. For instance, the pharmacists are told not to indulge in over-the-counter sale of steroids. “Molnupiravir has been approved for Covid treatment. In all likelihood, the medicine will be out of the shelves likely soon. The drug has some issues related to toxicity and must be administered only on the indicated patients. We have told the pharmacists to strictly stop over-the-counter dispensing of such drugs. The Food and Drugs Administration has been told to keep a check on the stocks, so that the drug is not sold without the doctors’ prescription,” said Singh. In an open letter, a group of 35 doctors from across the country has appealed to the central and state health authorities to stop these “unwarranted” practices and promote evidence-based medicine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/alert-in-satara-to-avoid-any-over-aggressive-treatment/articleshow/88907199.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Admin makes self-test kit detail check mandatory||Kolhapur: The district administration has made it mandatory for private laboratories, pharmacies and distributors to get details of self-test Covid kit users and share the information with the local authorities to ensure tracing and treatment of every person testing positive for the contagion. The use of the self-test Covid kits has increased in Kolhapur district in the past few weeks following the rise in infections. As per the procedure, the scanning of QR code and uploading details provide the valid test results. The test results, along with the details, are then made available to the local authorities. However, a mismatch has been noticed between the details made available with the authorities and the actual information about the patients. Most of the times, the local authorities find it difficult to trace the Covid patients.Non-reporting of positive Covid results via rapid antigen test (RAT) kits and home tests, by laboratories and individuals, remains a concern. On Wednesday, state additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas wrote to all divisional commissioners and collectors to ensure that labs update all positive results via RAT on the district portal. Citizens testing themselves using home kits have also been asked to declare and upload positive results to ensure adequate monitoring by local authorities during the home isolation period. Kolhapur district health officer Yogesh Sale on Friday said, “It is much necessary for the patients to be recorded with the local authorities so that they are monitored closely either by allowing them home isolation or brought to the Covid care centres for treatment. The self-test kits are used in large numbers. Even after testing positive, many people do not follow the home isolation guidelines or the treatment protocols. This not only posses risk to the patients’ health but the health of their relatives.”Sale said that the tendency of the users testing positive through the self-test kits to get self-treated or with traditional medicines was increasing. “The government has only prescribed allopathy medicines for the treatment, and not herbs or traditional concoctions. The right treatment regime helps the Covid patients recover fast and is effective. Also, the prescribed treatment does not cause any complications. Self-medication in case of Covid is harmful. The local authorities are asked to set up teams to trace the self-tested Covid patients on a priority,” said Sale.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/admin-makes-self-test-kit-detail-check-mandatory/articleshow/88907201.cms||---

All the six people were arrested and investigation was on how the illegal trade of Ambergris, which was found in Kolhapur for the first time, a forest officer said on Friday. Ambergris is largely used to make perfumes, beauty products and few medicines and is in huge demand in the international market. Ambergris, created by the bile duct of the sperm whale, is often called “floating gold” due to the immense price it fetches in the international market for its use in luxury perfumes. Range forest officer Ramesh Kamble said, “Acting on a tip-off about a gang from Sangli active in trade of Ambergris, we laid a trap in Kolhapur and arrested the six persons during a joint action by the forest department, wildlife crime control bureau and local crime branch Kolhapur. The six persons — Vishwanath Namdas, Alamshah Mullah, Rafiq Sanadi, Uday Jadhav, Kismat Nadaf and Aslam Mujawar — are all residents of Sangli district.” He added, “Besides Ambergris weighing 3.4kg, a car, two motorcycles and four cellphones were confiscated from them. The crackdown was conducted under the guidance of chief conservator of forests Clement Ben and deputy conservator of forests R.R. Kale with active support of honorary wildlife warden for Satara Rohan Bhate.” An official cited preliminary investigation suggesting that the Ambergris might have been brought into western Maharashtra from the Konkan region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/ambergris-seized-six-from-sangli-arrested/articleshow/88907202.cms||---

A day earlier, Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Chandrakant Patil had met the Jadhav family and requested Jayashri to contest on BJP ticket as she and Sambhaji Jadhav, brother of Chandrakant Jadhav, both were BJP corporators of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation and had longtime association with BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Patil had said that since the seat was left to Shiv Sena in the seat-sharing arrangement between BJP and Sena during 2019 assembly election, Chandrakant Jadhav had to contest the election on Congress ticket. After the meeting, Patil had said that the family is yet to decide and will convey the decision in two days. His statement had caused some confusion among the Congress party workers. Yuvraj Patil, close confidante of Jadhav family said, “During the meeting itself, we had cleared that since the seat was contested on Congress ticket, it will not be right to contest the bypoll on the ticket of any other party.” Meanwhile, Chandrakant Patil said the decision to contest the bypoll with or without Jadhav family on board will be taken soon. The Congress leadership is trying to get leaders of all parties on board to get the seat elected unopposed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/jayashri-jadhav-to-contest-for-cong-not-bjp/articleshow/88907203.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: From now, government will follow purposive testing strategy of ICMR||KOCHI: Superseding all advisories and guidelines regarding testing issued so far, the state government has now decided to follow ICMR’s guidelines on purposive testing strategy for Covid-19. Accordingly, asymptomatic patients undergoing surgery and pregnant women in labour who are hospitalized for delivery should not be tested for Covid unless warranted or develop symptoms. Also, contacts of confirmed Covid cases will not be tested unless identified as high-risk based on age or comorbidities. “The district surveillance units of the health and family welfare department shall take appropriate actions to ensure the implementation of advisory at the field level,” said an order signed by principal health secretary Dr Rajan N Khobragade on January 11.  The advisory on purposive testing strategy was issued to ensure early detection of asymptomatic cases as well as detection of infections in the elderly (above 60 years) and individuals with comorbidities for quick isolation and care. Accordingly, in community settings, now only symptomatic individuals and at-risk contacts (elderly patients and those with comorbidities) of laboratory-confirmed cases will be tested, besides international travellers arriving and departing from India. Meanwhile, in hospital settings, though testing may be undertaken as per the treating doctor's discretion, it has been made clear that no emergency procedure (including surgeries and deliveries) should be delayed for lack of a test. Admitted patients may not be tested more than once a week. It has been further decided not to go for random testing of asymptomatic individuals in community settings to check for community spread. Patients who stand discharged as per home isolation guidelines or revised hospital discharge policy will not be tested. Also, individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel will not be tested. ICMR, which is now promoting home tests or rapid antigen tests, has said that a positive point-of-care test is to be considered confirmatory, without any repeat testing. However, if the report is negative and the patient is symptomatic —fever, cough or sore throat— then samples need to be sent for RT-PCR. Though ICMR’s advisory is generic in nature and state health authorities have the discretion to modify it based on specific public health and epidemiological reasons, the state government has not brought in any changes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/from-now-government-will-follow-purposive-testing-strategy-of-icmr/articleshow/88907204.cms||Preetu Nair

Nearly 300 cabin crew members under the Air India Express Employees Union (AIXEU) banner decided to go on a strike raising various demands over the alleged ‘gross injustice’ meted out by the airline’s management. They also demanded re-appointment of cabin crew member Basil, who suffered a disability. AIXEU (BMS) president KK Vijayakumar said during the talks held on Friday in the presence of assistant labour commissioner (central) Anish Ravindra, both parties negotiated in good faith. “The management committed to resolving Basil’s matter and guaranteed that he will be allowed to join back as per disability commissioner’s orders. They also conceded to their mistakes regarding inordinate delay in issuing airport entry pass. They agreed to raise the issue regarding contract renewal with Tata Group post the takeover on Jan 23,” he said. He added that as the management has requested time till Feb 10 to resolve the issue, the union decided to postpone the strike. Further decisions will be taken after the meeting to be held on Feb 10.

---||Goa||Since 2021, Goa’s total mangrove cover has increased by 1 sqkm||PANAJI: Goa has a total mangrove cover of 27 sqkm, which has gone up by 1 sqkm over the last one year, as per the India State of the Forest Report (ISFR) 2021 of the Forest Survey of India, released on Thursday.  Goa is among only 11 states and union territories in the country with a presence of a mangrove cover. The report, however, shows that Goa does not have any mangrove patches categorized as ‘very dense’. Of the 27 sqkm of mangroves, 21 sqkm are ‘moderately dense’ mangroves whereas 6 sqkm are open mangroves. Moderately dense mangroves are those with a canopy density of between 40% to 70% and open mangroves are those with a canopy density of 10% to 40%. As per the ISFR report, Goa’s mangrove cover has doubled since 2009. The increase in mangrove cover recorded throughout India has been attributed by the report mainly to natural regeneration and to plantation drives. In Goa, natural mangrove regeneration is often noticed in saline ecosystems like the khazan lands, while some re-plantation activities have also been spearheaded by the Mangrove Society of India. Due to their rich biodiversity and ecological and environmental significance, the conservation of mangrove ecosystems is now a focus area in India. “In most countries, mangrove ecosystems face constant pressure due to increasing human population in coastal areas and the rising demand for land, timber, fodder, fuel-wood and other non-wood forest products. Appropriate management is germane to effective conservation of mangroves. Mangroves are repositories of rich biodiversity,” the ISFR report states. In India, presently as part of the conservation efforts, steps are being taken to identify selected mangrove areas for conservation, preparation of a management plan, promotion of research, and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to mangrove conservation involving the government, local universities, etc. In Goa, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority had formed a mangrove committee to demarcate the mangrove areas in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/since-2021-states-total-mangrove-cover-has-increased-by-1-sqkm/articleshow/88905420.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

While 552 of the nearly 4,000 operational beds are occupied, more than 1,700 beds are to be added soon. With the gradual rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past one month and more and more cases of the Omicron variant, a designated isolation unit at the Delhi government’s LNJP Hospital was created. Very soon, however, international passengers testing positive were shifted to the government’s free Covid care centres at Commonwealth Games Village, Terapanth Bhawan in Chhatarpur and Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre. The IBIS hotel near the airport was among the first to be designated as a paid isolation facility and, along with other centres, was linked with nearby Delhi government hospitals. With no or very mild symptoms being seen in most Omicron cases, international passengers with no major symptoms were shifted from LNJP to dedicated Covid care centres or paid isolation units at private hotels. The total bed strength is now 3,947, out of which 2,842 are oxygenated beds. New centres are set to open soon at South West, North and West districts, which have a combined bed strength of 1,765 and will take the tally to 5,712. New Delhi district has 154 Covid-19 positive cases in isolation centres operating from two five-star (Aloft and Novotel) and two three-star hotels (IBIS and Red Fox), apart from Viswa Yuvak Kendra in Chanakyapuri. Three centres are expected to become operational at South West district within days and include 500 beds at Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s EWS flats in Dwarka’s Sector 16-B, 200 beds on the hostel campus of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College in Sector 3, and 40 beds at a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) community centre in Sector 9. While the biggest isolation facility in Shahdara district is at DDA’s Yamuna Sports Complex, which has 400 oxygenated beds, a 70-bedded facility with oxygen support has been set up at the Shahdara police station, and three oxygenated beds are available at Karkardooma Court Complex.

The lowest prices quoted in the auction at the Spices Park, Puttady, also declined to Rs 756 per kg last week. In the morning auction on Thursday held by Kerala Cardamom Processing and Marketing Company Limited, Thekkady, the average price was Rs 870, while the maximum price quoted was Rs 1,298. Of the 66,399.9kg of cardamom that arrived, 64,378.7kg were sold. According to traders, a huge amount of cardamom arrived in the market and resulted in a continuous price fall. From December last week onwards, the price level continuously fell, and farmers demanded immediate attention from the government and the Spices Board. Under the banner of Wayanad Idukki Cardamom Farmers (WICF), farmers conducted a protest in front of the Puttady Spices Park on Thursday, demanding the Board's intervention to prevent the price fall of cardamom.An official of WICF said that their main demand is that the Spices Board should limit cardamom auction facilities only for farmers. "Now vendors are re-pooling cardamom in the auction and it has resulted in the production to double which resulted in the price fall. In addition, the government should take steps to fix a minimum price for cardamom," said the official.“After the second wave of the pandemic, we stored the produce expecting high prices. But the price suddenly fell to below the Rs 700 range. Now we can't sell the product,” said Thomas, a farmer in Kattappana.Spices Board Chairman A G Thankappan told TOI that the Board has called a meeting of cardamom farmers and vendors on January 19 at Kochi to discuss the issue. “The main demand of farmers is to fix a minimum price for cardamom. But the Board can’t fix a minimum price and only the state government can. After the meeting, if needed we will approach the government to fix a minimum price for cardamom,” said Thankappan.“It is the reality that the production of cardamom has largely increased,” said the chairman.The highest ever price of cardamom was recorded on August 3, 2019, at Rs 7,000 a kg at the auction held at Puttady.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/farmers-hit-as-cardamom-prices-fall/articleshow/88907207.cms||Sandeep Thomas

A team of experts from the college of veterinary and animal sciences, Mannuthy examined the cub on Friday. Dr Shyam Venugopal, who led the team, said the cub appeared to be reasonably healthy and there was no immediate need to give medicines. “The cub is too young, maybe born less than 10 days ago, and we have to watch how its condition is in the coming days,’’ he said. The cub is given milk replacement feed based on a kitten formula. But the rehabilitation of this cub could be a challenge for experts and authorities have not yet taken a decision, said forest veterinarian Dr David Abraham, who is also in charge of the rehab clinic. It is hand-fed now and sending it back to the forest could be a risk considering that it may not survive in the wild. If it becomes dependent on hand-feeding, maintaining it in the zoo could be an option, said Dr Venugopal.  “A final decision can be taken only after assessing its condition from six months to a year. As per the guidelines of National Tiger Conservation Agency (NTCA), tigers or leopards caught from the wild cannot be kept in zoos. Only those born in zoos can be reared there. So NTCA guidelines will also have to be factored in while making a decision on the rehabilitation of the cub,” he said. Leopard dies in Thrissur zooMeanwhile, a leopard, whose age is said to be around 26 years, died at Thrissur zoo on Friday. As per preliminary autopsy findings, the leopard died due to age-related complications, said Dr Abraham. Dr Abraham said the samples collected from the carcass would be sent for toxicological and histopathological studies for getting a more accurate picture on the cause of death. The male leopard was rescued from forest areas in Mukundapuram taluk and brought to Thrissur zoo in 2007, said zoo veterinarian Dr Dhanya. She said the leopard was keeping relatively well and had taken food on Thursday evening. Only two more leopards remain at the zoo and their age is over 15 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/neonatal-care-for-rescued-leopard-cub/articleshow/88907210.cms||T Ramavarman

Considering a petition by film director Pauly Vadakkan challenging the collection of parking fee from visitors, Justice PV Kunhikrishnan sought a response from Kalamassery Municipality. During the hearing, the court said, prima facie, parking space is part of the building as per the building rules and that building permit is issued on the condition that parking space is provided. The question is whether the owner of the building can collect parking fees after construction, the court said while seeking the municipality’s views on the matter. While the petitioner has alleged that the mall is collecting parking fees without any authority of law, the mall management has contended before the court that it has a valid licence issued by the municipality under Section 447 of Kerala Municipality Act.

Two AC electric buses were operated along the route with an aim to tap the airport passengers’ segment by providing last-mile connectivity to Kochi Metro.  Due to poor passenger turnout, KMRL withdrew one of the feeder services three months ago. Now, there are demands to operate ‘Pavan Doot’ as a circular service connecting more suburban towns in addition to Aluva and Cial. The ticket rate for one-way journey of the feeder service is Rs 50. Other than the starting point and the destination there are no other stops for the service.  D Dhanuraj of Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) has said that the feeder service would be viable if it operates as a circular service connecting Aluva railway station, Angamaly and Vyttila Mobility Hub in addition to the airport and Aluva Metro station.  “The unscientific operation of the service was the main reason for its failure. If the service connects major towns in and around Kochi, it would be helpful to hundreds of commuters,” said Rajesh Nair of Kerala chamber of commerce and industry. Biju John of V4Kochi organization has said that the current service connecting Cial with the Aluva metro station is not useful to many as most people wanted connectivity between the airport and the railway stations at Angamaly and Aluva.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/call-to-extend-metros-feeder-service/articleshow/88907212.cms||---

Some of the colleges have partially or fully closed fearing that the infection spread could lead to the formation of Covid clusters within the institutions. Several institutions are relying more on online mode of learning now by reducing the frequency of offline classes. Implementation of Covid protocols too has been strengthened to prevent the spread . However, many institutions are trying to downplay the spread of infection among its students and teachers. They said though cases are being reported there is no need to worry. Most institutions are not ready to reveal the exact figures of Covid figures stating that they are in the process of collecting the details.  If a student is tested positive, the entire class is shifted to online mode to prevent the spreading. Also, details about the spread of infection among the family members of the students and faculty are being sought. In case any positive case is detected in the family, the student is urged to stay home under quarantine. In Government Model Engineering College (MEC), Thrikkakara, all classes are being conducted online. Sources said that nearly 40 cases have been reported in the college over the last two weeks. “Many students are getting infected and there are reports of spread in the college. Though we are not being informed about it, we were asked to stop coming to the college and attend the classes online,” said a final-year student of MEC. Meanwhile, MEC principal Jacob Thomas said that the college was closed as part of giving the students enough time to study in the wake of upcoming exams. “Some cases are being reported among the students but there is no alarming situation. So far, around 20 cases have been reported,” he said. In St Teresa’s College, Ernakulam, two departments have shifted to online mode completely for a few days as some of the students were tested positive. College principal Lizzy Mathew said despite warnings many students are not cooperating and are careless about the protocols. “We have around 54 Covid positive students now and all of them are in quarantine. Communicative English and commerce departments now offer online classes to prevent the spread of the infection,” she said. In St Albert’s College too some of the classes reported positive cases and they were shifted to online mode. “Splitting the classes to maintain social distancing is not possible now as full strength is coming to college now. But we use large classrooms as an alternative,” Albert’s College principal M A Solomon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/many-colleges-switch-back-to-online-classes-as-covid-spikes/articleshow/88907215.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Covid testing ramped up, with focus on border checkpoints||DEHRADUN: In the wake of a steady rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, testing has been ramped up across the state, especially at all border points, airports, bus and railway stations. On Friday, 3,200 fresh cases were reported in Uttarakhand, bringing the total number of active cases to 12,349. Three deaths, two in Pauri Garhwal and one in Haridwar, were also reported. In Dehradun, testing booths have been set up at nine entry points in the city, including the airport, ISBT, railway station among others. “We are testing almost everyone coming to the city,” said chief medical officer, Dr Manoj Upreti. Two private booths are operating at the railway station, one by the health department at Jolly Grant along with several others in the city. The system, however, is not 100% accurate. “I had to rush to Mumbai for work and came back earlier this week. But all they asked me was details about where I lived. A volunteer at the airport told me to self-isolate for a few days but I wasn’t tested there,” said Anita Dongre, a Rajpur resident. Till early this month, the average testing in the state was around 18,000 but in the wake of increasing cases, the figure has gone up to over 25,000, which was the state target earlier. On Friday and Thursday, 27,740 and 29,484 samples were sent for testing, the highest were from Haridwar and Dehradun districts, respectively. Meanwhile in Nainital, joint magistrate Prateek Jain told TOI that vigil had been stepped up at entry points like Barapatthar and Jeolikote. Random checking and testing are being done in Tallital, Mallital and Barapatthar. Only those with a negative RTPCR report are being allowed to enter the city. At malls, hotels and shops, the temperature of visitors is being checked. In Uttarkashi, Mayur Dixit, district magistrate, said, "We have administered jabs to more than 4,000 people." “We have started random sampling at borders and high-risk areas of the district.” In Haridwar, health department has stepped up testing amid Covid surge in Haridwar. Several teams have been posted at Narsan and Chidiyapur borders. Testing is also being done at Ganga ghats and markets. According to health officials, more than 7,000 tests are being done every day. In Almora, chief medical officer Dr RC Pant on Friday said samples of 1,700 people had been sent for testing in the district. In Pithoragarh, testing at entry points from Nepal has been ramped up .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/covid-testing-ramped-up-with-focus-on-border-checkpoints/articleshow/88907216.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Ordered to shut for using oxytocin, Doon dairy still open||Dehradun: More than three weeks after the district administration ordered shut down of the dairy found using oxytocin on cattle, the establishment is yet to be closed down. The use of oxytocin is prohibited but dairy owners sometimes use it to enhance milk production. Earlier, on September 16, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) had approached the district magistrate with a complaint alleging that none of the dairies operating in Dehradun were registered with Nagar Nigam nor did they have any licence to operate. They added that there was also evidence that these dairies were discarding solid waste directly into drains in complete violation of environment protection laws.  Subsequently, on September 24, a few dairies at the Kanwali Road were inspected by additional district magistrate Dr Shiv Kumar Baranwal. During the inspection, one of the dairies was found to be using oxytocin on animals. It was served with a notice of closure by the district administration. Following the incident, SPCA also filed a complaint with the city police and the concerned dairy owner was booked under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.  “If the officials fail to implement the order of the ADM, how can the public expect any help from them. These dairies pose a threat to the welfare of animals and are a hazard to our health as well. Stringent action must be taken against dairies flouting health, safety and environmental laws,” said Rubina Nitin Iyer, member, SPCA.  Meanwhile, district authorities have said that they will look into the matter. “Necessary action will be taken soon. Officials concerned will be instructed to carry out the order,” said district magistrate, R Rajesh Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ordered-to-shut-for-using-oxytocin-doon-dairy-still-open/articleshow/88907218.cms||---

---||Varanasi||UP Election 2022: Congress first to field candidate in SP bastion of Azamgarh||VARANASI: The Congress party, which had contested the 2017 assembly elections in alliance with the Samajwadi Party, has become the first political party to field its candidate, Praveen Kumar Singh, from Azamgarh in the 2022 election. Though the Congress has fielded a young face of the party and district president of Azamgarh, political observers here feel it would be a difficult task for him to make any impact in the SP’s bastion. The reason: Azamgarh assembly segment has been a stronghold of SP since 1996 and represented by Durga Prasad Yadav for five times in a row. Besides, the Azamgarh parliamentary seat has also been represented by the SP for the last two consecutive terms, including SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and party chief Akhilesh Yadav since 2014. The Azamgarh parliamentary constituency has five assembly segments, including Gopalpur, Sagri, Mubarakpur, Azamgarh and Mehnagar (SC). Except Sagri, which was snatched by BSP’s Bandana Singh in 2017, all other seats are represented by the SP. According to records, though the Azamgarh parliamentary seat had been a bastion of Congress in the beginning during five consecutive general elections from 1952 to 1971, it could not open its account after 1984. From 1989 onwards, Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat was represented by various political parties, including BSP (1989, 1998, 2004, 2008), Janata Dal (1991), SP (1996, 1999, 2014, 2019) and BJP (2009). In such a situation, the grand old party Congress, which could win the Azamgarh assembly seat only two times in 1977 and 1980, will have to play on a difficult turf in the 2022 assembly election. Before 1996, this seat had shown a mixed characteristic by electing the candidates of different parties, including Praja Socialist Party (1957 & 1962), Samyukta Socialist Party (1967 & 1969), Bharatiya Kranti Dal (1974), Congress (1977 & 1980), Independent (1985), Janata Dal (1989 & 1991), and BSP (1993). The SP captured the seat in 1996, and it has been represented by Durga Prasad Yadav since then. However, Yadav had also won the seat in the past as an independent in 1985 and on Janata Dal tickets in 1989 and 1991. In the last election in 2017, he had defeated BJP’s Akhilesh by a margin of 26,262 votes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/cong-first-to-field-candidate-in-sp-bastion-of-azamgarh/articleshow/88907225.cms||Binay Singh

Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to DDA and asked it to file a reply and listed the matter for further hearing in March. The petition filed by Santosh Giri and other local residents has challenged the action of DDA of demolishing the slums near Lotus Temple Road, Kalkaji without prior notice. Some jhuggis were demolished last month. The plea sought temporary shelter with facilities, including running drinking water, sanitation facilities and clean hygienic surroundings in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioner further sought survey and rehabilitation as per the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) policy of 2015. The petitioners urged the high court to issue direction to DUSIB to conduct a survey of the affected residents and rehabilitate them in accordance with the Delhi JJ slum Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015. The petition also wants DUSIB to put on record the survey of the residents in accordance with their policy of 2015 and direct the respondents to provide temporary shelter to the dwellers. The jhuggi clusters in Kalkaji have been in existence at least since 1990 and comprise more than 23 houses. The residents are mostly rickshaw pullers, daily wage labourers and domestic workers who live below the poverty line. They are struggling to survive amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the plea informed the court. It added that the petitioners have proof of residence prior to January 2015.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-seeks-dda-reply-on-plea-over-kalkaji-slums-demolition/articleshow/88905943.cms||TNN

The four units of Aurangabad range comprising Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad district police successfully disposed off 46,243 pending cases, setting the record for clearing highest pendancy in the state. This feat has been achieved in a span of 14 months between October 2020 and December 31, 2021. Aurangabad range’s special inspector general of police KM Mallikarjuna Prasanna said they could achieve this feat by introducing more clarity, fixing accountability and at the same time by rewarding every work, irrespective of how small the work a police constable or any officer does. As per his instructions, an upper limit has been set to the number of cases that are expected to be probed by an investigation officer of particular rank. Moreover, an internal online system has been started that uses artificial intelligence to track progress in a given case, and alerts the IO as well as his immediate superiors about the same. Those completing the probe within stipulated time while meeting quality parameters, are rewarded, and the ones failing to meet, are officially reprimanded and punished. A total of 4,194 policemen have been given 16,607 rewards. The officer said that very few cases, which are either related to economic offences or have been stayed by court, or that are awaiting report from expert agencies, are pending. “Almost 90% of the cases that are currently investigation, were registered in the last quarter of 2021,” he said. Police authorities said that the number of body and property offences, as well as law and order situations reduced during lockdown due to which the investigation officers got time and space to complete pending probes. The range has successfully rescued 2,144 missing women and children. Some of them (946) were missing since 2011. The four police units have disposed off over 23,000 seized muddemal, 2,665 unclaimed vehicles, freeing up considerable space at all the police offices. Also, a total of 1.42 lakh unwanted files have been disposed off. During that past one year, 26,483 applications have been received by the four police units, and out of these applications, 1,129 were converted into FIRs, 1,536 into non cognizable offences, 25,554 were disposed off while only 935 are currently pending. Also, in 37 proposals for externment, 123 active criminals have been externed. The number of investigation officers from constabulary were 1,358 and have been increased to 2011.

It is being ensured that every student gets food packets and medicines in their respective rooms,” said chief provost Nalini Pandey. She said some male students who were positive but whose condition was not very serious have left the hostels while those who are from far-flung places will move once they get reserved tickets or their guardians come to pick them. We are taking due care of all our students in hostels. “My family is in Chandigarh. I will leave the hostel in a day or two after I get a confirmed railway ticket,” said Vishal Singh. Another student Devika Mathur said her guardians are coming by road from Chitrakoot on Saturday morning to pick her. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “LU dispensary has been given the responsibility to ensure that all required medical help is given to students who are unwell. Also, provosts at the three hostels and the chief provost are ensuring that the parents of the quarantined students don’t panic and keep them posted about the health condition of the students.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/eerie-silence-on-lu-campus-and-hostels-post-covid-19-outbreak/articleshow/88907235.cms||---

---||Lucknow||DSMNRU officer meets Guv with harassment complaint against 4||Lucknow: After lodging an FIR against three senior officers and one professor, accusing them of sexually and mentally harassing her, a woman officer from Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMNRU) has now knocked at the door of chancellor and governor Anandiben Patel seeking her intervention. The complainant met Patel and submitted her complaint in which she reiterated her accusation against the four persons named in the FIR. She also alleged that university authorities have given a clean chit to the accused following an inquiry, despite her repeated objections over the method for the probe. The woman officer has named university registrar Amit Kumar Singh, controller of examination Amit Kumar Rai, deputy registrar AK Singh and professor of sociology Himanshu Shekhar for sexually and mentally harassing her. She has also written to the chief minister, University Grants Commission, UP Women’s Commission and department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, requesting them to direct the university to conduct a fair investigation.The officer said she was being harassed for the past three years, but kept quiet hoping that her resistance would deter the accused. However, she added, when things turned traumatic, she lodged a complaint with the university in July, requesting for a probe through the internal complaints committee (ICC) as per the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act. “The university handed over the matter to the old ICC, whose term had expired. I objected to it, but officials did not listen. I then moved high court on whose direction a new ICC was constituted, but five out of the six members were either bosses or friends of the accused. I again objected, but it was not considered,” the officer stated.“The ICC did not provide me with enough time to cross-examine the responses of the accused. Further, only eight of 14 witnesses/evidences I submitted were seen. In November, ICC gave a clean chit to the accused. I then went to the vice-chancellor with an appeal to reconsider , but he refused. He even refused to give me the CCTV footage of the office where I work, which will prove my case beyond any doubt,” she stated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/dsmnru-officer-meets-guv-with-harassment-complaint-against-4/articleshow/88907238.cms||---

According to residents, several complaints to Lucknow Municipal Corporation and Jal Nigam have gone unheard. Tariq, a resident, said, “We use a motor pump to get water supply. The water is mostly foul-smelling, yellowish and murky. We have to throw away five to six buckets of water before relatively clean water starts coming from the pipe.” Shivika Saxena said, “Around six months back we installed RO machine because of dirty water. We even complained but after initial action, things went back to usual.” According to Jal Sansthan officials, the pipeline was last replaced in 2007 and has been damaged at several places. Jal Kal secretary Ram Kailash said, “We have tried to plug leaks on the pipeline. However, the problem persists.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Fake notes racket kingpin learnt skills in Bangladesh, say police||LUCKNOW: Two days after a gang manufacturing fake Indian currency notes was busted and five persons, including a GRP constable, were arrested, Lucknow police on Friday said that the mastermind is a Bangladeshi national identified as Jameel. Police said Jameel, who is still at large, was adept at manufacturing fake Indian National Rupee (INR). On January 12, Salman aka Aftab (21), Mohammad Mubassir (20), Mohammad Arbaz (20), Shavez Khan (22) and Rahul Saroj (32), a GRP constable, were arrested for circulating fake currency notes in the market. A senior police officer said that Salman had claimed he learnt the art of manufacturing fake currency notes from Jameel. “Jameel worked at a shop near the security printing corporation located in Ghazipur, Bangladesh. The corporation prints the currency notes of that country. Jameel learnt the art from there,” claimed police. Prior to 2019, Jameel used to print fake Indian currency notes in Bangladesh and smuggled them into Indian territory. However, since 2019, crackdowns by the Border Security Force and increased vigil by anti-terror agencies forced Jameel to stop cross-border smuggling and he came to India and started manufacturing notes here. “Jameel also lured unemployed youths on the pretext of getting them jobs and formed several groups. He used to teach them manufacturing of fake currency notes and then sent them to different parts of the country. He also gave them a cut of 20% in the total sale,” a senior officer added. A senior officer in UP ATS, who has led several crackdowns on such gangs, said that note resembling INR is manufactured by smugglers in Bangladesh. “They can manage it easily because of availability of starch papers and textile fibres in the neighbouring country,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/fake-notes-racket-kingpin-learnt-skills-in-bangladesh/articleshow/88907241.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Known for his distinct delivery style and wrapping up his news reports with couplets, Khan had received the prestigious Ramnath Goenka Award in 2010 and the Ganesh Shanker Vidyarthi Award from the President. People from all walks of life, including politicians, journalists, social activists, doctors and academics, took to social media to mourn his sudden demise. Khan, 61, is survived by his wife Ruchi Kumar, also a senior journalist, and son Aman. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath conveyed his condolences to the bereaved family and prayed for the departed soul. “Shocked to hear about the passing away of senior journalist Kamal Khanji. I met him just a few days ago and we discussed many thing. He kept alive values of truth and public interest in journalism. My deepest condolences to his family members,” Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted. “The death of Kamal Khanji, who emerged as a serious voice of journalism, is very sad. The deep voice of truth will always remain... My heartfelt tributes,” Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said. Sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik paid tribute by making a sand sculpture of Khan on Odisha beach. Varanasi natives lighted candles and held a special ‘aarti’.

Now, she has the option to appeal against the ICC decision at a higher level and the university will cooperate,” he added. He also said that since the university doesn't have cloud storage facilities, CCTV footage of only the recent past can be provided.Levelling a counter allegation, the VC said that the accusations made by the complainant seem to be an attempt to derail a probe in which all “wrong” appointments made in the previous regime are being examined. “A committee headed by the CM is investigating the matter and her name is also on the list of wrong appointments,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/vc-accused-deny-allegations/articleshow/88907243.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Team BJP in overdrive to counterOppn’s ‘anti-backwards’ narrative||Lucknow: Stung by a flurry of resignations by backward caste MLAs, including the three prominent UP ministers, the BJP has moved into an overdrive to arrest the opposition attempts to set the narrative of ‘backward versus upper caste’ — in what could potentially hurt saffron outfit’s larger social coalition it cobbled successfully in 2014 Lok Sabha and then again in 2017 assembly elections.Even as CM Yogi Adityanath led from the front by attending a ‘bhoj’ (eating session) at the house of a Dalit family on the occasion of Makar Sankranti in Gorakhpur on Friday, the BJP pressed the paddle by rolling out a mammoth batch of 20,000 backward caste leaders across the state to diffuse the crisis. As a matter of fact, ‘sah-bhoj’ — breaking bread with dalits and downtrodden — was a tradition started by Mahant Avaidyanath. The Goraksh Peeth has been following it religiously since the early 80s.UP BJP vice-president and in charge of OBC Morcha, Daya Shankar Singh confirmed to TOI that around 50 backward caste leaders have been deputed in each of the 403 assembly seats to carry out door-to-door campaigning. “The cadres have been asked to highlight the works done by the BJP at the Centre and the state for the backward community,” he said.Sources said the BJP was in no mood to allow the opposition to paint the saffron outfit as a party of just the upper caste. A senior BJP leader pointed out how the script of all resignations by BJP MLAs and ministers tend to paint the party dispensation as “ignorant” towards welfare of backward and Dalit and tampering with their reservation rights. “If this was true then why did these leaders stick to BJP for the past five years and enjoyed all the powers. Now when the elections are round the corner they have crossed over,” Singh said.Party sources said that the feedback about these leaders from the district and regional level was not satisfactory. “And they were well aware of it. They knew that they would be denied a ticket by the party,” said a senior BJP. Sources said that Swami Prasad Maurya, who triggered the spate of resignations in the saffron camp, not only wanted a ticket for his son Utkrisht from Unchahar but also sought to shift from his traditional seat of Padrauna to the neighboring Fazilnagar assembly seat in Kushinagar. The BJP, however, did not give into his demand as party candidate Ganga has been winning Fazilnagar seat since 2012.Likewise, Dara Singh Chauhan, who resigned from the cabinet a day after Maurya, too, wanted to leave the Madhuban assembly seat and contest from Ghosi, which was won by BJP’s Phagu Chauhan in 2017. He later got appointed as Bihar Governor in 2019 necessitating a by-poll for the seat which was won by BJP’s Vijay Rajbhar, a district level BJP functionary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/team-bjp-in-overdrive-to-counteroppns-anti-backwards-narrative/articleshow/88907244.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Lucknow||BJP finds old videos handy to ‘expose’ turncoats||Lucknow: Call it the BJP’s bid to arrest the narrative being set by the Opposition parties that OBCs are leaving the party, or an attempt to expose the opportunistic approach of the leaders switching over to the SP, BJP leaders and its IT cell have started digging into videos and statements of former cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya.In a video tweeted by Union law minister Kiren Rijiju with the caption, ‘Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha ka ek drishya (A scene from Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha)’, Maurya is seen attacking the Samajwadi Party leaders for showing concern for terrorists and Pakistan, in the UP legislative council.On Friday, Maurya joined the SP with another minister in the Yogi government, Dharm Singh Saini, and a few other MLAs.According to political analysts, the BJP is trying to show how a leader of the stature of Swami Prasad Maurya retracts from his statements. The idea is to prove that such leaders cannot sway OBC voters away from the BJP when they cannot stick to their statement and ideology for long.However, MLA from Tindwari assembly seat, Brajesh Prajapati, who also resigned from BJP with Maurya, said: “The BJP’s politics is centered on Maurya. Since they have nothing to tell the people, they will only come out with such videos.”BJP workers and leaders are posting another video of Swami Prasad Maurya wherein he is purportedly seen telling a journalist, “Let Akhilesh Yadav dream about forming the government. Dreams are after all dreams.”The video was reportedly shot in Sant Kabir Nagar on January 5 when Maurya had gone to attend a joint programme of BJP’s Kisan Morcha and OBC Morcha.“There are several instances where even BJP leaders said something but no truth was found in their claims,” Prajapati said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-finds-old-videos-handy-to-expose-turncoats/articleshow/88907246.cms||---

According to sources, the BJP has zeroed in on prominent faces from the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party and senior BJP leaders have also given their go ahead to their induction. “There are a few leaders who are demanding tickets. Their fate is yet to be decided,” a source added.  The biggest catch for the BJP would be an SP leader from an east UP district near Ayodhya, he said.  The leader enjoys support of a particular community, which may affect election results in the said district. The BJP was on the backfoot here after it failed to capitalize on BSP’s loss.  Sources said the BJP was also in talks with a prominent SP leader from Kannauj-Farrukhabad belt. According to sources, if the talks materialize, the induction of this leader would certainly be a major dent to the Yadav clan as he is said to have proximity with senior SP leaders.  Similarly, the BJP is also in talks with a former cabinet minister in the BSP government. His induction is in its final stages and the ball is now in the BJP’s court. BJP leaders are also in talks with an old BSP leader, who is influential among dalits. He had been working with the Bahujan Samaj Party workers at the grassroots for over two decades now. If he comes to the BJP camp, it would be a major advantage for the BJP in its dalit outreach.  The BJP leaders are also believed to be in talks with a former IAS officer, who, according to sources, is willing to join the saffron camp. These inductions are likely to begin from Sunday.  The said IAS officer was very powerful about a decade ago during the BSP regime.  The BJP’s strategy is not only to make a dent in other parties’ camps but also to bring in leaders whose clout can add value to BJP’s traditional vote bank. “Joining of Naresh Saini from Saharanpur and Hariom Yadav from Sirsaganj corroborates the BJP’s strategy,” a source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-to-avenge-defections-with-dents-in-rival-camps/articleshow/88907247.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

On Friday, a fake resignation letter of BJP’s Domariyaganj MLA Raghavendra Pratap Singh, who is state in-charge of Hindu Yuva Vahini and considered close to CM Yogi Adityanath went viral on social media. Addressed to UP BJP chief, the letter alleged neglect of Brahmins, Dalits and backwards. Singh, however, termed the viral letter on social media “fake and conspiracy of SP”. Again, after UP minister turned rebel Swami Prasad Maurya resigned from the state cabinet, a resignation letter by Bhadohi MLA Ravindra Nath Tripathi hit the social media circuit. Taken aback, Tripathi immediately came up with a video statement terming it a mischief by anti-social elements who used a fake letterhead and forged signatures to come up with “bogus resignation”. Tripathi later lodged a complaint with police. “I am and will be with BJP...Jai Sri Ram, Jai Parshuram...,” he stated. When Dara Singh Chauhan resigned from the cabinet the next day, rumours about UP minister and Kaiserganj MLA Mukut Bihari Verma’s resignation began doing the rounds. An old guard of BJP, Verma, a Kurmi, too was quick to junk rumours, saying “his body and soul were Hindu” and he would die a BJP worker. Verma joined RSS in 1962 when he was just 17 years old. He has since been working in various capacities in the Sangh. He was also nagar karyawah of RSS in Bahraich. He made his electoral debut from Kaiserganj in 1996, but lost to SP’s Ram Tej Yadav by a slender margin of 234 votes. He won the seat for the first time in 2002 assembly elections, defeating Ghulam Moil of BSP. He lost the seat in 2007, but won in 2012 and then again in 2017 assembly polls. He said, the party has given him a lot and would always abide by high command’s directives. Verma got an FIR registered against “unknown” persons. BJP sources said, such rumours are attempts by detractors to dent party’s poll prospects. “Dedicated party worker will never ditch the party. Those with individual interests are giving up membership,” said UP BJP spokesman Rakesh Tripathi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/round-the-clock-quit-rumourskeep-defection-hit-bjp-on-edge/articleshow/88907248.cms||Pankaj Shah

His reaction came a day after the two allies released its first list of 29 candidates for the upcoming state polls.  In a statement, Maurya categorically took the names of Haji Yunus in Bulandshahr, Nahid Hasan of Shamli, Rafiq Ansari from Meerut, Madan Bhaiya from Loni. “SP has shown the ‘trailer’ through this list that they are planning to bring back goons and rioters in the state,” he said.  The deputy CM said that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has given a clear message that he was not ready to leave criminals, goons and rioters. This also shows that formation of SP means riot raj, goonda raj and criminal raj in the state.  Maurya questioned the SP chief if he again wished to create an atmosphere which prevailed during Muzaffarnagar riots and exodus of families in Kairana. He said that the BJP would campaign against the character of the SP-RLD alliance. “People do not want the return of SP misrule and has made up it mind to give blessings to BJP which will win 300-plus seats,” he said.  Maurya said that SP never gave due importance to poor, laborers and farmers, while the BJP government gave 42 lakh houses to the poor, built more than two crore toilets, gave free gas connections to more than 2 crore poor under the Ujjwala scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sp-rld-alliance-has-given-tickets-to-rioters-history-sheeters-dy-cm/articleshow/88907250.cms||Pankaj Shah

Terming the event as the start of ‘Mandal 2.0’, he said, “Backward classes and dalits have realised that Hindutva politics used them as a tool to alienate minorities. The backward classes got nothing.” He said the BJP promised share in power to dalits and backward classes but after winning election, it suppressed their aspirations. “Backward classes and dalits have decided that they will themselves take their share in power as visualised by Ambedkar and Lohia,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/desertions-a-start-of-mandal-2-0/articleshow/88907251.cms||---

SP leadership is likely to take a call on this on Saturday. The meeting between SP chief and Chandra Shekhar was held in the backdrop of a tweet from ASP chief on Friday where he urged Akhilesh to include representation of Dalits in the alliance he is heading against the BJP. “Unity is very powerful. It is difficult to take on a party like BJP in the absence of a unified powerful force. It is the duty of those leading the coalition to make sure that all communities are represented and honoured. Today the dalit community in Uttar Pradesh expects Akhilesh Yadav to take this responsibility,” – the tweet in Hindi read. SP national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary confirmed to TOI the meeting did take place on Friday but refused to speak any further on the issue. Sources in SP however said Akhilesh was likely to take final call over the possibility of any tie-up with ASP on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/chandra-shekhars-asp-likely-to-join-sp-led-alliance/articleshow/88907252.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

I had also informed you (Mayawati) that in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, we would not get as many seats as we had been hoping for as we were losing our cadre but you did not listen to me and instead suspended me,” he said in his resignation letter to Mayawati. Upadhyay, a five-time BSP MLA, was in the party since 1996. He held the Hathras Vidhan Sabha seat for three consecutive terms from 1996 and then won from Sikandra Rao constituency in 2012. In 2017, he shifted to Sadabad constituency in Hathras. His wife Seema, who was earlier in BSP, had joined the BJP in 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ex-min-ramveer-upadhyay-quits-bsp-may-join-bjp/articleshow/88907253.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP Election 2022: BJP ‘vistaraks’ set to woo women electorate in state||LUCKNOW: Women leaders of BJP will play a major role to win support of the fairer sex in the forthcoming assembly polls in the state. Drawing up a big plan to retain power in politically crucial UP, the BJP has for the first time appointed women ‘vistaraks’ (expansionists) who will take forward the PM’s agenda of women upliftment to women across the state. For this, the party has formed a jumbo team of 60,000 women leaders comprising councillors, zila panchayat members and others associated with different roles at various levels within the party. The selection of women vistaraks has already been done and they are being deployed in all the assembly constituencies. Their training is also in the process. A vistarak is a full-time member of the BJP who is separate from the party unit. The party has attached 100 women with one woman vistarak who will meet and greet women in the assembly constituency assigned to her. “The campaign is totally for the women and by the women. Each woman vistarak will establish contact dialogues with the women and apprise them of the welfare schemes the BJP, both at the Centre and state introduced for empowering women,” said BJP’s state secretary Archana Mishra. Party functionaries said the double-engine government of BJP has taken initiatives keeping women as their biggest beneficiaries. Take for instance the Ujjwala scheme where gas connections are given in the name of adult women in the house. Similarly, women account holders of Jan Dhan Yojana got money under the Garib Kalyan Yojana that was announced by the Centre as part of Covid-19 economic stimulus. Again, the PM’s focus for toilets in each rural house was aimed at a healthy life and self-respect for women. According to political expert Prof SK Pandey women, who have now outnumbered men when it comes to voting, will definitely play a crucial role for BJP. “The forthcoming assembly polls in UP is a semi-final for the BJP for 2024. Since the party has launched several schemes targeting women, there is all possibility that this women vistarak campaign will strike a chord with the women voters. A woman obviously is more comfortable expressing herself with a woman than a man. And that is where this campaign will help establish immediate rapport,” said Prof Pandey. As per the plan, women vistaraks will reside permanently in their assembly constituencies till the elections are over. The organisation will take the responsibility of their accommodation and food. These will also become the link of communication between the high officials and workers of the party. So with this all-women campaign that will extend the party’s women outreach, the BJP is also making an attempt to change the minds of family members. “Only a woman holds the power to change the thoughts of her family. And we believe that she (women) will help the party earn votes, not only hers but many family members too,” Mishra added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-vistaraks-set-to-woo-women-electorate-in-state/articleshow/88907254.cms||Isha Jain

The party chief is also expected to announce her campaign schedule, including her first virtual rally next week.Party sources said, Mayawati’s first rally this election season will be launched in a big way. She was waiting to kickstart her rallies after announcement of election dates, but was caught in Covid protocols laid down by the poll panel, which banned physical gatherings and directed parties to hold virtual campaigns.“When Behenji was to step out and hit the road, it would have been a mega rally. However, since we are hamstrung by Covid-19 protocols, we have to find other ways to ensure her first address has a similar impact. Possibly, her first address will be aired across the state at the same time,” said a party worker. Subsequently, her virtual rallies or addresses will be shown in select constituencies.“Now, we will work as per the broadcast schedule. Her addresses, both live and recorded, will be shown in one or two constituencies at a time,” he added. Also, Mayawati will launch the 17th volume of her book — A Travelogue of My Struggle-Ridden Life and BSP Movement — on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/maya-to-announce-virtual-campaign-plan-on-bday-today/articleshow/88907255.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The motorcycles have been supplied for door-to-door campaigning and distributing campaign kits to supporters and voters.Earlier, the party’s founder and national president, Mukesh Sahni held a series of ‘helicopter’ rallies in the state in October and November to reach out to voters in Purvanchal. He had used his private helicopter to travel.VIP came into existence in 2018 riding the wave of demand for reservation to Nishads. In UP also, the party is demanding reservation for various sub-castes of Nishad community and is harping on the legacy of late Nishad MP, Phoolan Devi.The party observes Shahadat Diwas on July 25 since Phoolan was killed on the date in 2001 and had planned to install her 18-foot statues in 18 divisional headquarters of UP but the state government did not grant permission.Later, over 50,000 busts of Phoolan Devi were distributed among Nishads in Purvanchal and other districts to develop a connection.

---||Lucknow||Sisodia: Back AAP for goodeducation of your children||Lucknow: Addressing his first virtual meeting as part of AAP’s campaign for the upcoming 2022 elections, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia appealed to people to vote for the ‘good education of their children’.Addressing a virtual ‘Kejriwal Guarantee Sabha’ on Friday, Sisodia said that the people of Delhi had given a chance to AAP and now the people of Uttar Pradesh, who had seen the work of jumla parties like BJP, SP, BSP and Congress, should give it a chance too for better education, cheap electricity and good hospitals.Hitting out at both the BJP and the SP, Sisodia said that neither party had done anything to improve the level of education or schools in the state. “UP is a politically important state and the party which is in the centre and in the state seems to be in the process of getting dislodged. BJP’s own people are quitting the party and running away. It is clear that they see BJP getting dislodged in this election. But you should also think about where these people are headed. We should think as voters. Has the party to which they are now moving to done anything for your children in the five years that they were in power?” Sisodia said. Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said that so far all parties had been talking about religion and caste but education did not seem to be on anyone’s agenda. Asking for votes on development of schools, hospitals, social security for women, employment for youth and cheap electricity, Sisodia reminded people of party chief Arvind Kejriwal’s promise to give 10 lakh jobs a year.Saying that previous governments in the state had only played politics and not focussed on development work, Sisodia said that the people of UP finally had an alternative in AAP. “We firmly believe that good education is the basis of a strong society and if we cannot guarantee that, then what is the purpose of politics. Till now, parties like SP, BSP, BJP and Congress only played politics but now AAP has come as an alternative. If you give us a chance, we will show you that government schools can be better than private schools,” he said. Recounting the works done by the AAP government in Delhi, Sisodia said that there were 80% people in Delhi who were getting a zero power bill even though Delhi was not producing any electricity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sisodia-back-aap-for-goodeducation-of-your-children/articleshow/88907258.cms||---

---||Lucknow||With flurry of actions, Saharanpur in wild west turns into potboiler||LUCKNOW / MEERUT: As hectic politicking picks up pace ahead of UP polls, it is the west UP district of Saharanpur which has turned into a political potboiler. The district has witnessed the most number of crossovers by various party ranks, including former UP minister Dharam Singh Saini who switched over to the Samajwadi Party on Friday. The formal induction of Saini, an MLA from Nakur, in SP camp came three days after Congress heavy-weight Imran Masood joined the Akhilesh Yadav-led outfit leaving the grand old party faceless in the politically crucial region. It was Saini who defeated Masood twice -- in 2012 as BSP candidate and in 2017 on BJP ticket. Before that Saini had won the 2002 and 2007 assembly elections from Sarsawa assembly seat in Saharanpur, bordering Haryana. According to political analysts, Saini community has sizable presence in Shamli, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar and Noida and Dharam Singh Saini has influence in around 15 assembly constituencies in the area where Sainis are more than 30,000. BJP sources said that Saini was holding grudges against the BJP since the beginning after he was made the minister of state (independent) charge. During Mayawati's regime between 2007 and 2012, he was a cabinet minister. Sources said that Saini was also close to Maurya who raised the banner of revolt against the BJP and triggered a flurry of resignations in the saffron camp. Sources said that if Saini contests from Nakur, Masood might be shifted to the neighboring constituency of Behat where Congress's MLA Naresh Saini has defected to BJP. In 2012, Naresh lost to BSP's Mahavir Singh Rana by a slender margin of 500 votes. But in 2017 he defeated Rana, who contested as a BJP candidate, by a margin of over 25,000 votes. Saini is from the backward class and is said to be popular in his constituency. BJP sources said that he was likely to be given a ticket from the saffron party from Behat which goes to polls in the second phase of UP elections. This is not all. Imran's twin brother Nauman Masood left Jayant Chaudhary led RLD, an ally of SP, to join Mayawati's BSP. Having lost from Gangoh as Congress candidate in 2017, Nauman had joined RLD at the peak of farmers' protest against the three farm laws. The Dalit and Muslim dominated district, which is also home to the renowned Islamic seminary Darul Uloom, Deoband, had attained a centre-stage just over a month ago when the Yogi Adityanath government, just before the announcement of state elections, initiated a host of projects including construction of a university in the Ma Shakumabri Devi and an Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) commando centre. While construction of a university in the name of goddess Shakumbhari marked BJP attempt to hoist its tried and tested Hindutva symbolism, the coming of ATS centre was perceived by the saffron party with its trademark nationalistic lenses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/with-flurry-of-actions-saharanpur-in-wild-west-turns-into-potboiler/articleshow/88907262.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Election 2022: Swami Prasad Maurya, Dharam Singh Saini, 6 MLAs join SP at big show of strength||LUCKNOW: Having resigned from the UP cabinet, Swami Prasad Maurya accused the government of adopting a ‘use and throw’ policy towards scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward castes to form a government in Uttar Pradesh which was being run by the upper caste. After formally joining the SP in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Maurya said the party was now ready with its patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s famous 'Charkha Daon' to defeat the BJP in caste arithmetic and the 2022 Assembly polls. Apart from Maurya, his cabinet colleague in the government, Dharam Singh Saini and six MLAs also joined SP at a well-attended special event -- which was supposed to be virtual -- held at party headquarters in Lucknow. In his maiden address at SP headquarters, Maurya wasted no time in attacking the ruling BJP accusing the government of neglecting the scheduled castes and tribes and backward classes after coming to power riding on their votes. The list of remaining six MLAs who formally joined SP after resigning from the BJP in the past few days, included Bhagwati Sagar, Brijesh Kumar Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Roshan Lal Verma, Dr Mukesh Verma and sitting MLA Amar Singh of Apna Dal, which is part of the government in UP. While Dara Singh Chauhan - the third minister who resigned from the Yogi cabinet recently, was nowhere to be seen, sources said he was slated to join SP at an event on Sunday. Claiming that his joining the SP will mark the debacle of BJP in UP's history, Maruya said: "Today the senior BJP leaders who were in a slumber and never had the time to meet and listen to the MP, MLAs and minister, are having sleepless nights ever since we resigned," he said. He justified his resignation from the government, along with seven other MLAs, to join SP accusing the BJP of catering to 5% of the upper caste at the cost of votes which the party got from 23% scheduled castes and tribes and 54% backward classes. "The BJP talks of taking along 80% Hindus when it comes to elections, but once the government is formed only 5% upper caste "malai khate hain" (enjoy the fruits of it). "Before 2017 assembly polls, BJP used to say Keshav Prasad Maurya or Swami Prasad Maurya will become the CM. Once it was time for government formation, they tried to drop a Skylab from Ghazipur and then eventually sent one from Gorakhpur," he said. He cited the recent recruitment of teachers on 69,000 posts and questioned the government over filling up 19,000 posts meant for the reserved category by general candidates. "When you talk about elections being a 80-20 fight and say 80% are Hindus, then why don't you include 23% SC and STs and 54% backwards in jobs and welfare schemes. Are the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backwards not Hindus," he asked. Citing an instance where a proposal was tabled during a cabinet meeting for appointment in the medical education department, he said: "The proposal said since SC, ST and backward caste candidates have not applied, all the posts be given to general category candidates. I asked them if the vacancies were adequately advertised and found out that they were not."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/maurya-saini-6-mlas-joinsp-at-big-show-of-strength/articleshow/88907263.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Election 2022: Those who believe in nepotism can’t be supporters of social justice, says Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW/GORAKHPUR: CM Yogi Adityanath launched a blistering attack on the opposition on Friday saying that people who do politics of dynasty and nepotism cannot be supporters of "social justice". Yogi also tore into the previous SP government, accusing it of patronizing the mafia who encroached land and houses of the poor. "If this is social harmony, then I oppose it. We need to understand the difference between social justice and social exploitation," he said. "Those whose genes are part of corruption cannot fight for social justice. It is BJP which has fought the battle for social harmony and justice," he said.

Yogi also tore into the previous SP government, accusing it of patronizing the mafia who encroached land and houses of the poor. "If this is social harmony, then I oppose it. We need to understand the difference between social justice and social exploitation," he said. "Those whose genes are part of corruption cannot fight for social justice.

This suggests that the new strain has replaced the previously dominant Delta strain,” state surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal told TOI.He added that on an overall scale, Omicron has been isolated in 62% of the total 442 samples sequenced over the past four weeks.“Omicron taking over Delta is good news as the dangerous strain is finally dying down. But prevention is of paramount importance as the risk of complications with the vulnerable group remains high,” explained Prof Ram Shankar Upadhyaya, academician and scientist studying Covid-19 behaviour.Meanwhile, the daily case count continued to rise. As many as 16,016 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours across UP. With this, the total number of active cases in state swelled to 84,440. The official bulletin indicated that the number of recoveries was steadily rising. As many as 2,554 persons came out of the active category on Friday.The official bulletin also showed that three persons lost their life to the virus—one in Gautam Budh Nagar and two in Meerut—taking the total lives lost to 22,949. In terms of new cases, Lucknow topped the list with 2,209 cases followed by Ghaziabad (1,887), Gautam Budh Nagar (1,817), Meerut (1,207) and Agra (781). Meanwhile, additional chief secretary health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad urged people due for the second dose or precaution dose to come forward and take the shot at the earliest.Data from the CoWin portal indicated that over 22.3 lakh doses were administered on Friday. With this, the total number of doses given in UP reached 22.6 crore. In terms of people, 14.1 crore have taken the first dose while 8.4 crore are fully vaccinated.

---||Lucknow||Green cover went up, but UP also lost over 41sq km forest||Lucknow: The state of forest report (SoFR) 2021 has shown an increase of 91sq km in the green cover of Uttar Pradesh but, at the same time, the state has lost over 41sq km of forest cover of moderate density. While the green cover includes both the forest cover and the tree cover, the tree cover means trees lying outside the forest area.The districts that show loss of forest cover are Pilibhit, Mirzapur, Kheri, Maharajganj, Chandauli, Bijnor, Azamgarh, Sonbhadra, Sultanpur and Muzaffarnagar. The reasons, said sources in the forest department, may vary as forests are cleared not only for development projects, but also as per working plans of the forest divisions.Besides, at places like Kheri the forest cover also gets lost due to the Sharda that keeps on changing its course. The total loss of moderately dense forest in the state as per the report is 51 sq km. But, it is the gain of 10 sq km in the very dense forest area which shows that not all 51 sq km of moderately dense forest was lost, but 10 sq km of it got upgraded into a very dense forest in the state.“Moderately dense forest gets upgraded into very dense forest over a period of time. At the same time, when it degrades it leads to an increase in the open forest,” said sources.The SoFR categorizes forest into Very Dense Forest (VDF), Moderately Dense Forest (MDF) and Open Forest (OF) depending on the density of the canopy. The VDF has canopy density of more than 70%, MDF varies from 40% to 70% canopy density and open forest has less than 40% canopy density. In the 2021 report, OF has shown an increase of 53 sq km, which is also because of the plantation exercises taken up by the state government besides degradation of MDF. The 2021 report is based on the satellite data from October 2019 till February 2020. In that case, the rise in the green coverreflects the result of the plantation exercises done by the state governments till 2014-15.“The tree varieties that have been planted in the present regime like peepal, banyan & pakar take at least a few years to attain canopy density that can be recorded in the satellite data,” said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/green-cover-went-up-but-up-also-lost-over-41sq-km-forest/articleshow/88907266.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Giloy’ sans doctor’s advice can harm liver: Study||LUCKNOW: Consumption of ‘giloy’ without prescription and monitoring can cause damage to organs such as the liver, reveals a study recently published in Hepatology Communications, the official journal of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease. Giloy or Tinospora cordifolia is a herbal drug commonly taken as an immunity booster. The study was conducted by Liver Research Club of India at 13 medical centres including King George’s Medical University (KGMU). The university released the results to the public on Thursday. The study was conducted on 43 patients—23 female and 20 male—who reported with symptoms of jaundice. Clinical findings revealed that all patients were suffering from chronic liver disease or liver failure. Doctors also found that each of the patients had a history of taking a concoction of giloy. “We found that giloy was the main cause of liver issues in 67.4% (29) patients as there was no other factor like excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, thyroid, hypertension or any other etiological reason. The remaining patients consumed alcohol regularly and had comorbidities, hence they were not included among those in whom giloy was the main cause,” said Dr Ajay Kumar Patwa, associate professor of gastroenterology at KGMU. “Most of these patients had consumed the herbal drug without prescription or taken unprescribed doses for an average 46 days. This generated common antinuclear antibodies which started attacking liver cells and induced acute hepatitis with autoimmune hepatitis-like features,” said Prof Patwa. “Nobody should start popping it on their own,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/giloy-sans-doctors-advice-can-harm-liver/articleshow/88907267.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Lucknow||SGPGI treats young woman with rare cardiac procedure||Lucknow: A rare cardiac procedure undertaken by doctors at the cardiology department of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences on Friday brought instant relief to a patient suffering for several years. The case relates to 25-year-old Vineeta, who came from a remote village in Betia district of Bihar to the institute’s OPD three weeks ago. Her complaint of breathlessness, fatigue during increased activity, chest discomfort and palpitations was a clear diagnosis of mitral valve stenosis or narrowing of the valve (caused by rheumatic heart disease). To repair the diseased heart, a balloon mitral valvuloplasty (a cardiac procedure to repair the narrowed valve) was recommended. Normally, an intervention cardiologist approaches the heart through the femoral vein (in the thigh). However, in 1% of the patients, the femoral vein follows an abnormal path which closes this less invasive option. “The patient belonged to this category. What made the procedure rarer was that her femoral vein was looped,” explained Dr Roopali Khanna, additional professor who undertook the procedure on Thursday. “In such cases, open heart surgery is recommended. However, in big cardiac centres of the world, valvuloplasty through the jugular vein (in the neck) may be taken. We are happy to share that we could do that successfully at SGPGI,” she said, sharing the credit with her colleague Dr Amit Rastogi from the anaesthesia department.Congratulating the team, SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman said: “Only a few cases around the world have taken the jugular vein route. The team successfully resolved the condition while avoiding a high-risk and costly surgery requiring long hospitalization for the young woman. The procedure will help many patients as rheumatic heart disease is common in this part of the country.” The patient is stable and will be discharged on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/sgpgi-treats-young-woman-with-rare-cardiac-procedure/articleshow/88907268.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Agra||Ramveer Upadhyay, BSP's prominent Brahmin face, resigns||Agra: Former cabinet minister and BSP’s prominent Brahmin face -- Ramveer Upadhyay -- resigned from the party on Friday. Upadhyay, who had been with the party for the last 25 years, is a four-time MLA and represented Sadabad constituency in Hathras district. He is set to join BJP. In his resignation letter to party supremo, Upadhyay, once considered Mayawati’s right-hand man, said he was quitting from the party’s primary membership because BSP had veered off the ideals and principles of its founder Kanshi Ram. “The party did not introspect the reason behind its defeat in the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls and also in the 2012 and 2017 assembly elections,” he said. His letter reads: “When I had apprised the party chief that our defeat in 2019 Lok Sabha polls was due to the loss in our cadre votes, instead of accepting the reality, the party expelled me. My supporters’ sentiments were hurt.” Upadhyay’s disenchantment from the party is not new. He was sacked in 2019 for indulging in anti-party activities by supporting BJP candidates in the state. Upadhyay’s son Chirag Upadhyay said his father will join BJP on Saturday in Agra. He shared this information on his Facebook page. Upadhyay had played an important role in garnering the support of upper caste Brahmins for BSP. He was in-charge of the ‘Bhaichara’ (brotherhood) committee, constituted by Mayawati, to expand the party's base among the Brahmin community. He was the energy, medical education and transport minister during Mayawati’s tenure. His wife, Seema Upadhyay, is a former BSP Lok Sabha MP from Fatehpur Sikri and had won the seat in 2009. She had defeated Congress’ Raj Babbar, but in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the party fielded her from Aligarh but she refused and openly condemned the party leadership for the decision. BJP-backed Seema is currently the zila panchayat chief. Her brother-in-law and former block chief Rameshwar also joined the saffron party. Upadhyay’s brother Mukul Upadhyay, former MLC from BSP, who was expelled by Mayawati in 2018 for indiscipline, had also joined the BJP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/ramveer-upadhyay-bsps-prominent-brahmin-face-resigns/articleshow/88905441.cms||---

With three new deaths, the toll rose to 3,546 and the active caseload shot up to 18,597. Two men — a 44-year-old from Anjuna and a 37-year-old from Assagao — and an 88-year-old woman from Cuncolim — died at GMC. While the vaccination details of the 37-year-old man were not available, the other two were not vaccinated. The two men were under hospital treatment for less than a week, while the woman was admitted to GMC last month. On Friday, 25 patients were hospitalised and 17 discharged. The seven-day home isolation period of 1,432 people also ended, and the recovery rate stood at 89.14%.

The Forum members said that many of the constitutional rights continued to be denied to the tribal communities in Goa because the elected representatives have failed to give priority to these issues. “We fought for nearly 30 years to get ST status for Gauda, Kunbi and Velip communities and we got the status in 2003. But we were not granted our constitutional rights like declaring scheduled areas, forming tribal department and allotting sufficient funds. Political reservations, land and house rights have not been granted to the tribal communities till date. This is because the community was not given political reservation, which is meant to provide representation to the community,” said Ramkrishna Zalmi. The elected representatives neglected these tribal communities, leading to their issues remaining pending for nearly two decades now, said Zalmi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tribal-forum-to-float-10-candidates/articleshow/88923124.cms||---

Kejriwal urged voters to give AAP a chance in the coming elections and promised to provide clean and consistent power and water supply.

Later in the evening, he campaigned with Shiroda candidate Mahadev Naik. “There are a lot of expectations from the Aam Aadmi Party, and if AAP forms the government then we will try to fulfil these expectations. People want an honest alternative,” he said . Delhi MLA and AAP’s campaign-in-charge for Goa Atishi Marlena is also in Goa. “Goa’s politics has dismayed people and they want a party that is different.

---||India||2021 was 5th warmest year in India since 1901: IMD||NEW DELHI: The year 2021 was the fifth warmest year in India since nation-wide records commenced in the country in 1901, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its 'Climate of India during 2021' report. The annual compilation, released on Friday, also shows that the country had reported loss of 1,750 lives due to extreme weather events last year with Maharashtra being the most adversely affected state reporting 350 deaths. Among extreme weather events, lightning & thunderstorms took the highest 787 lives followed by heavy rains, floods and landslides that caused deaths of 759 people. Cyclones caused 172 deaths in different states in 2021. On warming phenomena, the report shows that 11 out of 15 warmest years in the country were during the recent fifteen years (2007-2021) with highest warming being observed during 2016 when it was 0.71 degree Celsius above the long period average (LPA) based on 1981-2010 period. The annual mean land surface air temperature averaged over India during 2021 was 0.44 degree C above the LPA. "The winter (January to February) and post-monsoon (October to December) seasons with all India mean temperature anomalies (actual-LPA temperature) of +0.78 degree C and +0.42 degree C respectively mainly contributed to this warming," said the Met department in its report explaining how the relatively less colder winter last year primarily contributed to the overall high mean temperature in the year. However, the all-India mean temperatures during the other two seasons such as pre-monsoon (March to May) and monsoon (June to September) were also "above normal" with anomalies of +0.35 degree C and +0.34 degree C, respectively. "The country averaged annual mean temperature during 1901-2021 showed an increasing trend of 0.63 degree C per 100 years with a significant increasing trend in maximum temperature (0.99 degree C/100 years) and a relatively lower increasing trend (0.26 degree C/100 years) in minimum temperature," said the IMD. India's mean surface temperature appears to be in sync with the rise in the global mean surface temperature. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in its provisional statement on Global Climate 2021 (January to September period) observed that the global mean surface temperature was about 1.08 ±0.13 degree C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average and the annual temperature is also likely to be between the "5 th and 7th warmest year" on record. As far as rainfall is concerned, the 2021 annual rainfall over the country as a whole was 105% of its LPA based on the 1961-2010 period. The southwest monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole was 'normal' at 99% of its LPA whereas the northeast/ post monsoon season (October-December) rainfall over the country as a whole was 'above normal' at 144% of LPA. The IMD in its annual report also compiled the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) which is used for monitoring drought conditions based on precipitation. This index is negative for dry, and positive for wet conditions. As the dry or wet conditions become more severe, the index becomes more negative or positive. The cumulative SPI values of the past twelve months of 2021 indicate "extremely wet - severely wet conditions" over parts of A & N Islands, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, East Rajasthan, West Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat Region, Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Andhra Pradesh state, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, North Interior Karnataka, South Interior Karnataka and Kerala. On the other hand, "extremely dry - severely dry" conditions were observed over parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam & Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram & Tripura, Sub Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim, East Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2021-was-5th-warmest-year-in-india-since-1901-imd/articleshow/88907287.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Godinho also said that minorities believe they need growth and want to be part of development, and are supporting BJP. He said that the alliance itself is a sign of accepting defeat. “Can all votes be transferred to one account? Does it happen anytime? It is like taking Goans and their votes for granted. This is wrong thinking. This is just an alliance and not a grand alliance,” he said. When asked why BJP did not ally with MGP, the transport minister said that MGP was BJP’s natural alliance partner at one point of time, but sometimes “they are blinded with ambition and they can see only one chair”. “As they have not got the chair, the leaders must have got blinded, and then you don’t know where you are driving,” he said. “They (MGP) have gone to a territory which is uncharted.” When asked about goenkarponn, Godinho said that this question should have been asked to political parties from other states. “Last ten years, BJP has been in government in Goa. Show me one incident where the party has taken any decision against the interest of Goans. Those parties which are coming to the state in large numbers are using social media to misguide the people of the state.” The transport minister said that people should think about TMC. “Even after the election in West Bengal, there was post-poll violence. Lots of people from Delhi have come. They have a lot of money, and if they all come to Goa, will there be goenkarponn? BJP is a party of Goans and BJP has always protected the interest of Goans.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/minorities-are-supporting-bjp-says-godinho/articleshow/88923133.cms||---

BJP’s Canacona functionaries, however, downplayed the incident. A source said the cause of tension was the secret ballot that was held in Margao by the party earlier this week to ascertain the workers’ preference for sitting MLA Isidore Fernandes or former MLA Ramesh Tawadkar as a candidate. The war of words among the two groups of workers was brought under control by senior functionaries who were present at the meeting. BJP secretary Sarvanand Bhagat told reporters that there was “no problem”, and that everything proceeded smoothly. “There was some misunderstanding but that was sorted out. All workers will work for the success of the party,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/goa/news/bjp-workers-spar-over-ticket-allotment/articleshow/88926575.cms||---

---||Goa||TMC, Cong in Twitter feud over tie-up plans||Margao/Panaji: The anti-BJP alliance proposed by TMC got mired in a heated clash on Twitter on Saturday, with both Congress and TMC leaders hurling innuendos back and forth. A day after TMC’s Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra countered the statement of Congress’ senior election observer P Chidambaram that TMC’s offer for alliance lacked clarity, stating that TMC had made a “formal and definitive offer to Congress on Goa to defeat BJP” two weeks ago, and that Congress’ response was awaited, Congress’ Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao on Saturday posted on his Twitter handle: “If (Congress general secretary) K C Venugopal’s tweet wasn’t reply enough, I wonder who from amongst Delhi leaders response is Mahua Moitra awaiting?” Rao was referring to Venugopal’s tweet on January 10 scotching speculations that “a possible alliance with TMC” was discussed by Rahul Gandhi. “Let me assure that the Congress party is confident — we will put Goa back on the path of progress soon,” Venugopal tweeted. In a sharp riposte to Rao, Moitra labelled Rao’s Twitter post as “uninformed false bravado” by Congress, and that it was “no substitute for rational thinking and maturity”. Stressing that TMC was “serious about defeating BJP,” Moitra, however, said she had “no desire to engage in further Twitter shadow boxing with various Congress functionaries”. What fuelled the Twitter feud were statements made by Chidambaram in television interviews that the February 14 Goa election would be a fight between Congress and BJP, and that any anti-BJP efforts have to be led by Congress while also expressing his “dismay” over TMC’s “aggressive and lavish campaign” and its poaching of Congress MLAs. While Moitra took to Twitter rebuffing Chidambaram’s statements, another TMC MP, Sushmita Dev, retorted stating that TMC was “the only party which can consolidate the anti-BJP vote,” in a clear indication that TMC was unwilling to play second fiddle. Dev said TMC has not forced or lured any Congress member to join the party. “Drop the double standards on defection. You malign everyone who leaves Congress, but you welcome everyone who left the other parties to join Congress,” she said. . On Saturday, TMC inducted former Congressman and former Gaondongrim sarpanch Ashok Velip.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tmc-cong-in-twitter-feud-over-tie-up-plans/articleshow/88923156.cms||---

By late evening an identical turtle dug a nest and laid eggs at nearby Morjim beach. At Vagator the turtle had arrived around 6.30am when some tourists and morning walkers were already moving about. It couldn’t be ascertained if it was the same turtle that ran into the beach-goers and stray dogs, decided to cross the Chapora river mouth and swim to Morjim beach on northern side of Vagator. “The turtle laid 110 eggs just after 11pm at Morjim and it had the right hind flipper missing,” said John Fernandes, range forest officer (RFO). The total number of nests at the Morjim beach, where proper guarding of turtle nests had begun in late 1990s with forest department’s support, has gone up to three. While Morjim is designated as a turtle nesting site along with Mandrem in Pernem taluka, besides two in Canacona, turtle eggs are sometimes relocated from other beaches, such as Anjuna, Vagator and Baga to prevent poaching and destruction of nests by stray dogs. “I saw the turtle during my morning walk digging a pit at around 6.30am,” Ramesh Naik, a member of biodiversity management committee of Anjuna panchayat said. The dogs started chasing the turtle when it had started digging the pit. “I saw it returning to the sea and requested a few curious tourists to make way for it,” Naik said. The flippered visitors are easily disturbed by bright lighting, noise and human presence. Tourism activities have reduced turtle habitats which at one point dotted the entire state coastline.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/3-limbed-oilve-ridley-turtle-nests-at-morjim-lays-110-eggs/articleshow/88905540.cms||---

Union minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted about this decision on Friday stating he has approved draft general statutory rules (GSR) notification to make minimum six airbags compulsory for vehicles carrying up to eight passengers. The ministry has already made driver airbag compulsory from July 1, 2019, and for front co-passenger from January 1, 2022. The latest decision would make airbags mandatory for rear seat passengers also. A notification would be released on Saturday and automobile manufacturers would be given six months to comply with the new rules, said sources in the MORTH. The Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, would be amended soon accordingly. Sources in the auto industry reacted sharply saying the decision was not based on any empirical evidence on rear seat passenger safety due to airbags. “In order to enhance safety of the occupants in motor vehicles, there will be two side torso airbags and two side curtain/tube airbags covering all outboard passengers. To minimise the impact of frontal and lateral collisions on occupants seated in both front and the rear compartments, it has been decided that four additional airbags be mandated in M1 category vehicles,” said Gadkari. According to him, this is a crucial step to make motor vehicles in India safer than ever. “This will ultimately ensure safety of the passengers across all segments, irrespective of cost and variant,” the city MP added. Sources said the development would push the auto makers to hike prices as they would have to make changes for adding two to four airbags for rear seats even in entry-level vehicles. This will up the cost by at least Rs 8,000 to Rs10,000 per vehicle. The cost may be a little higher for vehicles with lower sales. “Our priority is road safety, even if the decision was opposed by the manufacturers. In many countries, this feature is mandatory for all vehicles. The ministry is focusing on three aspects — road safety, its engineering and spreading awareness as well as promoting safe driving. The minister made it clear that there would be no compromise as far as passenger safety is concerned,” sources told TOI. A source in the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said the lobby group had flagged to Gadkari how the move to make six airbags mandatory was not based on any evidence and road deaths data when he had first held a meeting with industry representatives in August. “Nowhere in the world there is a regulation for airbags in cars. We are meeting the regulatory crash test norms. Second, there is no data or empirical evidence of rear seat passengers or occupant in cars facing bigger risk in crashes. There will be an additional cost to the cars because of the additional features and that will impact decision-making of people who want to shift from two-wheelers to cars,” the source added. Industry sources also said the proposed timeline was tough to implement. However, government officials dismissed the claims citing that all cars manufactured in India for export to Europe have at least six airbags. “It’s a matter of shame that we have to come out with regulations for safer cars. In Europe, car makers are providing more airbags to get the maximum safety rating and to retain their share in the market. Second, the manufacturers exporting cars to Europe and other countries already have the technologies with them and hence they can scale it up quickly,” an official said. According to road accident data published by the National Crime Records Bureau, 17,538 car occupants died in road crashes in 2020, which accounts for around 13% of the total road fatalities in the country. While the ministry’s thrust to improve occupant safety in cars is seen as a progressive move what remains a concern is poor compliance of seatbelt wearing by occupants on the rear seats despite it being mandatory as per law. This is because the efficiency of the airbags is more only when the passengers wear seatbelts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/come-oct-6-airbags-must-in-all-cars-up-to-8-seaters/articleshow/88905994.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Vidya Dhaklo Varik died on the spot while the injured was rushed to Hospicio, Margao. Sources said that the truck was carrying iron ore from Tollem in Sanguem to a sponge iron plant situated in the village. Following the incident, villagers gathered in large numbers at the spot of the accident and stopped mining transportation along the route. They claimed that ore transportation through the village was illegal. Kalay resident, Amar Naik, a lawyer, said that despite having complained to the authorities, including the deputy collector, pointing out that the route taken by trucks through the village was not authorised for mining transportation, no action was taken on the complaints. Naik further said that locals will be forced to stop transportation through the village if the authorities fail to take action. The Curchorem police have arrested the driver of the truck, Piedade Carvalho, under provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and the Indian Penal Code.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mining-truck-crushes-teen-at-kalay/articleshow/88923165.cms||---
