Housing and construction sectors have forward and backward linkages and impact nearly 200 sectors and it needs to be provided holistic support in the upcoming Union Budget, it said. "An interest subsidy of 3-4 per cent on housing loans could also be offered for a period of 3-4 years. "Extend a concessional tax rate of 15 per cent to companies that invest in green technologies on or after a specified date and also allow full deduction towards investment/ purchase of green technology assets," it added. It also recommended for the government to subsidise the usage of 6 -7 cylinders in a year to poor households; increasing collateral-free loans under CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises ) from the existing Rs 2 crore to up to Rs 5 crore. It also suggested the extension of the sunset date for newly incorporated domestic companies to commence their manufacturing till March 31, 2025. "Due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the setting up of manufacturing facilities/ production plans, regulatory approvals, resource planning, etc (which typically takes a considerable amount of time) within the sunset date of March 31, 2023, has become difficult," it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ficci-suggests-support-measures-for-housing-sector-in-budget/articleshow/88862858.cms||---

The country's national security adviser had accused neighbour India of financing, planning and carrying out the June 23 explosion outside Saeed’s house in the Johar Town neighbourhood. The anti-terrorism court handed the death sentence to Eid Gul of the banned Tahreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Peter Paul David, Sajjad Shah and Ziaullah on nine counts. Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta, who presided over the in-camera trial at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail, sentenced co-convict Ayesha Bibi to five years in jail. The prosecution presented 56 witnesses against the convicts, all of whom denied their role in the blast. According to Punjab’s counter-terrorism department, Eid Gul installed explosives in the car that was used to trigger the blast. The car belonged to David while the other three – Sajjad, Ziaullah and Ayesha – were facilitators. Saeed, chief of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), is said to be already serving a jail term in terror financing cases. His presence at the Kot Lakhpat jail, however, couldn't be confirmed. In 2020, Pakistan had sentenced Saeed to 15 years in jail in a terror-financing case, but he was never charged in connection with the Mumbai attacks. India and the US accuse him of being the brain behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed. Pakistani officials had reportedly told a Pakistani anti-terrorism court in 2012 that the terrorists who attacked and killed people in Mumbai on November 26, 2008, belonged to the Saeed-led LeT and that they had been trained at various cities in Pakistan. The key planner of the Mumbai carnage, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, was an undertrial at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, but was released on April 9, 2015, on the orders of the Lahore high court due to "lack of evidence".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-anti-terror-court-hands-death-sentence-to-4-for-blast-outside-terror-mastermind-hafiz-saeeds-house/articleshow/88862669.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

He said that Indian startups are the agents of change as well as the pillars for making India aatmanirbhar (self reliant). "Startups will help India transition from an assembly economy, particularly in the digital world, to a knowledge-based economy. In this digital age, technology has removed boundaries and barriers," Goyal said at the India Digital Summit. He added that the startups here are growing beyond geographical borders and there are a lot of opportunities for them across the world. "We are currently focusing on ease of living, ease of service and ease of skilling, re-skilling and up-skilling," he said, adding the government has taken a series of steps such as relaxation in public procurement norms, introduction of fund of funds and seed fund scheme to support the budding entrepreneurs. All these steps, he hoped, have brought simplification, facilitation and empowerment to entrepreneurs.

At the IAMAI India Digital Summit, Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma said the company is building credit as the next line of business and it has crossed the number of loans issued by one of the leading non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). "We are a payment company and payment has a derivative revenue line item in financial services driven by credit. The success of Paytm will be what we do with the monetisation led by financial services because payment is a revenue line item, which is growing and massively growing. "This quarter, we are talking about $100 million (Rs 739 crore) revenue from payments, which is a sizable revenue. That's quarterly and only for payments," Sharma said. He said that the contribution margin from the payments business is around 10 per cent. "If you add merchant services to it (revenue), that becomes $140 million and margins grow 30-40 per cent. People underestimate the size of payments revenue," Sharma said while responding to a query about concerns on a company's path to profitability. Paytm's share price on Wednesday dipped to an all-time low of Rs 1,075 apiece and closed at Rs 1,083.4 a unit, down by 3.22 per cent compared to the previous close at the BSE. Sharma shared a chart of global peers of the company which showed that their share prices have dipped in the range of 38-51 per cent in the past six months while Paytm's share prices have declined by about 26 per cent. "South American companies are over 70 per cent down," Sharma said. He said Paytm is now issuing more loans than Bajaj Finance in less than three years with an average ticket size of Rs 4,000. "We not only make a contribution profit into this line item. The partners are so happy that more and more numbers of partners are in the queue today than ever before," Sharma said. Paytm earlier this week posted over a four-fold jump in loan disbursals from its platform both in terms of numbers and value in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The company in a regulatory filing disclosed to have disbursed 44 lakh loans worth Rs 2,180 crore during the reported quarter, which was more than four times compared with 8.81 lakh loans worth Rs 470 crore disbursed from its platform a year ago. The company's gross merchandise value (GMV) more than doubled to Rs 2.5 lakh crore during the October-December 2021 period compared with Rs 1.12 lakh crore it registered in the corresponding quarter a year ago. "Our monthly transacting users (MTUs) showed consistent growth in FY 2021 and in the first two quarters of FY 2022. "The trajectory has continued in the third quarter of FY 2022 with 64.4 million average MTUs, growth of 37 per cent y-o-y over the 47.1 million average MTUs in the third quarter of FY 2021," Paytm said in the filing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytms-payments-revenue-expected-to-be-at-140-million-in-march-quarter-growing-50-60-y-o-y-sharma/articleshow/88863024.cms||---

The valuation of CEL has been done by two different sets of advisors -- transaction advisor and asset valuer as per prescribed valuation methodologies, said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is running the privatisation process along with DSIR. Of many allegations made by the CEL employees union, one relates against the general disinvestment policy of the government. Another relates to the absence of sectoral experience criteria in the EoI. Under-valuation and inter-relatedness of bidders are some other allegations. Also, the land lease of CEL is for 90 years of which 46 years have already gone. "The inter-ministerial group is examining certain allegations such as legal veracity of alleged inter-relatedness of bidders and pending this examination, the Letter of Intent of CEL has been put on hold," Pandey said. The government had in November approved the sale of CEL, under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), to Nandal Finance and Leasing for Rs 210 crore after a long drawn out open, competitive, bidding process. The transaction was scheduled to be completed by March 2022. The CEL employee association had approached the Delhi High Court against the privatisation much before the government's announcement in November. The case is not yet disposed of, but the employees association have also added additional allegations in that case. Separately, Opposition Congress also last month alleged that the company is being undervalued. "There are many allegations, which are either half-truths or factually incorrect. For example, on land value, the allegations hide the fact that land is not freehold land but a leasehold land of which 46 years have already elapsed and only 44 years of residual tenure is left. “Also as per Asset valuation methodology, various liabilities are to be deducted before arriving at Net Asset Value (equity). They are not deducting liabilities while quoting at their imaginary valuation numbers without any basis. Government has done CEL's valuation by both the transaction advisor and asset valuer using different valuation methodologies and then arrived at the reserve price," he said. The value of equity of CEL (net worth) in its balance sheet available in the public domain as of March 31, 2021, is Rs 111 crore as against the reserve price of Rs 194 crore set by the government for privatisation. The highest bid received for CEL is Rs 210 crore. Incorporated in 1974, CEL, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, is a pioneer in the field of Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) and it has developed the technology with its own R&D efforts. It has also developed axle counter systems that are being used in Railway signalling systems for the safe running of trains. The government had issued a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) on February 3, 2020, for CEL sale, following which three preliminary bids were received. Later, two companies -- Nandal Finance and Leasing Pvt Ltd and JPM Industries Ltd -- put in financial bids by October 12, 2021. While Nandal Finance and Leasing Pvt Ltd bid for Rs 210 crore, JPM Industries Ltd bid stood at Rs 190 crore. The bid by Nandal Finance was higher than the 'Reserve Price' of Rs 194 crore set by the government based on the valuations by the transaction adviser and asset valuer. This is the second time that the government had initiated the sale process of CEL after the Cabinet on October 27, 2016, approved its strategic sale. In the first attempt, although 6 preliminary bids were received, no financial bids came. The CEL sale process restarted in February 2020 and finally, two companies put financial bids in October 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/letter-of-intent-on-cel-privatisation-put-on-hold/articleshow/88863082.cms||---

With the recognition, CDSL Ventures will be able to issue accreditation certificates to "accredited investors". CDSL Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of depository CDSL. The recognition to CDSL Ventures has been granted for a period of three years with effect from February 1, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in statement. The renewal of the recognition would be subject to satisfactory performance by CDSL Ventures, it added. The procedure for accreditation of an investor and verification of accreditation status of an investor by investment providers -- Alternative Investment Funds, Portfolio Managers and, Investment Advisers -- and other modalities will be displayed on the website of CDSL Ventures and Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), Sebi said. In August last year, the regulator had notified norms for introducing framework for accredited investors in the Indian securities market. It also came out with modalities for implementation of the framework for such investors. Under the norms, a person will be identified as an accredited investor on the basis of net worth or income. Individuals, HUFs, family trusts, sole proprietorships, partnership firms, trusts and body corporates can get accreditation based on financial parameters specified by the regulator. Accreditation agency will be responsible for verification of documents submitted by applicants, timely processing of applications and issuance of accreditation certificate, maintaining data of accredited investors and verification of accreditation status.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-grants-recognition-to-cdsl-ventures-as-accreditation-agency/articleshow/88863092.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Restaurants should be allowed to stay open beyond 10 pm: Mumbai eateries||Keeping in mind the steep rise in cases of COVID and the spread of Omicron, the Maharashtra government has imposed a few restrictions in the state, with effect from January 10, 2022. Restaurants and eateries that were open till midnight, are now allowed to operate till 10 pm with 50 per cent capacity. The authorities have also directed them to display the number of people inside on a board. Restaurant owners are unhappy with the 10 pm deadline and say this will hamper their business, which anyway has taken a hit in the last few weeks owing to the growing number of cases in the city. ‘The new rule defiles logic’ Restaurant owners feel that with the 10 pm rule back, it will hinder the staggered seating that they had been following. “While we fully understand the need for capacity restrictions during a surge in Covid cases, reducing operating hours for restaurants defies logic. Extended timings allows for staggered seating and helps to avoid clustering,” says Rachel Goenka, who is the Founder and CEO of a chain of many popular restaurants across Mumbai.  Other restaurateurs agree. “If you are asking for 50 per cent capacity, which is actually debatable and has lots of grey area, then sticking to the original designated deadline is a necessity and makes best sense. That will help the restaurant and the patrons, because then, I don’t have to sit with a person who is waiting outside. 10 pm deadline means people rushing in at that similar time just to get inside the eateries. If the timing is extended then it will be easier to follow the social distancing rules because there will be no crowding,” says restaurateur Amrish Arora. Footfall in restaurants have decreased drastically Over 35 percent of the hotels and restaurants have closed down in just the last two years. There are some restaurant and bar owners in the city who feel that the fact that they are getting to remain open till 10 at night is better than completely stopping dining in the city. “We see the 10 PM curfew as a more appetising alternative to the total cessation of indoor dining," says Shaan Jaiswal, owner of a sports bar in Andheri East. With the current rise in cases, fear is high right now among the common man, and city roads and eateries are much emptier than regular. He adds, “Since we are more of a neighbourhood place where people enjoy on a regular basis and not occasional dining, we believe even a slow down or reduced operations timings for us would make us suffer to a greater extent.” Pradeep Shetty Sr. Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), explains, “This wave has rendered restaurants locked in even without a literal lockdown as the hotels and restaurants are deserted this year. The industry will be permanently debilitated if urgent relief measures are not forthcoming.” ‘Timing restrictions will have a devastating impact on revenues’ Restaurant associations say that while they stand behind the Govt and support the fight against Covid without reservations, the hospitality industry will not be able to fend the challenge off on its own. They have been operating under various restrictions, be it in terms of timing or capacity, since the pandemic started in March 2020. “The impact of lockdown measures and restrictions considered in totality, amount to loss of business to the tune of 80 percent,” says Pradeep.  “Hotels and restaurants had just started to return to normalcy after about 15 months of restricted operations. After the two successive lockdowns, hotels and restaurants have infused significant capital to reopen and restart operations. Presently there is considerable fear and anxiety in the sector. The effects of the new Covid wave will debilitate the hospitality industry,” he says.  Rachel adds, “Restaurants are reeling from the impact of lockdowns and timing restrictions will have a devastating impact on revenues.” WHAT RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR: Restaurant associations in the city feel that the restaurant owners have done a lot to bring back workers after the initial lockdown was lifted. “There has been a lot of effort put in to bring back workers. Repayment of loans taken to restart operations after the lockdowns is another major area of concern. We request the state Govt. to allow us to operate at least till 11 pm. The State Govt. will have to support us this time around if a disaster is to be averted. It should immediately come out with a direct salary transfer scheme for hospitality employees in addition to waiving off all statutory fees, taxes and utility bills. It is also imperative upon the Govt to come up with a credit extension scheme or some kind of moratorium to protect the owners and operators from credit defaults owing to the third wave,” says Pradeep.  Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR, adds, “We request the government to support us till normalcy is restored. The Government was successful to quell it to a large extent last time and I am sure they will do it again.” At a glance: Allow restaurants to operate at least till 11 pm A direct salary transfer scheme for hospitality employees Waiving off all statutory fees, taxes and utility bills Credit extension scheme or some kind of moratorium to protect the owners and operators from credit defaults||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/restaurants-should-be-allowed-to-stay-open-beyond-10-pm-mumbai-eateries/articleshow/88862583.cms||Debarati S Sen

With numbers from Tripura yet to come, Wednesday had already seen 2,46,443 new infections. The final count is likely to exceed 2.47 lakh. The previous highest increase in cases in a single day was a jump of 43,196 recorded on April 27, 2021, when the second wave was nearing its peak. The day also saw 203 deaths (excluding Tripura) reported from across the country, the daily toll having crossed the 200 mark for the first time since October 27. Daily cases have been rising at an alarming rate. Except for Monday, when cases saw a decline, Wednesday was the 15th day since December 28 when daily cases have seen a double-digit growth. Compared to Tuesday, Wednesday saw a 26.1% rise in fresh cases. Read AlsoCovid-19: Daily cases rise 17% but 7-day deaths soar 70%Covid-19 infections continued to surge in the country at a slightly slower rate than seen last week, with over 1.9 lakh fresh cases reported on Tuesday, up 17% from the previous day's tally. Deaths from the virus, although still very low overall, were rising at a faster rate with each passing day.Despite the steady growth in the daily count, deaths are at a much lower level than the figures reported during the second wave. During the second wave, cases crossed 2 lakh for the first time on April 14. That day had seen 896 deaths. However, deaths have been rising steadily over the past few days, with the cumulative toll in the last seven days 81% higher than that in the preceding week. Comparable international data shows that once again India is among the world’s worst-hit countries in the ongoing surge in global cases.

If Yogi contests, he would be the first CM in 15 years to have directly contested the assembly elections. Neither Mayawati, who was the CM from 2007 to 2012, nor Akhilesh, who was in office from 2012 to 2017, contested assembly elections. Both chose the upper house. Yogi, too -- who was an MP when anointed in 2017 -- didn't contest assembly election and chose to be a member of the legislative council. As per the Constitution, the CM of a state has to be a member of either the legislative assembly or the council, if it exists in that state. This time, too, Mayawati will not contest while there is no clarity over Akhilesh's decision. He has left the decision on his party. Ayodhya had been in the focus of Yogi ever since he took over. Even when the title dispute was pending before the Supreme Court, he left no stone unturned to develop infrastructure in Ayodhya in a bid to promote religious tourism. From road widening to beautification of ghats, he made all efforts to develop the temple town.

Neither Mayawati, who was the CM from 2007 to 2012, nor Akhilesh, who was in office from 2012 to 2017, contested assembly elections. Both chose the upper house. Yogi, too -- who was an MP when anointed in 2017 -- didn't contest assembly election and chose to be a member of the legislative council. As per the Constitution, the CM of a state has to be a member of either the legislative assembly or the council, if it exists in that state. This time, too, Mayawati will not contest while there is no clarity over Akhilesh's decision. He has left the decision on his party. Ayodhya had been in the focus of Yogi ever since he took over. Even when the title dispute was pending before the Supreme Court, he left no stone unturned to develop infrastructure in Ayodhya in a bid to promote religious tourism. From road widening to beautification of ghats, he made all efforts to develop the temple town. He even changed the name of the district from Faizabad to Ayodhya.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-elections-2022-yogi-adityanath-may-fight-from-ayodhya-or-his-home-turf-gorakhpur/articleshow/88863370.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Kolkata||Kolkata has my heart in a way no other city ever has or ever will: Nandana Dev Sen||Nandana Dev Sen is in Kolkata at a time when the city, and its neighbouring districts, are reeling under the impact of the third COVID wave. But for the actor-author-activist, this is a homecoming worth the long, long wait and anguish. While her mother Nabaneeta Dev Sen’s birth anniversary today is an occasion for her to revisit her intense and impactful poems about love, loss, longing and identity, this visit has also taken her to the Sunderbans, where she is working with children orphaned by the pandemic and cyclones. In a freewheeling chat with CT, Nandana talks about some of the most difficult and delightful memories of her wonder years, and her exceptional bond with Kolkata. Excerpts: Tell us a bit about your work for child protection, and what takes you to the Sunderbans.I am spearheading a programme with a child rights’ NGO to protect the most vulnerable children of my beloved Bengal, orphaned by COVID and the cyclones. We had started with a plan to take care of 200 orphans and needed `72 lakh to protect them for a year until we were able to place them in a safe environment. I was touched by the incredibly strong response to this initiative, because of which we crossed `1 crore and raised over `50 lakh more. As a result, 315 kids can be now supported through this programme, thanks to the generosity of many organisations and individuals. I have just come back from spending two wonderful days in the Sunderbans, playing with the most resilient children, reading aloud to them, speaking with youth leaders, consulting with the affected families and the gram panchayats. In the three decades of my work as an activist for child protection, I have always worked on the ground, so it is great to be back at the grassroots level once again, after this enforced period of long-distance advocacy. Your trip to Kolkata this time is also to celebrate your mother’s Bengali poems, some of which you have translated. You have talked about how “Nabaneeta in her prose could laugh at herself; whereas in her poetry she was unafraid to cry.” Could you elaborate on this aspect of Nabaneeta’s writing?My mother had left Kolkata as an incredibly glamorous person, a brilliant student on her way to Harvard, engaged to someone on the brink of becoming a star. She was the darling of Kolkata; her parents were super celebrities, literary luminaries close to Tagore. (Both my parents were in fact named by Rabindranath.) Ma had already published a celebrated book of poems, she was also a visual artist who had a lot of admirers, When she came back a few years later, with two young children and a marriage that was disintegrating, she tried to put the pieces of her life together. It was a scandal – even in her circle of liberal, openly radical, progressive friends, no one really knew anyone who was divorced. Upon her return, poetry took an even more central and visceral place in her life. While in her prose, Ma found a way – through irreverent honesty and self deprecation – to make fun of the truth of her life. In her poetry she did not wish to be clever like she was in her prose. Poetry was the most intimate work she ever created – it was a reflection of her deepest emotions. There was no artifice in it, no distancing through humour, it was very raw... and that’s the only way she could write poetry. She stopped publishing poetry for a short while, even though she continued to write it, as she felt it was “giving her away”. Because of this combination of her identity as a daughter of celebrity poets, a sparkling talent and a fascinating young woman, there was a lot of curiosity about her. But the moment she started talking about her personal life in her poetry, it was up for grabs in terms of what questions people wanted her to answer. My mother expresses that in a heartbreakingly lyrical way in the last poem — Return of the Dead (Acrobat). What she went through is what a lot of women in the public eye, across the world, have always confronted, when all their choices are judged upon. If you’re an artist, what you choose to paint about gets dissected. If you’re Hillary Clinton, you get criticised for your hair or shoes. It is about how, as women, our personal choices – as significant or insignificant as they may be – somehow get appropriated as fairplay for public discourse. What was it like to grow up in this kind of environment?I remember when I was in school we heard ridiculous stories about how our mother was to blame for this famous marriage falling apart. Those were not true of course, and she laughed them all off without any trace of bitterness. But what I admire about my mother is that as a writer, she never stopped being true to her feelings, or changed the way she wrote just because people were judgmental or uncomfortable with her poetry. Homecoming for my mother was not only about coming back to the house where she was born, Bhalobashar Bari. But it was also a very deliberate return to her mother tongue. Ma chose to write all her creative work in Bangla, while she continued her academic work as a scholar in English. Once back in Kolkata she committed to writing all her poetry and fiction in Bengali. She was intensely aware of the dynamics of the consequences of that choice, but she established herself again quickly as a formidable literary figure by being uncompromising in the emotional honesty with which she wrote both her prose and her poetry. In the process, she became an inspiration to a generation – as a mentor, a teacher, a language activist, a feminist writer for all ages, a beloved role-model. We had a privileged childhood in so many ways... There was this joy and freedom of growing up in a family of female writers, who were so obsessed with writing that we took it for granted as what everyone in the family was meant to do. And I was addicted to reading. In sheer quantity, I think I read more books in my childhood and early adulthood than ever since. And we wrote to each other all the time, even under the same roof -- letters and poetry for birthdays and other occasions kept flying between us. My mother was someone who could make up rhymes at any time for anything at all. How has your bond with Kolkata changed over time? It is not the same city of your adolescence anymore.My connection with Kolkata is deep and visceral, like an umbilical cord that was never cut. I love NYC, Boston and Mumbai – all wonderful cities where I have lived and worked, but Kolkata has my heart in a way no other city ever has or ever will. My home here is close to my mother’s place – we call it Chotto Bhalobasha. I have furnished it in the old fashioned style Ma loved, to resemble Bhalobasha Bari. Ma lived here with me for a while when she was ill. It allows us to feel close to my mother yet it is independently ours as well. Ma passed away just before the pandemic hit the world, and after that, I came to Kolkata twice – once for Ma’s birthday two years ago, when my father gave a tribute in her honour, and once for the Nabaneeta Dev Sen Memorial Lecture on Children’s Literature that I was invited to give in boi mela in February 2020. This is the longest I’ve ever been away from Kolkata, so it’s good to be back. But everything feels absolutely different without Ma. I miss her every minute. Now that you are juggling multiple roles – that of an editor, writer, translator, activist and mother – there are fans who would love to see you back on the big screen, or perhaps do something on the OTT platform. What has kept you away from films for so long? Do you have plans to get back to films in the near future?Cinema is an abiding love for me, and I’m absolutely sure I will return to it one day. My choice in films has always been esoteric and political, which often took me to faraway places (such as South Africa, to shoot a film on apartheid). So, I made a conscious decision to take a break from filming when I chose to become a mother, as I wanted to settle in one place and fully focus on my daughter, and my books. A favourite filmmaker of mine – one with whom I've loved working before – recently asked me to work with him on an extraordinary film that resonates with me on many levels. I’d love to take it up when the time is right. Everything is on hold right now because of the pandemic. Nandana on growing up in Bhalobasha bari It was a unique, all-female family with Ma, dimma (poet Radharani Debi), didi and me – and lots of free-spirited cats that sauntered in and out of Bhalobasha bari. It was extraordinary for all of us to come back to the house in which Ma was born. Bhalobasha bari had held a central place within the intellectual and artistic circle in Kolkata under my dimma and dadu – with literary soirees and kobi sammelans, impromptu concerts and dance performances. In many ways we felt the warm embrace of an exuberant homecoming when we came here. Because of Ma’s love for life, there were spontaneous gatherings at Bhalobasha bari all through the year. Baul gaan with Purna Das Baul, kobitar ashor by the Krittibas group, Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay and many others... The time I spent in Kolkata – mid ’70s to mid ’80s – made for the most formative, critical and precious years of my life – way more than my early childhood spent in England and Boston. Kolkata had this culture of adda and argumentation, which I loved. Everything that came out of the city then – songs, music, drama, theatre – was steeped in a very strong political consciousness, which was also wonderful. Along with songs by Tagore, Nazrul and Sukanto, I loved the IPTA songs. We debated over music, books, art, cinema, politics, food, and global affairs. We would save up for boi mela and eagerly wait for it each year. Youngsters grow up with a different political sensibility these days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-has-my-heart-in-a-way-no-other-city-ever-has-or-ever-will-nandana-dev-sen/articleshow/88861461.cms||Chandrima Pal

The images and analysis by the US data analytics firm HawkEye 360, which uses satellites to gather intelligence on ground-level activities, and vetted by two other experts, provide a detailed look into China’s recent construction along its frontier with Bhutan. Construction-related activity in areas along Bhutan’s border has been under way since 2020, with China initially building tracks and clearing out areas, based on material provided by satellite imagery firms Capella Space and Planet Labs, said Chris Biggers, the mission applications director at HawkEye 360.

Smaller structures were erected - possibly to house equipment and supplies - followed by the laying of foundations and then the construction of buildings, Biggers said. "To me, 2021 was the period for acceleration," Biggers said. Two other experts who studied the locations of the new construction and recent satellite images taken by Capella Space said all six settlements appear to be in territory disputed by China and Bhutan - including a contested tract of roughly 110 square kilometres - with little in the way of resources or native population. "It is Bhutan's policy not to talk about boundary issues in the public," Bhutan's foreign ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. The ministry declined to comment further. China's foreign ministry said the construction is "entirely for the improvement of the working and living conditions of the local people."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-steps-up-construction-on-bhutan-border-show-sat-data/articleshow/88863733.cms||---

In a letter to McCarthy released publicly, the House of Representatives Select Committee said it was requesting his testimony on a range of topics, including his conversations with the former president before, during and after the attack. The committee is also investigating whether Trump suggested to McCarthy what he should say publicly and to investigators about their conversations on the day of the attack, according to the letter. McCarthy and Trump met on Jan. 28, 2021, in Palm Beach, Florida. The panel had previously asked another Trump ally in Congress, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, to disclose conversations he had with Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. Jordan said on Sunday he would not cooperate with the committee's investigating, calling it illegitimate. Two Republicans, Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are members of the committee. The Select Committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, has said the panel is looking into whether it has the authority to issue subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to force their cooperation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-panel-seeks-testimony-from-republican-leader-mccarthy-about-january-6-attack/articleshow/88863910.cms||---

Meanwhile, the BMC has decided that unlike the first and second waves where positivity was the benchmark to impose a lockdown or restrictions, in the third wave further curbs would be imposed only if there is a burden of high hospitalisation rate and steep rise in oxygen usage. Read AlsoIn Omicron wave, patients having shorter hospital stay of 3-4 days: BMCDoctors are witnessing a shorter duration of hospital stay among Covid patients in the current Omicron wave.“Ninety-six per cent of the patients who are admitted on oxygen beds in 186 hospitals of Mumbai are unvaccinated. Otherwise, we have seen so far that vaccinated people are not reaching ICUs. We have 21 lakh vaccine stock available with us. The current hurdle in ensuring the entire adult population is vaccinated is the 84-day gap required between the two doses. Today, too, our vaccination percentage is the best in India,” Chahal said in a TV interview. He said people should not think of the Omicron as a flu, adding if unvaccinated it definitely can take an infected person to the ICU.

Chahal also reiterated further restrictions would be imposed in the third wave only if there is a burden of hospitalisations and oxygen use increases steeply. On Covid-related deaths, Chahal said they were in control with 19 deaths in the past 16 days. “Even though Mumbai has one lakh active cases as on date, only 10 tonne of oxygen is being used.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/96-of-those-needing-o2-beds-unvaccinated-mumbai-civic-body-chief/articleshow/88864040.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Amritsar||Separated by Partition, brothers reunite in Kartarpur after 74 years||AMRITSAR: It was a showstopper — both time and a flock of pilgrims stood still for a while to soak up the scene of two turbaned old men pat each other’s backs in a joyous embrace against the backdrop of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan on Wednesday. The significance of that hug was not lost on anyone. It was the reunion of two octogenarian brothers separated by Partition, 74 years ago. “Mil ta gaye... (We met after all),” cried out aloud one of the brothers in a beige turban. The two are Muhammad Habib aka Shaila from India and Muhammad Siddiq, 80, of Faislabad in Pakistan. With social media as a helpmate, Habib’s family located his long-lost brother and arranged a get-together when the Kartarpur Corridor opened for Indian pilgrims to visit the Sikh shrine of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, 4.7km inside Pakistan from the border in Punjab. Habib told his brother he didn’t marry and devoted his life to care for their mother. Theirs wasn’t the only reunion. Sunita Devi of Ajowal in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district crossed the border with five from her family to meet relatives in Pakistan. When Partition scythed through the land, her father chose to stay behind, while his brothers migrated to Faisalabad. And then, there were online friends too. Amritsar’s Jatinder Singh took the corridor to pray and love. He met his Facebook girlfriend, a postgraduate student in Lahore’s Punjab University. Manjit Kaur of Haryana went down that road too: to meet Facebook friend Awais Mukhtar of Pakistan. Both were, however, sent back by Pakistan Rangers as the “couples were found moving around in a suspicious manner” at the shrine. The reunion scene was overwhelming for officials too. “I was with my staff at Kartapur shrine on a routine visit and we were bowled over by the sight of people embracing and crying,” said Muhammad Latif, CEO of Project Management Unit, a Pakistani government agency that oversees Kartarpur’s upkeep. He said more Indian pilgrims should visit the shrine. “Only 153 devotees came to Pakistan on Tuesday, though we have arranged for 5,000 a day.” Watch Viral: Separated 74 years ago, the Kartarpur Sahib corridor sees brothers reunite||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/separated-by-partition-brothers-reunite-in-kartarpur-after-74-years/articleshow/88863848.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||India||UP polls 2022: After SP Maurya, minister Dara Singh Chauhan quits Yogi cabinet, but mum on BJP||LUCKNOW: In a second pre-poll jolt to BJP in as many days, UP cabinet minister Dara Singh Chauhan on Wednesday followed his former ministerial colleague Swami Prasad Maurya out of the Yogi Adityanath government after accusing it of “tampering” with the reservation rights of Dalits and backwards. Both Chauhan and Maurya had defected to BJP from Mayawati’s BSP in 2015. Chauhan, who held the environment and forest portfolio, said in his resignation to governor Anandiben Patel that the BJP government’s alleged apathy towards Dalits and backwards forced his hand. Speculation was rife about his possible exit from the cabinet since Maurya’s resignation on Tuesday. While Chauhan did not say if he had quit BJP as well, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav lost no time in tweeting an undated picture of him with Chauhan, calling him a “crusader for social justice”. “Chauhan ji ka SP mein sasamman hardik swagat evam abhinandan...(Welcome Chauhan ji to SP with honour),” Akhilesh wrote, signing off with the hashtag “#Mela Hobe” in an ode to Mamata Banerjee’s viral “Khela Hobe” chant during the Bengal elections last year. Deputy CM Keshav Maurya, too, took to Twitter in a bid to stem what ex-minister Swami Prasad Maurya had predicted would be an exodus from BJP leading up to the polls. “It pains to see a family member getting misguided. All I can say to the honourable partymen (is) not to ride a sinking boat,” he wrote, also requesting Chauhan to “reconsider” his decision. Chauhan is from the Nonia-Rajput or Lunia sub-caste, categorised as one of the state’s Most Backward Castes (MBCs) and an important electoral cog for parties in the east UP region. His exit from the cabinet and the possible induction into SP could hit BJP’s attempt to consolidate the MBCs that have played a key role in its victory run in the state since 2014. The Nonia community is majorly concentrated in and around the districts of Ghazipur, Mau, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Pratapgarh. Chauhan was elected from the Madhuban assembly seat in Mau for the first time on a BJP ticket in 2017. As a BSP member prior to that, he had been elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1996. He switched to SP in 2000 and got another Rajya Sabha term till 2006 before returning to BSP ahead of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. He got a BSP ticket to contest the Ghosi seat, which he won by defeating Arshad Ansari. Chauhan’s political fortunes received a setback in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where he was defeated by BJP's Harinarayan Rajbhar. The very next year, he joined BJP in the presence of party president Amit Shah. In the 2019 general elections, BJP failed to retain the Ghosi seat as its candidate Harinarayan lost to the SP-backed BSP candidate Atul Kumar Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-polls-2022-after-sp-maurya-minister-dara-singh-chauhan-quits-yogi-cabinet-but-mum-on-bjp/articleshow/88864176.cms||Pankaj Shah

On December 5, Saina tweeted raising concerns about PM Narendra Modi's security breach in Punjab. "No nation can claim itself to be safe if the security of its own PM gets compromised. I condemn, in the strongest words possible, the cowardly attack on PM Modi by anarchists," tweeted Saina. Siddharth's ‘derogatory' reply to the Olympic bronze medallist's tweet on Modi's security breach triggered a controversy. On Wednesday, a social activist lodged a complaint with cybercrime police against Siddharth, alleging that the actor's comment against Saina was derogatory in nature. "Social activist Prerna lodged a complaint with us alleging that the comment of Siddharth against Saina Nehwal was misogynistic and offensive in nature. Based on her complaint, we have registered a case under section 67 of the IT Act and 509 of the IPC," cybercrime ACP KVM Prasad said. Taking congnizance of the actor's tweet, the National Commission for Women (NCW) said: "The comment is misogynist and outrageous to the modesty of a woman amounting to disrespect and insult to dignity of women on social media platforms." The NCW had also asked Twitter India to immediately block the actor's account. Siddharth on the other hand apologised to Saina on Tuesday night tweeting: "I want to apologise to you for my rude joke that I wrote as a response to a tweet of yours, a few days ago. I may disagree with you on many things but even my disappointment or anger when I read your tweet, can't justify my tone and words. I know I have more grace in me than that. I However must insist my word play and humour had none of the malicious intent that so many people from all quarters have attributed to it. I am a staunch feminist ally and I assure you there was no gender implied in my tweet and certainly no intent to attack you as a woman. I hope we can put this behind us and that you will accept my letter. You will always be my champion." Saina said she was glad that the actor acknowledged his mistake.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/case-against-actor-siddharth-for-saina-tweet/articleshow/88864263.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Red sanders back on IUCN Red List of endangered species||HYDERABAD: Red sanders, the most-smuggled wood in the country, is back on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of endangered species. It was declared near-threatened species in 2018 and has now been added back to the endangered species red list of IUCN 2021 released recently. Red Sanders is endemic to Rayalaseema in Andhra Pradesh and, according to IUCN, there has been about 50-80% decline in its numbers. "Despite intense harvest of the species since the 16th century it has mostly retained in this geographic range. However, over time it has experienced a severe decline. This is due to the continual illegal harvest driven by demand for its attractive wood and the high-value products made from it," he IUCN stated. "The over-harvest of the species has left the population structure skewed, with trees of harvestable size and maturity being scarce and making up less than 5% of the trees in the wild," the IUCN added. Raising a red flag over its felling, the IUCN, said, "The species is theoretically banned from international trade, being listed under Appendix II of CITES, while its harvest is restricted at state level through legislation. However, there is still an illegal harvest and trade of the species to meet global demand. This is evidenced by the large volume of timber and red sanders products seized by authorities at all stages of the illegal supply chain. The decline in the mature population size and limited regeneration potential and a reduced seed set can contribute to genetic erosion in the future." It further said, "Pressure on the wild population leaves no time for the species to recover naturally, which is exacerbated by its slow growth rate. It is at further risk from anthropogenic habitat loss caused by local cattle grazing and use of the forest for local timber and fuelwood. Trees may also be outcompeted by invasive species and diseases. All these threats culminate in a dwindling wild population and, therefore, it is suspected that over the last three generations the species has experienced a population decline of 50% to 80%. It is assessed as endangered." Urging for physical deterrents and need for more patrols in Andhra Pradesh, IUCN said, "These conservation efforts should remain in place and strengthened to reduce smuggling further. The cultivation of the species in plantations should be promoted and needs monitoring so as to be able to better support the legal trade as well. Also, opportunities to increase the harvest and trade of cultivated stock should be investigated to relieve some of the pressure on the wild red sanders population."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/red-sanders-back-on-iucn-red-list-of-endangered-species/articleshow/88864267.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

More shockingly, sources in the education department said that for the financial year 2020-21, the education department did not send the proposal for these funds to the state finance department altogether. Grant-in-aid schools receive staff salaries from the state and grants to meet a part of their expenditure. The remainder is met by fees from students, the amount for which is also fixed by the state government. In April 2019, the Gujarat government decided to provide free school education up to the higher secondary level to the girls of the state and undertook to pay the fees on behalf of girls enrolled at grant-in-aid schools. These schools were told to stop collecting fees from their girl students, and supply details of enrolment and fees for the government to reimburse, through a government resolution (GR) dated April 24, 2019. However, schools have not received reimbursement for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 from the state government, leaving them with a shortfall and struggling to manage their finances in the pandemic years. Jyotindra Dave, managing trustee of JN Balika Vidyalaya in Saraspur, said fees totalling Rs 15 lakh for girls at their two schools have not been paid yet. "Our trust is facing many difficulties in operations due to this. Representations have been made at many places, including the education department but the result has been zero," Dave said. Their trust, Saraswat Vidya Mandal (SVM), was founded in 1944. It is mainly run by former students who volunteer. It currently educates nearly 5,000 students, mainly from the weaker sections of society. It has 800 girl students enrolled in two schools it runs -- JN Balika Vidyalaya in Saraspur and Asarwa Vidyalaya. "We have regularly been providing all necessary details to the state education department. This shortfall adds significantly to the institution's Covid-19 related financial difficulties, from non-receipt of fees and the 25% reduction in fees mandated by the government. This callous attitude on the part of the Gujarat government is bound to discourage serious, well-run, not-for-profit institutions and the selfless citizens who manage them," Jyotindra Dave, managing trustee of JN Balika Vidyalaya in Saraspur said. Gujarat State School Management Association president Bhaskar Patel said, "Some 1,600 grant-in-aid schools receive part of their funds in the form of reimbursement for girls' fees. None have got these funds from the government for two years. The total amount outstanding is between Rs 45 and Rs 50 crore. Our association has made representations at all levels, including to the chief minister, but they have yielded no results. Education minister Jitu Vaghani said, "These funds are paid out as part of a central government scheme, and we will release this soon after certain discussions with the department of social justice and empowerment. Efforts will be made in the current year and the cycle for payment will be accelerated." Primary and secondary education secretary Vinod Rao did not respond to requests for his comments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/guj-fails-to-reimburse-schools-for-girls-fee-waiver-in-pandemic-yrs/articleshow/88864272.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The notice stated that the traders would have to seek permission and register with MCG for continuing with the LED displays outside their shops. Reacting to this, traders said that markets and malls have been facing low turnouts due to a spurt in Covid cases, and the MCG is now adding to their stress by levying “unjustified” charges.However, according to the MCG, its officials would be collecting the registration fees for signages outside shops following the Haryana Municipal Corporation Advertisement By-laws, 2018. The traders, officials said, should not have any problem making a one-time deposit.Traders stress that their shops and the malls came into existence much before the MCG existed. "An LED signage outside a store is the identity of a business. The MCG has now suddenly served us notices and told us to pay the registration fee for these signages. Already, we are staring at losses. The turnout in our shops has again dropped due to a rise in Covid cases. We now have to remove the signage or pay the registration fee within three days. It is unfair for a trader, who is already under immense stress due to Covid,” said Sharad Goyal, a trader based in City Centre Mall.Another trader Krishan Kumar said, “For the shops in the malls, it is an additional financial burden since they are paying hefty maintenance charges to the malls. I fail to understand that when we are already paying to the mall, why is the MCG putting pressure on us to pay an additional amount?”However, the MCG has defended its decision. “If the dimension of an LED display board or signage put up by a trader outside the shop exceeds 2% of the outer façade of the shop, the trader will have to take permission from the MCG and pay the registration fee of Rs 10,000. It is a one-time registration fee, which is valid for six years, according to the provisions of the advertisement by-laws," said Madhusmita Moitra, MCG chief town planner. She is also the MCG nodal officer of advertisements.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/registration-fees-for-led-signage-unjustified-traders/articleshow/88864291.cms||Vishakha Chaman

During the drive, six under-construction houses, 25 other structures, five boundary walls and road network were razed, he said. “These colonies were in initial stage and on the basis of complaints, the department served notices and when the developers failed to furnish satisfactory reply, the colonies were razed,” he added.On Tuesday, the team carried out demolition drive at three locations and razed nine illegal colonies on 36 acre land. “A two acre colony in Pawala Khusurpur, two colonies on four-acre in Chandu and six colonies on 30-acre land in Farukhnagar were razed,” said Batth and added the team razed 10 under-construction houses, 200 other structures, four shops, dealer office and road network.Batth said the colonies were being developed without any permission from the concerned department in violation of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act 1975. He said the violation of Act is a punishable offence with imprisonment up to 3 years, therefore, the department will soon register police complaint against the offenders. We will also write to police to stop the development of unauthorized colony being done by the offenders and other offenders whose name gets associated with the offence, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/dtcp-razes-250-structures-in-14-colonies-frees-46-acres/articleshow/88864292.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

People, especially the migrant workers, are advised to take precautions but not panic and believe in rumours,” said deputy commissioner Yash Garg.On reports that migrant workers have started heading towards their hometowns fearing another Covid-19 lockdown, he said, “These rumours are baseless. We have found that the production units and industries are runn-ing regularly in the district and the workers are not going anywhere.”The announcement comes after the state government debunked the reports regarding the migration of daily wagers from the state due to unavailability of work because of the Omicron-led third wave of Covid-19, saying it’s not backed by any evidence.“After the publication of these reports, a departmental inquiry with special emphasis on the districts and the industrial establishments mentioned in the news items was conducted,” said an official government spokesperson. “The report from various industry associations and trade unions of Gurgaon has ruled out that the establishments are facing a situation of exodus of workers,” the official added.Daulatabad Industrial Area Association also confirmed that industries have been working normally and instances of workers returning to their hometowns have not come to their notice. “Industrial units are being operated regularly in his area and workers are also coming on duty. The rumours of migrant workers returning to their respective states are false and misleading,” said Association patron Vinay Gupta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/precautions-will-continue-but-no-lockdown-in-city-for-now-says-dc/articleshow/88864294.cms||---

Now, the company making the kits has fixed this issue and is sending the data of users directly to the Indian Council of Medical Research's (ICMR) portal.The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in a recent letter to all states and Union territories, had recommended the use of self-tests for symptomatic individuals. Many people are opting for these kits as these can be used for a quick check, especially because of the rush at labs due to the current surge. Earlier, not all were uploading their results on the ICMR portal, making it difficult for the health department to trace these cases and start treatment in case they suddenly need hospitalisation. “It is difficult for us to check how many kits are sold and how many are testing positive. Our teams are calling up all Covid-positive people whose reports are being uploaded on the portal to monitor their condition,” Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav said.Meanwhile, the kitmaker said they have already fixed the issue and are uploading all data onto the ICMR portal. Hasmukh Rawal, managing director and co-founder of Mylab Discovery Solutions, a leading manufacturer of home test kits, said: “We have witnessed a jump of almost 500% in sales of our self-test kit, Coviself, in the last one week across India. Our kits have a mechanism by which users have to upload a photo of their testing strips on our mobile application. Our app generates a report and directly sends it to ICMR.” He added, “Patients can claim health insurance for Covid expenses only if they produce a Covid-positive report. Hence, reporting it is beneficial for people.”People who have used the kits said the testing process is simple. “The result can be obtained only after uploading a photo of the test strip on the mobile app. I even got a call from the health department. The process is very simple. It saves time and protects one from the risk of infection from going out for a test,” said Mona Singh (34), a resident of Sector 48, who tested positive on a home kit last week and is in home isolation at present.Doctors said that these antigen kits mostly give accurate results, but an RT-PCR test is recommended in case symptomatic people test negative. “Self-test kits can be done at home but can sometimes give false positives or negatives. The problem is that there is a possibility that people who test positive aren’t self-isolating themselves or getting proper treatment,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director (pulmonology), Fortis Memorial Research Institute.Dr Shiba Kalyan Biswal, a consultant (pulmonary and sleep medicine) at Narayana Hospital, added, “Treatment is prescribed as per the symptoms and further evaluation. If a person has symptoms but tests negative, he/she is suggested to go for RT-PCR for final confirmation.”The Gurgaon chemist association said both sales and enquiries about home test kits have gone up significantly in the past week. “Sales have gone up after the rise in Covid cases. The maximum sales that we have noticed in Gurgaon are of Mylab’s kits,” said Anil Kumar, a member of the association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/home-test-kit-use-jumps-maker-says-all-data-sent-to-icmr-portal/articleshow/88864296.cms||Ipsita Pati

In the past 24 hours, it has added 2,704 new Covid cases to its tally, a spike of 13% compared to Tuesday’s 2,385 cases. The last time so many people had tested positive in a single day was during the middle of the second wave on May 12 last year, when 2,747 cases were recorded in the city. With this, the daily positivity rate has spiked from 20% to 22% on Wednesday. Gurugram also reported its second Covid death this month on Wednesday — a 66-year-old fully vaccinated man admitted to a private hospital. Doctors said the patient, who was from Sector 4, had a comorbidity of congestive heart failure. He was Covid-positive and was admitted to hospital two days ago when his heart started failing, where he was given IV fluids, antibiotics and other support. His pulse rate started dipping and he had an episode of severe hypotension (low blood pressure), which eventually led to a cardiac arrest on Wednesday. CPR was done but the patient couldn’t be revived, doctors said. On January 10, a 67-year-old fully vaccinated man died, the first Covid death reported this year. Doctors said the man, who was from Sector 43, had comorbidities such as hypertension, brain hemorrhage, heart disease, chronic liver disease and diabetes. A total of 929 people have died after testing positive for Covid so far, of whom 612 had comorbidities — 268 had diabetes, 146 had hypertension, 86 had kidney ailments and 113 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The city has 13,253 active cases at present, out of which 13,152 are in home isolation and 101 in hospitals. Only one Omicron case is active at present. The health department has sent 118 samples for genome sequencing till now this month as part of its sentinel surveillance, out of which 20 were found to have the Omicron variant. Gurugram has been sending 2% of all Covid-positive samples for genome sequencing. The health department said 1,405 patients recuperated on Sunday. “We are not witnessing any slowdown in cases. This surge will continue for some time. People are requested not to venture outside as the infection rate is very high,” chief medical officer Virender Yadav. In the wake of the surge, testing has been ramped up, he added. On Wednesday, 12,329 samples were collected for tests. “Many patients are coming in with flu-like symptoms. A majority of Covid patients have mild symptoms at present. There are still many people who are reluctant to inform the authorities if they test positive because of the isolation protocol and avoid consulting doctors,” said Dr Amitabha Ghosh, consultant (internal medicine), Manipal Hospital. Haryana, meanwhile, reported 6,883 new cases and a positivity rate of 15.6% on Wednesday. While Gurugram registered the highest new cases in the state, Faridabad was second with 1,037 cases, followed by Panchkula (734), Ambala (444) and Karnal (372). At present, the state has 31,150 active patients, of whom 25,870 are in home isolation. It carried out 46,809 tests on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/2-7k-new-cases-another-covid-death/articleshow/88864298.cms||Ipsita Pati

According to official data, Gurgaon has a 1,51,000 eligible population for Covid vaccination aged 15-17 years. The district had set a target to give first doses to all the children by January 10 but has not achieved it so far. “As the schools are not open, we have been facing some issues, calling the children for the drive. The Covid surge is also refraining people from sending their kids for vaccination. But we are vaccinating everyone who is coming to the session sites,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, as many as 1,809 people in the 15-17 age group got vaccinated. A total of 15,822 people in the 18-44 group got vaccinated. In the 45-59 age category, 1,606 people took the shots. The 60-plus category received 1,560 doses. Lastly, 740 healthcare workers and 294 frontline workers also took the jabs. The third day of the booster vaccination drive in the city went like Day 1. Only 2,026 recipients got the jabs on Wednesday, while the health department had opened 10,100 slots — 5,000 for Cowin-registered recipients and 5,100 for walk-ins — at 70 session sites.Nearly 38,000 healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities are eligible for the booster dose.

Special repairs of the 1.3km-long stretch, which will be carried out at a cost of around Rs 4.3 lakh, will involve road overlay, repair of kerbstones and taking care of any missing drain covers, as well as painting or touch-up of any other elements.Officials expect the work to take around three months to be completed. “Work hasn’t started yet because of the rains that occurred last week, but the contractor will be commencing repairs soon. We expect work to begin this month,” said a senior GMDA official. “Special repairs include work on the topmost layer of the road. It will take around three months to complete repairs of this particular stretch. It will be complete before monsoon,” the official added.The project has been in the pipeline for several months now. It was proposed during a meeting of GMDA’s core planning cell (CPC) in August. The chief executive officer had directed officials to expedite work osn the project. Tenders inviting bids were floated the same month.The matter was again taken up in a CPC meeting held last week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/revamp-of-sec-93-94-road-in-three-months-gmda/articleshow/88864301.cms||Sakshi Dayal

With this, the authority aims to assess the chances of survival of various species and undertake plantations accordingly in the future.According to officials, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is also the GMDA chairman, had at the last authority meeting emphasised on the need to better understand the survival rate of planted trees, directing officials to assess this using a scientific method at every six months.“We are already assessing the survival rate on a scientific basis, but now a decision has also been made to get third-party verification of the plantations conducted. As part of this, we will empanel an agency that will give us reports with the survival data on a quarterly basis, or in line with any other system that we devise. Based on this data, future plantations will then be planned and undertaken,” said Subhash Chander Yadav, GMDA additional chief executive officer (urban environment).Officials said the third-party verification will serve as “double confirmation” of the survival rate, since GMDA is already conducting works.“Our staff checks on the survival rate of saplings on a monthly basis when the bills of the contractors come in. We also have an application wherein we record the plantations on our different assets, including road networks, listing how many trees or shrubs were planted,” said the additional CEO.GMDA has, in the last few months, stepped up efforts to create and better maintain its green belts across the city. At the same authority meeting where Khattar had discussed the survival rate of trees, he had also recommended that the responsibility of maintaining green belts be handed over to private companies. The CM had, in addition, directed that roads be identified on a monthly basis for beautification of green belts||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/green-push-gmda-to-check-survival-rate-info-of-trees-planted-on-roads/articleshow/88864303.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Newly appointed urban local bodies (ULB) minister Kamal Gupta, who was on a surprise visit to the MCG’s Sector 34 office, had ordered the gates to the second floor, housing the engineering and accounts department, to be shut at 9.06 am, making it clear that no latecomers will be allowed inside the building. “Not even two minutes delay will be tolerated. You should start 10 minutes earlier for office and make sure to mark the attendance before 9 am and be at your seats by 9 am,” Gupta said. Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, home minister Anil Vij, Gupta also warned the staff to strictly maintain the attendance register and be punctual. While the staffers who reached late on Wednesday were later allowed into the office, the minister asked them to submit an explanation and issued an order to initiate action against them.Later in the day, during a meeting with the commissioner and joint commissioners at Civil Lines, Gupta directed the senior officers to review the work assigned to subordinate staff and initiate action against anyone who habitually kept work pending and did not adhere to the rules and regulations.Gupta, who took charge of the post two weeks back, has since had made surprise visits to Panchkula and Hisar offices before MCG. The objective, the minister said, was to strengthen the functioning and services being provided by the civic bodies. Asked about the ongoing probe on matters related to advertisements, C&D waste and others, he said all such matters would be thoroughly investigated whenever they were brought to his notice. In July last year, the unannounced visit by Vij had created a flutter at the corporation’s office as the then ULB minister had suspended two officials who were missing from the office, terminated the contract of one outsourced official for a delay in work and directed for registering of FIR against an executive engineer for irregularities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/on-surprise-visit-to-mcg-ulb-minister-locks-out-latecomers/articleshow/88864306.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

The incident took place on Tuesday night. Police said the men came in two separate cars and started abusing the store workers while ordering the items. After placing the order, they pretended as if they paying via a fake Paytm ID, which was noticed by the employees. The store manager then confronted the group of men for not paying. The accused got into a verbal abuse with the manager and when the manager didn’t give in, the men flashed a pistol at him. They then left the store and shot twice in the air before getting into the car and driving away. The Palam Vihar police has registered an FIR against three persons under sections 384 (punishment for extortion) and 25 (fraud) of the IPC and under relevant sections of the armed act as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/3-steal-items-from-store-fire-in-the-air/articleshow/88864307.cms||---
---||Faridabad||As Covid-19 cases went up, testing numbers saw a drop in 9 Haryana districts||GURUGRAM: The number of Covid cases reported in the state rose sharply in the first week of the new year from the last week of 2021, but in nine districts, testing numbers curiously fell. Among them are Rewari, Nuh, Jhajjar and Palwal, which are in the immediate neighbourhood of Gurugram, where most Covid cases in Haryana have been reported since the beginning of the current surge in December. The number of tests in Gurugram increased from 38,482 in the December 26-January 1 week to 68,439 in the January 2-8 week. The city’s share in Haryana’s overall testing too increased, from 16% (Dec 26-Jan 1) to 23% (Jan 2-8). The number of cases it reported from Dec 26-Jan 1 was 1,404. It surged to 9,386 in the week after. Faridabad, which has the second highest caseload, also upped testing, but not by as much – from 21,261 (Dec 26-Jan 1) to 24,689. The cases it reported in the corresponding period were 320 (Dec 26-Jan 1) and 2,745. But in the neighbourhood, the testing trend was divergent. Jhajjar, for instance, saw cases rise sharply too, though from a much lower base – 300 in the Jan 2-8 period compared with 20 in the previous week. However, it tested more between Dec 26 and Jan 1 (10,527) than in the subsequent week (10,194). The testing numbers in Palwal, meanwhile, fell to 7,339 (1,048 a day) in the Jan 2-8 week from 11,164 (1,594 a day) the week before. It had reported just two cases in the last week of December, which rose to 48 cases in the first week of the new year. Rewari, a district Gurugram shares borders with, carried out 10,776 tests from Jan 2-8, a drop from 11,164 in the previous week even though the weekly cases it reported jumped from 13 to 180. Weekly testing for the same period in Nuh fell from 4,820 to 3,633. It also reported very low case numbers in the corresponding period – 7 (Dec 26-Jan 1) and 58 the week after. The other districts where weekly testing numbers for the same period fell despite cases going up are Jind, Kaithal, Bhiwani, Mahendergarh and Charkhi Dadri. In some other districts, overall testing numbers remain low despite the numbers picking up in the new year from the previous week. Panchkula, for instance, reported 1,608 cases from Jan 2-8, the most after Gurugram and Faridabad. However, it carried out 13,864 tests Panchkula, which has the third highest number of active cases (1613) after Faridabad (3903), has conducted just 13,864 tests between January 2 and 8. Similarly, Ambala carried out 13,944 tests in the same period, though it reported the state’s fourth highest case numbers (1,160). According to the Haryana health department, districts with low testing numbers have been ordered to step up screenings. “Yes, there are districts which carried out very few tests and these districts have been told to ramp up testing. Haryana will conduct 50,000 tests daily,” said Rajeev Arora, ACS (health). This would mean 3.5 lakh weekly tests. In the Dec 26-Jan 1 week, the total tests done was around 2.43 lakh, which rose to around 2.86 lakh in the subsequent week. On January 12, though, the state had come close to the 50,000 mark with 46,809 tests. Health department officials said districts are being monitored daily on tests and cases. Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana and head of the department of pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS-Rohtak, said, “We are analysing the situation to ensure that all districts are conducting the desired testing to isolate patients and start treatment at the earliest.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/faridabad/as-cases-went-up-testing-nos-saw-a-drop-in-9-dists/articleshow/88866442.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Gurgaon||As Covid-19 cases went up, testing numbers saw a drop in 9 Haryana districts||GURUGRAM: The number of Covid cases reported in the state rose sharply in the first week of the new year from the last week of 2021, but in nine districts, testing numbers curiously fell. Among them are Rewari, Nuh, Jhajjar and Palwal, which are in the immediate neighbourhood of Gurugram, where most Covid cases in Haryana have been reported since the beginning of the current surge in December. The number of tests in Gurugram increased from 38,482 in the December 26-January 1 week to 68,439 in the January 2-8 week. The city’s share in Haryana’s overall testing too increased, from 16% (Dec 26-Jan 1) to 23% (Jan 2-8). The number of cases it reported from Dec 26-Jan 1 was 1,404. It surged to 9,386 in the week after. Faridabad, which has the second highest caseload, also upped testing, but not by as much – from 21,261 (Dec 26-Jan 1) to 24,689. The cases it reported in the corresponding period were 320 (Dec 26-Jan 1) and 2,745. But in the neighbourhood, the testing trend was divergent. Jhajjar, for instance, saw cases rise sharply too, though from a much lower base – 300 in the Jan 2-8 period compared with 20 in the previous week. However, it tested more between Dec 26 and Jan 1 (10,527) than in the subsequent week (10,194). The testing numbers in Palwal, meanwhile, fell to 7,339 (1,048 a day) in the Jan 2-8 week from 11,164 (1,594 a day) the week before. It had reported just two cases in the last week of December, which rose to 48 cases in the first week of the new year. Rewari, a district Gurugram shares borders with, carried out 10,776 tests from Jan 2-8, a drop from 11,164 in the previous week even though the weekly cases it reported jumped from 13 to 180. Weekly testing for the same period in Nuh fell from 4,820 to 3,633. It also reported very low case numbers in the corresponding period – 7 (Dec 26-Jan 1) and 58 the week after. The other districts where weekly testing numbers for the same period fell despite cases going up are Jind, Kaithal, Bhiwani, Mahendergarh and Charkhi Dadri. In some other districts, overall testing numbers remain low despite the numbers picking up in the new year from the previous week. Panchkula, for instance, reported 1,608 cases from Jan 2-8, the most after Gurugram and Faridabad. However, it carried out 13,864 tests Panchkula, which has the third highest number of active cases (1613) after Faridabad (3903), has conducted just 13,864 tests between January 2 and 8. Similarly, Ambala carried out 13,944 tests in the same period, though it reported the state’s fourth highest case numbers (1,160). According to the Haryana health department, districts with low testing numbers have been ordered to step up screenings. “Yes, there are districts which carried out very few tests and these districts have been told to ramp up testing. Haryana will conduct 50,000 tests daily,” said Rajeev Arora, ACS (health). This would mean 3.5 lakh weekly tests. In the Dec 26-Jan 1 week, the total tests done was around 2.43 lakh, which rose to around 2.86 lakh in the subsequent week. On January 12, though, the state had come close to the 50,000 mark with 46,809 tests. Health department officials said districts are being monitored daily on tests and cases.

---||Gurgaon||An aspirational district, but Nuh administration faces severe staff shortage||GURUGRAM: The status of the aspirational district designated by Niti Aayog notwithstanding, as many as 24 departments of the Nuh administration are running without any heads or sufficient employees. Thus, there’s a gap in service delivery and implementation of government schemes, officials have said. In Haryana, Nuh is the only district that has been identified as the aspirational district where the focus has to be on the ease of access to public services and concerted efforts of the administration to improve the services like education, health, and infrastructure. However, according to officials in the district administration, their entire work is deeply affected as departments like the women and child welfare and development and panchayats do not have any heads while many others are struggling with a critical shortage of staff. The education department may also have to function without any head as the district education officer (DEO) and the project officer of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan would be retiring at the end of this month.  Nuh deputy commissioner Shakti Singh told TOI that a letter was written to the government apprising it of the situation in the district. “Nuh is an aspirational district and concerted efforts are required to uplift the status of the district. But, we face a critical shortage of staff in this region. From healthcare to education, several departments are functioning with skeletal staff,” he said. “We are using digital tools to strike coordination between these departments and manage things, but we do need full strength to function effectively. We have had correspondence on this with the government and got an assurance from Chandigarh. Hope that all the posts will be filled soon,” he added. Officials attributed the shortage of staff to the reluctance of bureaucrats to join service in that area. “Appointing staff in Nuh has been a challenge. People see it as punishment posting and don’t want to continue. Similar is the case with the doctors and teachers,” said a senior government official. Sources in Nuh administration told TOI that while the locals are often blamed for vaccine hesitancy, the core issue lies in the lack of efforts of mass mobilisation and supervision. Departments like Anganwadi and ICDS that are entrusted with nutrition and immunisation barely has enough staff to manage documentation work. “The government should make it mandatory for all the bureaucrats to serve a fixed tenure in each district, failing which their promotion and other incentives should be held back. Hundreds of schools here are without the teachers, while thousands of young graduates are without the jobs,” said an administration official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/an-aspirational-dist-but-nuh-admin-faces-severe-staff-shortage/articleshow/88864311.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: One dies as car crashes into parked truck at Atlas Chowk||GURUGRAM: A 27-year-old man died on the spot after his car rammed into a pickup truck that was parked near a divider at Atlas Chowk on Delhi-Gurugram expressway Wednesday. The car was completely destroyed in the impact, police said. The incident, according to the police, occurred around 8 am when the deceased, identified as Shafat Ali, a resident of Delhi’s Uttam Nagar, was on his way from Gurugram to Delhi. He had been working as a driver for the past several months. Ali was driving his employer’s Wagon R car and did not spot the pickup truck, which had been parked near a divider and crashed into it, police said. “Preliminary investigation suggests that the pickup truck was parked for some repairs. It is possible that due to the fog, the car driver could not see the truck, but that will be clear after the probe. The car driver’s body was taken out of the car with the help of a crane and handed over to the family after autopsy,” a police officer said. Shafat’s cousing Shiraz said, “We got to know about the incident in the morning and came from Delhi. Shafat earlier used to work as a driver with cab aggregators. He was going to Delhi to deliver something as part of his job. His family had recently fixed his marriage and he was about to get engaged soon. We are all in shock.” An FIR has been registered at Sector 17 police station under sections 283, 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/one-dies-as-car-crashes-into-parked-truck-at-atlas-chowk/articleshow/88864312.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Noida||Bhadana entry raises the poll stakes in airport town||Noida: Jewar, in the news for the new international airport, drew attention for very different reasons on Wednesday with the advent of Avtar Singh Bhadana on the scene.Bhadana, the MLA from Meerapur in Muzaffarnagar, joined Jayant Chaudhary’s RLD and is likely to be the SP-RLD alliance candidate from the Jewar constituency, turning it into a high-voltage battle. Bhadana is a four-time MP who won on Congress tickets, thrice from Faridabad and once from Meerut. He is now with BJP, though he had contested the 2019 polls as a Congress candidate from Faridabad, which he lost. His resignation from BJP was, meanwhile, never accepted.Talking to TOI, Bhadana said that he was ready for a tough fight. “Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary are fighting in an alliance and they have told me that I will fight from the alliance. The Jewar seat has come to the RLD as part of the seat-sharing arrangement and I will fight on the RLD symbol. The alliance needs to win the western UP area to form the government and hence, I have come to help reduce the number of seats won by BJP,” he said.Bhadana, an influential Gurjar leader, was among those to address gatherings of the community in the aftermath of the controversy over the plaque of a statue of Samrat Mihir Bhoj that was last September in Dadri.He said he left BJP because the party did not listen to farmers, Dalits and people from backward castes. “I have always liked tough fights. The competition is tough and that is why I will fight from here,” he added. The Jewar seat is currently represented by Thakur Dhirendra Singh of BJP.According to estimates from the 2017 elections, there are an equal number of Rajputs and Gurjars in Jewar, which are the two dominant communities, a crucial statistic for candidate selection. A former panchayat member told TOI, “This seat had always been represented by a member of the SC/ST community since it was reserved till 2012. It became a general seat only after that. In 2012, BSP’s Vedram Bhati won from here. If BSP decides to field a candidate that appeals to the Gurjar community as well as the Dalits and Muslims, the balance may shift,” he said. A local Gurjar leader said Bhadana’s entry could make the fight tougher for BJP, but a split in votes could also benefit the BJP candidate. “The Gurjar community has been unhappy due to the recent Samrat Mihir Bhoj controversy, but if BSP fields a Gurjar candidate, it is possible that the vote will split, ending up helping BJP,” he said. There has been speculation that BSP may field Narendra Dhada, a Gurjar, from the seat.Thakur Dhirendra Singh said BJP was confident of victory. “We will fight on the development plank. The BJP is ready for any fight,” Singh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/bhadana-entry-raises-the-poll-stakes-in-airport-town/articleshow/88864314.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||After NGT order, GNIDA told to check maps, approvals of colonies near Surajpur wetland||Greater Noida: In a move to curb encroachments near the Surajpur wetland, the forest department has asked the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) to designate an officer to check whether the maps of the adjoining colonies had been approved and how so many of them have mushroomed in the area. The move comes after National Green Tribunal (NGT) constituted a panel for remedial action against illegal encroachments near the Surajpur reserved forest, which the state government is yet to notify as a wetland under the Wetland Conservation and Management Rules, 2017.In an order issued on December 15, 2021, a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had constituted a four-member committee led by the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate (DM) for looking into a complaint about the illegal encroachments. The bench had also sought an action taken report from the committee, and it will take up the matter again on March 9, 2022. The committee, including officials from the state wetland authority and the state pollution control board, the GB Nagar DM and the GB Nagar divisional forest officer (DFO)-the designated nodal agency for “coordination and compliance"-is now poised to verify the complaint and take remedial measures by the law. The Surajpur area is protected under the India Forest Act, 1927. Several environmentalists have raised concerns about “illegal colonies” on plots near the wetland.DFO PK Srivastava, when contacted, said that since the GNIDA is not a part of the committee, the department has separately asked it to look into the issue. “GNIDA can check how such houses have come up since the area is under their jurisdiction and is private land. We have asked it to nominate one officer to be part of the action plan,” he said.DM Suhas LY said that there would be a meeting soon on the issue, according to the NGT order. “We will look into all the points mentioned by the NGT, and since the responsibility will lie on the administration, all stakeholders, including GNIDA and police, will be directed to identify the cause of encroachment and take action as per the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, and the Zoning Regulations, 2010. GNIDA will check if the maps approve such houses, and if not, it can receive directions to remove the encroachments,” he said.GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan said that the authority would readily help, but the department concerned or police needed to file a complaint first. “They can lodge a police complaint or approach the authority with a complaint after which we will look into the encroachment allegations, and subsequently, take action,” he said.Designation of 6 sites pending with SCA spot visit to Surajpur showed that colonies have come up less than 20 metres from the boundary wall of the reserved area, with ground-level water often extracted from borewells inside the houses. Amar Singh, who has built a two-floor house in the area, said, “We bought this land from a private dealer in 2018. Most houses here are three to four years old. We have registries, electricity connections, and borewells. Nobody has said anything for so many years. Are we going to face action now?"The Surajpur wetland, a reserved forest, was called a wetland by the NGT in 2018, stopping all construction activities on the 308-hectare area as per the 2017 wetland rules. During the summer of 2018, the Surajpur wetland had turned dry for over two months, leading to allegations by local environmentalists that constructions in the area had interfered with the natural flow of water into the wetland. They have been demanding that six sites near the Surajpur forest get the wetland designation, too. Currently, the matter is pending with the Supreme Court. The UP government has filed an affidavit with the court in this case."In its affidavit, the state government has said that the land around the forest area boundary wall is private, but these houses have come up without a NOC (no objection certificate) from the GNIDA, and the ground level extraction is dangerous for the wetland. Under Sections 3 and 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the state government and the central government can take action against any activity, which can damage a wetland," environmentalist Vikrant Tongad said. The last bird count carried out by the Asian Wetland Census (AWC) in 2021 estimated that 3,107 waterbirds, including 40 species, had visited the wetland.Gate on the Devla Village side will be closedDFO PK Srivastava said that the Surajpur wetland has two gates, but the gate from the heavily-colonised Devla village will be completely closed. Instead, another gate will open on the 130-metre main road near the wetland. Wetland in charge Ram Avtar confirmed that the gate from the Devla village side will be closed because "there is too much movement and noise pollution" from that side.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/after-ngt-order-gnida-told-to-check-maps-approvals-of-colonies-near-surajpur-wetland/articleshow/88864315.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Noida||Noida: Revenue officials say ‘held hostage’ in lift, Supertech officials booked||NOIDA: Six officials of real estate developer Supertech have been booked after a revenue officer filed a police complaint, alleging he and two colleagues were held hostage inside an elevator of the developer’s Sector 96 project for an hour last week. Deputy revenue officer (Dadri) Ram Krishna, who is the complainant, told TOI on Wednesday that the three of them had gone to Supertech’s E Square project on January 5 around 2.30pm with a Rs 112-crore recovery notice issued by the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera). “On January 5, we reached their office to seal the premises on the 24th and 25th floor as the builder had not cleared the dues. As we took the lift and reached the fourth floor, power supply was switched off, leaving us stranded for one hour,” Krishna stated in his complaint. The official said they struggled inside the elevator without proper ventilation. “There was no ventilation inside the lift, which could have led to something serious. We called our seniors, who (finally) came to our rescue,” the complaint stated. The revenue officials later sealed the premises and filed a complaint at Sector 39 police station against six officials of the realtor. In a statement on Wednesday, Supertech said, “The elevator had stopped working due to technical issues. However, the issue was resolved after a while and all the elevators started working.” Rajeev Kumar, SHO of Sector 39 police station, said an FIR under IPC sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) had been registered against six people. No arrests have been made in the case, so far. Additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) Vandita Srivastava told TOI that 69 villas developed by the real estate group have been attached by the administration so far and will be put up for auction on Thursday. Earlier, the Noida Authority had slapped recovery notices to the tune of more than Rs 10 crore in water and sewerage charges. The UP-Rera, acting on complaints of homebuyers, has also issued notices. On January 7, the administration had sealed the company’s office by locking up the gates in Sector 96.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/revenue-officials-say-held-hostage-in-lift-supertech-officials-booked/articleshow/88864316.cms||---

Similarly, the Ghaziabad health department is running an ICCC from the district collectorate and offering teleconsultations from 31 more centres. As of now, over 90% of the active cases do not require any hospitalisation. The health departments from the respective ICCCs are keeping an eye on the health status of patients in home isolation and have also sought the help of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to provide medical advice to patients. The ICCCs track the development of any symptoms in the patients through phone calls for seven consecutive days from the date of start of home isolation as per the state government’s latest guidelines. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the ICCC is under the supervision of the additional district magistrate (L/A), Balram Singh. It is run in three shifts with 30 phone lines and 59 staff, comprising 19 doctors and officers. They call at least 3,800 patients every day. The 16 other centres receive over 100 calls per day. Since December last year, 5,043 calls have been received from patients. Moreover, GIMS, Greater Noida, on Wednesday re-launched UPCHAR, a mobile app to provide teleconsultation to patients free of cost. Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, the director, GIMS, said, “The app had benefitted over 800 patients during the second wave. Now, it has been re-activated amid the third wave.

While, Kavita Jamil, vice chairperson Arun Vihar Residents Welfare Association (AVRWA – sectors 28, 29 and 37), Sanjeev Kumar, RWA general secretary for Sector 51 and residents of Rajat Vihar Sector 62 and Jalvayu Vihar Sector 25 complained that no sanitisation had taken place in their sectors recently, residents of Sector 33 said that the sanitation drive carried out in their area was a mere formality.Jamil said that there are 84 Covid-19 patients in Arun Vihar at the moment while Jalvayu Vihar has 63 active cases in home isolation. "Whatever sanitisation is done is nothing compared to the requirements of the three sectors which are huge and spread across vast areas," said Jamil.Meanwhile residents of Sector 33 demanded a planned schedule of sanitation drives in the area. "Concerned officials are requested to plan a schedule and circulate the same to all RWAs so that monitoring can be done. We also request the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association (FONRWA) to coordinate with the public health department of the authority to chalk out and streamline this important exercise as it was done in the past during the second wave," said a resident. KK Jain, secretary general FONRWA, has requested the public health department of Noida Authority to intimate the concerned RWA where they plan to carry out the sanitation drive as well as to coordinate with sector RWAs in this exercise for better results.Meanwhile the Authority on Wednesday carried out sanitation drives in more than two dozen sectors including sectors 31, 10, 11, 12, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/residents-noida-not-carrying-out-sanitation-drives/articleshow/88864318.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Noida||Noida finds a fix for its e-waste||NOIDA: The Noida Authority has selected two private firms for the disposal of e-waste generated in the city. In the absence of a designated dumpsite for e-waste in the city, the Authority placed e-waste bins about two years ago along with trash bins for segregated waste at a few public places, mostly around IT hubs. However, officials said that there was a lack of response for e-waste dumping mostly because of the monetary value attached to the electronics items in the scrap market. Therefore, the Authority has now released a price list of about 75 items, including pen drives, copper wires, headphones, laptops, keyboards, washing machines, refrigerators and mobile phones for both individuals and companies to dispose of through the two companies — Green Enabled IT Solution Pvt Ltd and RLG India — hired by the authority. The e-waste items are divided into functional and non-functional and their prices range from Rs 10 to Rs 2,500 a kg. “Any individual or company can call the two selected firms for the disposal of e-waste. Noida being an IT hub, has many companies and individuals who periodically upgrade the IT goods. Apart from that, electronics goods, including household items, can all be disposed of now,” said SC Mishra, deputy general manager (public health department), Noida Authority. “We hired a company about two years back for the disposal of e-waste in the city and placed bins for e-waste at 21 places in the city. But there was no response as no one dumped their electronics waste in them as there’s some monetary value to these goods in the scrap market. Therefore, we have now fixed a price list for select goods on which these two firms will pick up the e-waste,” he said. For disposing the e-waste, Green Enabled IT Solution Pvt Ltd can be contacted on its toll-free number 1800-419-0431, while RLG India can be contacted on 1800-203-1460 .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-finds-a-fix-for-its-e-waste/articleshow/88864320.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

A local Gurjar leader said Bhadana’s entry could make the fight tougher for BJP, but a split in votes could also benefit the BJP candidate. “The Gurjar community has been unhappy due to the recent Samrat Mihir Bhoj controversy, but if BSP fields a Gurjar candidate, it is possible that the vote will split, ending up helping BJP,” he said. There has been speculation that BSP may field Narendra Dhada, a Gurjar, from the seat. Thakur Dhirendra Singh said BJP was confident of victory. “We will fight on the development plank.

---||---||Uttar Pradesh polls: Avtar Singh Bhadana's entry raises the political stakes in Jewar||NOIDA: Jewar, in the news for the new international airport, drew attention for very different reasons on Wednesday with the advent of Avtar Singh Bhadana on the scene. Bhadana, the MLA from Meerapur in Muzaffarnagar, joined Jayant Chaudhary’s RLD and is likely to be the SP-RLD alliance candidate from the Jewar constituency, turning it into a high-voltage battle. Bhadana is a four-time MP who won on Congress tickets, thrice from Faridabad and once from Meerut. He is now with BJP, though he had contested the 2019 polls as a Congress candidate from Faridabad, which he lost. His resignation from BJP was, meanwhile, never accepted. Talking to TOI, Bhadana said that he was ready for a tough fight. “Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary are fighting in an alliance and they have told me that I will fight from the alliance. The Jewar seat has come to the RLD as part of the seat-sharing arrangement and I will fight on the RLD symbol. The alliance needs to win the western UP area to form the government and hence, I have come to help reduce the number of seats won by BJP,” he said. Bhadana, an influential Gurjar leader, was among those to address gatherings of the community in the aftermath of the controversy over the plaque of a statue of Samrat Mihir Bhoj that was last September in Dadri. He said he left BJP because the party did not listen to farmers, Dalits and people from backward castes. “I have always liked tough fights. The competition is tough and that is why I will fight from here,” he added. The Jewar seat is currently represented by Thakur Dhirendra Singh of BJP. According to estimates from the 2017 elections, there are an equal number of Rajputs and Gurjars in Jewar, which are the two dominant communities, a crucial statistic for candidate selection. A former panchayat member told TOI, “This seat had always been represented by a member of the SC/ST community since it was reserved till 2012. It became a general seat only after that. In 2012, BSP’s Vedram Bhati won from here. If BSP decides to field a candidate that appeals to the Gurjar community as well as the Dalits and Muslims, the balance may shift,” he said.

Inching towards the 50,000 daily mark, the state added 46,723 cases, a 35% jump since Tuesday (34,424). With this, Maharashtra’s caseload crossed 70 lakh. The state government issued a statement to “rectify” perceptions that the Omicron-Covid wave was “flattening” in Mumbai, but experts said Wednesday’s high tally could be a reflection of a months-old trend in which the week’s highest tally is registered on Wednesday. CM Uddhav Thackeray appealed to the public to not lower their guard because of a drop in cases for just a couple of days. In a more worrying sign, the state has reported a surge in fatalities since the last two days—32 on Wednesday, the highest since November 30 (35).

Cases are increasing in rural areas as well,” he said. Health minister Rajesh Tope said there is no flattening of the curve in Mumbai or the state. “Mumbai is at the peak of the third wave right now,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s Covid task force. “Daily fluctuations shouldn’t matter as much as the weekly tally,” he said. Dr Joshi said that despite the higher tally on Wednesday, the daily test positivity is lower (24.3%) than it was a few days back (28% on January 9). Read AlsoIndia reports 2.47 lakh new Covid cases, highest since MayIndia logged 2.47 lakh new Covid cases, 27 percent jump from yesterday while the active cases rose to 11,17,531, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Thursday. The death toll climbed to 4,85,035 with 380 fresh fatalities according to the data updated at 9 am.“We cannot look at absolute numbers as the parameter (of seriousness). We have instead to focus on four other parameters: the number of hospitalisations, the number of people on ventilator, ICU numbers and those needing oxygen support,” said Dr Joshi. Municipal commissioner I S Chahal said the daily test positivity rate could jump in the coming days. “Due to changes in the national Covid testing guidelines two days ago that directed only symptomatic cases would be tested, it is likely to create a spike in positivity as most of the symptomatic cases would be almost confirmed positive cases,” he said. Thackeray said districts have been asked to focus on vaccination as it has been seen that fully vaccinated people, even if they need to be hospitalised, do not go on oxygen support and their recovery is faster. He said the oxygen requirement in the state has gradually risen to 400MT and once this requirement reaches 700MT, stricter restrictions will come into force. Tope said that of the total active cases in the state, about 3% are critical and need oxygen and ICU beds.

Of these, 21 are from Mumbai and 53 from Pune. The remaining are from Pimpri-Chinchwad (6), Pune Rural (1), Satara (3) and Nashik (2).

Even those who have taken the vaccine are getting infected, but the severity of Covid-19 infection is much less for them,” she said. According to the data provided by the BMC, of the 4,575 Covid deaths from February 1, 2021, to January 4, 2022, the number of deaths among the unvaccinated individuals was 4,320, or about 94%. Health authorities have expressed concern over the fact that nearly 98 lakh in the state are yet to take the first dose of the Covid vaccine. They directed district officials to step up the drive and get the left-out population inoculated. Maharashtra has an estimated 9.14 crore residents aged 18 years and above and the first dose of the anti-Covid vaccine has been administered on nearly 8.16 crore beneficiaries. The state introduced some curbs on January 8 following a rise in cases and started the precaution dose drive on Monday. All local authorities have been given a deadline to cover the pending population in districts. Thane, Nashik, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nanded are leading the list of the maximum number of unvaccinated people.

The priority is to reduce viral spread. Smaller cities have started to report an increase in cases,” said Tope. Vaccination being slow in the state and the recently imposed restrictions were discussed in Wednesday’s state cabinet meeting. he said. “Cabinet members were of the opinion that schools and colleges should continue to remain closed. We are watching the numbers daily and decisions will be taken appropriately.” He said the cabinet recorded displeasure at the reduced rate of vaccination in the state. “Strict steps will be taken to ensure that people take the jab. It is not right that people take concessions like ration that the state offers and do not come forward to get vaccinated. We may not be able to make vaccination mandatory, but districts have been asked to take strict steps in the interests of larger public health to ensure everyone is vaccinated,” Tope said.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt seeks monitoring of at-home Covid test kits, reporting of results||MUMBAI: Worried about Covid cases going unreported, the state has asked districts and civic corporations to monitor the sale of at-home testing kits and ensure that people using them report test results to the authorities. They have been asked to work with the Food and Drug Administration and rope in chemists to educate users about the importance of registering results. The BMC is likely to come out with guidelines for at-home kits on Thursday.  The use of rapid self-test kits has seen a massive jump since the Omicron surge began. As the waiting time for RT-PCR tests soared with the swelling in sample load, many turned to self-administered test kits that can deliver results in 15-20 minutes. But given that reporting is effectively voluntary, most positive cases were not reported. The BMC was informed of barely 98,000 tests from August to December. Meanwhile, lakhs of kits have been sold in the city in the past 20 days.  Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas dashed a letter to district officials on Wednesday stating, “It seems there are large numbers of Covid positive cases which have been tested on these kits but have not been reported to the authorities concerned and such persons appear to be in home isolation.” Cautioning that the more virulent Delta variant was still found in 70% of samples sequenced from the state, he wrote, “Rapid antigen tests generally do not distinguish between Delta and Omicron variants. Thus, it may so happen that many of these home-isolated Covid patients may need hospital care (particularly those with Delta and comorbidities) and suddenly there may be stress on our health infrastructure.” The state has asked local administrations to tie up with the FDA, monitor the sale of such kits through medical stores and understand the geographical areas where they are being used on a large scale. “Chemist shop owners can also be educated to inform the kit buyer to report a positive result,” he said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC plans to write to the FDA chief on Thursday asking for a direction to chemist shops in Mumbai to give data on buyers of home kits. The BMC will give the data to its 24 ward war rooms, which will call such individuals. Still, rapid antigen kits will continue to be the mainstay of Covid diagnosis for now, said ICMR head Dr Balram Bhargava on Wednesday. He said home antigen and rapid antigen kits have become the backbone in the war against Omicron and WHO has also kept these as one of its major recommendations. He said antigen tests are able to detect Covid between Day 3 and Day 8 of exposure, which is the infectious period. “Intimation of the test results on the ICMR portal is necessary,” he said, adding that India has the capacity to produce 18 lakh kits daily. He didn’t say how many are being consumed.  A chemist from Marine Lines said they are selling 150-200 kits a day and maintaining a record of each buyer could be challenging. “Many people are buying it online, what about them?” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-seeks-monitoring-of-at-home-covid-test-kits-reporting-of-results/articleshow/88864330.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Just 0.5% of 1 lakh cases in institutional quarantine||MUMBAI: Even as Mumbai reported the maximum Covid cases in a single day at 20,971 last week, on January 7, the number of individuals who are currently under institutional quarantine has been the lowest since the pandemic struck. When the pandemic first hit Mumbai in March 2020, during the initial months, more than 10,000 people were in institutional quarantine. In May 2020, for instance, their numbers totalled 10,260. In the current situation, though, merely 542 people are in institutional quarantine facilities while active cases total 1.03 lakh. Officials pointed to several reasons for this, one being that more positive cases are being reported from non-slum areas. Dr Bhupendra Patil, medical health officer, M-West Ward, too, said 95% of cases from his area, Chembur, are from buildings. “In some cases, positive patients from the slums tell us they do not use a community toilet as they have one in their homes and hence would not prefer institutional quarantine. But, if we feel that the patient is at a high risk of infecting his family members, we insist on shifting them into an institutional quarantine,” said Patil, adding with no lockdown-like situation now, people who do not have a work-from-home option hesitate to move into institutional quarantine for fear of long leave and loss of pay. Congress corporator and opposition party leader Ravi Raja said unlike the second wave which was severe, this time as cases are milder, so people are also a bit hesitant to go in for institutional quarantine.  MLA Rais Shaikh said in the first wave especially home isolation was never considered. “A general practitioner is also aware of how to handle a positive patient unlike in the first wave,” said Shaikh. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said even though there are few under institutional quarantine, the administration is not looking at reducing the facilities. “Currently, 93% of Covid cases are not from slums. But in case numbers in slums rise, then the need for institutional quarantine may go up again.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/just-0-5-of-1l-cases-in-institutional-quarantine/articleshow/88864332.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Mumbai||Penalty waiver for Sena MLA bldgs gets nod; BJP cries foul||Mumbai: In a controversial decision, the state cabinet approved a proposal to waive off the penalty and interest on penalty levied on illegal floors in Chhabhaiya Vihang Garden, two 13-storey buildings developed by Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik-owned Vihang Group.BJP MLA Kirit Somaiya had filed a complaint against the illegal construction in July last year with the state Lokayukta. Somaiya had alleged that the top five floors of the two buildings were unauthorised and did not have an occupation certificate (OC). He alleged that Sarnaik had cheated 114 flat buyers. The buildings were constructed in 2008 and in 2012, the Thane Municipal Corporation declared the floors from nine to 13 as illegal. It levied a penalty of Rs 3.3 crore in October 2013 and warned if the money is not paid within six months, then an interest of 18% would be levied. Somaiya has alleged that Sarnaik owes the corporation Rs 21 crore.The proposal first on Wednesday’s cabinet agenda was about the waiver of the penalty and interest on penalty as well as issuance of an OC.Government sources said because of the illegality, the proposal had been pending for more than a year but then there were clear instructions that it had to be done. “There is a crucial difference between this case and others. In this case, Sarnaik had constructed a school for the corporation for which he had received construction TDR (transfer of development rights). He had used this construction TDR to construct the additional floors. However, he had not applied to the Thane Municipal Corporation and obtained permission for the same. The permission was obtained after the penalty and interest was levied and subsequently the floors were regularised,” said sources. Around Rs 3.08 crore is the penalty and Rs 1.25 crore is the interest on penalty that was levied, said a source.“The final order of the Lokayukta is still awaited. But during the hearing before the Lokayukta, the government accepted that the constructions were illegal and it would recover the penalty and interest from the developer. And today all because he is a Sena MLA all his crimes have been forgiven and the penalty has been waived off,” said Somaiya.A political leader from an alliance partner of the Sena in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government said the cabinet should not have approved such a proposal. “There are several such buildings with illegal floors across the state. Now the cabinet will have to regularise all of these,” he said. Mantralaya sources said the case would serve as a precedent only in those cases where construction TDR was already available with the developer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/penalty-waiver-for-sena-mla-bldgs-gets-nod-bjp-cries-foul/articleshow/88864334.cms||Clara Lewis

Congress corporator Asif Zakaria and MNS functionary Tushar Aphale complained to Mhada that the foundation had outsourced the operations at the ground to a private company, Wings Sports Centre, which was allegedly charging around Rs 300 to Rs 500 from people for jogging per hour and Rs 7,000 per hour for playing sports. According to the Mhada notice issued to RJMF last month, the playground plot was developed using government funds and was given to the foundation for upkeep and maintenance for three years from September 2019 to September 2022. “There were terms and conditions when the plot was given to RJMF for maintenance. It was mentioned that there would be no commercial use of the plot and Mhada’s permission would be required for commercial use as per revenue-sharing terms… it looks like these terms and conditions are not being followed...,” Mhada’s notice said.“During site inspection it was noticed that a football tournament Sketchers The Legions Cup was being played and Wings Sports Academy’s office was also seen on the plot. Mhada was not informed about any tournament and no permission was given. You are directed to open the plot for public use and to submit a report to Mhada with your explanation on the complaints,” the notice said. Zakaria complained to housing minister Jitendra Awhad. “There is a complete misuse and commercial exploitation of the plot. Third-party rights have been created on a public open space and all Mhada terms and conditions are being flouted. RJMF has circulated a ground use policy for locals and only a part of the open area can be used by locals and that too at specified time slots. A thorough inquiry must be initiated into this and the reserved playground should be made accessible to all,” Zakaria said.RJMF’s Santosh Kelkar said, “We have already replied to Mhada’s notice. We have appointed a private agency which is an expert in sports. We are not making any commercial use of the plot. If any events have taken place, we will inform Mhada. We have also shared a usage policy for citizens with Mhada.” BJP MLA from Bandra (west) Ashish Shelar said he would ensure that Bandra Reclamation residents get to use the facilities at nominal rates. “I helped to turn a dump yard into a sports facility. There is a pending case between Reclamation residents and Mhada over ownership of the plot. The agency should have informed Mhada about any sports activity there and followed terms and conditions,” Shelar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/misuse-of-playground-by-pvt-party-mhada-issues-notice/articleshow/88864339.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Shops in the state will display signboards in Marathi in large letters. Even if the shop has one employee, it will have a Marathi signboard, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray tweeted. State minister Subhash Desai who holds the Marathi language portfolio said, “We were getting complaints of many shops not implementing the rule, so we decided to make this amendment in the Act.” The retail traders’ association has protested the move. “The high court had stayed a bigger font on Marathi signboards after we went to court in 2001. This cannot be passed in the assembly as the issue is sub-judice,” said Viren Shah of the Federation of Retail Traders Association. “Shopkeepers have suffered in the pandemic... [This] cost a lot of money. We request the state government to keep shopkeepers away from politics of Marathi signboards,” he said. The cabinet also decided that liquor shops must not be named after great men and women or forts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/marathi-signboard-move-opposed-by-retail-traders/articleshow/88864344.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The decision will benefit over 16 lakh families. The announcement of the waiver was made on January 1, by CM Uddhav Thackeray with an eye on civic elections. While BMC is set to lose around Rs 417 crore, the government will lose around Rs 45 crore in revenue. Thackeray had justified the decision by pointing out that BMC had earned Rs 11,000 crore by approving building constructions. The windfall was on account of the government reducing various premiums by 50%.

The other two major categories of complaints are a failure by banks to meet commitments and non-observance of the fair practices code.The share of ATM/debit card complaints, mobile/electronic banking and credit card complaints to total complaints received from July 2020 to March 2021 stood at 17.4%, 13% and 12.4%, respectively. The corresponding percentage of complaints against these grounds from July 2019 to June 2020 were 22%, 13.4% and 9.3%.The shift to digital platforms for grievance redressal has led to two major gains. First, the cost of redressing grievances has fallen sharply. Second, there has been an improvement in the turnaround time (TAT).The average cost of handling a complaint under the banking ombudsman scheme decreased by 33.5% from Rs 2,412 during July 2019-June 2020 to Rs 1,605 from July 2020-March 2021. “The cost reduction was on account of the increased volume of complaints handled by the same human resources, supported by the end-to-end digitisation of complaint processing in the complaint management system (CMS),” the report said.The time taken to dispose of a complaint by the banking ombudsman declined from 95 days to 55 days. The reporting year has changed along with the change in the accounting year for the RBI. As a result, the numbers in absolute terms are not comparable.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cards-e-banking-plaints-still-dominate-grievances/articleshow/88864351.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Schools want to hold offline HSC and SSC prelim exams||MUMBAI: With the state education board determined to hold Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) offline exams as per schedule in March-April, schools too are insisting on physical preliminary tests for students. Schools had begun preparing students for physical exams in October. The January shutdown of schools amid rising infections put a question mark on the pen and paper exams. The state, however, clarified that SSC and HSC exams will be held in the physical mode. Worried about students lagging behind in writing lengthy papers, schools want students to take practice tests in the physical mode. “The preliminary question papers are set. We were contemplating having an online exam. Students need practice if they have to write the offline boards. We have called students to school in batches next week for the preliminary exams,” said the principal of a school in Charni Road. Schools are hoping to conduct atleast two practice tests before students take the SSC exams from March 15. “The syllabus has been completed and students have been told to solve previous years question papers. The practice test will give us a sense where students rank. We plan to hold offline prelims in the last week of January,” said the principal of a Borivli school. Preliminary exam papers are kept tough to help teachers know where students stand in the finals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/schools-want-to-hold-offline-hsc-and-ssc-prelim-exams/articleshow/88864352.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||At 18,000cr, TCS unveils largest stock buyback ever||Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced a mega stock repurchase proposal on Wednesday. The move is supported by higher profits and cash flows as the software services giant benefits from the pandemic-induced digital ramp-up. TCS proposes to carry out a Rs 18,000-crore share buyback, which will be the biggest stock repurchase by an Indian company. TCS would buy back 4 crore equity shares at Rs 4,500 apiece. The announced rate is at a 17% premium to the Wednesday closing price of the TCS stock, which ended at Rs 3,857 on the NSE. The proposal, the fourth in five years by the company, tops its previous three share buyback deals of Rs 16,000 crore each. “The Rs 18,000-crore buyback size translates into 1.08% of TCS’s outstanding equity, which is not material per se. But what is important is the intent of TCS to consistently reward shareholders through buyback programmes and dividends, reflecting its golden standard of corporate governance,” said Sharekhan BNP Paribas research head Sanjeev Hota. TCS vowed to begin stock buybacks in FY18 in order to distribute 80-100% of its free cash flows to shareholders. According to information from financial content platform Prime Database, several large share buybacks in the recent past were carried out by IT companies. Besides TCS, Infosys and Wipro returned huge cash to shareholders. The TCS move would also funnel cash back to its largest shareholder Tata Sons. Participating in the buyback will fetch Tata Sons, which holds 72% in the IT giant, Rs 12,960 crore. The gains made from such deals would help Tata Sons to pay for M&As and other corporate purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/at-18000cr-tcs-unveils-largest-stock-buyback-ever/articleshow/88864353.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Rs 207 crore netted in fines since the pandemic began in 2020||MUMBAI: Since March 2020 after the pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdown, police stations across the state have collected fines amounting to Rs 206.97 crore. The money was collected as penalty from those who violated lockdown rules, including motorists who disregarded restrictions. Among those who paid up were people who did not follow Covid-19 rules (like wearing a mask, kept hotels/eateries open beyond stipulated time and unlawful assembly). Also, police across the state have caught 10,056 people in all for violating quarantine measures. Also, 63,102 people were arrested under bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Epidemic Act, Disaster Management Act, and Maharashtra Covid-19 regulation, 2020. A total of 3.77 lakh cases have been registered in the state while 1.56 lakh vehicles were impounded. Also, 422 policemen were assaulted in the state and 124 personnel injured in this period, police said. A senior IPS officer said that a major chunk of the fines was collected from people from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai — the biggest contributors to these statistics since inter-district and regular movement of people in these cities is high. A lot of people continued violating restrictions and the rules that are regularly updated and re-imposed by the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/207cr-netted-in-fines-since-the-pandemic-began-in-2020/articleshow/88864354.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP MLA Nitesh Rane says murder attempt case against him is ‘preposterous’||MUMBAI: Interim oral assurance from prosecution not to arrest BJP MLA Nitesh Rane to continue till his plea for pre-arrest bail is decided by Bombay high court in an attempt to murder case registered last month in Sindhudurg. The HC will continue hearing the matter on January 13. Senior counsel Niteen Pradhan argued before Justice C V Bhadang that invoking of offence of attempt to murder was “preposterous’’ in the case against Rane. The case was nothing but an outcome of “lampooning’’ he faced outside Vidhan Bhavan last month when BJP leaders were protesting, he said. In a rejoinder he filed, he said that there is “malice in fact” in the investigation “for ulterior political motives and the outcome of some lampooning outside Vidhan Bhavan on 23.12.2021”, adding, “There is also no explanation in the reply (of the police) either admitting or denying the conduct of the material witness.’’ The BJP MLA, Nitesh Rane, son of Union minister Narayan Rane, is an one of the accused persons in a case of alleged attempt to murder of a Shiv Sena functionary, Santosh Parab, in Sindhudurg in December 2021. Special public prosecutor Sudeep Pasbola had earlier orally submitted before Justice C V Bhadang that no coercive steps would be taken till then against him. That assurance continues. There is reference only to “two abrasions on the chest’’ and the “glaring fallacy’’ of the prosecution case is there is no explanation of the assault of the blow and the injury, as the FIR says there was only “one blow’’ and hence invoking the offence of attempt to murder under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code is “preposterous”. Rane said the state has not replied to his contention that Shiv Sena activist Satish Sawant met the complainant in the government hospital at Kankavli and addressed media outside against Rane, even before the FIR was registered. Pradhan said the statement of media must be taken to rule out false implication against Rane. The rejoinder said the complainant was apparently felicitated by high-placed political personalities and deputy chief minister who had visited Kankavali and attended a rally on December 26 which was led by Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/nitesh-rane-says-murder-attempt-case-against-him-is-preposterous/articleshow/88864356.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet exempts 100% road tax for school buses||MUMBAI: The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to give a 100% road tax exemption to all the vehicles that are used as school buses in the state. The waiver will be applicable for a two year long period from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022. The state government said that this exemption will only be applicable for all those buses that are owned by schools or those that are taken on lease by schools and exclusively operate as school buses. A senior transport officer said that the tax waiver is presently around Rs 8.5 crore for school buses across Maharashtra. “Schools were shut during this time due to Covid and so it was felt that some tax relief should be extended to the affected transporters,”said an official. School Bus Owners Association president Anil Garg said hundreds of bus operators were seeking compensation for the period lost due to the imposition of lockdown and school bus trade coming to a standstill from March 2020. “Owners have gone through a harrowing experience of zero income and their staff including drivers and women attendants were rendered jobless,” he recalled, adding that the SBOA welcomed the government decision to waive taxes and provided much-needed relief to the school bus community. The waiver will benefit 8,000 buses in Mumbai and 44,000 school buses across Maharashtra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-cabinet-exempts-100-road-tax-for-school-buses/articleshow/88864359.cms||Somit Sen

Western Railway had gradually restored several long-distance train services after the ebbing of the second wave in anticipation of a demand surge. A senior WR official said, “The occupancy in premier train Rajdhani Express between Mumbai Central and New Delhi was a mere 47% on January 10. Similarly, occupancy in August Kranti Rajdhani train was 41%.” The Mumbai-New Delhi route has heavy demand for the most part of the year. It was impacted after the Delhi government imposed stringent restrictions when its daily positivity rate hit 20,000 cases. It has ordered closure of private offices, except those in the exempted categories. While some trains to Gujarat are running at 100% occupancy, there are a few with 70-90%. Karnavati Express which runs between Mumbai and Ahmedabad has an occupancy of only 86%. Mumbai-Bhavnagar Express, which usually sees a heavy demand too has 73% occupancy. IRCTC reduced the frequency of Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas Express from five days a week to three from Wednesday. A senior WR official said, “We feel this is a short-term phenomenon and demand is expected to pick up as many experts are predicting that this will ebb soon.” Wedding restrictions in Maharashtra saw several outstation passengers cancel their travel plans as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/occupancy-in-mum-delhi-trains-halves/articleshow/88864361.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Mumbai||Covid funds used, BMC looks at rainy-day kitty for Rs 300 crore||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spent around Rs 1,300 crore on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic this year. With all its funds earmarked for the pandemic for this year already exhausted, the country’s richest civic body has moved a proposal to divert an additional Rs 300 crore for Covid-related spending till March 2022. In its budget in February 2021, the BMC had allocated around Rs 1,380 crore for Covid and out of this, Rs 1303 crore has been used already by November 2021. The municipal corporation will now divert Rs 300 crore from its contingency funds to pay its Covid bills. The civic body has already used around Rs 400 crore from its contingency funds for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. BMC officials said that it may require more funds for Covid and it will divert money from funds meant for land acquisition too. BMC has placed a proposal to divert Rs 300 crore for Covid before the civic standing committee. According to opposition parties, so far, BMC has spent close to Rs 3,000 crore on fighting the pandemic. Several purchases by BMC have faced allegations of corruption and irregularities. The BJP has demanded a white paper on the BMC’s spending on Covid-19. “Despite writing several letters and asking questions, the BMC has failed to submit details of contracts. Almost every purchase has been rigged and there has been a massive siphoning of money in the name of the pandemic. A majority of contracts were awarded without floating tenders. This is how builders bagged contracts to build jumbo centres. The BMC must come clean and present a white paper on all Covid expenses right from March 2020 to March 2022,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. A large part of BMC’s Covid expenses is for upkeep and maintenance of the jumbo centres and on rent for these centres. The BMC was to spend Rs 104 crore to outsource operations of its new jumbo Covid-19 centres. It had planned to give out the operation of three new jumbo centres at Malad, Sion and Kanjurmarg along with a part of those in BKC and Dahisar to private agencies. BMC officials said the Malad jumbo centre would be the biggest of the five, with 2,170 beds, including 190 ICU and 1,536 oxygen-supported beds. There are 1,700 beds in Kanjurmarg, and 1,100 beds at the Sion centre. A proposal for Rs 1 croreto lay oxygen pipelines at the Malad jumbo centre is also placed before the civic standing committee on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/covid-funds-used-bmc-looks-at-rainy-day-kitty-for-300cr/articleshow/88864362.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Somanath, who at present is serving as director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), told TOI: "The most important responsibility is to create a space enterprise in India where all the stakeholders, including DoS, Isro, IN-SPACe, industry and start-ups are all part of the efforts to expand the space programme on a bigger scale. This is the primary responsibility." "Another objective is to align the overall space programme with the vision the government has put forth where DoS has to really become an enabler to cause the expansion of space enterprise in India. This will be done through appropriate legislation, framework and guidelines that have to be put in place," he added. Before becoming VSSC director, he had a two-and-a-half-year stint as director, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC). Among other things, Somanath is credited with "energising development activities of the high thrust semi-cryogenic engine, conceiving a fast track hardware realisation and test programme, development of throttleable engines for the lander of Chandrayaan-2 and successful flight of an electric propulsion system in GSAT-9".

The woman registered a complaint with the Aarey Colony police station and officers are investigating further. The woman is a resident of Thane West. She told the police in her complaint that the incident occurred last month while she was taking her son to FilmCity in Goregaon's Aarey Colony for a film audition. She used an app to book an autorickshaw. But instead of sending an auto to her residence, the app company organised a cab for her. The woman and her son were getting delayed and boarded the cab. When the fare came to Rs 1,380, the woman paid the sum but decided to take up the issue with the app cab service provider nevertheless. She searched on a web search engine for the company's customer care numbers and dialled a number the number she came across. Unknown to her, the number belonged to a cyber fraudster. “The accused had a brief conversation with her and got her to install an application on her phone. This application provided him remote access to her phone screen,” said a police officer “When the victim used her debit card and an e-wallet, the accused got hold of all the details and used them to transfer Rs 98,000 out of her account,” the police officer further said. After multiple transactions took place and the woman received a string of text alerts from the bank, that is when she realised she had been conned. She blocked her netbanking account and approached the Aarey Colony police to lodge a complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/woman-duped-of-98k-by-cyber-fraudster/articleshow/88864364.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: After HC rap, govt imposes curbs on participation in Mekedatu rally||BENGALURU: Facing flak from the Karnataka high court, the state government on Wednesday imposed stringent restrictions to prevent people from participating in the Congress’s Mekedatu padayatra from Thursday. Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar issued the order prohibiting movement of vehicles and persons in inter-district (within Karnataka) and intra-district (within Ramanagara) for participating in the Namma Neeru Namma Hakku padayatra with immediate effect. He directed deputy commissioners, superintendents of police, all police commissioners and transport commissioners to strictly implement the order. His note read: “Despite the explicit order of banning dharnas and protests vide orders on January 4 and 11 which is in force until January 31, it is observed that certain groups of people have organised and mobilised people from various districts to Ramanagara district to participate in the padayatra, defying government orders.” The act of defiance is endangering the lives of a large number of people, it further said, adding that the padayatra is likely to aggravate the already worsening Covid-19 situation in the state. Any person violating these measures will be liable under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, besides legal action under sections of the IPC, and other legal provisions as applicable. Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh said the padayatra will continue on Thursday and it'll reach Bengaluru as planned. Consequently, police stepped up security in Ramanagara district, indicating they may initiate action if Congress goes ahead with the padayatra on the fifth day. After the high court sought the state government's reply on what action it has initiated to prevent the padayatra in the wake of the huge surge in Covid-19 cases, sources said the government directed Ramanagara police to keep a vigil on top Congress functionaries and place them under house arrest to ensure they don't lead the padayatra on the fifth day between Ramanagara and Bidadi. Sources said Siddaramaiah returned to Bengaluru on Wednesday evening for a physiotherapy session and this led to speculation the Congress may call off the padayatra fearing police action. Senior Congress functionaries on Wednesday held a closed-door meeting in Ramanagara and reportedly decided to end the padayatra at Bidadi and not enter Bengaluru. The change in plan comes after the former additional advocate general AS Ponnanna met Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. He explained the high court's stance and implications of continuing the yatra. Sources said the party is also worried about being blamed for a spike in Covid cases, especially with several leaders testing positive and other party functionaries showing symptoms. The high court on Wednesday asked the Congress to inform by January 14 whether it had taken any permission to hold the padayatra demanding a reservoir across the Cauvery river at Mekedatu in Ramanagara district. Former CM and BJP leader SM Krishna also appealed to Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to end the padayatra. "I agree the project must be implemented but holding padayatra now will only pose hurdles to the government's Covid control efforts," Krishna said. 'Fundamental right'"We're going to submit before the court that it is our fundamental right to protest as it is a struggle for water. The padayatra is in the larger interest and it is being taken out with the permission of authorities. We will abide by the court's order," said AS Ponnanna, head of KPCC legal cell and former additional advocate general. Salem Ahmed, KPCC working president, said their lawyers are preparing the affidavit. "We will submit it to the court on Thursday or Friday. However, there is no question of stopping the padayatra," he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/after-hc-rap-govt-imposes-curbs-on-participation-in-mekedatu-rally/articleshow/88864365.cms||---

Shivamogga district stands second with 6.4% positivity rate among the children of this age group. At 5.5%, Bengaluru tops in the test positivity rate among children in the 9-19 age group, too. According to the health department, of the total 9.7 lakh tests done from January 4 to 10, some 50,783 turned positive for Covid. Among them, the test positivity rate was 2.9% among children from the age group 0-9 years and 2.4% in the age group of 9-19 years. In Udupi, 3.2% positivity rate has been observed in the age group 9-19, followed by Mandya at 3%. "For any measure like school closure in the districts, the test positivity rate among children needs to be considered and not the overall test positivity rate in a district," said a health officer. The matter was discussed at a meeting held with the CM on Tuesday. The decision on school closure should be based on the positivity rate, absolute number of cases and any increasing trend in clusters among educational institutions, said D Randeep, commissioner, health and family welfare department. A majority of the paediatric cases have been mild. "In most cases, we are seeing entire families having symptoms and we tell them to get tested. Most parents do not get their children tested. We inform them of warning signs they must not ignore," said Dr Shivaprakash Sosale, executive board member, Karnataka, Indian academy of Paediatrics. Twelve kids have been admitted to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health -- now dedicated to paediatric cases - in the past one week. "They are moderate cases, not requiring ventilator. We've dedicated one block for Covid and earmarked 90 beds. None of the patients at present have severe form of disease," said Dr KS Sanjay, director of the hospital. At Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, three pediatric cases of suspected Omicron were treated.

With experts fearing that the constant waterlogging has rendered the structure a little weak, BBMP has taken up work to compact the soil behind the retaining walls of the underpass.Currently, traffic is being allowed only on one lane as work is in progress.BBMP chief engineer said the underpass was constructed by the railways. “There was an issue with the retaining wall, which we pointed out, and they are currently carrying out the work while BBMP is overseeing it,” he said.Experts said usually, it takes decades before such a problem arises. “Soil consolidation and retention have to be part of the design. If the construction of the structure is fairly recent, such a problem shouldn’t arise. Normally, such issues occur after some decades. There are numerous reasons one can list such as substandard material being used, flaws in design, not implemented on time or accurately,” said V Ravichandar, an urbanist.According to him, all such structures are built keeping in mind that the water will flow into the drain and not get logged. “Waterlogging puts unexpected pressure on the retaining walls. The iron rods in the foundation tend to corrode and the asphalt also is impacted with waterlogging and it later causes potholes. In case of an underpass, when such a situation occurs, the hydraulic pressure puts pressure on the retaining wall, making its foundation weak,” he added.The project was delayed with very little or no work happening for two years, which might have exposed the metal to elements such as air and water leading to corrosion.An official from the railways said: “There are issues pertaining to the retaining wall and the service road. We will finish the work by the end of this month.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/work-in-progress-to-strengthen-underpass/articleshow/88864367.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||What are you waiting for? Watching? Karnataka high court to govt on rallies||BENGALURU: “What are you waiting for? Watching? Are the state authorities so helpless to stop the padayatra?” These were some of the searing questions posed by the Karnataka high court to the state government and Ramanagara district administration on Wednesday over handling of Congress’s ongoing 10-day Mekedatu padayatra led by Congress state president DK Shivakumar and former chief minister Siddaramaiah. Posting hearing on two PILs on the issue to Friday, the court asked the state government and the Congress to come up with responses on adherence to the Covid guidelines issued on January 4 this year. “What are you waiting for? Waiting for this to court to pass some orders?” a division bench headed by Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi queried when additional advocate general R Subramanya appeared for the state government. Subramanya told the court that permission has not been granted for the padayatra and added that as and when the rally enters a town or city, FIRs are being registered every day for flouting the Covid norms. The court was not impressed by the governments stand. “How are you keeping silent when FIRs are being registered, knowing fully well that the padayatra is against public health? Are state authorities so helpless to stop the padayatra?” the bench said, indicating it may not hesitate to pass a judicial order for removing the deputy commissioner for being incompetent. As the Congress counsel sought time to enable senior advocate AS Ponnanna to appear on behalf of the party, the bench posted the case to Friday. “Looking at the Covid situation and taking into consideration the large increase of Covid cases daily in the state, we call upon the state government to inform the court as to how and why the rallies, particularly the rally held by the sixth respondent (Congress), are being permitted to continue and why no appropriate action has been taken by the state authorities to restrain the sixth respondent from such activities,” the bench observed in its order. The Congress has been asked to inform the court whether it has taken permission for the padayatra and if it was taking steps to follow the Covid protocol. The party has been directed to list the measures taken to adhere to the SOP and action in case of a violation. In the morning, Shridhar Prabhu, counsel for the petitioner, sought urgent hearing of the petition fearing the padayatra could become a superspreader event. Later, senior advocate Aravind Kamath, appearing for the petitioner, told the court Congress was taking out the rally, demanding implementation of Mekedatu project, despite the government announcing Covid restrictions. He said the yatra -- if it’s not stopped forthwith -- could cause severe damage to public health. Nagendra Prasad, one of the petitioners and manager with RMV Residents’ Welfare Association, claimed that Karnataka on Tuesday reported 12,000 infections and active cases stood at 49,602. Yet, the government has not taken any action on such a large number of people gathering in violation of rules.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-to-govt-what-are-you-waiting-for-watching/articleshow/88864369.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Event turning into ‘superspreader’: HM||Bengaluru: As the 168-km Congress padayatra completed its fourth day on Wednesday, home minister Araga Jnanendra said it could turn out to be a ‘superspreader’ event since the state is in the throes of a third wave.“I have information that a lot of people who are taking part in it are Covid positive and they could have spread it to others already. Some senior functionaries have also tested positive and are under treatment. Several party workers are participating despite testing positive,” he alleged. Jnanendra said the cases in Ramanagara and Mandya districts were less before the padayatra began but now both places have reported a huge hike. “If the surge continues, there may be a situation of imposing lockdown in the state which would further deal a blow to the people affected by the previous curbs. Some states have already imposed a lockdown. However, it is our last option,” he added.The padayatra seeking speedy implementation of the Mekedatu project began on Sunday. Congress state president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah held a breakfast meeting to assess the situation in the backdrop of criticism the party is facing over the event. “We had made several appeals to the Congress functionaries to defer this event, but it seems they are only concerned about taking political advantage and not about public health. I hope the Congress leaders who were also in power in the past will act sensibly and responsibly and call off their programme,” Jnanendra said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/event-turning-into-superspreader-hm/articleshow/88864370.cms||---

Humans bring with them a set of challenges the most prominent of which is their safety. Therefore, from developing systems for optimum performance, we are now building things that are reliable.”Further, the CE-20 will undergo four more tests for a cumulative duration of 1,810 seconds. “...Subsequently, one more engine will undergo two short-duration tests & one long-duration test to complete the cryogenic engine qualification for Gaganyaan programme,” Isro said.S Somanath, director, VSSC, who will replace Sivan as Chairman Isro and secretary Department of Space (DoS) said: “...Overall, we are still in the sub-system testing phase and have not reached the integrated-level testing phase. Testing of systems will be a continuous process and will continue during the whole cycle of the Gaganyaan programme.”And, as reported by TOI earlier, tests are in progress for human-rated L-llO Vikas engine, cryogenic stage, crew escape system motors and service module propulsion system. The S200 motor has been realised for ground testing too. Main parachute drop test has also commenced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/gaganyaan-cryo-engine-closer-to-induction-into-gslv/articleshow/88864371.cms||---

Congress MLA MB Patil, who was water resources minister in the Siddaramaiah government, accused the state government, particularly water resources minister Govind Karjol, of misleading people by presenting false information on the project to justify the delay on its part.“Our government was the first to kickstart the groundwork for Mekedatu project by preparing a pre-feasibility report after it was approved by the cabinet on March 13, 2017. A detailed project report was submitted to the Central Water Commission Bengaluru, on June 7, 2017,” Patil said.Though the CWC sought a pre-feasibility report in the wake of change in its guidelines in 2017, in 2018 it accepted the DPR on the grounds that it was not an irrigation project.On January 18, 2019, a revised DPR of Rs 9,000 crore was submitted by the JD(S)-Congress government. “But the BJP has not done anything to get the approval, though they claim to have a double-engine government,” he alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/patil-cong-laid-groundwork-double-engine-govt-delayed-it/articleshow/88864372.cms||---

The flyover has been closed for traffic since December 25. While it was expected to be opened in a week, it was later put off to on January 14.“The work on the flyover is not yet completed. We are trying to finish all essential works before January 14. However, it is time consuming and may extend by another 3-4 days,” officials from National Highways Authority of India said. With Makar Sankranti slated for the weekend and many Benaglureans expected to head to their hometowns in north and coastal Karnataka to avoid weekend curfew, traffic on the stretch is likely to get more agonising over the next few days. Prestressed cables connecting the bridges on a few pillars had slackened and the same are being fixed, traffic police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/peenya-flyover-work-to-stretch-beyond-jan-14/articleshow/88864374.cms||---

After winning the confidence of the victims who thought that they were chatting with a girl, accused Prapanch Nachappa, a resident of Fraser Town, would coax them into sharing their nude pictures with him. He would later blackmail them threatening to upload these pictures if they didn’t pay up. Nachappa is a final year BSc student in a private college in Banasawadi. Preliminary investigations revealed that he had extorted at least Rs two lakh from 30-40 victims. “He extorted between Rs 4,000 and Rs 10,000 from each victim. We are yet to scan the bank account details of the accused to know the exact amount he has extorted,” police said. Police said the accused opened a fake Instagram handle parthiksha_bohra_ in September 2021. He sent friend requests to women. He told his victims that he was into modelling and could help those wishing to become models. “He had sent a friend request to the complainant saying his (her) name was Prathiksha. and that he was looking for a lesbian relationship. He told the victim that society was shaming him for his sexual proclivities. To win the confidence of the student, the accused sent a couple of nude pictures, claiming they were his. He told her that he would give Rs 4,000 for each picture that she sent him. By now, the girl had shared some pictures of herself with the accused. She, however, sensed a trap and blocked him. Nachappa opened another Instagram account, and sent her messages, demanding money and threatening to upload her pictures if she did not pay him. The girl filed a police complaint and we tracked Nachappa to his residence recently,” an investigating officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/student-poses-as-lesbian-on-insta-blackmails-girls/articleshow/88864376.cms||---

On March 22, 2019, Sudeep Hemareddy Saswihalli, 43, of JP Nagar 7th Phase, purchased a Phonak hearing aid for Rs 2.5 lakh from Hearing Wellness Clinic in Nrupathunga Nagar and realised there was some defect in the device within a few months of use. He approached the clinic and got himself a new device, with the warranty extended till January 2023. But much to the Bengalurean’s dismay, the new hearing aid also gave him trouble. He approached the clinic and Phonak’s regional office in Langford Town, but got no positive response. Meanwhile, Hearing Wellness Clinic attempted to pacify the customer by offering him a compensation of Rs 15,000, but Sudeep refused the refund for the hearing aid worth Rs 2.5 lakh which had failed not once but twice. With no sign of relief from both parties, Sudeep finally approached the Bangalore Urban 2nd additional district consumer disputes redressal commission in Shantinagar with a complaint against Hearing Wellness Clinic and Phonak. In the court proceedings that began in December 2020, Sudeep’s lawyer presented his case, while the advocate who appeared on behalf of the clinic claimed that the hearing aid was replaced once, but the complainant had been making untenable allegations and abusing the law. Phonak representatives failed to appear in court. In their verdict pronounced on December 1, 2021, judges of the consumer forum slammed Hearing Wellness Clinic and Phonak for not addressing Sudeep’s concerns and failing to refund or replace his hearing aid, which they termed deficiency in service. The court directed the clinic and Phonak to jointly refund Rs 2.5 lakh to Sudeep, apart from paying him Rs 5,000 towards transport expenses and Rs 5,000 towards court expenses and Rs 50,000 as compensation for the trouble caused. The forum said all payments must be made within 60 days of the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengalurean-sues-clinic-maker-forfaulty-hearing-aid-wins-60000/articleshow/88864378.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Two weeks after father’s death, 10-year-old reveals he was killed||BENGALURU: A 40-year-old Doddaballapura handloom weaver who was believed to have died after a bout of fits and cremated by his family over two weeks ago was actually murdered in front of his 10-year-old son. The man’s wife, mother-in-law and wife’s boyfriend were arrested on Monday, based on the boy’s eyewitness account. The demise of Raghavendra N, a resident of Karenahalli, on December 27 was passed of as death due to severe epileptic attack by his wife, Shylaja, 30. Her son recently revealed how his father actually died. Shylaja was assisted by her mother Lakshmidevamma, 50, and boyfriend Hanumantha, 30, in eliminating Raghavendra, he revealed. CCTV footage from a handloom unit, which covers Raghavendra’s house, and phone call details between Shylaja and Hanumantha corroborated the eyewitness account. Police said Hanumantha was employed at a handloom unit and Shylaja worked with a garment factory. She met Hanumantha at her workplace and they began having an affair. This led to a clash between Raghavendra and Shylaja. She and Hanumantha allegedly hatched a plan to kill him. According to a complaint filed by Raghavendra’s younger brother Chandra Shekhar on January 7, Shylaja called him around 2.15am on December 27 and informed him that Raghavendra had sustained injuries after falling on the floor due to fits. Shekhar and his father Nanjundappa rushed to the spot and found him dead. They noticed injuries on his head. Initially, Raghavendra’s kin believed Shylaja and performed the final rites. But they suspected foul play and questioned Shylaja’s son on December 29, who revealed a man was present at his house on the day of his dad’s death. Shekhar had rushed to Raghavendra’s home, verified CCTV footage in a nearby building and noticed a man wearing a pullover had entered the house at 10.45pm. “My brother lived with his wife, mother-in-law and two kids — a son and daughter — in a rented house. My sister-in-law was at her parents’ home in Andhra Pradesh when I verified the CCTV footage and hence I delayed filing a police complaint,” Shekhar told police. Shekhar’s nephew, meanwhile, began giving more details to his grandfather Nanjundappa. According to the boy, he was sleeping and woke up on the fateful midnight after hearing some noise. “My grandmother (maternal) was holding my father’s legs and my mother was sitting on his back. Another person was hitting my father with a rolling pin. I asked them why they were hitting my father. But that person hit me and threatened to kill me if I reported this to anyone,” Raghavendra’s son told police later. Doddaballapura town police registered a case of murder and destroying evidence against the trio. Cops found blood stains on the wall at the crime scene, collected call record details of the suspects and CCTV footage and arrested them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/two-weeks-after-fathers-death10-year-old-reveals-he-was-killed/articleshow/88864379.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Expedite Phase 3 Namma Metro with focus on city areas, say experts||BENGALURU: With BMRCL setting a 2024 deadline for Namma Metro’s Phase 2, activists and commuters want Phase 3 planning to be expedited with a focus on city areas. BMRCL had earlier planned corridors like Carmelaram – Yelahanka, Marathahalli – Hosakerehalli, Bommasandra - Attibele, Gottigere- Basavanapura, RK Hegde Nagar-Aerospace Park and Kogilu Cross- Rajanukunte as part of the Phase 3 project. In the 2018-19 state budget, it was announced that BMRCL will prepare DPR for the 105-km Phase 3 corridor. In 2019, BMRCL identified three Metrolite corridors under Phase-3: Magadi Road Toll Gate to Kadabagere (13km), Whitefield– Domlur (16km) and Katamnallur Gate (near Hoskote) - Sarjapur Road-Hebbal (52km). In addition, a 34-km underground Inner Ring corridor and Hebbal to JP Nagar (ORR-West) was also proposed under this phase. In 2020, BMRCL decided to take up two Phase 3 corridors on priority— 13km Magadi Road and 42km JP Nagar-Hebbal. However, BMRCL is yet to prepare DPR even for one corridor so far. Sources said approvals from the state and Central governments, mobilising funds, land acquisition and identifying contractors will be time consuming. For instance, the DPR of the first phase of the 42-km network (Byappanahalli- Mysuru Road and Nagasandra- Yelachenahalli) was prepared in 2003 but the entire project was finally completed only in 2017. ‘Metro should focus on city areas’Activists said two corridors — Hoskerehalli- Marathahalli and Yelahanka - Carmelaram — which pass through the core city areas should be revived. While Hosakerehalli- Marathahalli line on Old Airport Road is to pass through HAL, Domlur and Town Hall, Yelahanka-Carmelaram corridor will serve areas like Hebbal, Shanthinagar, Dairy Circle, Forum Mall, Koramangala, Iblur and Carmelaram. However, BMRCL kept these two key routes under cold storage reportedly to make way for the controversial elevated corridor project. BMRCL has recently stated that Metro should focus within BBMP/BDA limits and suburban rail should be extended to nearby districts and satellite towns. Pruthvin Reddy, a commuter rail activist, said: “Hoskerehalli-Marathahalli and Yelahanka -Carmelaram are two crucial Metro lines which were scrapped for the elevated corridor project. We need more Metro lines through CBD areas and BMRCL should focus within the core city areas. BMRCL could plan more Metro or Metrolite corridors instead of elevated corridors to decongest the city. This will help people to access a Metro network every 1-2km,” he said. BMRCL officials said DPR is being prepared by RITES for two corridors: JP Nagar-Hebbal along Outer Ring Road (ORR West) and Magadi Road, from the toll gate (Hosahalli station) to Kadabagere. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “DPR of these corridors will be ready by June. We are planning a total of 317km of Metro rail network by 2030.” At present, only 56km of the network is operational. Ashish Verma, IISc associate professor (transportation systems engineering), said: “We had suggested a fully underground Inner Ring Metro (IRM) line connecting places like Yeshwantpur, Cantonment, Indiranagar, Koramangala, Ashoka Pillar and Mahalakshmi Layout. In fact, this was included in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan but it was not prioritised. In a circular city like Bengaluru, a spider-web like Metro network is required but unfortunately, the government agencies are doing little to decongest dense core city areas and are focusing on the outskirts. Expansion of the Metro network will decongest the city than road widening and flyover projects.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/expedite-metro-with-focus-on-city-areas-activists/articleshow/88864380.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Officials said they are planning to finalise the tender by February and launch the facility by May-June. “The selected firm will provide 12,000 Android-based electronic ticketing machines that could accept UPI QR-code, NCMC and closed-loop cards,” said an official.Sources said both BMRCL and BMTC had been promising implementation of AFC for the past few years but it was delayed due to various reasons. In March 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched NCMC to enable travel and payment of parking and toll charges through a single card. Bengaluru agencies, however, failed to implement it mainly because of poor coordination.Another official said implementation of AFC system will eliminate the need for conductors in BMTC buses. “We are planning to introduce 1,000 conductorless buses on interior and Metro feeder routes. The system will help facilitate contactless and cashless travel,” said a BMTC official. Many regular BMTC passengers have been demanding smart card-based travel to avoid cash transactions, especially after Covid-19.BMRCL officials said their NCMC is ready to be launched. “We will finalise the launch date after consulting the CM’s office and Union ministry of housing and urban affairs,” said a senior official. BMTC officials said passengers will be able to track buses through a new app from March-April.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bmtc-floats-tender-for-cashless-travel/articleshow/88864381.cms||---

They escaped with a warden’s mobile. According to police, the youths on the run are a 19-year-old from Nepal, who had been arrested by Rajagopalnagar police in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act case registered in 2018, and a 20-year-old from Haveri arrested by Guttal police in 2018. As the two were minors at the time of their arrest, they were lodged at the Place of Safety in the Mandira. Place of Safety is an institutional mechanism in Indian juvenile justice system, where certain categories of children in conflict with law are housed during inquiry or after conviction.

---||Business||IT attrition soars, TCS, Infy, Wipro add 50,994 in Q3||BENGALURU: TCS, Infosys and Wipro together made a net addition of 50,994 employees in the December quarter, compared to 42,829 in the September quarter. TCS added 28,238 employees on a net basis (excluding those who quit), taking the total number of employees to 5.5 lakh. TCS chief HR officer Milind Lakkad said that in addition to the 43,000 freshers the company hired in the first half of the year, it onboarded 34,000 fresh graduates in Q3. "This is higher than our full year fresher hiring numbers in prior years," he said. But attrition rates are soaring. Its LTM (last twelve month) attrition rate was 15.3%, compared to 11.9% in the previous quarter. Lakkad said a number of steps are being taken to contain attrition. "We are giving preference to internal candidates for the most exciting open positions, providing global deployment opportunities, fast tracking career paths linked to learning, and we have promoted over 110,000 employees this year. We have been able to retain our best talent and overcome supply-side challenges,” he said. Infosys added 12,450 employees to take the total headcount to 2.9 lakh employees. It saw a sharp spike in attrition to 25.5%, from 20.1% in the September quarter. CFO Nilanjan Roy said, “We continue to prioritise investments in talent acquisition and development and have further increased our global graduate hiring programme to over 55,000 for FY22 to support our growth ambitions.” The company has rolled out skill-based incentives. Wipro added 10,306 people during the quarter, taking the total strength to 2.3 lakh employees. Wipro’s attrition rose to 22.7%, from 20.5% in the previous quarter. Its president and CHRO Saurabh Govil said, “We have tried to increase supply by adding 70% more freshers in this fiscal, compared to last year -- from 9,000 to 17,000. And we are hiring 30,000 freshers for next year. We want to ring-fence talent with hot skills in areas like cloud, engineering and data. We have done two rounds of salary increases and three rounds of promotions in the last 12 months.” Govil said attrition will moderate in the coming quarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-attrition-soars-but-so-does-hiring/articleshow/88864387.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Business||Infy beats TCS, Wipro in Q3 results||BENGALURU: India’s three biggest IT companies all announced their third quarter financial results on Wednesday, and all had solid double-digit year-on-year revenue growth rates – a reflection of the massive surge in demand for IT and digital services across the world since the pandemic. But the star of the day was clearly Infosys. The company has already been the revenue growth leader in the industry for several quarters. But in the latest quarter, it had a sequential dollar revenue growth rate in constant currency (which discounts the impact of cross-currency fluctuations) of as much as 7%, compared to TCS’s 4%, and Wipro’s 3%. That performance and future visibility around its order book encouraged the company to raise its revenue guidance for the full year to 19.5%-20%, from 16.5%-17.5% that it had provided just three months ago. On the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Infosys’s share price was up 5% soon after opening, though subsequently it pared those gains a little. On the other hand, Thierry Delaporte’s excellent run at Wipro over several quarters slowed down. In the previous two quarters, the former Capgemini executive who took over as Wipro CEO in mid-2020, had beaten his own revenue guidance for those quarters. Several brokerage houses had expected him to repeat that in the latest quarter. But the 3% sequential growth rate was at the mid-way point of the guidance. Disappointed investors on NYSE pushed the company’s stock down by over 8% in morning trade. All companies said their growth was broad based, with good growth across geographies and industry verticals. All said their order-book positions are among the best ever. And all said the biggest growth is coming from new digital offerings such as cloud and data analytics. TCS CEO & MD Rajesh Gopinathan said the company is participating in all parts of customers' digital and technology transformation journeys. “We continue to build our capabilities across cloud, digital, analytics, and other areas, and we see continued strong traction across the board. We crossed a TCV (total contract value) of $7.6 billion this quarter,” he said. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the company’s deal pipeline was very strong and the overall demand environment looks very strong beyond March as well. “We are really in a situation that all the choices that we made over the last several years – building on digital, cloud and the new areas our clients are looking for – all of those digital transformation programmes are very strong and we see our execution remain good. That gave us the ability to increase our guidance for the year,” he said. The company’s large deal wins accelerated, with a TCV (total contract value) of $2.5 billion in the December quarter. Large deals are those over $50 million. Delaporte noted that the company has been consistently growing sequentially at or over 3% for five quarters now. This, he said, is because of the company’s improved execution abilities, and the follow-through on the business strategy established in November 2020. “The first nine months’ growth of 28% is six times faster than the average growth in the last 10 years,” he said. Some of that growth has, however, come from two big acquisitions Wipro did last year. TCS remained the operating margin leader, at 25%, slightly down from the previous quarter. Wipro's margin was 17.6%, again slightly down from the previous quarter, but ahead of its stated range of 17%-17.5%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/infy-beats-tcs-wipro-in-q3-results/articleshow/88864388.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Due to the strict standard operating procedures in place amid the pandemic, KOA sources said the Indian Olympic Association has limited the distance of the relay, which will be symbolic, to one kilometre. The Baton will arrive in the city on Thursday.“On Friday, Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot will receive the Baton at Vidhana Soudha before handing it over to the athletes. They will then carry the Baton to the Sree Kanteerava stadium,” sources told TOI, adding that the final details are being worked out and will be released on Thursday. Among those expected to attend the relay, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and ace cueist Pankaj Advani are down with Covid-19. “CM will not be attending the function as he is not well.

The left-hander looked out for the count after losing the opening set and falling behind 0-3 in the second, having been broken in the second game. Gunneswaran had two game points at 40-15 before the 228th ranked German struck on his second opportunity. The Indian struggled against Marterer’s serve, winning just two points on his opponent’s first serve in the 90-minute clash. Gunneswaran broke back to level at four games apiece. He then had two set points at 6-4 in the tie-break and another chance at 8-7 before Marterer won three successive points to close the match. Gunneswaran’s exit leaves Yuki Bhambri as the last Indian in singles fray at Melbourne Park. Bhambri, ranked 1049, playing his first Grand Slam match since the 2018 US Open, will take on the 20th seed Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic in the second round on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/prajnesh-out-of-qualifiers/articleshow/88864391.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Kickstart may face action, lose points over rule breach||Bengaluru: City-based club Kickstart FC is set to face disciplinary action and could lose points for breaking the rules in the just concluded BDFA Super Division league.Among the clubs who complained against Kickstart, who are currently second in the table, are Kodagu FC who ended ninth in the league. “As per the league rules, teams should field two U-21 players for the whole duration of the match. Kickstart fielded only one in their 2-1 win against Kodagu resulting in the protest,” sources told TOI.With the BDFA reportedly finding merit in the protest, Kodagu will now be awarded a 3-0 win which will lift them up to the eighth place. But Kickstart, whose tally will fall to 31 points, could face more trouble and may even lose their second place if similar complaints by Bangalore United FC and Bangalore Dream United FC are upheld by the disciplinary committee. Bangalore Eagles Football Club are now third with 30 points.Asked why the final standings had not been released a day after the league is over, BDFA sources said it was because of the protests. “There was an official protest from Kodagu FC right after the match on December 21. The other two clubs lodged their complaints much later. We have got quite a few protests and counter-protests and we have decided to probe these matches for any violation. The final standings will be released only after the scrutiny. We are working on this and the final list will be released soon,” they said.If BUFC’s complaint is upheld they will garner 21 points and regain the eighth spot ahead of Kodagu who will end up with 19. Likewise, Dream United will jump to the 12th spot with another three points in their kitty. Currently, they are behind Students Union FC (13 points) with a tally of 11 from 14 matches. ADE finished with the wooden spoon with just one point while Young Challengers FC ended second last with nine points.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/kickstart-may-face-action-lose-points-over-rule-breach/articleshow/88864392.cms||---

---||Chennai||PM Narendra Modi announces Rs 3,000 crore assistance for Tamil Nadu health infrastructure||CHENNAI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the Union government would provide Rs 3,000 crore to Tamil Nadu in the next five years under the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission to address critical gaps in health infrastructure and health research, especially at the district level. Modi was speaking through video conferencing at the inauguration of 11 new medical colleges in Tamil Nadu and a new campus of the Central Institute of Classical Tamil in Perumbakkam. He said, “This (PM-ABHIM) will help in establishing urban health and wellness centres, district public health labs and critical care blocks across the state. The benefits of this for the people of Tamil Nadu will be immense”. Commencing his 16-minute speech by extending Pongal greetings to the people of Tamil Nadu, PM quoted the famous adage “Thai piranthal vazhi pirakkum” (beginning of Tamil month Thai brings new opportunities) and said the health of society was being furthered and connection with culture was getting stronger with the inauguration of various projects. Modi said the government of India had brought many reforms in the health sector. He said, “The once-in-a-lifetime Covid-19 pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of the health sector. The future will belong to societies which invest in healthcare.” Take full advantage of central schemes, Modi urges peopleHe asked people to take full advantage of central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, which provides quality and affordable healthcare to the poor, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana that brought about a revolution in access to affordable medicines. Sanitary napkins are sold at Re 1 per pad through Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana Kendras. In the event, which was attended by governor R N Ravi and chief minister M K Stalin and ministers, Modi said medical education was one of the most desired streams for studies. “The problem of shortage of doctors in India was wellknown. But there were not enough efforts to address this problem. Perhaps vested interests also did not let previous governments make the right decisions. Ever since we have taken office, our government has worked to address this gap,” he said, reeling out statistics. The number of medical colleges in the country rose from 387 in 2014 to 596 in the last seven years. There were 82,000 UG and PG medical seats in 2014, which increased to 1. 48 lakh seats in the last seven years. He said his government had given approval for 22 AIIMS. He said medical education sector had been made more transparent and added regulations for setting up medical colleges and hospitals were liberalised without compromising on quality. “In the coming years, I envision India as being the go-to destination for quality and affordable care. India has everything needed to be a hub for medical tourism. I say this based on the skills of our doctors,” the PM said. Modi said that he was always fascinated by the richness of Tamil language and culture and recalled setting up of ‘Subramania Bharati Chair’ on Tamil Studies at Banaras Hindu University, located in his parliamentary constituency. “One of the happiest moments of my life was when I got a chance to speak a few words in the world's oldest language, Tamil, at the United Nations. The Sangam classics are our window to the rich society and culture of the ancient times,” the Prime Minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/modi-announces-3000-crore-assistance-for-tn-health-infra/articleshow/88864394.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||Space start-up from state readies for Nasa launch of its pocket satellite||Chennai: A space startup based in Tamil Nadu will have its first satellite weighing just 30gram launched by Nasa later this year. The satellite IndianSat, one of the smallest and lighest, built with 3D reinforced graphene polymer, will be a technology demonstrator carrying 11 sensors to measure 20 parameters in the space. Tospace Private Limited, the start-up, has been created by three people, including two students from Karur. Govindraj R, director and COO, Tospace, said the satellite was built as part of the ‘Cubes in Space’ programme of Idoodledu Inc in association with Nasa. “It took two years to develop IndianSat. It is scheduled to be launched by Nasa’s terrier improved-Orion suborbital sounding rocket in June 2022 from its flight facility. It will be launched at an altitude of 120km,” he said. Data measured by equipment such as ultraviolet sensor, luminosity sensor, RGB sensor and gas sensor that are onboard the satellite will be transmitted to the ground station. The startup is also working on IndianSat V2, a communication pico-satellite weighing 250gm, which has secured a slot with SpaceX for a launch towards the end of 2022 or early 2023, apart from the IndianSat V3 multispectral imaging satellite, weighing 500gm. “Our vision is to make space affordable and accessible to everyone. We have been focussing on making small satellites which can reduce the cost of satellites and rocket launches,” said Adnaan M, a final year physics student, who created the startup with Pradeeprajan R, a third-year engineering student and Govindraj, who has experience in the field of semiconductors and printed circuit boards. The team of seven at the startup has Elangovan R, a former Isro scientist, providing his technical expertise. The start-up aims to provide various services including satellite building and launch and ground station support while also focussing on r&d and promoting STEM subjects among students. “It is very encouraging for startups like us that India is promoting and enabling private players to carry out independent space activities. We will soon scale up our operations and are looking for investments,” said Govindaraj.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/space-start-up-from-state-readies-for-nasa-launch-of-its-pocket-satellite/articleshow/88864395.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||Chennai||Chennai: Metrowater tender process goes online||CHENNAI: Taking a cue from the city corporation, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) or Metrowater, has made its tender process completely online. The change has been implemented in Metrowater’s four recent tenders, with it asking all competitors to bid as well as make the earnest money deposit, which is 1% of the project cost, online. The tenders are for laying of pipeline at Chembarambakkam lake, purchase of iron pipes, maintenance of treatment plant and pumping stations at Veeranam lake, and buying of machineries for the maintenance of sewage pipelines. “Earlier, we called tenders online, but bidders would take print-outs of documents and put them inside boxes outside offices of executive engineers and superintending engineers. The tenders would then be scrutinised and names announced. Now, the entire system has been made online,” said a CMWSSB superintending engineer. Apart from ensuring more transparency, officials opined, this would help the board save money as it would enable better competition, which wasn’t possible in the earlier system. TOI had reported how goondas were placed outside offices and contractors were locked up in hotels to ensure only specific contractors won the bids. In some cases, bid amounts had been changed after tenders were opened. CMWSSB awards contracts worth more than 2,500 crore every year. Of this, about 250 crore is for maintenance alone. Though there are nearly 600 contractors in the city, only a few bid for such projects. Some of these contractors fall under class I and can bid for projects above 75 lakh. While a group of activists welcome the metro water’s move, some demand that the state government amend the Transparency in Tenders Act, making online tender process mandatory in all departments. “We have petitioned the chief minister and the finance minister and are hopeful that it would be implemented this year. The Chennai corporation took 15 years to completely implement the online system, but they are already reaping the benefits,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of NGO Arappor Iyakkam. Officials, however, should look out for tender conditions that allow only certain contractors to participate and ensure such conditions are removed, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/metrowater-tender-process-goes-online/articleshow/88864396.cms||Komal Gautham

He appealed to the non-resident Tamils (NRTs) to shed their differences and prosper by making use of opportunities abroad. He urged them to maintain their connections and strengthen their roots in Tamil Nadu. Hailing the Tamil as a powerful tool to bring all Tamils together wherever they lived, the CM said, “The land and countries can divide us, but the language binds us together. The Tamil language has such a power to connect us. It has the power to defeat the religious and caste divide. Hence, we adopted the slogan ‘we connect through Tamil’,” said Stalin.The government has formed a non-resident Tamils (NRTs) welfare board and announced various welfare schemes for them. Though they did not have voting rights in Tamil Nadu, they can proclaim the government here as their own, said the CM while addressing the NRTs, who participated in the virtual programme organised by the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils to celebrate the Tamil Diaspora Day.Stalin listed out schemes for NRTs to assist them financially for a livelihood when they return to their native places in the state. The government has started the NRT welfare board with a corpus fund of Rs 5 crore for welfare schemes. The government had also implemented Rs 317 crore projects for Sri Lankan Tamils in TN.The government would soon create a database of non-resident Tamils and launch a mobile application to reach out to NRTs, who are in need of help, said the CM. Tamils were living in large numbers in 30 countries, while a lesser number of Tamils were in 60 other countries, he said and dubbed them as “ambassadors of Tamil Nadu” on foreign land. Stalin recalled the initiatives of the DMK regime under M Karunanidhi for the welfare of NRTs and the enactment of The Tamil Nadu Non-Resident Tamils’ Welfare Act 2011 to implement welfare schemes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/land-and-countries-divide-us-but-language-binds-us-says-stalin/articleshow/88864397.cms||---

The industries minister told reporters in Chennai that it was the AIADMK government that indulged in the ‘sticker culture’ (grabbing credit for the programmes of the previous government) by pasting stickers. “It was the AIADMK which pasted stickers on ‘samacheer kalvi’ textbooks of the government, over the name of late chief minister M Karunanidhi in government projects, and even on the relief materials donated by the private institutions, voluntary organisations during the Gaja cyclone. They even pasted the stickers on sugarcane, just to seek publicity,” the minister charged. Palaniswami on Tuesday accused the DMK government of attempting to take credit for the 11 new medical colleges for which funds were allocated during his regime. Thennarasu said the image of chief minister was not to be seen in the Pongal bag or in any other programme of the DMK government. “There is no need for us (DMK) to paste stickers like they (AIADMK) did,” the industries minister said, detailing how the AIADMK took credit for projects like the Hogennakkal drinking water supply scheme conceived and implemented by the previous DMK regime. Thennarasu alleged that the AIADMK inaugurated the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus in Koyambedu, implemented by the DMK, by removing the party’s plaque. The New Secretariat Complex built by the DMK was turned into Omandurar hospital by the AIADMK.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/industries-minister-slams-palaniswami-for-sticker-culture/articleshow/88864399.cms||---

They include a Shiva Chandrasekhara idol stolen from Sripuranthan temple in Ariyalur district by jailed idol smuggler Subhash Kapoor, an exquisitely carved Nataraja and his consort Sivakamasundari. Kapoor is now lodged in Trichy prison in Tamil Nadu.  Busting yet another major idol smuggling racket, the US attorney for the southern district of New York and an acting special agent of the Department of Homeland Security announced on January 11 the filing of a civil complaint seeking forfeiture of 35 Cambodian and Southeast Asian antiquities from a private American collection for the purpose of returning them to their countries of origin. “This is a tremendous result for us as we have been looking for the Chola bronze Shiva Chandrasekhara stolen from Sripuranthan by Subhash Kapoor for over a decade now. Today we can disclose that homeland security agents have traced it and successfully taken possession of the bronze from an American collector,” said India Pride Project co-founder S Vijay Kumar. The organization constitutes art enthusiasts, who work to restore stolen Indian antiquities. Antiquities dealer Douglas Latchford sold the collection to its present owner, the American collector with false statements and fake provenance documents intended to hide the fact the antiquities were the products of looting, and then imported them through lies on customs paperwork, said a release from the US attorney office’s office. The collector has voluntarily relinquished possession of the antiquities, it added. The American collector had obtained many Cambodian artefacts from now deceased dealer Douglas Latchford as well as the Chandrasekhara bronze which Latchford purchased from Kapoor. “This proved crucial as we could provide clear matches from the pre-theft in situ photographs from the French institute in Pondicherry. Further, the same collector had also in his possession the beautiful Chola bronze Nataraja and his consort Sivakamasundari which have also been taken over,” said Vijay Kumar. The Tamil Nadu idol wing, led by ADGP Jayanth Murali, is yet to be apprised of the development. Latchford started his collecting odyssey on stolen Chola bronzes and his apartments in Bangkok and London prominently featured them. “We are still searching for many such tainted Kapoor and Latchford artefacts and today's result should show the collecting lobby that there is no running away from such actions. They should consider doing the right thing, which is to return the stolen Gods,” said Vijay Kumar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-to-get-back-three-more-of-its-idols-soon/articleshow/88864401.cms||Jaya Menon

The arrest was made based on a complaint from Child Welfare Committee official Lalitha, who was tipped off about the sale of the baby. Police said Vijayalakshmi, 30, of Kannagi Nagar and her husband Chinndurai, 35, decided to sell their ten-month-old baby Muthuraj, due to poverty. Chinnadurai, an auto driver, remained jobless during lockdown and the couple decided to sell their baby for money. When the neighbours asked them about the baby, they told them that he was being brought up by his grandmother. The neighbours however did not believe their version and were always suspicious. The couple approached a woman broker, Thangam, 45,who agreed to take the baby for a sum of 85,000. The couple is said to have demanded more money but she refused citing that it was illegal and she was taking a risk. However she took the baby and sold it to a couple Navaneetham, 64 and Pandurangan, from Red Hills for 3 lakh. The child was kept at Putlur in Andhra Pradesh. The CWC official Lalitha, who came to know about the sale, lodged a complaint with Red Hills police. She requested them to rescue the baby, after which a team was fanned out to AP, searching for the baby. Red Hills police who probed the case arrested the trio Vijayalakshmi, Thangam and Navaneetham. Police have launched a hunt for one more person who was behind the child selling the racket. Police are also probing if the broker was involved in selling anyother babies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mother-among-3-arrested-for-selling-10-month-old-baby/articleshow/88864402.cms||---

However, the sale will not earn the Indian company ‘any consideration’. According to a stock market notification by M&M, which holds 75% in Ssangyong, a consortium led by South Korean electric busmaker Edison Motors has agreed to acquire the debt-ridden Ssangyong for Rs 1,882 crore through a primary equity investment. “We are happy to hear that Edison Motors consortium has formally agreed to acquire Ssangyong Motor Company and that the acquisition will progress to the next stage, in a defined time frame,” said an M&M spokesperson. “We will cooperate with the new investor in enabling the transition.” The Edison led consortium has asked for 95% stake in Ssangyong and the investment agreement was executed on January 10, 2022. Following the capital restructuring “undertaken as part of the rehabilitation process,” M&M’s “holding in SYMC will reduce”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ev-co-edison-to-buy-mms-ssangyong/articleshow/88864408.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Traffic cop makes street girl’s quest for education smooth ride||CHENNAI: Schools have been closed and accessing online classes is a problem for Deepika, a pavement dweller, but help has come in the shape of S Mahendran, a police constable. His tuitions on the Flower Bazaar pavement, even as vehicles whizz by, have provided timely assistance to the 12-year-old. Her parents Ranjith and Sudha are fruit vendors who have three other children. Last year, during a lockdown, the 12-year-old student of a government middle school in the locality was glued to her notebook on a pavement, even as others of her age were playing, when Mahendra saw her. The native of Kallakurichi, who is attached to the Flower Bazaar traffic enforcement wing, was on his way to board a train. The undivided attention she gave to solving mathematical problems, amid the various distractions at the spot, caught the 29-year-old’s eye and he sat down next to her. A brief conversation with the girl was enough to gauge her talent and Mahendran, a graduate in mathematics, decided he would continue to help her as much as he could. Since then, whenever he crossed the stretch, Deepika would come up with her textbook, asking him to clear her doubts. “It was the child’s interest that made me help her. She would grasp things so easily,” says Mahendran. “I hope she gets a good education, which will help turn her life around ,” he adds. Though a few other children of the area too joined her, they did not take as much interest in studies as Deepika, he says. So taken up with her teacher is the child that she runs to the place wherever he is posted to get her doubts cleared. “I love mathematics and the help from my sir is God's gift to me. I want to study well, but at the same time I don’t want to trouble my father financially,” says the girl. Deepika, who says her ambition is to become a maths teacher, has dreams of flying high, but unfortunately, her family situation has left her wings clipped. Greater Chennai police commissioner Shankar Jiwal has lauded Mahendran for his gesture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/traffic-cop-makes-street-girls-quest-for-edu-smooth-ride/articleshow/88864410.cms||Sindhu Kannan
---||Chennai||TVS Grp rejig as part of family settlement starts||Chennai: As part of the ongoing family settlement, the TVS Group has announced a series of demergers and amalgamations involving holding company TV Sundram Iyengar & Sons (TVSS) and group companies like TVS Motor Company, Sundaram Clayton, Sundaram Industries, Southern Roadways, TVS Sundram Fasteners, Wheels India, TVS Srichakra among others. As part of a composite scheme approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLAT) Chennai bench last week, Sundaram Industries and Southern Roadways have been merged into TVSS and dissolved “without the process of winding up”. As result of this merger, the shareholding of Southern Roadways and Sundaram Industries in various group companies have been transferred to TVSS to be further transferred to respective holding companies on February 4.For instance, Sundaram Industries and Southern Roadways’ 44.94% stake in Sundaram Clayton, which is the promoter of TVS Motor, has been transferred to TVSS following which TVSS’ stake in Sundaram Clayton has gone up from 19.78% to 64.72%. On February 4, which is the second appointed date for the process, the two-wheeler, auto parts and die casting business of TVSS comprising equity shares of Sundaram Clayton and also of TVS Motor held through Sundaram Clayton will be demerged from TVSS and moved to TVS Holdings Pvt Ltd (THPL). TVSS had indirectly acquired just over 52% voting rights in TVS Motor, which will also transfer to THPL. Similarly, the shareholding of Southern Roadways in Sundram Fasteners comprising 24.16% stake has been transferred to TVSS. As a result, TVSS’ holding in Sundram Fasteners has gone up from 25.37% to 49.53%. Sundaram Industries does not hold any shares in Sundram Fasteners. Ditto for Wheels India which too will see a similar transfer of stake. The Southern Roadways’ stake in Wheels India comprising 9.28% has been transferred to TVSS. This has increased TVSS’ stake in Wheels India from 20.41% to 29.69%. Sundaram Industries does not hold any shares in Wheels India. On February 4, the Sundaram Motors and Madras Auto Service Dealership and automotive business of TVSS, which includes stake in Wheels India as well as India Motor Parts & Accessories Limited (IMPAL), will be demerged and transferred to Trichur Sundaram Santhanam & Family Private Limited (TSSFPL). IMPAL as part of the promoter/ promoter group holds 4.57% of Wheels India, while TVSS holds 21.87% in IMPAL. Post transfer, TSSFPL will therefore acquire 29.69% in Wheels India directly and 4.57% indirectly through IMPAL.Similarly Sundaram Industries’ 6.45% stake and Southern Roadways’ 12.16% stake in Sundaram Brake Linings has been transferred to TVSS increasing its shareholding in Sundaram Brake Linings from 14.05% to 32.67%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tvs-grp-rejig-as-part-of-family-settlement-starts/articleshow/88864411.cms||---

Leading edtech firms, under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), on Wednesday announced the formation of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC). The IEC has committed to observe and adhere to a common ‘Code of Conduct’ and establish a two-tier grievance redressal mechanism for consumers. “Aligned with the government’s recent advisory, the IEC will ensure that every learner shall have access to quality and affordable education, which not only improves their academic performance but also makes them future-ready,” a statement from IAMAI said.

Over the past three days, 200 trucks with about 2,000 tonnes of sugarcane have arrived at the market. A bundle of sugarcane, comprising 18 to 20 pieces, is sold for an average Rs 300 to Rs 400. However, there were few takers. Last year, a bundle cost about Rs 700 to Rs 800 due to great demand. Meanwhile, a pack of three to four turmeric cost about Rs 60 to Rs 80 on Wednesday. The market received only 175 tonne of turmeric from Gummidipoondi in Tiruvallur district. ‘Madurai Malli’ variety of jasmine sourced from Nilakottai in Dindigul is sold for 1,500 to 2,000 per kg, about 500 more compared to last Pongal. The items may be costlier at neighbourhood markets. S Srinivasan, president of Chennai Fruits Commission Agents Association, said more sugarcane arrivals are expected on Thursday and Pongal day which will help keep prices low. “A bundle was sold for 250 to 500 on Wednesday,” he said, adding that sales have reduced due to the Covid surge. “We are expecting better sales in the next two days,” he said. V R Soundararajan, former member of the Market Management Committee, said turmeric cultivation in Erode and Thuraiyur took a bad hit during the rain and resulted in poor arrivals. S Mookaiah of Chennai Koyambedu Flower Traders Association said flowers from Chennai’s neighbours were not available this time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sugarcane-rates-dip-to-300-for-a-bundle-of-18-ahead-of-pongal/articleshow/88864416.cms||---

Justice M Dhandapani passed the order, concurring with the submissions of senior counsel P Wilson on Wednesday. The case was filed by D Suresh, assistant professor, department of general medicine, Madras Medical College, seeking implementation of the quota. According to the petitioner, in admissions to super-specialty courses, particularly in respect to state quota seats, 50% of slots were earmarked for in-service candidates and selection conducted by way of preparation of two lists — one for service candidates and another for open quota with further condition that the service candidates are also entitled to compete in the open quota. However, in view of orders passed by the Supreme Court, the reservation was discontinued from 2017. Subsequently, the matter was referred to a larger bench of the Supreme Court which held that the state had the legislative competence to provide for a separate source of entry for in-service candidates seeking admission to PG medical courses in exercise of powers under Entry 25 List-III of the Constitution, senior advocate P Wilson said. Though the state passed a government order providing the reservation in 2020 the same was not permitted by the Medical Counselling Committee, Director-General of Health Services, Union ministry of health taking the issue once again to the SC. Since counselling for the academic year 2020-21 has commenced, the SC said it could not permit the reservation for that year, the petitioner said. Now, since the admission processes for the current academic year is likely to commence, the petitioner made a representation to the authorities to implement the 2020 GO passed by the state government. Since no action was taken, the petitioner approached the high court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/implement-50-super-specialty-quota-for-serving-govt-docs-hc/articleshow/88864419.cms||Suresh Kumar

One property, measuring 66.7 acres and with a document claiming it belonged to 10 people of Ettayapuram Zamin, was registered at Royapuram SRO with the guideline value of a nearby plot as the property in question wasn’t assigned a value, the complaint said.Despite the marshland being declared a reserved forest in 2007, about 10 acres was registered between 2010 and 2013, the NGO said. In some cases, survey numbers were created by officials though there was no survey number in the village revenue land records, the complaint said.At a virtual press conference, Jayaram Venkatesan said the registration department should have initiated action against five officials for irregularities. These officials, however, now hold senior positions such as assistant inspector general of registration in Chennai and Madurai and lead positions in the intelligence wing of the department, he pointed out. “Why wasn’t any action taken against them for engaging in fraudulent registrations,” he asked.To a query, he said about 1,700 acres of the marshland had been handed over to the forest department. “Of this, we estimate 200 acres to 300 acres have been illegally registered as properties. The forest department must physically verify this,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/fake-registration-of-pallikaranai-marsh-ngo-seeks-action-on-corrupt-officials/articleshow/88864423.cms||---

TRS sources said party working president and minister KT Rama Rao is playing an important role and has been in touch with several leaders of regional parties. If rumours are to be believed, the TRS leadership is in touch with JD(S) leader and former CM of Karnataka HD Kumaraswamy, National Conference vice-president and ex-CM of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah and others. The TRS is also in touch with Shiv Sena leaders in Maharashtra to form an alternative front, sources said. Party sources recalled that KCR has good relations with former PM HD Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy. When Kumaraswamy became CM of Karnataka in May 2018, KCR along with party leaders had gone to Bengaluru to congratulate him on his victory in the polls. Similarly, KTR shares excellent relations with Abdullah. Political analysts said KCR has intensified his efforts to get the federal front rolling and prepare the alliance for the next general elections. “As many as 32 parties had supported the cause of separate statehood for Telangana during the movement. Some leaders have called up KCR congratulating his renewed efforts on the federal front which they believe is the need of the hour,” a TRS MP said.Leaders like Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav have earlier supported the Telangana CM who, during a recent meeting with Communist parties, had said the SP will come to power in Uttar Pradesh polls. Akhilesh had visited Hyderabad in 2019. TRS sources said KCR will go to Delhi after a couple of months to meet the leaders. With the national capital witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases and five states heading for crucial polls, the TRS chief will undertake the tour at a later date, sources said. “KCR has a good equation with NCP leader Sharad Pawar and his daughter and MP Supriya Sule is a friend of KCR’s daughter K Kavitha. He will also meet AAP chief and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders,” a party senior leader said. TRS secretary general and MP K Keshava Rao, who is currently under isolation after he tested positive for Covid-19, will also be roped in for consultations with other allies of UPA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-in-touch-with-parties-kcr-keen-on-federal-front/articleshow/88864433.cms||Koride Mahesh

The team conducted a preliminary inspection at the temple site on Tuesday.The severed head was placed at the temple on the roadside on January 10. The incident has sent shockwaves across the state.Ramana Reddy, however, said that it was up to police to probe if it was a human sacrifice or not. “Irrespective of that, it is a ghastly murder and the culprits must be brought to book,” he said. Police are yet to trace the torso.The man was identified as 30-year-old Jaihind Naik of Shunyampadu thanda in Palakeedu mandal of Suryapet district. While police said Naik was a vagabond, the JVV team said from what they had gathered from their interactions with family members, he was working in Turka Yamjal village near Ibrahimpatnam.

---||Hyderabad||Bifurcation blues: Telangana tells Andhra Pradesh to pay up Rs 12,111 crore power dues||HYDERABAD: Telangana has demanded a quick resolution of all pending bifurcation issues with neighbour Andhra Pradesh and urged the Centre to settle them at the earliest. At a joint meeting on the bifurcation issues between the two states on Wednesday, Telangana slammed AP for dragging its feet on resolving the issues and demanded payment of dues from AP and Centre to the state immediately. On the power bills issue, Telangana said it should get dues of Rs 12,111 crore from AP. Telangana insisted it should get money spent on common institutions and higher education institutes. Since some issues were pending with the high court, Telangana suggested to AP to withdraw cases for an amicable settlement of the pending issues. Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla held a virtual meeting with chief secretaries of Telangana and AP. Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar, principal secretary to CM S Narsing Rao, special chief secretaries Sunil Sharma and K Ramakrishna Rao, principal secretaries Jayesh Ranjan and Vikas Raj and senior officials were present. The meeting discussed eight issues — payment of power dues to APGenco by Telangana discoms, dispute over Schedule IX and X institutions’ bifurcation, division of AP State Financial Corporation, division of Singareni Collieries Company Limited and its subsidiary company AP Heavy Machinery Engineering Ltd, dispute over allocation of AP Bhavan in Delhi, apportionment of tax arrears and refund as per the AP Reorganisation Act and division of cash balance and bank deposits — mainly. Telangana said it had taken a firm stand that unless court cases were withdrawn, it cannot go ahead with bifurcation of Schedule IX and X institutions. On the division of cash balance and bank deposits, Telangana argued that Rs 495 crore was due from the Centre for the last seven years while AP owed Rs 315 crore towards money spent on common institutions such as high court, Raj Bhavan, etc. “Even expenditure like sharing of buildings under construction, welfare fund of Rs 456 crore and resumption of net credit forward of Rs 208 crore have also not been paid,” Somesh Kumar said. AP said Telangana power utilities owe Rs 3,442 crore. However, Telangana retorted. “Telangana is deprived of low-cost hydel power from Sileru hydro power project. Due to which, Telangana power discoms are forced to procure high-cost power, which is causing a huge financial burden for the discoms. AP should withdraw the case on power dues in the high court,” the state government said. To resolve the issues, Bhalla suggested that two nodal officers be appointed to look into the cash balance and refund issues. While Telangana nominated Ramakrishna Rao, AP named special chief secretary SS Rawat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bifurcation-blues-t-tells-ap-to-pay-up-12k-cr-power-dues/articleshow/88864436.cms||Koride Mahesh

More awareness about its effectiveness to reduce transmission as well as options to get cheaper N95 masks has resulted in many preferring this over surgical or cloth masks, dealers and shopkeepers said.“With the availability of low-cost N95 masks and price ranging from Rs 20 to Rs 300, many people are buying them,” said M Vikas Verma, a shopkeeper.Previously, these masks were mostly used by healthcare workers and those who had regular contact with the public, said Anand Jain, a distributor of health care products. “But ordinary citizens are also now preferring these masks. It is best to wear them only once or at best two to three times, not repeatedly,” said Jain.According to studies, N95 masks provide the best protection when both the infected and non-infected wear them during direct contact. Ordinary surgical or cloth masks do not provide the same level of protection even though they were used a lot in previous waves.The imposition of fine for not wearing a mask has also increased overall sales, shopkeepers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ordinary-masks-out-n95-inas-3rd-wave-surge-hits-home/articleshow/88864442.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

While students affiliated to CBSE and ICSE schools have finished their first term exam, state board students are facing uncertainty.As per the academic calendar, state board schools conduct pre-board exams by January-end or February. The SSC exams commence in March. However, due to the pandemic, the SSC exams were scheduled in May for the last two years. Now, with the government declaring holidays till January 16, and rumours on extension of the same, many state board schools are worried over conduct of pre-boards for SSC students. “Ever since schools reopened, barely 90 days of physical classes have been conducted. In February, all schools will have to conduct pre-board exams. Considering the prevailing conditions, we are uncertain if the government is even keen to reopen schools. This would have a severe impact on all students, especially those set to appear for SSC exams,” said Sadula Madhusudan, general secretary of Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association. As per the academic calendar, the academic year 2021-22 concludes by April. However, the TRSMA has written to the state government for an extension of the academic calendar and holding examinations for all classes in April. Teachers say students are underprepared. “Many students are still not attending online classes. We have so many students who still don’t have concepts cleared in subjects such as maths and science and need a lot of hand-holding. And we have constant pressure to ensure that the pass percentage doesn’t drop,” said Shailaja, a government teacher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ssc-schools-in-a-bind-over-fateof-pre-boards/articleshow/88864447.cms||Preeti Biswas

Prasadam is also prepared in larger quantities. However, after receiving orders on restrictions, all work has come to a halt, said a temple official in Secunderabad.

In fact, some popular Vaishnavite shrines in the city including the TTD-owned Venkateswara Swamy temples in Himayathnagar (Liberty) and Jubilee Hills, Venkateswara Swamy temple at Chikkadpally, Ranganathaswamy temple at Jiyaguda, Balaji Venkateswara Swamy temple at Alwal, among others, have decided to do away with the Vaikuntha Dwara Darshanam on Thursday. “We have decided to close the Birla temple on Thursday and requested devotees not to come to the temple. The rituals of lord Venkateswara will be performed internally,” said executive officer of Birla Mandir, Shyam Kothari. Similarly, the Venkateswara Perumal temple in Secunderabad too has will be out of bounds for people. “The rituals will be performed internally at the sanctum sanctorum. Keeping with the endowments department’s instructions we have made no arrangements for darshan this time. Last year, close to 1.5 lakh devotees visited the temple on this day,” said its executive officer, K P Satya Murthy. While the popular Balaji temple at Chilkur has decided to keep its doors open for devotees, all those turning up for darshan will have to strictly follow Covid-19 norms, authorities said. “Devotees will be allowed to stand in queue and follow social distance. Everyone has to wear a mask,” said C SRangarajan, Balaji temple’s hereditary archak. The usual buzz in the city — days ahead of Vaikuntha Ekadashi — has also been missing.

ED has been conducting money laundering probe against several Indian NBFCs and their fintech partner mobile apps, which were booked by Telangana police in multiple FIRs for illegal lending and using extortionist means to recover exorbitant rate of interest from customers. ED investigation had revealed that various Indian companies, which were flush with investments from China and Hong Kong created memorandum of understanding (MoU) with defunct NBFCs and gave security deposits in the name of ‘performance guarantees’. NBFCs opened separate merchant IDs with payment gateways like Paytm, Razorpay and allowed these fintech companies to start full-scale online lending operations. “Against RBI guidelines, Indian NBFCs allowed fintech companies to piggyback on their licence and do full-scale lending in their names. Mobile apps of the fintech companies were providing unsecured instant micro personal loans for term ranging between seven days and 14 days. They used to deduct 15-25% of the loan at the time of disbursement itself in the name of processing fee. The rate of interest charged was also exorbitant. Their apps would also capture customers’ mobile data. In order to obtain more profits, they resorted to harsh recovery measures via call centres,” ED alleged.ED further said that personal data of the customers was misused, calls were made to their friends and relatives and abusive language was used. Even social media posts were made against the defaulters to shame them. These apps managed to have a recovery rate of over 90% and earned huge profits.Kudos Finance and Investment Private Limited, an NBFC, signed MoUs with 39 fintech companies and illegally accepted ‘security deposits’ from them and allowed them to do lending activity. With the help of extortionist-type call centres, they generated profits of 544 crore for the apps and earned a commission of 24 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/loan-app-case-ed-seizes-72-cr-of-finance-firms/articleshow/88864452.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Since 2017, Chinese manja maimed 429 birds in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GHSPCA) workers have found a total of 429 birds that were injured due to Chinese manja getting entangled across the city since 2017. The ban on Chinese manja was declared in January 2016, under Section 5 of Environment Protection Act, 1986. According to Soudharm Bhandari, an animal welfare officer (AWO), every year, around 20 to 25 birds die due to Chinese manja and many of them sustain grievous injuries. “Around 20% of birds, especially pigeons taken for treatment after sustaining an injury due to the manja tend to die,” Bhandari said. The glass-coated thread continues to be sold across Hyderabad’s kite market. Since the pandemic, little has been done to enforce the Chinese manja ban and many vendors cash in on the demand for manja during the Sankranti season. Bhandari explains that in GHSPCA alone, they rescued eight such birds since January 1. The impact of Chinese manja on birds and other animals is not just restricted to Sankranti alone as the discarded threads remain on branches and injure small birds. “Last year, during Holi, an Indian spotted eagle was stuck on a tree branch as it was entangled in Chinese manja. While we managed to save the bird, the manja had cut through one of its legs and now it has to live the rest of its life in captivity,” Bhandari said. Experts note that another common reason for birds dying due to Chinese manja is that most people are unaware of the ways of removing the thread from the bird. They tend to use blades, knives or scissors which can harm the bird. According to GHSPCA’s records, a high number of birds were injured by Chinese manja back in 2018, with 156 birds getting injured. In 2017, as many as 106 birds were injured. Last year, 56 birds were injured. As per Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, any person found to be violating the rules is liable for imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine up to 1 lakh or both.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/since-17-chinese-manja-maimed-429-birds-in-city/articleshow/88864454.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Adding to its plethora of environmental issues is the latest development of an ‘inland delta’ on one of the corners of the once pristine lake. This inland delta is the result of sewage building up and the growth of algae, further polluting the water body. A satellite image of the Hussainsagar lake by the World Resources Institute (WRI), India, shows that in the last 10 days there has been an accumulation of green colour due to algal growth. The image also revealed black coloured sewage flowing into the water body. An inland delta has been created due to the presence of the pollutants. The image was taken on January 3 around midnight. P Raj Bhagat, senior manager, WRI-India, Bengaluru, tweeted on January 10 that “satellite image of Hyderabad from last week shows green-colour algae filled polluted Hussainsagar lake and black coloured sewage flowing into it and creating an inland delta as it enters the lake”. Bhagat told TOI that he had been studying water bodies including those in Hyderabad for the last 10 years. He said he had noticed high levels of pollution in most of the lakes in the city through satellite imagery. Asked how the pollution levels in the Hussainsagar lake had changed in the last week or fortnight, he said weekly comparison is not possible as the satellites images are affected by many parameters. “It depends on how much cloud cover is there over the city for satellites to observe,” he said adding the pollution in Hyderabad’s lakes has been increasing. WRI-India has been closely working with Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) in the cleaning of the Hussainsagar lake. It had set up a fully automatic floating solid waste clean-up system in Picket Nala, one of the inlet channels of the lake. According to a WRI document on Hussainsagar lake, waste material that makes its way into water bodies affect the biodiversity particularly the aquatic life. The avian fauna that depends on water bodies for food is also hit badly. Over the years the Hussainsagar lake has lost its natural ability of rejuvenation with high loads of pollutants bombarding the water body. Its waters are contaminated by chemical, pharmaceutical, municipal, and industrial pollutants. Several research studies conducted earlier revealed that the Hussainsagar lake is practically dead and a Swedish research body had gone to the extent of extracting pharma residues from the lake waters and producing a pill. The pharma residues included drugs meant for treatment of cancers, mental disorders and infectious diseases. Last year, the genetic material of novel coronavirus was extracted from Hussainsagar lake indicating the presence of the pandemic virus in the water body.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/delta-forms-in-hsagar-as-filth-spills-algae-blooms/articleshow/88864455.cms||Syed Akbar

While there is an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) ban on construction within a 200-metre radius of the over 400-year-old monument, a house is being built barely 100 metres from it at Char Kaman. By the time Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials acted on being alerted by the ASI, which approached the civic body after getting complaints, the house foundation was laid with a compound wall surrounding all four sides diagonally opposite to Charminar’s scaffolding. “The idea behind the construction ban is to reduce the scope of spalling of the centuries-old monument. Already, heavy traffic in the area has resulted in one of its minarets collapsing two years ago,” Krishna Rao, a civil engineering expert and former professor with JNTU, said. Locals said that illegal constructions keep cropping up in the area. Previously, three small shops were illegally constructed near the monument and civic officials stalled another building on 400 square yards nearby. “Just climb onto one of the terraces near the monument and you can see many illegal constructions. Officials have turned a blind eye to these issues, until ASI or protestors intervene,” Mohammed Rizwan, a local, said. While GHMC officials said that they stalled the work on the house immediately after receiving information, a senior town planning official explained that it was easy to stop such constructions, but difficult to raze the already constructed portion. “Construction or demolition surrounding Charminar will have the same adverse effect on the monument. Anything further can be done only after consulting civil engineering experts and ASI officials,” the town planning official in the Charminar zone said on condition of anonymity. Officials also said that notices were issued to the builder involved in the illegal construction and legal action will be taken against him as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/illegal-construction-just-100m-from-charminar-stopped-after-protests/articleshow/88864456.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

While the GHMC recently announced that 418 crore was saved in the power bill in the last five years due to the installation of LED lights across the city, a substantial proportion of the lights stands defective. According to official data, complaints on streetlights happened to be the largest with an average of 6,000 to 6,500 complaints after sanitation. These complaints were received by GHMC via dial 100, GHMC’s official portal and on its Twitter page.Also, another complaint that residents often raise is that the lights are turned on late in the evening and not before the mandated timing. “In some areas where the streetlights are not working, we have not received a complaint and hence, a delay occurs in restoring it. In areas where a complaint has been filed, we have strict SOPs in place and ensure that the streetlight is rectified within the target deadline to redress the grievance,” an official from the electrical wing told TOI. Sources said several streetlights became defunct after the heavy monsoon rains in July last year. Social activist Harish Daga, however, said actual LED bulbs glowing in the streets was less than 73%. “The entire LED bulb installation was a non-starter for a long time while it was supposed to be completed in 2015. The GHMC has no control over the contractor and it was eventually delayed which was a lost opportunity to save more via power bill,” Harish told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/defunct-streetlights-not-repaired-many-left-in-dark/articleshow/88864458.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

ED initiated investigation under PMLA on the basis of FIR registered by CBI, Economic Offences Wing, Chennai, against Babu, Digital PC Technologies Limited and its directors Karvendula Vijay Kumar Chanakya and others. The CBI chargesheet alleged that Kishore took a bribe of Rs 50 Lakh from Chanakya to provide finance to Digital PC Technologies Limited on the basis of fake trade receivables. Chanakya subsequently cheated the financing firm and diverted the loan for personal gain. The account became a non-performing asset (NPA) and the total loss caused to Global Trade Finance Limited, Hyderabad, was around Rs 9.32 crore, the chargesheet said. Investigations revealed that Babu had systematically layered the bribe proceeds of Rs 50 Lakh received from Digital PC Technologies Limited by making cash deposits in his bank accounts and utilised this amount to buy the flat in Silver Springs, Czech Colony, Sanathnagar, which has now been seized.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-flat-worth-30-lakh-in-pmla-case/articleshow/88864461.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Kolkata||PIB’s tweet on Vivekananda and 1857 freedom war stuns experts||Kolkata: Kolkatans have reacted with shock and surprise to the Press Information Bureau’s tweet from a Government of India biweekly online news magazine that mentions Swami Vivekananda as among those who influenced the 1857 First War of Independence.‘New India Samachar’, in its first edition of 2022 published on January 11, said: “During the Bhakti movement, the saints and mahants of this country whether it is Swami Vivekananda, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramana Maharshi were concerned about its spiritual consciousness. It served as the precursor to the revolt of 1857.” PIB tweeted this as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations.On Wednesday, which happened to be the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, some ridiculed the lack of a sense of history while others read between the lines. Vivekananda was born on January 12, 1863 while the First War of Independence took place between May 10, 1857 and July 8, 1859. PIB’s Twitter handle has since “regretted” and “corrected” the error but it is far from being forgotten in Kolkata. Historian Rajat Kanta Ray didn’t rule out politics at play behind the move. “The first supposition of this being a simple error is so improbable that one might resort to a second interpretation. There is a trend of taking refuge in imaginary and abstract history where time is not a factor. This is done to confuse the readers,” he said. “Earlier on, books were published mentioning that Taj Mahal was a Hindu palace,” Ray continued. “I find a similarity between this and the kind of mentality that equates the two epics with history. Since there was no contribution of RSS in the freedom movement, all this could be a ploy to change the narrative and distort history to suit their own purpose.” Trinamool Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Jawhar Sircar said: “One pities them that they have so few learned people and thus the ruling group reveals its level of complete ignorance of history. It’s the same ignorance that makes them rant at all history and want to change syllabus and textbooks to suit their propaganda, not facts.”Director Abhijit Dasgupta, who has made five documentaries on Swami Vivekananda, said: “I have read about Swamiji and talked to several monks and scholars. Every passing day, I come across new revelations regarding him. As far as my knowledge goes, most of these are figments of imagination. How can he inspire the mutiny when he was born later? I am not aware of his connection with the Bhakti movement either.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pibs-tweet-on-vivekananda-and-1857-freedom-war-stuns-experts/articleshow/88864462.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s share of daily Covid cases dips with Omicron’s ‘district shift’||KOLKATA: The city’s share of Bengal’s Covid caseload is on a steady decline, leading a section of experts to surmise that the Omicron surge might be shifting to the districts. On January 1, Kolkata had 53% — or more than half — the number of the state’s fresh infections; that figure is now 32%, or a shade less than a third, going by Wednesday’s figures. On January 1, Bengal had reported 4,512 cases, of which 2,398 were from Kolkata. On that day, the share of five worst-hit districts combined — North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and West Burdwan, with a total of 1,639 cases — had been 36%. By Tuesday, Kolkata’s share was down to 28%, whereas the combined share of the five districts was up to 46%. “According to the numbers, the city’s share of Covid cases is coming down, contrary to cases surging in some districts. This is an indication of the pandemic surge shifting to the districts,” said Diptendra Sarkar, professor of surgery and part of IPGMER’s Covid task force. Senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of Bengal’s Global Advisory Board on Covid, felt that Kolkata was, “and, still is, the centre of the pandemic”, which was why the surge was first felt in the city. “Now, with the city already overflowing with infections, it is now fanning out to the districts.” He, however, said that these were “very initial assumptions”, and that a period of about seven days was needed to confirm the trend.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kols-share-of-daily-cases-dips-with-omicrons-district-shift/articleshow/88864463.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||L&T, state govt tie up for flood mgmt in lower Damodar basin||Kolkata: For the first time in its history, engineering and infrastructure giant L&T has joined hands with the West Bengal government for flood management. L&T has been working with various state governments for setting up geo-infrastructure, but this would be its first such tie-up with a state for flood control.The proposed project includes an integrated flood management plan, including safeguarding against the ingress of water into human habitation and cultivated areas, in West Bengal’s lower Damodar sub-basin roughly corresponding to the Hooghly and Howrah districts.L&T has pointed out that the project was necessitated because the lower Damodar sub-basin, adjoining the two branches of the main Damodar — the Mundeswari River and Lower Damodar (Amta) Channel — spread over 1.8 lakh hectare (1,887 sq km), which is historically a flood-prone zone. The infrastructure giant has stated that around 4.6 lakh people and 335 sq km (0.335 lakh hectare) of cropped area are inundated by flood annually. This area covers two municipalities and 20 administrative development blocks.The state irrigation and waterways department’s comprehensive plan involves constructing flood walls, river embankment armouring, de-silting the Mundeswari river and 41 other canals.The state government will bear 30% of the project cost, while it will be co-financed by the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The project is likely to be completed by July 2022.Of the three components of the proposed project, L&T Geostructure would carry out flood management work under four contract packages accounting for a total stretch of 122.5 km. An L&T spokesperson said, “The government believes that the problem needs to be addressed urgently and is undertaking various measures. The flood management contract has been entrusted to L&T’s Geostructure under four contract packages.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lt-state-govt-tie-up-for-flood-mgmt-in-lower-damodar-basin/articleshow/88864464.cms||---

Titagarh has already been building ships for the Indian Navy, National Institute of Ocean Technology etc, in its shipyard located in Titagarh.However, acquisition of the present infrastructure will enable Titagarh to substantially enhance its capability and capacity for the ship-building business. It has stated that the newly acquired land and infrastructure would remove the biggest constraint of being located north side of the Howrah bridge, which was limiting both the water draft and air draft available. Due to this, TWL was unable to participate in many tenders.With this acquisition, TWL will be able to functionally merge the two facilities in Titagarh and Falta in order to cater to a much wider range of specialised ship-building activities.Titagarh currently has an order book for 18 ships valued at approximately Rs 400 crore and is also building a fast patrol vessel for the Indian Coast Guard under contract from GRSE.Umesh Chowdhary, MD and CEO of the company, said: “Apart from the two well-established business lines of the company i.e. freight, transit and propulsion, the SBD (ship-building, bridges and defence) business vertical also is in the centre of our strategy. Titagarh, in the coming days, would place substantial focus on growing all the three aspects of the SBD business.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/titagarh-buys-precision-shipyard-assets-in-falta/articleshow/88864467.cms||---

The victim, Dipak Das, succumbed to his bullet injuries that he sustained on his head. Das used to supply chicken through multiple outlets at New Market and Amherst Street. Cops have launched a search for the accused Rakesh Das who had recently developed some enmity with the victim. Sources said Rakesh was helped in the crime. Both the accused and the victim, who hail from Bihar, had been living in Barasat fir the last few years. The afternoon shooting sent shockwaves among the residents of the densely populated area. “While minor political clashes are common in this area, such planned murder happened here after a long time,” said a local resident. Cops said Dipak was at his grocery shop when the accused Rakesh and his accomplice came there. They managed to flee after the crime. “We were told that the victim had been shot inside the grocery shop. He was shifted to Medical College with severe injuries and died later in the evening,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “Preliminary investigation suggests that Rakesh and Dipak had an altercation over some issue. Thereafter, a shot was heard and the victim was found lying in a pool of blood. We are collecting the local CCTV footage to verify the chain of events,” said Sharma. The main shop of Dipak is located at New Market. About six months ago, he had removed Rakesh from the job on suspicion of theft, according to the police. “But this was not the sole reason behind the enmity. Rakesh had also taken a bike from the victim in lieu of Rs 60,000. Later, Rakesh had returned the bike to Dipak and was asking him to return his money. Dipak had reportedly refused to pay him back, leading to their relationship turning bitter,” said a police source. Family members claimed that the accused and victim had been involved in promoting, with both of them joining the opposition groups. However, cops refuted such promoting link to the murder so far. “We will probe this angle too,” said an officer. A forensic team is likely to visit the spot. Cops said they are carrying out an analysis of the CCTV footage and raiding multiple places in northern suburbs of the city and North 24 Parganas to nab the accused. The Amherst Street police has registered a murder case even as the homicide wing of the detective department is helping in the probe.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/trader-shot-inside-shop-in-amherst-st-complex/articleshow/88864468.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Extending between Bihar and Chhattisgarh, the trough led to rain in north Bengal on Wednesday. “Chances of rain are high on Thursday due to the low-pressure trough. There could be a few spells of light rain. The showers may continue on Friday even as the cloud cover persists. The skies will start clearing up on Sunday and the mercury will gradually fall,” said RMC director GK Das.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Auto operators, hawkers clash at Garia crossing||KOLKATA: The busy Garia Crossing — leading towards SC Mullick Road — was shut for over half an hour on Wednesday evening after a group of local hawkers clashed with the auto operators. On Tuesday, there were some skirmishes after a few temporary shop structures were damaged by the auto operators. Local cops intervened and the matter was sorted. On Wednesday, the matter took a turn for the worse when the hawkers wanted to stage a roadblock on this issue at Garia crossing. The mob comprising around 250 men from both the unions owing allegiance to the ruling party resorted to hooliganism, damaging at least three autos and attacking an auto driver with a sharp weapon. The auto drivers, in turn, damaged a number of roadside shops. The mayhem came to a stop only after the Garia traffic guard sent in a huge police force followed by cops from Netaji Nagar and Patuli police stations. At least half a dozen people from the two groups were detained by the Netaji Nagar police. It took more than an hour to clear the jam that resulted from the incident. Locals wondered how the two groups could clash at such an important crossing of the city by throwing all Covid norms to the wind. According to police sources, tension in the area was simmering from December 30 after the auto union leaders asked the hawkers not to lay out their wares in front of their flag post that is located near 5 No. bus terminus at the Garia Crossing. “A few anti-socials entered this group as it swelled to over 200. The hawkers suddenly damaged the autos parked near the crossing. As the auto drivers resisted, a fight ensued,” said a police officer. The Netaji Nagar police said a case and counter case are being initiated against the two sides. “We have set up a picket in the area and are checking CCTV footage. The injuries are minor. A probe is on to nab the main accused,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/auto-operators-hawkers-clash-at-garia-crossing/articleshow/88864471.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Test-wary Kolkata depends on Covid symptoms; doctors flag concern||KOLKATA: With entire families having Covid-like symptoms, many are ready to assume that they have the virus and are reluctant to get tested. Instead, they are taking medicines after consultation with doctors and going into home isolation for a week. While this has reduced the pressure on diagnostic laboratories to an extent – which are already facing a stiff challenge handling thousands of tests each day – doctors and experts are worried that this would lead to a gross under-reporting of cases and encourage self-medication. Number of tests has dropped sharply at Peerless Hospital since last week. While it tested more than 400 samples a day last week, it slid to 327 on Tuesday. “The symptomatic are now reluctant to get tested and preferring home isolation, assuming they have Covid. Since the new ICMR guideline says that asymptomatic contacts need not get tested, they, too, are staying away. But the latter are often not sticking to isolation and many are not even wearing masks, risking a spread,” said Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. He added that the availability of rapid testing kits over the counter has encouraged the tendency to avoid a proper RT-PCR. “Many are using these kits at home but not uploading the result on tesing positive. Even those testing negative but with persistent symptoms need to consult a doctor and find out if they have a non-Covid infection that could be serious,” said Chowdhury. Thousands of symptomatic patients are relying on self-medication which could be fatal for many, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “Almost 40% of the patients who consulted me over the last one week had already started taking antibiotics. This could be useless and counter-protective. Antibiotics have no role in Covid unless there is a secondary or associated infection. So, those with the virus will actually suffer more and could deteriorate,” said Panja. Every symptomatic person should get tested, even if it is a rapid test or one done at home with a self-test kit, said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas. “Else, the real number of infected people will remain unknown and asymptomatic carriers will spread the disease,” he said. It is still too early to assume that all Covid positives have Omicron since Delta is active as well, said Chowdhury. “A good number of cases could still be severe and avoiding a test and the right treatment could be risky. We have already seen a spike in severe cases and rise in mortality triggered by this tendency to avoid a test. Many are delaying treatment having skipped the test and seeking admission when they have already deteriorated,” added Chowdhury. Medica Supersecialty Hospital has been receiving 2-3 severe cases every day, according to chairperson Alok Roy. The hospital has been doing between 500 and 600 tests a day. “All our 45 ICU beds are occupied. Even two weeks ago, the number of patients was one-third,” said Roy, adding that most severe patients were people with comorbidities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/test-wary-city-depends-on-covid-symptoms-doctors-flag-concern/articleshow/88864472.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The RWAs in housing societies have requested residents with Covid symptoms and their caregivers to avoid using the lifts and put on double masks and use gloves. They are also sanitizing the common areas of the buildings and minimising interaction with service staff. In New Town, VIP Road, Ballygunge, EM Bypass, Tangra and New Alipore, members of the administration have held meetings with the residents’ associations and instructed them to increase vigil and awareness. “In some of the complexes in New Town cases have increased manifold and have become a cause of concern for us. Many people are testing on their own but continue to use common areas which is helping the virus to spread faster. The authorities must find some way of identifying such individuals if we want to control the situation,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News. Several complexes have started sanitizing lifts twice or thrice a day. “It is a small enclosed space and one doesn’t know who is infected. We are sanitising and have requested everybody to wear masks,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association in Sukhobrishti. “Residents who have Covid symptoms or caregivers of positive patients have been requested to maintain social distance and not use any of the common areas,” said Ankita Agarwal, resident of Shanti Kunj in New Alipore. Many associations have also instructed residents to inform if they test positive using self-testing kit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/gated-complexes-focus-on-lifts-common-areas-to-stall-number-spike/articleshow/88864474.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The patient is now being treated at the Covid ICU of the hospital. A 67-year-old was to get treatment for acute renal ailment at a private hospital off EM Bypass. His swab samples tested positive before hospital admission. The patient is now being treated in the hospital’s Covid ICU. The Covid ICUs across hospitals have patients with different profile this third wave. While a good number of younger patients also landed in ICU needing intensive therapy during the second wave, this time it is mainly the senior citizens. In most cases, Covid-19 has only been an incidental detection. “This time, a majority of patients in our Covid ICU are those who came in for treatment for critical conditions like stroke, trauma or heart ailment. And Covid has been a chance detection. Despite their comorbidity, some are requiring oxygen but in minimal quantity. So managing of Covid patients in ICU during this current wave is different from the second wave,” said Yogiraj Ray, infectious diseases specialist at IPGMER. “In the second wave, we saw at least 40% of ICU beds being occupied by younger patients with lung damage due to inflammatory reactions. But this time, they are not there. It is mostly the aged who came to ICU admission for other ailment,” said critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee of Medica Superspecialty Hospital. Chatterjee added that some these patients had not been vaccinated as they could not reach vaccination centres physically. The scenario is same even in the districts. All the eight patients admitted at the Suri Superspeciality Hospital Covid CCU at present are septuagenarians and have various comorbidities. “Four came with acute myocardial infraction, two with chronic kidney problem and one with heart failure while another has Covid-related respiratory issues. So Covid was incidental in seven out of eight patients,” said Anamitra Barik, physician chest clinic at Suri Superspeciality Hospital. “Race up for the booster dose, remain indoors as much as possible, get tested at the slightest of the symptoms or if an elderly had been in close contact of confirmed positive case. Early detection will help doctors treat them,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI. All 18 critical cCovid patients directly under pulmonary unit here are above 60 years of age had come for treatment of other comorbidities. “Given the fact Covid-19 has become chance detection in comorbid patients, I feel focus should now be shifted to organ care for treatment of these patients in respective ICUs of the departments where they had come for treatment rather than isolating them in the Covid CCU,” said IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/seniors-with-comorbidity-occupy-most-cov-icu-beds/articleshow/88864475.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The 16-year-old had been wondering if she would ever get her share of the Covid-19 vaccine. On Wednesday Rezia and some teenagers who live on the pavements got the shot of hope. The initiative was taken by NGO Prantakatha and the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) to ensure the jab to children living in the open or school drop outs. “I am happy that I finally got the first dose of the vaccine. I would have felt left out if I had no access to the vaccine,” said Sheikh Sahir (17) a street dweller. The special drive to vaccinate street children was rolled out on Wednesday, coinciding with the National Youth Day. The NGO has been raising funds for the drive where about 100 children were registered. Peerless Hospital where the teenagers were vaccinated offered the jab on discounted rate. “Since these children stay in the open they are all the more vulnerable to Covid. During the pandemic through our schools in footpath we have also been raising awareness on Covid appropriate behaviour among them. So they were aware about the vaccines were eager for it,” said Bappaditya Mukherjee of Prantakatha. The inoculation drive for kids in the 15-18 years age group was launched on January 3 and most are being inoculated though school camps.  “This was the first special drive for such children who are not under any institutional care. Since they would not have an easy access to the vaccine we will be targeting more areas to identify such eligible kids for the jab,” said WBCPCR chairperson Ananya Chakraborti Chatterjee. Most of the children who got the vaccine on Wednesday were those living under the flyover close to the Race Course. The NGOs will be looking out for more such children from other localities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/special-vax-drive-rolled-out-for-street-children/articleshow/88864476.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: Railway, CISF quarters join containment zone list in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A couple of Railway and CISF colonies located in the Port area were included in the city’s micro-containment zone list on Tuesday evening after new cases were reported from these spots all through last week. The Port region now has eight of the 29 micro-containment zones that are presently existing in the city. These eight Port areas — spread mostly in West Port area and a couple more in the South Port area — are part of the 12 new areas that have also been added in the new list that also includes a couple of zones from Netaji Nagar and Garfa. KMC health department and Port division police sources said that the primary reason they have been included in the fresh list is because of their proximity to the densely populated Garden Reach and Ramnagar residential colonies. The South Eastern railway colonies — most importantly the BNR Colony, along with one from CISF — has been reporting several fresh cases as late as December 6. A review on these zones is expected in the next three days. Both KMC and police sources said the primary objective will be to ensure that those infected do not go to markets. “There are RPF personnel who are stationed at the spots. We are resorting to miking. Since the infected are senior railway officers and those in responsible posts, the level of compliance with rules has so far been high. With no fresh cases reported in the last five days, we are hopeful of reversing the rising numbers,” said an officer from West Port police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rly-cisf-quarters-join-c-zone-list/articleshow/88864478.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||CISCE pushes back internal marks submission deadline to February 28||By: Poulami Roy KOLKATA: CISCE has deferred the deadline for ISC practicals, project and SUPW marks submission to February 28 instead of January 31. For ICSE, the deadline for project and SUPW marks submission will also be February 28. Both ISC and ICSE art examinations earlier scheduled for January 24-29 will now be held in the last week of February. The practicals, projects and SUPW were the internal assessment component of the semester-I board examinations which could not be held due to the closure of schools in Bengal due to the Omicron threat. In a notification to principals, CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon said while many schools have completed their internal assessments and uploaded marks, some had expressed their inability to conduct these assessments offline due to Covid. Arathoon said the last date for schools to upload the marks is now February 28. Likewise, the ICSE project marks and SUPW grades will also have to be uploaded in the same time frame. ISC has practical components in physics, chemistry, biology, biotechnology, computer science, fashion designing, music courses, physical education, and home sciences. St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, principal Fr Rodney Borneo said, “The state has closed schools and we now have till February 28 to conduct and upload the marks. We will wait for the state advisory on school reopening before drawing up the examination schedule.” Calcutta Boys’ School principal Raja Mcgee said, “We have sought clarifications from CISCE because examinees wanted this to be deferred. Given the situation, it is possible to conduct the tests with one or two kids. It is impossible to conduct practicals where the entire class needs to be present. We now have time till February 28, which is a great relief.” According to the original schedule, schools had planned to conduct their internal assessments later this week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cisce-pushes-back-internal-marks-submission-deadline-to-feb-28/articleshow/88864479.cms||---

The usual mass rallies and roadshows have been missing amid the third wave of the pandemic, but Chakraborty has been making the rounds of the blocks, either on foot or by open vehicles and using the social media platforms to connect with the electorate. Ward 29, from where Chakraborty is contesting, is reserved for women candidates this time. The ward consists of BJ, CJ, AK, BK, CK, CL, AL, BL, SA blocks, Amartya Abasan and Sourav Abasan in Salt Lake, with over 3,000 households and nearly 11lakh voters. “I seek your blessings to choose me for the third time. You had made me the mayor, made me the chairperson. I am always with you. I have worked for you to develop water supply and improve street lights, roads and parks. I vow to take up all your responsibilities again,” she requested voters. Chakraborty is campaigning only once a day with only five or six personsand focusing on social media. “We watch your campaign on Facebook Live. We are with you,” said an elderly resident as Chakraborty passed by his BK Block home.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ex-mayor-opts-out-of-rallies-for-safety/articleshow/88864481.cms||Suman Chakraborti

At the transit hub in Kolkata, police and civic staff checked the vaccination status of Gangasagar-bound pilgrims and ramped up Covid-testing facilities. Swab samples of around 250 pilgrims were collected by 3pm and sent to National Institute of Cholera and Enteric diseases for RT-PCR tests. “Pilgrims who test positive won’t be allowed to visit Gangasagar,” said a KMC official. Police said they were allowing only the fully vaccinated to board the buses heading towards Lot 8 jetty and other points. Those eligible for the second dose are being directed to the vaccination camps. Police have asked bus operators to allow pilgrims to board only after they show vaccination certificates. Along the transit routes, buses and vans were stopped at screening points. The number vehicles ferrying pilgrims was half of what used to ply during the pilgrimage earlier, sources said. According to district police, vehicles were not allowed any mid-way halt for refreshments or lunch. Some voluntary organisations distributed dry food among pilgrims instead. At nine buffer zones, the administration carried out RT-PCR tests on the pilgrims after double vaccination screening. RT-PCR tests were carried out at Gazinagar-Mukulika, Piyas, Ramzannagar, Kanpur, Tulsi Chawk, Sarisha Bazar, Diamond Harbour Stadium More, Kulpi Bazar, Kashinagar and Kakdwip. From Namkhana and Diamond Harbour stations, 6,000 pilgrims were allowed to enter the Mela after screening. Two NDRF battalions comprising 110 rescuers under the supervision of assistant commandants Sudhir Kumar Dewedi and Pushpendra Kumar have been deployed at Lot 8, Kachuberia and Sagar from January 6 for rescue operations. In Diamond Harbour subdivision, 53,203 Covid tests were organised by MP Abhishek Banerjee and carried out by Diamond Harbour district police on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary. In all, 1,151 tested positive. Several of those tested were pilgrims.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/vax-cert-checks-cov-tests-ramped-up-after-hc-order/articleshow/88864482.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police stress on revised night naka SOP to cut infection risk||KOLKATA: The traffic police top brass has again asked everyone to follow the night naka SOP that has been in place for several weeks but is not being followed. A revised SOP asks cops to maintain 6ft distance with a biker or motorist to ensure that neither passes on the infection. Cops have also been asked to wear masks, face shields and gloves. While orders to carry out citation challans instead of spot fines had long being passed along with a stop on breathalyzer tests, the fresh set of measures are aimed at further reducing the number of traffic cops getting infected each day. Cops on the road said maintaining physical distancing was difficult when carrying out checks on vehicle documents and communicate with the driver through the gear. “Since these checks stretch for seven hours, maintaining the ideal SOP is a challenge,” said an officer. The special drive has left several traffic guards worried after mounting evidence that drunk driving is on the rise at night but is going undetected. What has made their job even more difficult is the present restriction on the use of breathalyzers due to fear of Covid spread. Cops on duty at night this weekend claimed that at least six of the 25 traffic guards had sent around two to three motorists each for alcohol tests to various hospitals after they were allegedly found to be reeking of alcohol. All police units have also been asked to be careful while carrying out daily arrests and while taking custody of those arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/police-stress-on-revised-night-naka-sop-to-cut-infection-risk/articleshow/88864483.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||BMC contenders campaign from a distance to keep virus at bay||KOLKATA: Door-to-door campaigns, one of the most popular ways for candidates to connect with the electorate, seems to be taking a backseat before the Bidhannagar civic elections as a majority of contestants have been refraining from visiting households due to a surge in Covid cases. Moreover, the multiple micro-containment zones in Salt Lake and its fringes are also keeping canvassing at bay at those places. Currently there are 14 micro containment zones in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area, of which 10 are in Salt Lake at FD, GD, CB, AK, HA, IB, BF and EC blocks. The BMC area is reporting a daily average of more than 6,000 active Covid cases with 1,312 new cases, the highest single-day figure ever since the pandemic broke out. “We are in a situation where almost every household has a Covid patient or has someone with Covid-like symptoms. Hence, I am not visiting any house. I am walking past the houses, meeting them from the road. They are greeting me from their balconies. We are not taking out rallies in micro-containment zones. I plan to call up residents and seek votes,” said Rajesh Chirimar, former councillor and Trinamool candidate from Ward 39. He himself came out of isolation only on Wednesday and still complains of massive chest infection. Ward 39 comprises a part of CB Block, barricaded as a micro-containment zone. In absence of door-to-door visits, candidates are shifting their focus to digital and other modes of campaigning, such as announcements on mikes while making rounds of blocks by autos and vans, putting up hoardings and distributing leaflets across neighbourhoods. At FD Block in Ward 33, two houses are now demarcated as micro-containment zones and many more houses from where Covid cases are being reported. Banibrata Banerjee, outgoing Trinamool councillor of Ward 28, who is contesting from Ward 33, said the local Block association had always been active about helping the Covid-affected families as and when required. “Tackling Covid is the priority this year. We are campaigning in such a way that Covid patients are not troubled and that the virus does not spread. The local Block association is also helping out Covid patients inside or outside micro-containment zones,” Banerjee said. Left contender from the same ward Basab Basak is canvassing from open vehicles. He is also connecting with isolated families through social media. Basak’s social media timeline is flooded with campaign posts and videos. The same is with four-time councillor Tulsi Sinha Roy, who is again contesting from Ward 40, which has multiple micro-containment zones in EC Block. “The affected families have completed their isolation. We have kept in touch with them. I am visiting the neighbourhoods with only a few party workers,” she said. Sinha Roy also has a Facebook page, where she regularly uploads campaign messages, interacts with voters and responds to their queries. Former BMC mayor Sabyasachi Dutta, contesting again from Ward 31, which has two micro-containment zones in BF Block. Dutta is visiting households and meeting people from a safe distance. The few party workers accompanying him are also distributing masks to people on the streets. His former colleague-cum-opponent, Devasis Jana, who is contesting on a BJP ticket, is following the same norm. “I am seeking people’s blessings from a distance. We are distributing leaflets and pamphlets at their houses,” Jana said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bmc-contenders-campaign-from-a-distance-to-keep-virus-at-bay/articleshow/88864484.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Residents in containment zones to vote in last polling hour||KOLKATA: Voters in containment zones could cast their votes between 4pm and 5pm on polling day of the civic election, State Election Commission said in an order on Wednesday. While the last-hour polling hour was kept for the Covid-affected and those with Covid-like symptoms during the KMC elections, the Wednesday order was extended to all living in containment zones. The micro-containment zones were introduced in high-Covid prevalence zones. The elections are scheduled to be held on January 22 in four municipal corporations of Bidhannagar, Chandernagore, Asansol and Siliguri, were there are multiple containment and micro-containment zones. Voters in those zones can cast their votes in the last hour. Sector officers have also been asked to keep a tab on containment zones and coordinate so that residents there do not go to booths earlier and pose a risk to other voters. Moreover, voters from containment zones have been asked to contact nodal health officers and if required, Covid patients can ask for ambulances to be ferried to booths. PPE kits will be provided to the affected. The SEC had earlier asked to appoint four nodal health officials for the safety of voters in the four municipal corporations. But with 14 micro-containment zones being put up in Bidhannagar and around 1,000 Covid cases being reported there every day, it is feared many voters with mild symptoms might go to booths and spread the novel coronavirus. Booths will, however, check body temperature of everyone entering and everyone will have to wear gloves. .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/residents-in-c-zones-to-vote-in-last-polling-hour/articleshow/88864486.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Kolkata||Encroachment removal plan for Vivekananda Park||Kolkata: On the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s 160th birth anniversary on Wednesday, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) officials pledged to remove encroachments from Vivekananda Park and redevelop it so that it is accessible to citizens. The decision follows feedback about the park located opposite Rabindra Sarobar from residents of Southern Avenue, Lake View Road, Keyatala Road, Sarat Chatterjee Road among other areas. According to a KMC parks department official, the residents have for long been complaining that the park had been usurped by different sports clubs in the name of running coaching camps. “I have asked the heads of clubs that have an agreement with KMDA about running sports activities in the park to show the documents. We will reclaim the additional areas in the park that have been occupied later. Our department will then speak to KMDA authorities for an all-round infrastructure development and beautification of the park,” said Debasish Kumar, member, mayor-in-council overseeing the KMC parks department. KMDA officials, in charge of Vivekananda Park’s maintenance, said they would jointly chalk out a development plan once they receive a formal proposal from KMC. According to the plan, a jogger’s track will be laid with a paver block. KMC also plans to install decorative benches so that people can sit after taking a stroll. “Our first priority is to clear encroachments and create an environment so that the park can be used by citizens. The government agency taking up the beautification work can be decided later,” Kumar said. Locals welcomed the initiative. “There should be a green belt and a proper place for a statue of Swami Vivekananda at the park,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh who lives on Sarat Bose Road. “This is a welcome initiative. Encroachments at the park should be prevented and the park should be developed as a green zone for morning walkers and so that locals and children can use it for football or cricket,” said Amit Roy, a social worker and local resident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/encroachment-removal-plan-for-vivekananda-park/articleshow/88864488.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Oil prices hit two-month highs, lifted by tight supply and easing concerns over the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Data showed the U.S. consumer price index leaping a whopping 7% in the 12 months through December, the biggest annual increase since June 1982. But it was within forecasts, which appeared to reassure investors. "Today's inflation report continued to reinforce the theme that gaudy price gains are not standing in the way of demand," said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income and Head of the BlackRock Global Allocation Investment Team. "We don't think the Fed will overreact to this condition," Rieder said, adding that he expected the Fed to raise rates in March. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.28%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.23%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.11%. Gains were stronger for European and Asian shares. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.65%. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.81% to one-year highs, lifted by mining and oil giants. Japan's Nikkei rose 1.9% overnight, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed up 1.95%. Buoyant global equity markets lifted MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe up by 0.8%. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields edged down to 1.7481% after falling as far as 1.7269% -- more than seven basis points from an almost two-year high hit on Monday. Fed fund futures are predicting nearly four rate hikes this year, a seismic change from a few months ago. Long-term rates have been relatively steady. U.S. interest rate pricing is peaking at 1.5% by the third quarter of 2024, far lower than previous U.S. rate tightening cycles. "It seems to be a fait accompli that the Fed will hike interest rates quickly, even if inflation comes in a little below expectations," Commerzbank analysts said in a client note. "In a worst-case scenario, lift-off will not be in March, but in May or June." The dollar hit a two-year low on the inflation report, with the dollar index falling 0.666% to 94.97 against a basket of six major currencies. A struggling dollar lifted the euro up 0.66% to a near two-month high of $1.14430, and boosted spot gold by 0.2% to $1,825.40 an ounce. The prospect of rate hikes by the Bank of England also boosted sterling. The pound leapt 0.52% to $1.37045, its highest in more than two months against the dollar. In oil markets, U.S. crude jumped 1.92% to $82.78 per barrel and Brent was at $84.76, up 1.24%. "Omicron is yesterday's story now," said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. "The market isn't moving on Omicron but on earnings, Fed and economic data." Not all major central banks are tightening policy though. In China, a softer than expected reading on prices has drawn bets on policy easing. Five-year Chinese government bond futures rose eight ticks to an 18-month high before trimming gains. Yuan gains were also capped.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stocks-up-dollar-down-us-inflation-data-surges-as-forecast/articleshow/88864503.cms||---

Friends, relatives and neighbours are supportive and teams from Corona Control Room and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) regularly keep in touch with them to help them medically or otherwise, they said. K R Mishra, who lives in Kolar, when asked whether he has any problem due to barricading outside his home, said “No. There is no problem at all.” When asked how many members in his family are infected, he said “Three”. And, how does he meet the requirements like milk, vegetables and fruits, when three members of the family are in isolation, he said, “Our milkman leaves milk outside the house. Barricading was done on Saturday. We are all improving. There has not been any problem till now. You are ill and living in isolation, that in itself is a problem but beyond that everything is fine,” said Mishra. When asked whether he receives calls from the Covid Control Room, he said, “Yes. They make calls regularly. A doctor had physically come to our home”. Maya and her husband, also residents of the Kolar area, are also in home isolation for over 10 days. Talking to TOI, Maya’s husband said, “When I tested positive, I isolated myself on the first floor of the house. Then, a team from the Corona Control Room came and took samples of my wife and two children. My wife also tested positive but both the children were negative. I let all my friends and relatives know that I have been tested positive for Corona. They were all very supportive. Children from neighborhood ask if we needed anything if they are going to a shop. My daughter is elder, so with the help of her 11-year-old brother, she is able to cook. We tested negative after 10 days itself but medical team from the Covid Control Room advised us to remain is isolation for 4 more days. So I am still in the room, which I had occupied after testing positive. With a laptop, a table and my bed, I am at ease in this room. And, why should I expose other people to risk and put myself at risk by moving around when I have been asked to remain indoors for four more days even after being cleared of Corona,” he said. When asked about the response of the medical team from the Corona Control Room, he said, “They have been very nice. They make calls both in the morning and the evening. Besides, the BMC team makes calls. They even asked me if we made you a video call, would you respond? I said why not?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/wave-of-empathy-no-stigma-for-patients-in-containment-zones/articleshow/88864513.cms||---

Off the record, some consultants do highlight the delay in getting test results. Nine Bhopal laboratories which conduct RT-PCR testing, when analyzed indicate on Tuesday that 4,096 samples were tested and almost 3,069 results are awaited. They had a positivity rate of almost 8%. Around 105 samples of suspected Covid-19 patients were rejected during the day.Other reason being given for 13% of patients under Covid-19 care and not positive for the infection is late presentation and approach for medical treatment. Reaching out for test and early start of medical treatment is critical, according to medical experts.In the last week, Bhopal death toll due to Covid-19 has increased to 1,007. At the start of the year it was 1,005, two more have succumbed to the infection in a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/13-in-covid-hosps-are-suspected-patients/articleshow/88864515.cms||Jamal Ayub

It’s not like police personnel in their uniforms standing on a busy road with their bikes parked and waiting for law breakers to fall in trap and the violators turning their vehicles away from a distance on sighting them. The team in plain clothes is going to market places, residential areas or simply standing in front of a busy hotel or shop and imposing fines on people going in or coming out without wearing masks. “I had gone to the dispose the garbage at my colony gate when these people in plain clothes fined me for not wearing a mask. It’s a better way to enforce the mask norm,” said Dinesh Tiwari, a resident of Trilanga. General secretary of New Market Kirana Vyapari Mahasangh Ajay Devnani said, “The team makes rounds of the market to catch those without masks and fine them. It is a welcome move.” The district administration has formed 85 teams (one for each ward) comprising a revenue inspector, a police sub-inspector and ward in-charge of the BMC to ensure compliance of Covid protocol with the BMC in-charge given the mandate to carry the POS machine and inform the administration each evening on the number of persons fined for violation of Covid protocol and the amount collected from them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/now-cops-in-plain-clothes-to-ensure-mask-use-in-city/articleshow/88864516.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The biggest defaulters were the vendors. They move around without masks. Even when some passengers objected, they hardly complied. “You can see yourself that majority of the passengers are wearing the masks. However, the vendors who can play a major role in spreading the infections have either refused to wear the masks and use it as a decorative piece on the neck,” said a passenger, Ravi Kumar.Vendors who sell goods and food items inside the train also don’t bother to wear masks. Passengers said that such vendors are even more dangerous as they come to them after meeting several other passengers.Even some passengers were spotted without masks at the Bhopal station. When they were queried, they made silly excuses. “I lost my mask. I will buy another one after leaving the station,” said a passenger. The Bhopal railway division has collected a fine of Rs 6 lakh from the passengers not wearing a mask and spreading litter on the station premises. The fine was collected in the period of April to December 2021.Bhopal division officials said that a campaign is being run against passengers not wearing masks and littering on the station in the Bhopal division and action is taken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/vendors-passengers-unmask-covid-risk-at-bhopal-rly-station/articleshow/88864519.cms||Ramendra Singh

As BJP celebrated Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary across the country on Wednesday, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh called the media for a religious discourse on Hinduism. “Digvijaya Singh was never anti-Hindu and will never be,” said the former CM. Singh, who is criticized by BJP as being ‘anti-Hindu’, read out from the scriptures and Ramcharit Manas, and quoted Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Paramhansa and Gandhi, to say that it is he is a true Hindu, and not the BJP-RSS combine. “I am proud to be the follower of a religion that has taught the world tolerance and universal culture,” Singh quoted Swami Vivekananda, and added: “We accept all religions as true. It’s the character of India and Sanatan Dharma to respect all religions, which was mentioned by Swami Vivekananda,” he said. “This is what I have said and followed. As CM, I took action against radical Hindus and radical Muslims alike,” he said, adding that religion shouldn’t be used as ammunition for political success. On Savarkar’s philosophy that only those religions born in India can live here, Singh said: “If this ideology of Savarkar is to be followed, what happens to Indians settled in the US and the Middle-East? If you have to make India the Vishwa Guru, then you need to take everyone along.” State BJP president VD Sharma said, “Why has it become necessary for Digvijaya Singh to say that he is not anti-Hindu? He is now on the path of recognizing that life is under the protection of RSS and Hindutva. He has sinned by supporting terrorists and Naxalism and attacking Hinduism, and wants to come into the protection of RSS. He wants to wash his sins but that will not happen.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/diggy-was-never-anti-hindu-followed-sanatan-dharma/articleshow/88864520.cms||Suchandana Gupta

One of them was unvaccinated and the other one had taken her first dose. Both deaths took place at Bundelkhand Medical College in Sagar district, and each of them died within a day or two of hospitalisation. The first patient, a woman, was already in a serious condition when admitted on January 8, say health department sources. She died on January 10. The same day, a 22-year-old man was brought in. He died in less than 24 hours and his Covid report came after his death. “The male patient stayed in hospital for barely 24 hours. He was having trouble breathing, so his kin brought him here. We had seen the X-ray of his lungs and found they were badly affected, bilaterally infected. He had some travel history. The spread of infection seemed to be very fast. We tried our best but could not save him,” superintendent of Bundelkhand Medical College Dr S K Pippal told TOI. “His family could not provide any information regarding his vaccination status. He was most probably not vaccinated,” Dr Pippal added. The woman had symptoms for nearly a week before she was taken to hospital. “She was critical. Her oxygen saturation was below 88. She was partially vaccinated. Her kin said she had taken one dose,” Pippal told TOI. “The common thread between the deaths is that they both were young,” he said, with concern.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/two-22-yr-olds-die-of-covid-in-mp-youngest-victims-of-third-wave/articleshow/88864528.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Syndicate members, who backed Pillai, said on record that they were consulted by the VC before he informed the chancellor that syndicate members had turned down his proposal that the university may honour the President with honorary DLitt. Syndicate members turned down the proposal not because they were against honouring the President; they had solid reasons to infer that the President is unlikely to accept the honour. Despite syndicate decision, KU had failed to confer DLitt on former president KR Narayanan due to protocol issues flagged by authorities concerned. Moreover, Rashtrapati Bhavan has recently turned down the honorary degree offered by Chandigarh University, they added. The VC’s communication with the chancellor had taken place in this context. “Syndicate members pointed out the legal and protocol issues associated with the proposal. The only intention was not to become a laughing stock by offering DLitt to the President, which he would decline for sure. It’s unfortunate that a precautionary measure taken by syndicate members was misinterpreted,” said a syndicate member. The syndicate decided not to irritate the chancellor further and decided against passing a resolution in this regard as it could further complicate the situation. “We want the chancellor, vice-chancellor and all others concerned to work together for the welfare of the university,” syndicate member KH Babujan said. Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammed Khan rejected the narrative that he had put unnecessary pressure on KU VC, forcing the latter to give a reply in writing to the chancellor’s suggestion to confer DLitt on President Ram Nath Kovind. Khan told reporters on Wednesday that he only sought an explanation from the VC after he failed to convene a syndicate meeting as directed by the chancellor. “I only criticized the sentences (he) used in the letter when you (media) people brought the same to my attention. I did not criticise the vice-chancellor, but his language,” Khan said, adding that television reporters should not try to put their words in his mouth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-syndicate-rallies-behind-vice-chancellor/articleshow/88864531.cms||---

According to a stock market notification by M&M, which holds 74.65% in Ssangyong, a consortium led by South Korean electric bus-maker Edison Motors has agreed to acquire the debt-ridden Ssangyong for 304.858 billion won ($254.65 million or Rs 1,882 crore) through a primary equity investment. “We are happy to hear that Edison Motors consortium has formally agreed to acquire Ssangyong Motor Company and that the acquisition will progress to the next stage, in a defined time frame,” said an M&M spokesperson. “We will cooperate with the new investor in enabling the transition.” The Edison led consortium has asked for 95% stake in Ssangyong and the investment agreement was executed on January 10, 2022. Following the capital restructuring “undertaken as part of the rehabilitation process,” M&M's “holding in SYMC will reduce”. If the fresh investment results in M&M's stake in Ssangyong falling below 50%, “it will cease to be a subsidiary of the company,” M&M said in the notification. However, M&M “will not receive any consideration on account of the proposed primary investment,” it explained. Although M&M ceased consolidating Ssanygong as a subsidiary from December 2020, the Korean auto company and its subsidiaries are still “considered as subsidiaries” under the Companies Act 2013. Ssangyong went into bankruptcy and has been under court receivership and M&M has tried in the past to crank out a stake sale in the troubled automaker. Among the investors who showed interest but later backed down was American auto retailer HAAH Automotive which has a tech partnership with Chinese company Chery. Once the sale goes through, Ssangyong’s subsidiaries SsangYong Australia Pty, SsangYong European Parts Center B.V, SsangYong Motor (Shanghai) and SY Auto Capital will all cease to be M&M subsidiaries. M&M had paid $463 million to acquire 70% initial stake in Ssangyong in 2010. It later increased its stake in the company. Last financial year, M&M had taken an impairment of Rs 1,210 crore on account of Ssangyong.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ssangyong-finds-a-buyer-but-mm-to-get-no-consideration-from-the-sale/articleshow/88862836.cms||---

Leading edtech firms, under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), on Wednesday announced the formation of the India EdTech Consortium (IEC). The IEC has committed to observe and adhere to a common ‘Code of Conduct’ and establish a two-tier grievance redressal mechanism for consumers. “Aligned with the government’s recent advisory, the IEC will ensure that every learner shall have access to quality and affordable education, which not only improves their academic performance but also makes them future-ready,” a statement from IAMAI said. The move comes at a time when the HRD ministry recently released a note warning parents and other stakeholders to be careful while choosing online platforms to invest in for their children’s education. “It has come to the notice of the Department of School Education and Literacy that some ed-tech companies are luring parents in the garb of offering free services and getting the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) mandate signed or activating the Auto-debit feature, especially targeting the vulnerable families,” the ministry said in the note. “The formation of this self-regulatory body is an important step towards protecting learners as more and more students, teachers and stakeholders are becoming a part of the online education ecosystem,” Subho Ray, president, Internet and Mobile Association of India, said. Mayank Kumar, co-founder & MD upGrad, and co-chairperson, IAMAI EdTech Committee, said that it is crucial to foster and sustain stakeholder trust by safeguarding their interest as a practice. “This initiative will go a long way in strengthening the EdTech sector and establishing India as the teaching capital of the world,” he said. Careers 360,Classplus, Doubtnut, Great Learning, Harappa, Times Edutech & Events, Scaler, Simplilearn, Toppr, UNext Learning, and WhiteHat Jr. are a few other firms part of the IEC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/under-scrutiny-edtech-sector-forms-a-self-regulatory-body/articleshow/88862885.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The ruling was given by Justice N Nagaresh on a plea challenging denial of registration to Kerala Deaf Cricket Association for using the word ‘Kerala’ in its name. It violates provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act of 1950, the state government had contended. The association was asked to change its name by the district registrar (general) under the Societies Registration Act as the chosen name resembles that of the state government. In the judgment of December 23, the court pointed out that the Emblems Act only banned the naming of commercial entities after India or Kerala. Since the petitioners’ association is not related to any trade, business, calling or profession, the Emblems Act cannot be applied, the court held.

The move is supported by higher profits and cash flows as the software services giant benefits from the pandemic-induced digital ramp-up. TCS proposes to carry out a Rs 18,000-crore share buyback, which will be the biggest stock repurchase by an Indian company and the year’s first such capital-reduction move. TCS would buy back 4 crore equity shares at Rs 4,500 apiece. The announced rate is at a 17% premium to the Wednesday closing price of the TCS stock, which ended at Rs 3,857 on the NSE. The proposal, the fourth in five years by the company, tops its previous three share buyback deals of Rs 16,000 crore each. “The Rs 18,000-crore buyback size translates into 1.08% of TCS’s outstanding equity, which is not material per se. But what is important is the intent of TCS to consistently reward shareholders through buyback programmes and dividends, reflecting its golden standard of corporate governance,” said Sharekhan BNP Paribas research head Sanjeev Hota. TCS vowed to begin stock buybacks in FY18 in order to distribute 80-100% of its free cash flows to shareholders. During the third quarter of FY22, it had a cash flow of Rs 10,853 crore, which was more than 100% of its profit. According to information from financial content platform Prime Database, several large share buybacks in the recent past were carried out by IT companies. Besides TCS, Infosys and Wipro returned huge cash to shareholders. The TCS move would also funnel cash back to its largest shareholder Tata Sons. Participating in the buyback will fetch Tata Sons, which holds 72% in the IT giant, Rs 12,960 crore. The gains made from such deals would help Tata Sons to pay for M&As and other corporate purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/at-rs-18000cr-tcs-unveils-largest-stock-buyback-ever/articleshow/88863236.cms||Reeba Zachariah

While the share of plaints against debit cards have fallen, those against credit cards are on the rise. The other two major categories of complaints are a failure by banks to meet commitments and non-observance of the fair practices code. The share of ATM/debit card complaints, mobile/electronic banking and credit card complaints to total complaints received from July 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 stood at 17.4%, 13% and 12.4%, respectively. The corresponding percentage of complaints against these grounds from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 were 22%, 13.4% and 9.3%. The shift to digital platforms for grievance redressal has led to two major gains. First, the cost of redressing grievances has fallen sharply. Second, there has been an improvement in the turnaround time (TAT). The average cost of handling a complaint under the banking ombudsman scheme decreased by 33.5% from Rs 2,412 during July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 to Rs 1,605 from July 1, 2020-March 31, 2021. “The cost reduction was on account of the increased volume of complaints handled by the same human resources, supported by the end-to-end digitisation of complaint processing in the complaint management system (CMS),” the report said. The time taken to dispose of a complaint by the banking ombudsman declined significantly from 95 days during July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 to 55 days from July 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. “The TAT pertaining to all the complaint categories showed a substantial decline, which is mainly due to resolving of the technical glitches faced during the initial period of CMS transition.” The CMS also aided in uninterrupted operations throughout the year, despite the pandemic. The reporting year has changed along with the change in the accounting year for the RBI. As a result, the numbers in absolute terms are not comparable. However, RBI deputy governor M K Jain said in his foreword to the annual report, “On an annualised basis, a spurt of 22.3% was witnessed in the number of complaints received under the three ombudsman schemes in operation.” The three schemes are for banks, finance companies and digital transactions, which have now been integrated under a unified ombudsman. Next year’s annual report will be a unified one.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cards-e-banking-plaints-still-dominate-grievances/articleshow/88863253.cms||---

As part of a composite scheme approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLAT) Chennai bench last week, Sundaram Industries and Southern Roadways have been merged into TVSS and dissolved “without the process of winding up”. As result of this merger, the shareholding of Southern Roadways and Sundaram Industries in various group companies have been transferred to TVSS to be further transferred to respective holding companies on February 4. For instance, Sundaram Industries and Southern Roadways’ 44.94% stake in Sundaram Clayton, which is the promoter of TVS Motor, has been transferred to TVSS following which TVSS’ stake in Sundaram Clayton has gone up from 19.78% to 64.72%. On February 4, which is the second appointed date for the process, the two-wheeler, auto parts and die casting business of TVSS comprising equity shares of Sundaram Clayton and also of TVS Motor held through Sundaram Clayton will be demerged from TVSS and moved to TVS Holdings Pvt Ltd (THPL). TVSS had indirectly acquired just over 52% voting rights in TVS Motor, which will also transfer to THPL. Similarly, the shareholding of Southern Roadways in Sundram Fasteners comprising 24.16% stake has been transferred to TVSS. As a result, TVSS’ holding in Sundram Fasteners has gone up from 25.37% to 49.53%. Sundaram Industries does not hold any shares in Sundram Fasteners. Ditto for Wheels India which too will see a similar transfer of stake. The Southern Roadways’ stake in Wheels India comprising 9.28% has been transferred to TVSS. This has increased TVSS’ stake in Wheels India from 20.41% to 29.69%. Sundaram Industries does not hold any shares in Wheels India. On February 4, the Sundaram Motors and Madras Auto Service Dealership and automotive business of TVSS, which includes stake in Wheels India as well as India Motor Parts & Accessories Limited (IMPAL), will be demerged and transferred to Trichur Sundaram Santhanam & Family Private Limited (TSSFPL). IMPAL as part of the promoter/ promoter group holds 4.57% of Wheels India, while TVSS holds 21.87% in IMPAL. Post transfer, TSSFPL will therefore acquire 29.69% in Wheels India directly and 4.57% indirectly through IMPAL. Similarly Sundaram Industries’ 6.45% stake and Southern Roadways’ 12.16% stake in Sundaram Brake Linings has been transferred to TVSS increasing its shareholding in Sundaram Brake Linings from 14.05% to 32.67%. On February 4 or the second appointed date, this will be demerged from TVSS and transferred to Madurai Alagar Enterprises Private Limited. TVS Srichakra will also follow a similar route with Sundaram Industries 9.79% stake moving to TVSS, thereby increasing its shareholding from 27.73% to 37.52%. This chunk will move to TVS Mobility Pvt Ltd on February 4, this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tvs-grp-rejig-as-part-of-family-settlement-starts/articleshow/88862854.cms||---

SEC is responsible for the preparation of electoral rolls and conducting municipal elections. Located at Nigam Bhavan in Kashmere Gate, it has started the process of setting up a computer cell for the polls. It will also develop a new and improved website. The commission is going to engage a reputed firm to set up the cell, provide help with preparation of electoral rolls, develop a web-based software, provide software training to electoral officers, and assist SEC even after the process is closed. The firm would also help in launching the poll app for voters, apart from a separate app for election officers. The voters’ app would have modules like search, voter slip, locating polling station, information about candidates, nominations, rejections, withdrawal and final list of those in the fray. Voters would also be able to submit complaints and get other details, like contact numbers and regular updates from SEC. The election officers would be able to download or upload observer reports and expenditure observer reports, address complaints of voters and returning officers, upload polling data, capture incidents, etc. The first responsibility of the firm would be preparation of ward-wise electoral rolls, apart from draft and final list of polling stations and generation of voter slips in PDF format. It would also develop the web-based software and implement all election-related works. Software training would be provided to all electoral officers, including returning officers, observers, sector officers, presiding officer, BLO, etc. The training would be regarding software applications for polling stations, parties, electoral roll, forms, voter complaint, observer reports, candidate expenses, online nominations, voter slip distribution, polling day data upload, etc. There would also be web-based management of permissions. The EVM inventory would be available on a web portal. The entire process from receiving EVMs to disbursal to returning officers after randomisation, transfer to the strong room and receiving it back would become even more efficient. The reports of the election with all details would be prepared and the firm would assist SEC even after polls are over for extracting information from the system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/poll-body-takes-e-turn-ahead-of-civic-battle/articleshow/88863300.cms||Sidharatha Roy

In an article written for the CPM’s ‘Chintha’ weekly, the CM said the argument that the project would break the state’s economic backbone is baseless. There is no government in the world that has not availed loans for infrastructure development, that will rejuvenate the economic growth and generate income. There should not be a second opinion regarding the fact that reducing the travel time by one fourth will give a boost to the business, tourism and information technology sectors, he said. He said that the claims that thousands of families would be rendered homeless by the project is false, as the land acquisition will be undertaken only by adhering to the compensation package that has been announced. He also recalled how the GAIL, highway and waterway projects were executed by allaying all the fears of the public. He added that the government would undertake public hearings to allay the fears of the people and also take the opinion of the people’s representatives regarding the SilverLine project. Many international agencies, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), have come forward offering financial assistance for the project, Vijayan said. It may be noted that the Centre has only given an ‘in-principle’ approval for the project and the final approval is yet to be received. While the DPR is yet to be cleared by the railway ministry, the funding part for the Rs 63,941 crore project is yet to get a final shape as the proposal for external funding is pending before the department of economic affairs (DEA). The state government had submitted a proposal for availing foreign funds to the tune of Rs 33,700 crore for the project. The state’s proposal to the DEA had said that the state is looking for funds from JICA, ADB, AIIB and KFW. The DEA had earlier sought an undertaking from the state government that in case of special purpose vehicle (SPV) failure in debt servicing, the liability will be borne by the state government, without any budgetary support from the ministry of railways. The state government had then informed the Centre that it is ready to take up the responsibility as sought by the Centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-project-has-already-got-central-railway-board-nods/articleshow/88864532.cms||---

The suburban rail which the UDF government had conceptualized is the only viable option for the state,” said Chandy.“The Indian Railways had encouraged the proposal for the suburban rail and it requires only 300 acre for acquisition. The total project cost was estimated at Rs 10,000 crore. However, SilverLine will cost around Rs 2 lakh crore when completed. About 20,000 families will have to be displaced for this project and 3,417 hectare will have to be acquired, he ädded.During the tenure of VS Achuthanandan government, they had proposed a high-speed rail for which DMRC was appointed as the consultant. They had submitted the DPR when UDF was in power. It had estimated a project cost of Rs 1.27 lakh crore and there was huge public sentiment against this project, said Chandy.This was the reason the UDF government came out with the proposal for suburban rail. The plan was to set up this line till Chengannur first and assess the feasibility to extend it further. The DPR was prepared by the Mumbai Rail Corporation and it was sent to the Union railway ministry. However, since the elections were announced the state government could not go ahead with it, said Chandy.The first LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan also shelved the light metro project proposal of the UDF government in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. All these projects would have been viable for the state. Instead, the Pinarayi Vijayan government is going ahead with SilverLine which the state will not be able to withstand, he alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-govt-scuttled-suburban-rail-now-planning-unviable-silverline-chandy/articleshow/88864533.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||MLCP at corporation office: User fee fixed at Rs 60 per hour||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation has prepared the draft note on user fee to be levied for the multi-level car parking facility on the premises of the corporation office. The facility which was constructed as part of Atal Mission For Rejuvenation And Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme could not be opened fully to the public although it was formally inaugurated two years ago. As per the draft report, user fee has been pitched at Rs 60 per hour. The first two levels of the parking facility will be given for free to the corporation councillors and corporation staff. The draft is under the consideration of Mayor Arya Rajendran. It is expected to be presented in the next council meeting. The state high powered steering committee (SHPSC) meeting held in the first week of January had expressed displeasure over the delay in opening the facility to the public. The SHPSC had directed that the user fee should be fixed within a week and that it should be made fully functional. It was directed that if the decision of SHPSC is not complied with, action should be initiated against the officials concerned with the city corporation. SHPSC also directed the city corporation to expedite the arrangement of the multi-level car parking facility at Chalai and Putharikandom. Both these works had to be terminated after the contractor asked for a 25% hike in estimate. The work for the MLCPs at Chalai and Putharikandom will now be retendered. The work has to be completed by March 31, as per the deadline fixed by SHPSC. Right from the onset, the civic body has been struggling to find a sustainable model for revenue generation. The project was completed at a cost of Rs 5.64 crore and monthly maintenance cost is slotted at Rs 3 lakhs. Expenses for power, labour and other aspects are also anticipated for which budgeting has to be done. The detailed project report had projected four times occupancy on a daily basis. The facility can accommodate 102 cars at a time and it is estimated that around 400 cars could be parked in the facility daily. The corporation officials have pointed out that even if the facility can be perceived as a kind of service, the cost based sustainability will be a key factor in the long run. The officials had earlier pitched a third party lease model so that the entire financial responsibility and maintenance can be shifted to the party that wins the lease. The state high powered steering committee had earlier approved the tender bids for MLCPs at the corporation office and Putharikandom at a tender excess of Rs 75 lakhs. The project involves a semi-automated multi-level car parking system using puzzle parking technology, internal and external electrical installations, fire alarm, fire fighting system with sump and landscaping and allied works at the corporation main office and installation of a parking facility with similar specifications at Putharikandam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/mlcp-at-corp-office-user-fee-fixed-at-rs-60-per-hour/articleshow/88864534.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Contrary to the claims of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the central government has not given any approval to the K-Rail project, said BJP state president K Surendran.If required, the state BJP leadership would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and brief him about the ill-effects of the project, said Surendran, in his address to the state office-bearers. “If need be, we will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the K-rail project that poses heavy damage to the environment and threatens the lives and livelihood of thousands of people,” he said. Surendran criticized Pinarayi for preferring medical treatment in a country like America that CPM sees as the enemy of Communism. Surendran accused the state police of treating SDPI with kid gloves and said the state is having a namesake police chief. “It’s the chief minister who directly oversees things. The ruling party is hell bent on unleashing violence against political opponents,” he said.Earlier, addressing a rally to the Secretariat, demanding strict action against SDPI, Surendran said that Islamic terror outfit ISIS is trying to create communal tension in Kerala. “The youth in Kerala are given online training in terrorism. Police, despite having a clear idea about the same, are doing nothing,” he added.Surendran alleged foul play behind the granting of bail to Abdul Hakkim, one of the accused in the murder of RSS activist Sanjith A in Palakakd. He said the state police were not carrying out proper investigation in cases relating to the murder of RSS-BJP workers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-to-intensify-protest-says-claims-of-centres-nod-fake/articleshow/88864535.cms||---

Some of them have been deprived of books while others cite lack of proper transportation facilities to reach schools on time. Hema Francis, a class X student who lives in a relief camp in Valiyathura was let down when she heard from her friend that the exams were over and that she could not attend it. The education of the girl has been interrupted for the past two years. Another problem faced by the children is the unavailability of buses. Only two buses are available in this route which is scheduled at 8.30 am. The children have to take two buses in order to reach the schools.  Hema was unable to attend the online classes as she did not have a mobile phone. Hema has always dreamt about securing a good job and providing a better life for her family. A boy named Beckham, who also lost his books during the shift, manages to study by borrowing friends’ books and he will return the books after finishing each portion. About 16 families from Kochuthope are sheltered in the godown of the food corporation near Valiyathura bridge. There are 16 rooms in the godown which have been separated by roofing sheets. From those families, there are around 20 children. Most of the families have more than five members and only one room is given to each family. The rooms are so tiny and congested. The authorities have built four toilets and two bathrooms for them. “My studies have been interrupted when the online classes began. I had no mobile phone. When I asked my teacher regarding the exam, she said she was unable to contact me as I have no access to a phone and I was not attending offline classes. Only students who have secured good marks in the past exam will be allowed to appear for the next exam,” said Hema.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/children-who-struggle-to-keep-up-with-studies/articleshow/88864539.cms||---

The dance form is choreographed in such a way that it includes the elements from both kathakali and French contemporary dance. The dance form, named as S. Thala, will be performed at Kerala Arts and Crafts Village near Kovalam at 6.00 pm on Friday. The one-hour performance features a poetic visual approach of Marguerite Duras’s prose. This dance form choreographed by French citizen Annette Leday will focus on the realistic life experiences and conditions of human life.  The incidents from real life will be showcased with the help of a LED screen as the background. The programme aims at giving a glimpse of French culture to enrich the knowledge of the Indian audience. The performers will include two kathakali artistes from Kerala and two French contemporary artists. The project S. Thala started soon after the success of Kathakali King Lear. The crew will also perform in Kochi and Chennai. This time also the choreographer has succeeded in developing a unique approach to intercultural contemporary creation by utilizing various movements and expressions from kathakali. The dancers include Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan who has been performing Kathakali for the past 42 years. Another speciality of the show is that no artist has been given any particular character. All the four artists will perform several characters according to the situation. As the audience will also become the characters, each person must have their own experiences.  “As it includes western movements, I was unable to learn the art form easily. But the continuous practice has helped me to perform well. As the choreographer has a good knowledge of kathakali, it was easy for us to communicate and that also helped us to improve,’ said Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/an-indo-french-fusion-treat-for-the-art-buffs/articleshow/88864540.cms||---

The police have also taken two of the suspects into custody. However, their arrests are yet to be recorded. Police said that the incident happened around 6.30 am on Wednesday. The complainant, Abdul Malik, was abducted by the gang in a car from the poultry shop at Azhikode near Nedumangad where the former worked part time. Nedumangad station house officer inspector Santhosh Kumar said that the gang abducted Malik from Azhikode and abandoned him at Nedumangad town. He was beaten up mercilessly inside the car during the journey. The inspector added that the cause of attack is suspected to be rivalry between families. Meanwhile, the relatives of Malik said that abduction and attack could be a case of mistaken identity. Two of the suspects in the case are siblings who owned a furniture shop at Azhikode. A few days ago there was a clash at their shop between two groups of men. The persons who attacked Malik might have falsely assumed that the latter was involved in the group that stormed their shop and unleashed violence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-abducted-beaten-up-by-gang/articleshow/88864545.cms||---

CPM politburo member M A Baby, CPM district secretary Anavoor Nagappan and other party leaders were present during the occasion. The area committees in the district had planned the dance performance as part of the CPM district conference scheduled to be held at Parassalla from January 14. At a Covid review meet held on Monday, the government had stipulated that only 50 people can assemble in gatherings, but the order was not clear on political functions. However, even as per the Covid protocols set earlier, not more than 150 people can assemble in public functions. The other day, health minister Veena George was also not ready to reply when she was asked about the mass gatherings occurring in the CPM district conferences. Thiruvananthapuram reported 2,200 cases on Tuesday, with a test positivity rate of 22.4%. The hospitals in the district have been seeing a steady rise in the inflow of Covid-19 patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-faces-row-over-covid-protocol-breach/articleshow/88864548.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC fines Surat top cop, five others 25,000||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday ordered six cops including Surat police commissioner to pay fine of Rs 25,000 for not adhering to the deadline to submit their replies in a contempt of court case filed by a person alleging custodial torture.  The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri granted adjournment to the cops till January 28 on making the payment to the court’s registry. The court was upset with the alleged contemptor cops for not taking the matter seriously and rebuked the state government. The court fined the cops for not filing their reply despite enough time granted to them. The case involved one Juned Saiyed from Surat who was picked up along with other youths in June 2020. The police filed a gambling complaint against them. Saiyed’s advocate Zubin Bharda submitted before the court that his client was picked up and beaten in police custody for merely an alleged breach of Covid-19 guideline. He was not released on bail, and assaulted. Later, the cops allowed him to leave. When his family admitted him to the hospital because of his injuries, the police slapped an FIR accusing him of gambling. Saiyed has claimed that the custodial torture he had to suffer was in clear violation of the Supreme Court’s judgment in D K Basu’s case in which detailed guidelines have been laid down regarding the treatment of an accused in police custody. During the hearing on Wednesday, the court found that only one of six police officials had filed an affidavit. When the government sought adjournment in the case, the court granted it by ordering the cops to pay up the amount personally. As the government disputed the claims of injuries, the court has asked the government to place all medico legal cases on the court's record. The court has ordered all the police officials to file their replies by next hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-fines-surat-top-cop-five-others-25000/articleshow/88864550.cms||---

She filed a complaint of domestic violence against her husband on Tuesday. The woman told Sola police that she got married to a man from Dethli village in Bechraji taluka of Mehsana on February 22, 2015. Theirs was a barter marriage in which her brother married her husband’s sister. “Seven months following the wedding, my husband and in-laws began harassing me over petty issues. My husband had no job and when I sought money from him, he would thrash me and tell me to get money from my parents. Since I had married according to the barter system, I kept mum for my brother’s sake,” said the complainant. On August 25, 2016, she gave birth to her first child at her parents’ place where she stayed till December 2018 as neither her husband nor her in-laws got her back. She alleged that her husband finally took her back only after the intervention of community elders. He, then, started working at her brother’s electric shop but later left that job also. “He then began suspecting me of having an affair with my maternal uncle and cousin. He would beat me a lot. When I raised the issue with my in-laws, they sided with him and abused me,” she alleged. She told police, “Even as my family and community elders tried to convince him not to harass or thrash me, he continued to beat me over petty issues. In August 2021, I took my kid and moved in with my parents.” The woman finally approached Sola police and filed a complaint of domestic violence, causing hurt and abetment against her husband and in-laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bartered-in-marriage-woman-thrashed-by-suspicious-spouse/articleshow/88864553.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Chilli fired, courier firm staffer robbed of 5 lakh||AHMEDABAD: Barely 24 hours after three angadia firm workers were attacked and robbed on Ashram Road, a courier firm employee was targeted in Vastrapur. Two men threw chilli powder in his eyes in front of Gujarat University Samras Hostel and fled with Rs 5.1 lakh late on Tuesday. The incident occurred during curfew hours at a spot where there were no CCTV cameras. According to a complaint filed with Vastrapur police, Jaafar Shaikh, 29, a resident of Juhapura, works as a supervisor with a courier firm in Naranpura. “He collects money from courier delivery boys every evening, counts it and takes it home. The next day, he deposits it in a bank,” said police. “On Tuesday night, he put all the money in a plastic bag which he kept in a cloth bag that he placed in his backpack before leaving office,” said police. A police officer said, “When Shaikh was riding his scooter from GMDC Circle to BPA Crossroads, a biker rammed into his vehicle from behind, causing him to fall on the road. Shaikh got up and parked his scooter on the roadside. The biker approached him and blamed him for applying sudden brakes. While Shaikh argued that he was not at fault, another man approached them and asked why they were fighting. “Shaikh turned to address him and the second man threw chilli powder at his face. The two men snatched his bag and fled on the bike. A couple of minutes later when Shaikh managed to open his eyes, he called the police control room and later filed a complaint of loot and abetment with Vastrapur police. Police said, “We did not find any CCTV footage as there was no camera in the area. There were cops deployed under the IIM-A flyover on BPA Crossroads but no one spotted the accused.” In the Ashram Road robbery, which occurred on Monday evening, Crime branch officials nabbed four accused within 30 minutes of the incident as a GPS tracker was inside one of the parcels they had taken.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/chilli-fired-courier-firm-staffer-robbed-of-5l/articleshow/88864554.cms||---

The department cross-checked information from the RTO and its own records and found the discrepancy is for an amount totalling Rs 17.92 crore. “We have started the process of issuing notices to for these unpaid taxes. We have also initiated the process of retrieving data of the vehicles registered in 2020 and 2021 from the RTO, which will be verified against our records,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of the AMC revenue committee. According to data made available by the department, 19,068 of these 24,487 vehicles are from areas falling in AMC limits before the expansion in 2020. The remaining 5,419 vehicles are registered from areas outside AMC limits. Of the vehicles that have tax pending, 13,068 are two-wheelers, 2,747 are cars and 2,796 are other vehicles including three-wheelers. “Vehicle tax is usually included in the vehicle bill at the dealership. People do not check their bills, and this may be why this situation arose. We appeal to people to check whether the vehicle tax is included in their bill when buying a vehicle,” Vakil said. He added that there’s no provision for penalizing vehicle tax defaulters. “We are considering introducing a penalty now,” he said. AMC collected Rs 97.54 crore in vehicle tax from April 1, 2021 to January 10, 2022, up 61% from Rs 60.48 crore in the same period last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tax-for-24k-vehicles-unpaid-in-2019/articleshow/88864557.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||UHC doc accused of poaching patients||AHMEDABAD: For many years now, the civic body has been empaneling private medical practitioners as consultants to attend to patients at the urban health centres (UHCs). But now a complaint registered at Rakhial UHC, accusing a medical consultant of coaxing patients at the AMC-UHC into visiting private clinic, has opened the pandora’s box. “We are looking for similar complaints across UHCs in eastern and western parts of the city. Most patients who visit the UHC cannot afford private consultation, which is the reason the government pays. But if these medical consultants direct patients to their private clinics, the matter has to be investigated,” claims a senior AMC official. It does not end there. In the report filed on Wednesday, a senior AMC official revealed that in the south and west zones, Asha workers and even Anganwadi workers are paid a commission if they successfully direct a patient to the consultants’ private clinics. Visiting consultants such as a pediatrician, a gynecologist and a general physician are paid an honorarium of Rs 75,000 a month for daily services from 9 am to 1 pm. Other specialists like pathologist, ophthalmologist, dentist etc are called on alternate days for visitation and paid Rs 37,500 for the four-hour service. “All specialists are required to provide their services on all working days and even the medicines have to be provided from the UHC. Only in rare circumstances are medicines to be bought from outside the UHC premises,” the AMC official added. While elaborating on the illegal practice, it was being alleged that in Rakhial, the doctor provided their visiting card with a token number behind it and patients were asked to leave their phones outside the consulting room. “Earlier, patients had been complaining of similar practice in south and west zones as well. We are looking into these complaints,” added the AMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/uhc-doc-accused-of-poaching-patients/articleshow/88864559.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Loot for casino debts, CCTV jackpot for cops||AHMEDABAD: Dariapur police on Wednesday arrested a peon of a bank for his involvement in the theft of Rs 9.75 lakh, which was pulled off by an accomplice who was struggling with Goa casino debts. Police’s CCTV gamble paid off: they had scanned the footage of 400 cameras to crack the case and nab the peon and his high roller friend. The theft had occurred at the Kalupur branch of Vijaya Bank, now merged with Bank of Baroda, on the night of December 30. Several teams, including technical and surveillance squads, were formed by Dariapur senior inspector R J Chaudhary. Cops had suspected an inside job. Chaudhary said all six locks were missing from the spot and the knob of the main safe had been removed and left on the floor. The safe had notes in Rs 2,000, Rs 500, and Rs 100 denominations. Only insiders would know that the knob could be removed easily, Chaudhary said, adding that the two arrested men are peon Vimal Patel, a Meghaninagar resident; and Javid Sandhi, a resident of Fatehwadi. Chaudhary said that it was a tough investigation Patel had switched off all CCTV cameras at the bank before the theft. However, a camera at a crossroads showed a two-wheeler parked near the bank premises. Investigations revealed that a person carrying a bag had driven off on this two-wheeler. Chaudhary said they scanned footage of over 400 CCTV cameras and spotted the two-wheeler going towards Patel’s house. The same vehicle was then spotted near Vasna. Chaudhary said that when interrogated, Patel broke down and confessed that he had conspired with Sandhi to loot the bank.He told cops that he had earlier worked at a spa with Sandhi and they frequently visited Goa. Sandhi had a girlfriend in Pune who worked at a spa too. The owner of the Pune spa had given Rs 4 lakh to Sandhi to open a spa in Ahmedabad. But things did not work out because Sandhi used the money for personal expenses, including a good time at Goa casinos. Chaudhary said the girlfriend was now asking Sandhi to return the money and hence the two men planned the theft. Chaudhary said Patel had a set of keys to the bank and gave it to Sandhi. Sandhi entered the bank, opened the safe, and stole Rs 9.5 lakh. He stored the money at Patel’s residence. Later, he left with a part of the stash for Pune and stayed with his girlfriend. When Sandhi returned, he was caught with Rs 2 lakh. The two had transferred some of the loot to various bank accounts, police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/loot-for-casino-debts-cctv-jackpot-for-cops/articleshow/88864560.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||String of corona events cuts down kite prices||AHMEDABAD: A couple of days ahead of Uttarayan, kite markets are usually brimming with people, not just through the day but at night as well. The scene is full of life: gleaming lights, shopkeepers screaming out rates, people looking to shop at the last minute for kites, manja, tapes, whistles, and sunglasses. However, with the night curfew beginning from 10pm, shopkeepers are compelled to shut shop early. Besides, muted sentiment in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases has curtailed the buzz at kite markets. Estimates of kitemakers and traders suggest that the overall demand has nosedived by a significant 30%. “As the Kite Festival was cancelled at the last minute, all the orders which we received specific to the festival and Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav events from the state government were cancelled,” said Salimbhai Mansuri, a kite manufacturer based in the Kalupur Tower area of the city. Mansuri added: “The cancellations caused a major loss to the business. That apart, the overall sales are low due to the surge in coronavirus infections and low-key festivities.” Initially, kite prices were higher by 20% as compared to last year. For instance, the price of a kodi (a set of 20) of the basic cheel kites —which cost about Rs 100 last year — had gone up to Rs 120. However, soon the Covid cases went up, the announcement of the cancellation of the Kite Festival was made, and fresh restrictions on celebrations were imposed. Kite prices declined once again as a consequence. Iliyas Rangrez, a kite trader in the Jamalpur area of Ahmedabad, said: “The basic cheel kites which were sold at Rs 100 for a set of 20 till December-end now cost Rs 80.” He added: “We had no choice but to reduce prices because the footfalls in the market dramatically went down.” He went on to say: “People are busy during the day and therefore often visit markets at night. But due to the night curfew, not many are venturing out.” Kite manufacturers, in fact, are taking a big hit with the recent reduction in prices. While they have lost a major chunk of their business with dwindling corporate orders and the Kite Festival cancellations, they are also compelled to sell kites at lower rates. Naseruddin Shaikh, a kite shop owner in Jamalpur, said: “Since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, the costs of raw materials that go into making kites have gone up.” The materials include paper and the flexible wooden stick used to hold a kite’s shape. “Despite bearing higher input costs, we’re compelled to sell kites at a lower cost which leaves us with thinner margins and revenues,” Shaikh said. “We had also previously requested the administration to relax market timings and curfew timings so that business can pick up.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/string-of-corona-events-cuts-down-kite-prices/articleshow/88864562.cms||---

The state government shut down in-person education for Classes 1 to 9, and classroom attendance is optional for Classes 10 to 12. Over the past month, more than 1,500 schoolchildren tested positive for Covid-19 in Gujarat. Several schools have also opted to conduct only online classes. Raja Pathak, trustee of Satva Vikas School, said, “In line with govt guidelines, we have made it mandatory for students wishing to attend in-person classes to get vaccinated. This is to push for maximum coverage in the 15 to 18 years age group.” On the other hand, guardians of school students say that the guidelines of the Centre or state do not say that vaccination for students is to be made mandatory. Many schools witnessed 70-80 per cent of their eligible students getting vaccinated, after Covid immunization was opened to the 15-18 years age group on January 3. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/schools-make-jabs-must-to-enter-class/articleshow/88864565.cms||---

At least nine laboratories have been engaged for the purpose. “AMC will pay Rs 320 per test that are carried out at these specialized testing booths set up by the laboratory,” claimed a senior AMC official. Each day, around 18,000 RT-PCR tests are carried out within municipal limits across government and medical labs according to municipal officials. “SVP has the potential to process 1,500 RT-PCR samples a day for Covid, but as the numbers are increasing, we have asked the nine laboratories capable of carrying out these tests to set up booths,” the official said. The officials also added that RAT tests were not enough to detect the Covid variant. In the next two weeks, the AMC may increase the RT-PCR testing booths in the city. “We are looking at the post-Uttarayan period when we expect the Covid numbers to surge drastically and may require more RT-PCR testing booths,” said the AMC health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/9-labs-to-carry-out-random-tests/articleshow/88864569.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: SpiceJet flights to operate from Terminal 2 at SVPI from February||AHMEDABAD: If you’re taking a SpiceJet flight from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad in February, you will likely board from the international terminal i.e. Terminal 2 (T2). As runway resurfacing is set to begin at SVPI from January 17, 52 flights are expected to be rescheduled. The decision to move operations of SpiceJet from Terminal 1 (domestic) to Terminal 2 has been taken to cater to the increasing passenger rush. The decision is part of a proposal under discussion since October 2020, by which operations of two airlines will be shifted from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. About 52 flights are expected to be rescheduled at the city airport from January 17, when runway resurfacing takes place on all days except Sundays and public holidays. In this period, flight movements will be completely suspended from 9am to 6pm. City airport authorities have received approval for runway resurfacing work from the aviation regulator, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). “The first airline scheduled to shift is SpiceJet Airlines. This will be in addition to the existing operations of Air India and its subsidiary airline, Alliance Air, and international carriers. The necessary work is in progress at T2 and the shifting process is to be complete by February 2022,” said an SVPI airport spokesperson. Apart from the current operations, with the SpiceJet shift, an additional 15 flights will be operating out of Terminal 2. All passengers of SpiceJet will be handled through T2 for arrivals as well as departures, the spokesperson further said. About 170 flights operating from the city airport will depart or arrive either before 9am or after 6pm. To manage the rush, it had been proposed to shift operations of two airlines from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/spicejet-flights-to-operate-from-t2-at-svpi-from-feb/articleshow/88864574.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Footfalls nosedive at restaurants, multiplexes||AHMEDABAD: Footfalls at restaurants, multiplexes, and malls have nosedived amid the recent spurt in cases of Covid-19. With a fresh set of guidelines capping the numbers on public gatherings and the extension of night curfew timings, restaurants have seen an 80% dip in footfalls. Takeaway orders have also declined. Multiplexes are compelled to cancel shows with new releases getting postponed in the wake of the rising Covid cases. Dilip Thakkar, an Ahmedabad-based restaurateur, said: “In December, the curfew was imposed after midnight and because of that business was good as we received a lot of footfalls in the evening.” He added: “As compared to December, footfalls have now dipped to barely 10% in the first ten days of January as people have stopped venturing out due to curfew restrictions.” He went on to say: “With the curfew starting at 10pm, we need to shut shop by 9.30pm latest, which means we cannot entertain guests after 8.45pm. This is hurting the business.” Similar is the case with an Ashram Road restaurant where dine-in customers have declined by a sizable 50%. Even takeaway orders have been hit. “The sentiment has nosedived across the city with Covid cases showing a massive spike,” said Baiju Dhanani, another Ahmedabad-based restaurateur. “Therefore, customer footfalls as well as takeaway orders have gone down.” Hoteliers and restaurateurs are pinning their hopes on Uttarayan festivities when at least takeaway order volumes are expected to pick up. Multiplexes have seen an estimated 60-70% decline in customer footfalls and overall business. “Most new film releases which were scheduled in January have now been postponed by a month. We’ve been running the same movies for the past four weeks and naturally viewer interest will decline,” said Niraj Ahuja, general manager of a multiplex on SG Road. Ahuja added: “Moreover, with Covid cases rapidly surging, people have been apprehensive about venturing out for the past ten days which has certainly impacted business.” The owner of another multiplex in Ahmedabad said on the condition of anonymity: “The multiplex business throughout January and February is expected to reel from losses.” He added: “That’s not just because of restrictions and guidelines but also because of deferred releases. The third wave will slow down the recovery of the multiplex business.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/footfalls-nosedive-at-restaurants-multiplexes/articleshow/88864575.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ordinance to amend land-grabbing laws issued||Gandhinagar: After a reprimand by the Gujarat high court over large scale misuse of the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2020, the Gujarat government has promulgated an ordinance to amend contentious provisions of the act. The Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2022 has modified the original provisions of the Act which were affecting tribal rights. Dated January 11, the amended section reads, “Provided that ‘land’ shall not include the land in respect of which applications for grants are pending on the date of commencement of this act under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006.” By this crucial amendment now no action will be initiated against any tribal person under the land grabbing act if any such proposal before the concern authority is pending for the allocation of land under the ST and Traditional Forest Dwellers Act.” In another significant amendment through the ordinance, the government has empowered an authority in the form of a special court to decide whether an application is prima facie frivolous or vexatious. If the court, in its first assessment finds the application to be frivolous, the applicant will not be allowed to be called as witness against anyone. Key sources in the state government said, “All the key directions of the high court for amendment in the act have been included in the ordinance.” The ordinance mentions that any person aggrieved by the order of the special court can file an appeal in the high court against any civil or criminal proceedings. The aggrieved person will have to file an appeal in the high court within 30 days of the judgment. If the high court is satisfied, aggrieved person can file appeal in 60 days of the judgment as well, the ordinance says. “On receipt of any such appeal, the high court shall, after giving the parties to the appeal a reasonable opportunity of being heard, make such order, as it may think fit, confirming, modifying or reversing the order appealed against or remanding the case back with such direction as it may think fit for a fresh order after taking additional evidence, if necessary,’’ the ordinance says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ordinance-to-amend-land-grabbing-laws-issued/articleshow/88864584.cms||---

A thief who broke into a house near Mansa town in Gandhinagar, found a blanket during the theft, wrapped himself in it and promptly fell asleep. He woke up in the morning only to find himself surrounded by the owner of the house, locals and a posse of policemen. Vishnu Dantani allegedly broke into the house at Ridrol village on Tuesday night. The 25-year-old ransacked the cupboards and found gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 7 lakh. During his search for valuables, he also found a blanket. As he had not been sleeping properly for almost a week, Dantani took a leaf from Goldilocks’s book, wrapped himself up and decided to catch a few winks before he left with the booty. According to the FIR filed with Mansa police, the house belongs to Vishnu Patel, a 61-year-old resident of Ghatlodia.  Late on Tuesday, he got a call from his cousin, Kanu Patel, telling him that someone had broken into the house. When Kanu and other locals entered the house, they saw Dantani asleep with the valuables next to him. They latched the main door from the outside and called Patel and the police. The thief got a rude awakening when he woke to find himself fenced in by locals and cops. The minimum temperature in Gandhinagar was 7°C on Tuesday night. Dantani, a resident of Badpura village in Mansa taluka, told cops that he had not been sleeping well for the past few days. “He told us that he was searching for the valuables when he found the blanket. As it was chilly, he wrapped himself in it. He felt so comfortable in Patel’s house that he fell asleep,” police said. Mansa police have registered a case of burglary and criminal trespassing against Dantani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/thief-steals-a-snug-nap-wakes-up-to-cops/articleshow/88864583.cms||---

The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore issued notice to the central authorities and sought replies by January 17. By then, the court requested assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas to discuss the issue with the highest authority and “try to assert whether the department would be agreeable to accept tax audit report and I-T return filing in physical form. We request the authority concerned to take a practical view of the problem that assesses are facing on account of technical glitches in the portal. The authorities should not overlook this and try to solve the problem and ease the difficulties that assesses are facing”. The court further said that though CBDT has extended the deadline for filing by one month, till February 15, taxpayers may not be able to make good use of the time if the problem with the portal persists. The judges said that if the technical glitches are not removed, assesses might not file their returns till February 2023 as well. The HC was hearing two petitions raising concerns about the I-T department’s insistence on payment of interest for delays in filing returns under Section 234A of the Income Tax Act. The petitioners also urged the court to direct the authorities to permit them to file returns in physical form and whenever they get the chance, they would upload the forms on the portal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/why-cant-taxpayers-file-returns-in-physical-form/articleshow/88864585.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||10 years in jail for land grabbing harsh: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday questioned the state government on harsh punishment provided for land grabbing offences and suggested to think over the proportionality of punishment. The minimum punishment provided in the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act is 10 years in jail and this may go up to 14 years. During the hearing of numerous petitions challenging the Constitutional validity of the law, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri expressed concern about the quantum of punishment prescribed in the law. The CJ said that the minimum punishment is 10 years in jail. The court said if a person purchases half a guntha land and after a passage of time it is proved that the sale was not proper, ten years imprisonment appears little harsh. The judges suggested that instead of minimum 10-year imprisonment, the punishment should be ‘up to’ 10 years or something in which the special court, formed for this law, has discretion in awarding punishment. In response, the advocate general, Kamal Trivedi cited several provisions in different sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), in which minimum sentence is prescribed and courts do not have discretion to award less punishment to offender than the prescribed minimum one. He submitted, “The idea behind keeping 10 years minimum punishment is to see that offence of land-grabbing is dealt with utmost strictness.” He also said that the punishment prescribed in this law cannot be said to be barbaric. However, the court was of the opinion that 10-year imprisonment as minimum punishment is bit harsh and the government should think over the quantum and introduce words like ‘up to’ 10 years. The judges reiterated that a person buying a little piece of land may be proved a land grabber years after the land deal without any fault of his and the courts will not have any option but to send him behind bars for 10 years. As the government law officer defended it by saying that it is legislature’s discretion, the judges said, “The courts will not be having any option (but to award harsh punishment). Think over proportionality of punishment.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/10-yrs-in-jail-for-land-grabbing-harsh-hc/articleshow/88864587.cms||---

According to case details, Nachiketa Engineers sued Kavya Ploytech in civil court at Mirzapur rural court campus for alleged infringement on its exclusive rights over a design for a sugarcane juice machine that it had registered in its name in2018. Nachiketa claimed that its design was novel and eye-catching, a new shape and configuration in respect to sugarcane juice machine. It put in hard work, innovation and years of experience to design the machine. However, Kavya indulged in piracy and launched similar machine in April 2019 and hence it should be stopped from using registered design. When Kavya received court’s notice, it filed an application and demanded that Nachiketa’s exclusive rights be cancelled because the design was neither new nor original. It was submitted that Nachiketa had started selling the product before registration of the design, and this makes it non-registrable. Besides, it was claimed that the same design of sugarcane juice machine was first patented in 1994 in the USA. One Khodiyar Industries had registered this design in India. A Taiwan company manufactures and has been selling this machine for nearly 30 years. As it was not new and original, the design is not registrable. It does not satisfy provisions of Section 4 of the Designs Act, 2000 and therefore is liable for cancellation under the provisions of Section 19. The plaintiff is not entitled to claim exclusive rights over this design that is based on common principles of manufacturing. It was submitted that on demand of cancellation of such registered design under provisions of section 22 (4), the case is required to be transferred to the high court. A request was made for transfer and the plaintiff’s lawyer did not object to it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/design-of-sugarcane-juice-machine-dispute-lands-in-hc/articleshow/88864588.cms||---

Generally, contractors would not come forward for any work in tribal areas as they allege bills would not be passed in time. But the government has now focussed on the development of tourism places. It may be recalled that the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) had planned a resort at Lammasingi with an estimated cost of 5 crore and started work in 2018. “We are trying to complete works as early as possible. Around 70% to 75% of the work has been completed. The APTDC is trying to get another contractor to complete the remaining work. Meanwhile, we are trying to inaugurate the restaurant for the convenience of the tourists,” tourism minister Muttamsetty Srinivasa Rao told TOI. Lammasingi is a small village in Chintapalli mandal of Visakhapatnam district on the eastern ghats. At an altitude of 1,000 meters above sea level, the area is cooler than the surrounding plains with moist deciduous forest cover. It attracts around 2,000 tourists on a normal day and more than 6,000 in rainy and winter seasons, from September to February. But there are no accommodation facilities. The state government planned the development project and commenced work three years ago. As per the project, eight cottages, a function hall, a restroom, and a restaurant would be constructed initially. Around 70% of works were completed, except Kerala-type roof works, wood works and others. The contractor stopped works allegedly due to pending bills. The department called for tenders again for the remaining works, but no one has come forward yet. “Tenders would be called in a day or two to complete the works by June or July-end . The entire project would be thrown open the next season. In the meantime, we are planning to open the temporary restaurant for the benefit of the public,” APTDC managing director M Satyanarayana said. APTDC has around 99 acres at Lammasingi and it has plans to provide many amenities including good ambiance and landscaping. “It was an untapped area for tourism until a few years ago. We are planning to provide facilities to attract more and more tourists,” MD added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/contractors-shy-away-from-hill-resort-project-at-lammasingi/articleshow/88864590.cms||Siva G

---||Visakhapatnam||Mangoes from Andhra Pradesh to line US shelves again||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Union government has secured the approval of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for export of Indian mangoes to the USA in the new season. The export of Indian mangoes has been restricted by the USA since 2020 as USDA inspectors were unable to visit India due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The USDA’s approval would pave the way for exports from traditional mango production belts such as Andhra Pradesh. While several countries import mangoes based on the certification given by the phytosanitary inspectors of Andhra Pradesh, countries like the USA and South Korea deploy their own inspectors to India to certify the mango consignments. According to industry sources, traders export about 10,000 tonnes of mangoes from Andhra Pradesh to various countries every year. But the official estimates put this figure at about 2,000 tonnes. The difference in the numbers stems from the fact that the traders, after procuring mangoes from the state, export them from international flights and ports in other states like Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, etc. Additional director, department of horticulture, M Venkateswarulu, said that irradiation treatment is a must to export mangoes to the USA. “Vapour heat treatment is required to export mangoes to countries like South Korea and Japan. Andhra Pradesh has two VHT facilities in Tirupati and Nuzvid out of the four such facilities in the country. The export norms vary from country to country. For instance, several Middle East countries import mangoes certified by the state’s phytosanitary inspectors. But it is different for countries like the USA, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc.” said Venkateswarlu. The additional director added that Andhra Pradesh horticulture department has eight phytosanitary inspectors. “Processes like irradiation are aimed at eliminating the live pest, fungus or disease in the mangoes. The state horticulture department is conducting training programmes for the farmers, in association with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, to enable them to utilise export opportunities in overseas markets. Banganapalli, Suvarnarekha, Alphonso and Collector are the most exported mango varieties from the state. The horticulture department is working towards increasing the mango exports from the state,” said M Venkateswarulu. Industry sources said that lack of international cargo and related infrastructural facilities at the airports of the state is hampering the direct export opportunities from the state. The traders have to rely on shipping ports and airports in other states. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh has 12 pack houses for horticulture crops. But these also reportedly lack connecting facilities to improve the export scenario of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/mangoes-from-ap-to-line-us-shelves-again/articleshow/88864597.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Though the distribution of hailstorms was not uniform, many pockets in Ranchi experienced it in the first half of Wednesday.

Health minister Banna Gupta, who is currently in home isolation after testing positive for the virus last week, too was part of the virtual inauguration ceremony.During his brief address, Soren cited how the state has managed to tackle the first and second waves despite numerous challenges and assured that the government is better prepared in all terms. He said, “There was a time when the Covid-19 hit us, the state didn’t have even a single testing machine. But today, we have set up several RT-PCR labs in key cities and many are in the process of installation. Recently, we also procured two Cobas machine, a high end device for quick testing, in Ranchi and Dumka. Hospitals too have been upgraded on a war footing in last two years. We don’t know how long will the pandemic continue, but are sure that even after that is over, the assets which we are creating will benefit for years to come.”The seven PSA plants are set up in Ranchi, Ramgarh, Deoghar, and East Singbhum. Gupta added that they are in addition to 93 PSA plants that were already installed.“Be it oxygen, beds, or other medical facilities, the health department is better prepared in all terms this time as we had started working in anticipation of another wave in advance. As far as beds are concerned, currently we have about 28,000 dedicated Covid beds in the state, but luckily, occupancy is barely eight per cent of the total active cases at the moment,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/7-psa-plants-launched-in-4-dists-to-fight-covid-crisis/articleshow/88864603.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Mysuru: Patients less likely to need hospital care, say healthcare providers||MYSURU: Health care providers have said that hospitalisation of Covid patients may not be as high as the previous two pandemic waves, going by the trends in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. However, the district administration has geared up to tackle the challenges by reserving over 6,300 beds. Covid cases are going up and the positivity rate too is high. According to a comparison of data of hospitalisation in metro cities, active cases a year back and now are the same, whereas the percentage of hospitalisation of patients is around 15%, which is lower compared to the previous waves, claim private health care providers. The requirement of beds may not be challenging. Gopal Gowda Hospital managing director Dr Santhrupth said that going by statistics in other cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, “I don’t think bed requirement in Mysuru will be high like it was during the previous waves. We, however, have prepared for all challenges with beds, oxygen, ventilators and ICU beds. Apollo Hospital vice-president NG Bhartheesha Reddy said the trend in metro cities indicates that patients today do not require hospital beds. “During the previous waves, about 50-70% of infected patients were hospitalised and now the situation is a reversal. Hospitalisation is less. As per our study, Mysuru witnessed a rise in Covid cases on the lines of metro cities after two to six weeks. We are expecting the same trend with regard to hospitalisation,” he said. The office of the deputy commissioner has told the private hospitals to keep aside 30% of beds for Covid patients. Centralised bed management system in placeThe district administration has geared up to tackle challenges with regard to hospital beds to extend help to patients. Officers have reserved 6,300 beds in government and private hospitals and Covid care centres. A centralised bed management system, where authorities will manage beds in private hospitals through a war room and guide the patients to hospitals and centres, depending on bed availability, will be in place. Deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham said the administration will manage the hospital beds under a centralised system. The positivity rate has been more than 5 % in the last three days in the district. On Tuesday, the positive rate was nearly 10%. Officers had decided to sound the alarm and shut the schools in Mysuru city and Mysuru taluk. Krishna Rajendra Hospital medical superintendent Dr BL Nanjundaswamy said there was no shortage of beds. “We are prepared for any challenge. In KR Hospital, there are 600 beds, at the trauma centre there are 250 beds and at the super-specialty hospital about 200 beds. The majority of them are oxygen beds,” he said. “Only patients with moderate to severe conditions are treated at our facilities. Once they are hospitalised, they require a minimum of 14 days of stay.

The devotees from Mandya, Hassan, Chamarajanagar, and Shivamogga have tested positive till now raising concerns in old Mysuru and Malnad regions. The district administrations of the old Mysuru region are struggling to trace the devotees and get them tested as the devotees are spread all over the districts. Health officers have intensified surveillance. According to the devotees, generally they go on pilgrimage in the month of December or January. “After a ‘vrath’ they visit the temple. At the time of the pilgrimage, the devotees carry an irumudi which contains coconut, banana, etc,” said Arun Kumar, a devotee from Shivamogga, who is visiting the temple for the last three years. “A majority of the devotees are women,” he said. “There are no fixed days for the vrath. Many perform it for several days according to their convenience,” he said. According to the rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa, who arranged 86 buses to ferry 4,300 devotees to the TN taemple, it is a matter of belief. “Like Chamundi and Ayyappa, people especially women follow this deity. We are planning to send devotees in 106 buses from Shivamogga next year,” he said. DC Nanjunda, Associate Professor, Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion, University of Mysore (UoM) said, “Women from many social groups are devotees of this temple. In this temple, women are allowed to offer puja to the deity directly, which is very rare in any Indian temple,” he said. According to Mysuru DHO Dr KH Prasad, surveillance has been intensified and the number of tests has been increased to 9,000 per day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/officials-step-up-vigil-after-om-shakthi-devotees-test-ve/articleshow/88864624.cms||---

As per the revised order, offline classes are allowed for Class 10 students.

However, once a bridge is built across the river Cauvery in the Mekedatu project site, the distance between the Hanur and Bengaluru will come down by around 60 kilometers. We can reach the Kanakapura town and, Bengaluru easily,” he said.“Along with a bridge, there is a need of constructing a road along a 3km stretch inside the forest too. If these two works are completed, it will help the Chamarajanagar district,” he said.If the new road is constructed, it will help the devotees who visit the hill stations and temples like MM hills of the Chamarajanagar district, he added.According to Narendra, this road proposal was first mooted by his father late G Raju Gowda in 1978. Raju Gowda, a former minister also appealed to then CM HD Deve Gowda for the same in 1994. “When Deve Gowda was the CM, the DPR was ready. Due to political reasons, the project proposal didn’t see the light of the day. Now I am pursuing this project with Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh,” he said.Narendra observed that this project is helpful for all the stakeholders including Tamil Nadu. “66 TMC of water will be available once this project is completed. It will help to resolve the water and electricity crisis including regular water supply to Bengaluru city,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/mekedatu-project-critical-for-development-of-dist-says-mla/articleshow/88864628.cms||---

Petitioner Suhas Morey, director of Revati Associates and Infrastructure was put behind bars on January 6, 2021, when he appeared in front of the commission in a case filed by respondent Dhanraj Khaparde, a senior citizen from Katol. The latter had purchased three plots from Morey for Rs65 lakh and paid Rs55 lakh advance. After failing to get the properties, he filed a case with the commission for refund of his amount. The commission ordered Morey to refund Rs55 lakh to Khaparde along with interest on October 21, 2016. When he failed to comply with the ruling, non-bailable warrants were issued against him, but he was released on bail later. On January 6 last year, he appeared before the commission and pleaded not guilty. However, the judges cancelled his bail for not complying with their order for over five years and remanded him to the magisterial custody by cancelling his bail. Since then, he has been behind bars till last week of December, and four bail pleas have been rejected. “Commission proceedings reveal that till date there is no progress, but dates are given. Though the petitioner was in magisterial custody, still there is no progress which is quite amazing. Section 27 of Consumer Protection Act, 2016, provides maximum sentence which may extend up to three years. Without holding trial, the petitioner is kept behind bars for near-about one year. It is a fit case to exercise writ jurisdiction since there is violation of personal liberty,” Justice Vinay Joshi said. According to him, the commission has pre-judged the matter and before concluding the trial, incarcerated the petitioner. “Certainly, he can be kept behind bars, if he violates bail conditions. However, the order of January 6, 2021, itself speaks that he himself appeared and was placed in jail. This approach of keeping him behind bars and adjourning the matter for a long period is quite disturbing.” While quashing the commission’s order rejecting Morey’s bail pleas, HC directed it to grant him bail. “One can understand taking a petitioner in custody if he jumps bail or has been brought under execution of warrant. Generally, in that eventuality, the defaulter is being taken into custody to secure his/her presence for trial. However, January 6 order, nowhere spells that there was likelihood of petitioner absconding. Only considering his past antecedents and particularly, non-compliance of the order, his bail was cancelled.” Justice Joshi pointed out that the trial was yet to be conducted in which, whether it was wilful default or despite sufficient means, the petitioner avoided to pay, was to be adjudicated. “The situation was such that if he pleads guilty then he would have been punished. Alternatively, when he denied, still, he was taken into custody without proceedings. Before finding that he had deliberately avoided paying or wilfully at default, he was incarcerated and languishing in jail for a year. The commission’s approach was wholly against the principles of natural justice. ” WHAT HC SAID * Commission proceedings reveal no progress in trial, but dates given * Consumer Act provides maximum sentence up to 3 years * Without holding trial, petitioner behind bars for near-about one year * Commission pre-judged matter & before concluding trial, incarcerated petitioner * This approach of keeping him in jail and adjourning matter is quite disturbing||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-raps-consumer-panel-for-keeping-man-in-jail-for-1-yr-without-trial/articleshow/88863320.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

However, even after four years, major departments including agriculture and horticulture are yet to be shifted from Kollegal.Hanur Primary Health Centre is also yet to be upgraded as taluk general hospital. The government has formed new taluks to take the administration to the doorsteps of the people. But it is not realised yet at Hanur.As densely populated areas like Gopinatham, Jallipalya and Hugyam were located 60 to 100km away from the taluk headquarter, the government formed this new taluk after bifurcating Kollegal, to help the people give better access to government services. Except the office of tahasildar, treasury, taluk panchayat, sub-registrar office, key department offices like social welfare, scheduled tribe, animal husbandry and veterinary science office are yet to be shifted from Kollegal. As these departments have not shifted, people from faraway places must still visit Kollegal for official work.“Former CM Siddaramaiah, former district minister Mahadevprasad and local MLA Narendra played a key role in granting taluk status. Government must expedite the work of shifting major department offices, constructing taluk general hospital after upgrading Hanur Primary Health Centre,” said former taluk panchayat president Murudeshwaraswamy.Speaking to TOI, Hanur tahasildar G H Nagaraj said he had already brought the matter to the notice of district administration as well as the local MLA. “Due to the pandemic-induced financial constraints, state government has delayed releasing necessary funds in shifting the offices to new taluk headquarters. The district administration has already drawn the attention of the state government on the matter,” Chamarajanagar additional deputy commissioner Katyinidevi told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/despite-granting-taluk-status-govt-offices-yet-to-be-shifted-to-hanur/articleshow/88864630.cms||---

But sadly, they want to do business in dollars,” he said. He spoke after inaugurating Vivekananda Jayanti and national youth week celebrations at the Hindustan College here. The event was organised by the district administration in collaboration with the department of youth empowerment and sports, Mysuru zilla panchayat, and the NSS unit of the college. “Today’s generation is forgetting those who fought for social reforms, freedom struggle, and other causes. Youth should understand history. They must start reading more,” he said. Mysuru ZP deputy secretary Prem Kumar said Vivekananda spread the fragrance of Indian culture, heritage, and religion across the globe. “He led the revival of Indian values. He is the tallest spiritual leader of the country,” he said, adding Vivekananda’s preaching will guide Indian society forever. K Suresh, assistant director, department of youth empowerment and sports said the event will help motivate youth to take up social service besides inculcating various values in life.Follow his ideals: MLAChamaraja MLA L Nagendra said Swamy Vivekananda made the world look towards Hinduism, while speaking at the Vivekananda Jayanti organised by the Paduvarahalli Sneha Balaga here. “We all must follow the ideals preached by the Vivekananda to attain success in life,” the BJP legislator said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/swami-vivekanandas-contributions-remembered/articleshow/88864631.cms||---

We are confused about which one to follow. Already, due to the first and second wave lockdowns, thousands of families are facing financial crisis. If another lockdown is imposed, it will further affect them,” he stated.“The government is creating confusion through so many orders at a time. We don’t know which one is correct,” said Prashanth.“Due to the fear of lockdown and weekend curfew, we can see congestion in many places. Even the experts have made it clear that none of these measures are helpful in containing the spread of the infection. We must learn to live with this virus for a few more years,” he said.“Fifty per cent occupancy order is not practical. The virus is not severe. The rules are violated by politicians every day. These unrealistic orders are affecting business badly,” said Prashanth. “People are attending rallies in a large numbers, but others are barred from having lunch in a hotel. What is the logic behind these orders,” asked federation vice president Narayana Gowda.

---||Vijayawada||Rooster sales slump due to Covid, crackdown in Krishna, East Godavari districts||VIJAYAWADA: Sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases has affected the rooster sale in Krishna and East Godavari districts. While preparations for cockfights are in full swing ahead of Sankranti, the sale of trained roosters slowed down in Krishna and West Godavari districts.  ‘Assel’ breed roosters trained in Krishna district are usually in high demand during Sankranti season. Rooster farms in green mango gardens located in Nuzividu area used to be crowded with buyers including ministers and film stars selecting roosters for cockfights. Despite the Covid-19 outbreak, many buyers from Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu came to the local farms and bought roosters in 2021. The price of ‘nemali kaki’ variety rooster touched a record price of 3.2 lakh at a farm in Adavinekkalam that year.  Breeders expected a better price this year as the Covid-19 situation was under control till the second week of December last and they trained a huge number of roosters. But the increasing number of Omicron cases is affecting the sales.  “Sale of roosters usually gets over three days before Sankranti festival. But the situation is quite different this year. Only 20 per cent of trained roosters have been sold to date and the buyers from Telanaga reduced drastically,” said M Ranga Rao who runs a rooster farm at Mylavaram area.  Stringent action initiated by the Krishna district authorities and Vijaywada police against cockfights is also an important reason for the sudden fall in the sale of roosters. Krishna district police identified around 128 places where cockfight arenas were set up in the past and also closed down units that manufactured knives used in cock fights. Police on Tuesday booked cases against 18 people who indulged in cockfights and seized stake money to the tune of 42,000, seven roosters and vehicles from their possession at Mylavaram and Kanchikacherla. However, rooster breeders estimate that the sales will pick up during festival days and hope police will permit cockfights without knives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/rooster-sales-slump-due-to-covid-crackdown-in-krishna-eg-districts/articleshow/88864639.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Passengers resent challans to vehicles at Ramavarappadu||VIJAYAWADA: While the private travel buses are chocking the traffic at Ramavarappadu junction, police are issuing challans to those vehicles which come to drop off their near and dear citing illegal parking. The officials on the one hand allow the private travel buses to stop at the busiest junction in the city to enable passengers to board the bus and on the other hand impose fines for stopping vehicles at the junction for a few minutes. Most private buses have made Ramavarappdu a pickup point on either side of the National Highway – 16 (NH-16). While there exists free space for the buses and other vehicles to stop on the southern side for those going towards Hyderabad or Chennai, the northern side road has no such facility. The highway also takes a sharp turn leaving no space for the vehicles to stop. Despite the space constraints at the junction where traffic gets accumulated from four sides, the private travels made it a pickup point. Though it is convenient for passengers to board the bus at Ramavarappadu, regular traffic takes a hit during night as private buses makes a bee line for the junction. What makes things worse for the passengers is that the traffic police are not allowing them to stop their vehicles and are issuing challans even though the vehicle stops only for a few minutes. M Gopikrishna, a resident of Gunadala who received a challan for illegal parking, shared his experience with traffic police. “I went to drop my sister who wanted to catch a bus to Visakhapatnam. I stopped my car at the pickup point for hardly five minutes. I did not even get down from the car knowing well about the traffic problem at the junction. Before my sister got down and boarded the bus, traffic police issued a challan to me for illegal parking” he said. ADCP traffic, T Sarkar, said they are planning to utilise the freeway road available adjacent to the highway for private travels buses. He acknowledged the problem at Ramavarappadu and said they are working on solutions. Deputy transport commissioner (DTC) for Krishna district, M Purendra said they are working on an alternate solution by shifting pickup point of private travels out from the city. “We will place the issue before the road safety committee in the next meeting. The private travels can ferry passengers from various locations in smaller vehicles to the pickup point on the outskirts of the city without creating traffic snarls in the city. We will come up with a workable solution very soon.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/passengers-resent-challans-to-vehicles-at-ramavarappadu/articleshow/88864640.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Township proposal may be cleared on January 21||VIJAYAWADA: The state cabinet is scheduled to meet on January 21 at the Velagapudi secretariat. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will chair the meeting, during which the cabinet is likely to take several important decisions, besides clearing the Jagananna townships proposal which the government launched earlier this week. The government has proposed townships for the middle class at affordable prices and the first phase has already been launched at Nowluru in Guntur district, Dharmavaram in Anantapur district, Rayachoti in Kadapa district, Kavali in Nellore district, Kandukuru in Prakasam district, and Eluru in West Godavari district. The cabinet has to clear the proposal after which it will be launched across the state. The CM is likely to explain the scheme in detail to his cabinet colleagues and senior officials during the meeting. The chief minister is also expected to give an overview of new industries in Kadapa. During his visit to the district in the last week of December 2021, he laid the foundation stone for several industries and inaugurated a couple of other major industries in Kadapa, including Kopparithy industrial estate. Jagan is also likely to discuss his plans for the much-awaited cabinet reshuffle, which would most likely happen after the budget session. Sources say he would give his mind to his cabinet colleagues and take their views before making a final move. The CM is planning to have his ‘Team 2024’ ready for the general elections and is firm on having some of the cabinet colleagues in the team. As the budget session of the Parliament is also likely to begin in the last week of January or first week of February, he is likely to raise the issues concerning the state to be presented by the party MPs in both the Houses during the budget session. Meanwhile, the chief minister inaugurated a star hotel promoted by the ITC group in Guntur on Wednesday. Stating his government has changed the definition of development as rural AP is witnessing rapid growth in agriculture, health and education sectors, he said they have put the state on the growth corridor by laying a strong foundation. “Rural Andhra Pradesh is transforming thanks to the government’s new initiatives in agriculture, food processing, health and education sectors,” the CM said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/township-proposal-may-be-cleared-on-jan-21/articleshow/88864641.cms||Gopi Dara

Single bench of justice Dinesh Mehta, however, ruled that the admission in a medical college will remain subject to the outcome of the petition. Petitioner Sandeep Kumar had appeared in NEET exam and had secured 80% marks, but was denied admission in medical college on the ground, that his LTV expired and awaiting its renewal since long.With the prayer to seek directions for issuance of LTV, so that he could pursue MBBS, he had moved the high court. Providing relief to the petitioner, justice Mehta “petitioner appeared in the NEET (UG) Examination and has secured 80% marks, it is hereby ordered that the competent authority of the NEET shall allot appropriate college to the petitioner, of course, in accordance with his merit, however, ignoring the fact that the petitioner is not having Long Term Visa in his favour”.Order further stated that the petitioner shall thereafter be permitted to pursue his course, which shall be subject to final outcome of the writ petition.The petitioner had submitted that he was a Pak national and had come to India with his parent and siblings in 2011 through a valid passport under LTV.He submitted in the court that his Visa had expired in October 2017 and a extension request to extend his visa has been pending with the authorities since then. During the previous hearing in August last year, petitioner had expressed his desire before the court to appear in NEET exam but was apprehensive that his application for appearing in examination may be rejected for the reason that the petitioner is not in possession of LTV. The court had then directed the Convener (Rajasthan NEET Under Graduate Admission Board, Jaipur) and the Director of National Testing Agency to accept the form of the petitioner to arrange for admission of Sandeep in appropriate medical college with regard to his merit. In its hearing on Tuesday, the court also gave the Additional Solicitor General Mukesh Rajpurohit 4 weels time to submit his reply.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/hc-directs-nta-to-admit-pak-immigrant-in-medical-college/articleshow/88864643.cms||---

However, even after a year, working committees are yet to be formed.Mohammad Zakariya, Independent councillor from ward number 65, said they had been asking about the panels, but no satisfying reply was received. "It is high time and we need proper answers for that. We have met all sitting MLAs in the Walled City and they have given assurance that the working committees will be formed soon. Now, we want action or else we will take back our support."The councillors had met minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Wednesday over the issue and he had supported their cause. According to sources, the MLAs are the real power behind the mayor, who will decide the formation of the committees. However, none of them can reach a consensus to form any committee. "MLAs are not decisive about the chairman’s position. All of them want lucrative working committees like finance, building/planning or garden to be given to their supporter. Until they agree, mayor Munesh Gurjar cannot do anything," said a source in the corporation.TOI tried to contact Munesh Gurjar for a comment, but could not get through.Independent councillors have decided to stage a protest at the corporation headquarter on Thursday demanding the formation of the committees.Without the working committees, all the power is in the hands of mayor Munesh Gurjar, which has made it difficult to manage. If there are 12 committees, sewerage, garden, fire, finance or building planning working can be dealt with by the committee members. Without any committee, the work is solely managed by the mayor that has made it even more difficult in resolving problems sooner and a lot of files are still pending in the corporation due to this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/nine-independent-councillors-threaten-to-withdraw-support/articleshow/88864656.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Joblessness in Rajasthan hit 27% in December on spotty tourism recovery||JAIPUR: Unemployment rate in Rajasthan has hit 27% in December, the second highest in the country after Haryana at 34.1%. Recruiters in the state said that the high levels could be attributed to the slump in tourism and travel industry which accounts for a large portion of job creation in the state. While tourism was coming back to life just before the third wave, the recovery was uneven. Hotels and restaurants at the upper-end of the value chain were better positioned to leverage the revival, many hotels at the lower-end that generated huge number of employment were unable to run operations even closer to the capacity. “December 2021 was certainly a better month compared to the same month in 2020. But the full workforce that the industry employed in 2019 was much higher than in December 2021. That could be the reason why the jobless numbers don’t look good,” said Alka Batra, managing director of Aegis Jobs, a recruitment firm in the city. Services sector has been a laggard as Covid pandemic has limited it growth. Physical events have not restarted as it used to be in normal times. Batra said could have been the dampener. The sustained over 20% joblessness over the past one year indicates that it is the tourism and travel that has held back new hirings. Representatives from various segments of manufacturing have been saying that they are almost back to the normalcy. For example, the jewellery sector has been witnessing shortage of hands. Handicraft, textile and other sectors are almost back to health. “I think it could be only tourism industry which is not able to generate jobs. Otherwise, all sectors have more or less recovered. Travel and tourism has a huge footprint on jobst. If this sector does not revive, recruitments will remain depressed. The events industry has not been hit hard. It is a growing segment in Rajasthan,” said an industry representative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/joblessness-in-state-hit-27-in-dec-on-spotty-tourism-recovery/articleshow/88864660.cms||---

The poisonous gas formation during illegal dumping of chemicals from a tanker in an open runnel on January 6 led to death of six while 23 fell sick and had to be hospitalized. GPCB will be going in for advanced gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) tests to identify the substances that led to the tragic incident, officials said. Police investigation has revealed that the chemical released from the tanker and effluent present in the runnel led to formation of the deadly gas. “We are making efforts to find out exactly how the gas formation took place. We will identify what types of chemicals were present in the runnel and find out from which industry they were released,” said a GPCB official. “GPCB has collected at least 50 samples in three days from the industries in Sachin GIDC. It will take a few days for the GCMS test reports to arrive. Only after the report comes then we will be able to establish if the chemicals present in the runnel were released from any industry in Sachin GIDC or not,” the official added. Though the GCMS reports are awaited, GPCB sources said that preliminary findings indicate that the chemical in the tanker and the chemical present in the runnel have come from outside Sachin GIDC. So far 10 accused have been arrested by police in the gas leak case. The crime branch has arrested three directors of Vadodara-based company Sangam Enviro Pvt. Ltd — Ashishkumar Dudhnath Gupta (41) of Vadodara, Nilesh Bahera (28) of Surat and Maitrai Vairagi (39), a Bharuch resident.

In the previous two waves of the pandemic when inadequacy of hospital beds and oxygen supply was a major challenge, CCIC had proved to be the biggest saviour. These centres not only isolated patients but also reduced load on the hospitals ensuring availability of beds for critical patients. A meeting of groups managing the isolation centres was called by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) on Wednesday in which representatives of 28 centres joined. Within a week some of the major CCICs will start functioning. A total of 1,615 beds have been planned to set up at different isolation centres. The isolation centres will arrange for doctor and nursing staff as well as additional support from the SMC. “At present, 1,615 bed facilities will be set up at CCICs which will be scaled up, if required. A CCIC is not only useful in isolating positive persons but also helps people in need who will get all required facilities at the centre,” said Bachhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. Interestingly, CCICs came as a saviour for patients coming from outside the city all the way from Saurashtra and even Maharashtra too. Oxygen support was not available for patients in most of the villages and towns and had to be shifted to the city as other big cities in the state too were already facing severe shortage of oxygen. “No death was recorded in CCIC during the last wave and only 200 required to be shifted to hospital. It shows the effectiveness of CCICs,” said Dinesh Rabari, deputy conservator of forest, social forestry, Surat, who is coordinating the CCICs in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/new-surge-diamond-city-to-wear-its-ccic-shield-again/articleshow/88864669.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The random tests were done at Mangaluru International Airport on arrival.According to data available with TOI, as of January 10, 2022, about 415 passengers at MIA were identified by various airlines for RT-PCR tests on arrival. Among them, five persons with Covid-negative reports from their respective boarding points tested positive, said Dr Ashok H, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Dakshina Kannada. “The random testing has stopped several stray cases that would have possibly spread the Covid-19. Most of those who tested positive came from Gulf countries,” Ashok said. Those who tested positive must be in mandatory quarantine.International passengers from non-risk countries and who are not tested on arrival have been asked to self-quarantine and get tested later. “The very reason for quarantine is that a traveller could be a potential carrier of the virus infected during transit. This cannot be detected during the RT-PCR test done soon after arrival. Therefore, we ask every passenger to quarantine and test later.”The guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare, issued on November 30, made it mandatory that travellers from countries excluding those countries at risk, will be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days after arrival. A sub-section of 2% of the total flight passengers have to undergo a post-arrival test at random at the airport. The cost of testing has to be borne by the travellers.819 fliers from high-risk countries test -veDr Ashok, shared details about passengers arriving from high-risk countries, and said that as of date, 819 passengers have been identified, but none tested positive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/2-random-testing-at-mia-detects-5-ve-cases-in-a-month/articleshow/88864676.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Financial stress due to online gaming addiction increasing in youths||Mangaluru: With the pandemic, financial crisis and its correlation with suicidal risks is increasing among students. Cybersecurity expert Ananth Prabhu G has expressed concern over the growing online addiction, leading to a rise in the use of illegal online loan apps, which cause youths to fall prey to debt traps. A 26-year-old accountant was found hanging at his office in Surathkal police limits on Monday, and online addiction along with financial stress is suspected to be the reason for him taking the extreme step. “Despite a ban, the fact remains that several online gaming apps and Chinese loan apps continue to thrive in the Indian market, attracting victims of the job crisis, and those addicted to online gaming,” said Ananth Prabhu. Explaining how it works, he said that every web browser has a unique fingerprint. When browser fingerprinting happens, websites can uniquely identify the user out of the sea of other internet users, especially when they have searched for keywords like loans, instant money or browsed for expensive items. “Those addicted to online games out of the fear of missing out (FOMO), opt for instant loans to subscribe for premium features, which is the topic of discussion among gamers in many forums. The illegal loan apps charge exorbitant interests and compromise personal data,” he said. Ananth said a lecturer from the city, who was a victim of harassment due to a loan app , had almost ended his life, after he had fallen into a debt trap. He was lucky that the family got to know about it, and helped him to get out of it. “I came across a home loan app that is offering loans between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 5 crore, for repayment tenures up to 25 years on conditions, that the user provides access to mobile data, storage, contacts, and the user cannot uninstall the app until full loan repayment, compromising data. Hence, the need of the hour is for a personal data protection act. The bill is pending in Parliament. Since these scamsters use KYC details that are leaked, a user can check the mobile number on the Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer Protection (TAF-COP) portal-tafcop.dgtelecom.gov.in, and report any number that is not theirs,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/financial-stress-due-to-online-gaming-addiction-increasing-in-youths/articleshow/88864677.cms||---

Restrictions during Christmas and in New Year celebrations as well as the closure of liquor shops because of MLC and other elections caused the sales to slump. During Christmas 2020, 17,317 cases of liquor were sold. This fell to 14,771 cases in December 2021. New Year sales did go up in 2021-2022, but only by 653 cases compared to 2020-2021. The total cases of liquor sold for this New Year was 10,516. Bindushree P, the deputy commissioner of the excise department in Dakshina Kannada, said that liquor sales had remained poor after the pandemic lockdown eased. “For the past two years, sales were poor. We expected the sales to pick up but it was below our expectations. This Christmas, the sales was poorer than last Christmas and New Year sale not satisfactory. The major reason was the increase in Covid cases and the restrictions. There was also a poor flow of tourists. Sales was also hit due to closure of liquor shops due to elections,” Bindushree said. Bindushree added that not many CL-5 licences, a temporary license to serve liquor at events, were issued this time. An excise department official, on condition of anonymity, added that the coastal district had a good percentage of business coming from neighbouring Kerala. The restrictions forced people to stay away.  “We are losing business because of it. Keralites who came to the city are now purchasing liquor from border villages of Karnataka. Another reason for poor sales is the restriction on events and closure of liquor shops at 10pm,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/spirits-low-liquor-sale-slumps-in-festival-season-excise-dept-feels-pinch/articleshow/88864684.cms||---

The administration has also rejected claims of seven families. “The number is lowest since 2014 due to several factors, including families coming together and banks extending credit to the farmers during the last two years,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said. The year 2014 witnessed 42 suicides committed and the number crossed the 100-mark in 2017 when 104 cases were reported. The peak was in the year 2018 with 108 cases. However, since 2019, the number of cases has started declining with 69 cases being registered that year followed by 44 in 2020.According to Mandhare, the task force also did a good job in counselling farmers on various issues. Also, all other departments came together to facilitate the farmers for credit offtake and help them buy things on time. “Bank credit released to the farmers was highest in the last two years. So more and more farmers came under security of banks, which is also an assuring factor as against getting loan from private moneylenders,” Mandhare said. The authorities noted that agriculture schemes were taken to the farmers by the department, which ensured the farmers understand government’s role in the same and the support given to them. “Also, post harvesting schemes, good market prices, help in making things available and help in case of adverse climatic conditions has helped farmers gain confidence and stop them from taking extreme steps,” the authorities noted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/lowest-number-of-farmer-suicides-in-nashik-dist-since-14/articleshow/88864688.cms||---

The court further observed that “those who do not deposit crores of rupees in banks and rather hide the same in the basements of their houses, are responsible for hollowing out the economic prosperity of the country”.While denying bail to Neeraj Mandal alias Rakesh and three others, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav further opined that “the bank has to take responsibility for such cases wherein the money of their customers is withdrawn by cyber criminals as such customers are more honest towards the country since they put their white money in banks”.“Bank account holders’ money should be safe. Not only because the customer deposits money in the bank so that he/she can withdraw it when needed, but also because the money deposited by the customers in the bank is white and due to which, the economic condition of the country also improves. On the other hand, there are people in the country who do not deposit crores of rupees in the bank and keep it hidden in the basements of their houses. The banks do not get any benefit from it, and they also hollow out the economic condition of the country. In such a situation, that customer of the bank is more honest towards the country and his money should be kept safe by the bank at all costs and if in any way the money is withdrawn by cybercriminals, then for this, the bank has to take responsibility for it,” the court opined.The court was dealing with the bail plea of Neeraj Mandal alias Rakesh and three others in connection with a case, wherein money was fraudulently withdrawn from the bank account of a retired high court Judge of Allahabad high court, Justice Poonam Srivastava. An FIR was registered in this connection by her at police station Cant, Prayagraj on December 8, 2020. The matter was probed and the three accused were arrested from Jamtara in Jharkhand. Thereafter, they moved the court by way of filing bail pleas and opposed the charges against them.Earlier, at one stage in June 2021, during the course of the hearing, the court had observed that the police authorities are not making serious efforts in controlling these types of fraudulent activities. Again in August 2021, expressing concerns over the spreading nationwide network of cyber thugs, the high court had observed that cyber thugs are eating up the entire country like termites and are responsible for the weakening of the economic condition in the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/responsibility-rests-with-banks-to-keep-depositors-money-safe-hc/articleshow/88864716.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj is well-equipped to handle any spurt in Covid-19 cases, says CMO||PRAYAGRAJ: The district is ready to attend and treat Covid-19 cases even if there is a spurt in coronavirus infection in coming weeks as the preparations made during the third wave of the pandemic and also in the past four-five months would come in handy, said health department officials. “We are fully geared up to meet any sudden spurt in the number of cases, including those needing hospitalisation,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Prayagraj Dr Nanak Saran. He said that despite a comparative spurt during the past one week, the number of active cases remains at just 1,179 with the majority of them being in home isolation. “Moreover, so far no hospital staff including doctors, nurses or ward boys, etc., has been testing positive for Covid-19,” he added. This is a welcome development as during the past two waves in Prayagraj, over half-a-dozen government doctors and paramedical staff besides over a dozen private doctors had lost their lives and dozens of others had tested positive including many of them more than once. However, hardly a handful of patients were required to be sent out of the city to bigger centres for treatment during the first two waves. The CMO said that in light of the Covid-19 resurgence, leaves of doctors and all other medical staff of the district have been cancelled with immediate effect. “As many as 100 doctors in Level-3 SRN Hospital and 28 doctors in Level-2 Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital have been kept on high alert. They can be pressed into service at very short notice,” he added. Officials said that unlike during the first two waves when getting oxygen was a challenge, now nine additional oxygen plants have been made functional in the district making many of the hospitals and even many bigger CHCs self-reliant in terms of oxygen supply. Regarding bed capacity, public health expert of CMO office said, “Presently, around 1,500 beds, all with oxygen supply, for Covid-19 patents are ready in the district in government hospitals, including maximum 1,066 at Level-3 SRN Hospital, 226 at Level-2 Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital and 100 at Level-2 Railway Hospital besides 30 beds each at Level-1 rural community health centres (CHCs) of Manda, Ramnagar and Kotwa and 18 beds at CHC-Phulpur.” “If we include private hospitals, presently there are 5,600 beds available for treating Covid-19 patients in the district,” he added. “If needed, we can further increase the count of beds by another around 500 by roping in the present non-Covid-19 hospitals that include Government TB Hospital at Teliyarganj besides Moti Lal Nehru (Colvin) Divisional Hospital and Dufferin Hospital,” he told TOI. “At present we also have 200 isolation beds in SRN Hospital besides around 353 ICU beds and around 350 ventilators for Covid-19 patients in the district just in government hospitals,” the health official explained. MLN Medical College principal Dr SP Singh said, “The Covid-19 testing lab running in the microbiology department of the college presently has a capacity to conduct 8,000 to 10,000 RT-PCR tests as per need. SRN Hospital, the largest of all government hospitals in the district, is fully ready to treat Covid-19 patients.” He added, “Compared to the first two waves, the medical infrastructure has witnessed a fillip with over 80 new ventilators, 150 high-end multiparameter monitors for monitoring vital signs of patients, 100 other high-end monitors as well as paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and High Dependency Unit (HDU) added to the hospital’s resources.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/prayagraj-is-well-equipped-to-handle-any-spurt-in-covid-19-cases-says-cmo/articleshow/88864720.cms||Rajeev Mani

The Union railway ministry has agreed to introduce Bengaluru-Hazarat Nizamuddin Rajdhani Fast Express train via Hubballi-Dharwad. Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnav has acceded to the demand by Dharwad MP and Union minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi. As of now there are nine trains connecting Hubballi to New Delhi and they all start from Bengaluru. While some trains go via Gadag-Bagalkot-Vijayapur-Sholapur others go via Dharwad-Belagavi-Miraj-Pune-Itarsi-Bhopal-Agra-Mathura and reach Hazrat Nizamuddin. From Hubballi junction these trains take 36 hours to reach Hazrat Nizamuddin. The travel time in the new train will be 28 hours as there will be limited number of stops. The train is expected to run at an average speed of 139 kmph and all its coaches will be air-conditioned. As of now, the Rajdhani Express (train no.22691) from Bengaluru does not benefit travellers from Hubballi-Dharwad as its route is it does not touch the twin cities. “The demand for a fast train between Hubballi and New Delhi was a long pending one. The new Rajdhani Express will have limited number of stops and people must bear with it without demanding stoppages at more stations,” said Prahlad Narsapur, a former member of Railway Consultative Committee. SWR sources said a detailed proposal has been sent to the Railway ministry and the announcement could be made during the budget presentation. Prahlad Joshi told TOI that Ashwini Vaishnav has also agreed to start Dharwad-Bengaluru-Dharwad Vande Bharat Express train. This train will reach Bengaluru in six hours and reduce travel time by two hours. Joshi said the railway minister has accepted the proposal to construct a service road on either side of the new railway bypass between Kusugal-Amargol. This will help farmers of villages along the railway line.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/rajdhani-express-to-delhi-via-twin-cities/articleshow/88864722.cms||---

The border district of Belagavi has recorded the lowest temperature in the state at 8.6 degrees Celsius. The chill weather in Belagavi continued even during the day with people wearing skull caps, scarfs and sweaters while outside. In the early hours the residents were sitting around fire for heat, while the city was engulfed in thick fog. In the city, the temperature was 10.5 degrees C and the lowest was recorded at Belagavi airport in Sambra, about 18km from here. The data is sourced from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Temperature at Belagavi-Athani-Kagwad was 9.9 degrees C at 7am on Wednesday, while it was 10.7 degrees C at Belagavi-Bailhongal 7 and 11.8 degrees at Athani-Anantapur. According to an IMD official, so far 8.6 is the lowest minimum temperature recorded in the state this winter. However, the all-time record lowest temperature in the district is 6.4 degrees Celsius in 1984. The cold weather is likely to continue for almost a week according to the IMD forecast. Manoj Ranjan, director, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, said that as North-North Westerly winds are blowing over Belagavi-Dharwad and surrounding areas, the districts are recording low temperatures. The winds are blowing on these areas due to trough existing over north Interior Karnataka and central Maharashtra. However, when compared with the normal minimum temperature scenario it is common and even in the previous years, single digit minimum temperatures were recorded in Belagavi. Dharwad has recorded a temperature of 11.1, Gadag, 12.7, Bagalkot, 11.4 and Hampi 14.5 degrees C. But easterly districts have recorded higher than normal temperatures due to cloudy weather. Temperature in Bidar, which normally records the lowest in the state, was 18 degrees and it was 16.4 C in Raichur 16.4 and 18.6 C in Kalaburagi. H Sadananda Adiga, meteorologist at IMD told TOI that temperature in Belagavi may further dip in the coming days. He said due to north westerly winds the district is reeling under cold conditions. G Srinivas Reddy, senior consultant, Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) said the cold wave that began from northern parts of India has a large impact on Belagavi due to which temperatures have dipped.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/belagavi-records-lowest-temp-in-state/articleshow/88864729.cms||Shreyas HS

Pankaj Kasrija, member of Chandigarh and Tricity gym association said the UT administration on January 6 issued an order to close all gyms, stadiums and swimming pools. Gym association is protesting because this time all other services like spas, massage parlours, restaurants, bars, taverns, multiplexes, cinema halls, malls and all other market are allowed to open with 50% capacity, but only gyms are closed. They are demanding to keep gyms open as well with 50% capacity and other Covid protocols, he said. He further added that, “There is not scientific reason or logic to open rest of everything and to shut down gyms. There are approximately 1,000 small/big gyms in city affecting 20,000 employees and their families. Since covid came around 30% of gyms are closed permanently and more will close during this lockdown. Fixed expenses like rent, electricity/water bills and salaries will hurt them most.

When the depositors approached it for payment, the firm refused to pay them on the pretext of bad business owing to demonetization.However, when the firm failed to pay even after the promised time, an investor first approached the Jam Kandorna police seeking help, but when cops didn’t register her case, she sought help from a local court which ordered the police to file an offence in this regard. Complaninant Kariben Bagda told the police that she had deposited Rs 33,000 in 2011 with the company named Welcome Real Estate and Buildcon Private Limited. The company had floated various deposit schemes including monthly, quarterly, half yearly and yearly schemes and also appointed agents to convince people to invest in it. The firm promised to double the investment amount in five years, in which the complainant too had invested. But when she went to take her matured amount in 2018, the firm told that because of demonetization they were unable to pay and asked her to wait for about six months more. However, Bagda did not get her money back and finally in 2020 approached the police. But her application did not tempt the cops enough to start investigation. Finally, she registered a private complaint with the court which ordered police to register her complaint. The police found 20 more victims like Bagda and initiated the process to record their statements and verify documents. The police believe the amount of scam may go up as investigation progresses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/ponzi-firm-dupes-many-with-lucrative-schemes/articleshow/88864761.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Rajkot: Vax hesitancy leads to huge Covid spike in Dhoraji||RAJKOT: Dhoraji, around 90 km from Rajkot city, has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot with the taluka accounting for nearly 40% of the total cases in Rajkot rural areas. Officials blamed massive vaccine hesitancy among people here due to a misinformation campaign on social media that Covid-19 vaccine results in impotency. Dhoraji is one of the five towns in Rajkot district which has a municipality and is considered an urban area. The vaccination hesitancy was low in urban areas compared to the villages across Gujarat, but in the case of Dhoraji, the scene was different. According to official figures, a total 497 people have tested positive in the last 11 days in 11 talukas of Rajkot district (not including the city) of which 194 are from Dhoraji town alone. Two patients also died during the treatment in Dhoraji. Talking to TOI, Dev Choudhary, district development officer, Rajkot said, “The number of cases in Dhoraji is highest as there was strong resistance of people in many wards of the municipality following false social media messages.” According to Choudhry, people had a misbelief that they would become impotent on taking the jab and this resulted in serious vaccine reluctance. Rajkot collector Arun Mahesh Babu and DDO Chaudhry personally visited Dhoraji twice to convince people for vaccination. Finally, 90% are vaccinated with the first dose and 75% with the second for the population of more than 18 years. According to the district administration, the first dose was delayed and a large chunk of the population was not eligible for the second dose until 20 days back because they did not complete the mandatory 84 days. A local health officer said, “Majority of the population took the second dose just before two to three weeks. The vaccine also takes two weeks to boost immunity. This is the reason for maximum people getting infected.” Dhoraji is famed for its non-vegetarian food and a large number of people from nearby cities including Rajkot go there, mostly in the night to relish these delicacies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/vax-hesitancy-leads-to-huge-spike-in-dhoraji/articleshow/88864765.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The VB has also booked then executive officer of Dharamshala municipal committee Mahesh Dutt Sharma in the matter.A vigilance probe has found that Jaggi had taken a building of the municipal committee on a monthly rent of Rs 20,111 and from December 14, 2006 to December 31, 2019, he earned Rs 1.61 crore as rent from the building while in turn he paid Rs 18.39 lakh as rent to the civic body.Balbir Singh Jaswal, additional SP-sum-SHO, vigilance police station, Dharamshala, said a complaint by Dharamshala municipal corporation against Jaggi, who was a former mayor, was received through office of the SP, State Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau (Northern Range) Dharamshala, for verification of facts.During the probe, it has been found that the building in question which is adjacent to the office of Dharamshala municipal corporation on the main road was initially constructed as a rest house for MC employees. In 2005, this under-construction building was leased out to Jaggi without mentioning the security amount and rent in the tender notice, whereas, the initial resolution number 911 dated August 29, 2005 passed by the House for renting out this building had decided that the amount of security shall be Rs 30 lakh and the monthly rent shall be Rs 30,000 with the lease period of the building to be 25 years.Moreover, the auction of this building was approved vide resolution number 39 dated May 15, 2006 of the House without mentioning the security and rent amount, which implied that the conditions approved by the House were to be adopted for the auction.The vigilance official said contrary to this, the executive officer in violation of “the leasing out of stalls/shops constructed by the Municipalities in Himachal Pradesh Rules, 2001” framed new terms and conditions for the auction of this building in order to benefit Jaggi.The official said prior to the passing of resolution number 911, the tender for auction of the building was called earlier also, but was later withdrawn as security and rent amount was not mentioned in the advertisement. Inspite of this, when the security and rent amount were subsequently approved in the House, the executive officer at his own level decided that the rent of building shall be fixed on the basis of amount offered by the highest bidders for the tender.After this building was handed over to Jaggi. The then executive officer, municipal committee Dharmshala, without obtaining House approval, firstly authorized Jaggi to mortgage the building with any bank for loan purpose up to the lease period and secondly also issued a NOC that the building can be given on a rent basis to any bank/insurance company or any finance institution.Vigilance inquiry further found that after taking the possession of the building, Jaggi leased out the first floor of the building to a private bank and another storey above it to a private insurance company.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/shimla/dharamshala-ex-mayor-booked-for-fraud/articleshow/88864769.cms||---
---||Madurai||Man who turns beast must be sent to eternal world: Madras HC||MADURAI: Confirming the death sentence imposed by the trial court on a man for rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl belonging to a scheduled caste community in Pudukottai district, Madras high court on Wednesday observed that when the attitude of a man turns into that of a beast having no mercy over other creatures, he should be punished and sent to the eternal world. The incident happened on June 30, 2020 when accused Samivel alias Raja went to the house of the child whose mother was mentally ill. He took the girl to an isolated place, sexually assaulted her and to cover up the crime murdered her by dashing her head against a tree. He then threw the body into a dried pond. On December 29, 2020, Pudukottai district mahila court convicted him and handed him death sentence for offence under Section 302 of IPC and under sections of Pocso Act. The case was referred to HC Madurai bench for confirmation of conviction and sentence. A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that they were a little hesitant initially to take away a life by way of a judicial order and thought of converting the punishment into life imprisonment. However, they were reminded of the preaching of Lord Krishna to Arjuna in the battle field that “everyone is going to disappear from the world, even if he (Arjuna) does not shoot the enemies with arrows, even though they are relatives / known persons.” The judges also further quoted the Quran, Bible and Thirukkural. “It is pertinent to mention that everyone’s mind contains a liar, a cheat and a sinner and a man cannot be judged by his outer appearance, as Adolf Hitler, who ordered the execution of some eight million people and was responsible for the deaths of many millions more, hated cruelty to animals and was a vegetarian,” they said. Referring to a song sung in the 1964 Tamil movie ‘Karnan’, the judges said the word ‘bravery’ in it denotes ‘courage’ to kill enemies having evil character. The word ‘courage’ can be fitted to this case to mean that we have to discharge our duties without any fear or favor courageously as per the oath taken by us, the judges said. “Taking into consideration the brutality of attack, the barbaric manner in which the deceased child was murdered and the mental agony undergone by the parents, we find that except death sentence, no other sentence will be adequate,” said the judges. The judgment of the trial court fulfilled all the touchstone to determine that it is one of the rarest of rare cases for imposition of death sentence, they added (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/man-who-turns-beast-must-be-sent-to-eternal-world-says-hc/articleshow/88864771.cms||Kaushik Kannan

But this is our first major exam and we are worried if the marks may be considered for board exams,” said S Meena, a Class XII student at a private school. Though most private schools have completed the syllabus, teachers said that more preparation is needed for students to score high marks. “We have never had such a batch of students in both Class X and XII directly going for the board exams without any previous experience. Subjects like Science and Maths require students to study chapters repeatedly to grasp the concepts,” said S Shanthi, a Physics teacher. A Class X student from a government aided school, R Varshini, said that despite online classes and tests, writing exams in classrooms has not been easy to adapt to. “I usually score average marks but when we were first given a test on returning to school, I was not able to score as well as I usually did. However, now, as we write more exams, it gives me more confidence. But, now we don’t know if all exams will happen as per schedule,” she added. Meanwhile, some government and aided schools reported marginal drop in attendance when Covid-19 vaccination was being carried out but school heads said that a majority are keen to come to school. “The students also realize that exams will be conducted and it keeps them motivated. We have conducted a few unit tests already and students were able to do well,” said the headmaster of a government school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/class-x-xii-students-anxious-as-they-gear-up-for-revision-examinations/articleshow/88864775.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The counsel wanted to pass a similar order on his plea.The judge said that at this stage, the government advocate M Sakthi Kumar, brought to the notice of this court an article which was published in a web journal about two judges expressing different views over installation of CCTV cameras at spas. The article also quotes the renowned senior counsel K T S Tulsi that this conflict must be resolved by a larger bench.The judge said that he is quite clear that he has merely followed the decision of the nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in K S Puttaswamy v Union of India.

The deities are placed on a grandly decorated float constructed on a raft and pulled around the tank, which is one of the biggest in the state. There have been years when there was not enough water in the tank such that a static float was used for the festival. Last year, the festival was celebrated grandly as the tank was brimming with water brought from river Vaigai through its original supply channels.This year, however, the festival which began on Friday continues to be celebrated within the temple premises. Temple sources said that they have been asked to hold the float festival also within the premises, without devotees, in view of the Covid situation. “It would be a very rare occasion where the float festival is not being held in the Mariamman teppakulam, which is now full of water, but restricting crowds would be impossible,’’ said temple sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/float-festival-to-be-held-inside-temple-premises/articleshow/88864779.cms||---

A call was made by the court officer and the recipient identified himself as Sundaravadivelservai and clarified that his signature had been forged. He confirmed the correctness of Aadhaar card details which have been enclosed in the typed set of papers.The judge observed that it is obvious that some third party who had access to the petitioner’s personal details had impersonated the petitioner. “I would not fault the counsel for the petitioner or even the attesting counsel. They will figure as witnesses. The person who impersonated the petitioner and the person who accompanied the impersonator should be prosecuted. One cannot tolerate fraud being played on the court,” observed the judge.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-orders-inquiry-into-impersonation-of-petitioner/articleshow/88864782.cms||---

The party leadership is influenced by unprincipled people and has deviated from its original socio-political path laid down by Mulayam Singh Yadav. I was expelled from the party on the instructions of Ramgopal Yadav, but BJP gave me respect,” he said. The three-time MLA — Shikohabad (2002), Sirsaganj (2012 and 2017) — was expelled from SP for six years in February 2021 following differences with party general secretary Ramgopal Yadav. Later, he played a crucial role in making a BJP candidate win the post of Firozabad zila panchayat 'adhyaksh'. For the past six months, BJP members, including Firozabad MP Chandrasen Jadon, had been wooing Hariom Yadav, who despite the BJP wave in 2017 had managed to retain the seat by a margin of over 10,000 votes. SP's Firozabad district president, Ramesh Chand Chanchal, said, “Hariom Yadav won thrice due to our party’s support. Last year, he was expelled for anti-party activities. There is anger among the masses against the ruling party and it won't win a single seat in Firozabad.” ReplyReply to allForward||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/3-time-sp-mla-also-msy-relative-joins-bjp/articleshow/88862200.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Madurai||Private hospitals tighten curbs in Madurai||MADURAI: In the light of rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in Madurai, private hospitals are exercising caution especially in non-emergency departments by putting up various restrictions to prevent spread in hospitals. Elective surgeries are continuing to be performed with Covid-19 tests for symptomatic patients. At Aravind Eye Hospital, the authorities have asked patients to avoid coming to the hospital for routine eye checks to prevent unnecessary crowding. In a notice, it was stated that only patients facing severe eye problems, injury and vision loss or have recently had eye surgery are advised to come for hospital visits. Last year, ophthalmology was among the first specializations to put off elective surgeries and attend to only emergencies during the previous wave. Dentists are also at high risk as they are exposed to the mouth of a patient. However, dentists said that all dental surgeries are continuing to be done without delay. “Currently, we are following the protocol given to us and are performing procedures with Covid-19 safety measures. We cannot afford to put off surgeries especially if the patient is in pain. But, if any patient is symptomatic for Covid-19, they have to take a test. Further, mostly patients suffering from even mild flu-like symptoms are avoiding coming in for dental treatment of their own accord,” said Dr N Gururaj. At private multi-speciality hospitals, elective surgeries are being performed with patients having to undergo Covid-19 tests. “We are managing the situation based on the experience we had from the previous waves. Unnecessary elective surgeries are being restricted if a patient is Covid-19 positive but we still have to perform all emergency surgeries without waiting for Covid-19 test result,” said J Adel, GM (operations), Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Center. He added that attendants at the hospital are also being restricted as a precautionary measure to prevent crowding so as to allow only one attendant per patient and also check their vaccination status. Dr Ramesh, senior consultant at Velammal Medical College Hospital, said the hospital has so far not restricted elective surgeries but Covid-19 tests are being done for symptomatic patients. “We saw during the previous wave that many of those who delayed elective surgeries suffered a lot. So, we don’t want that to happen. All Covid-19 safety precautions are being taken. Healthcare workers are also tested and quarantined if they show symptoms,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/private-hospitals-tighten-curbs-in-madurai/articleshow/88864783.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran ordered notice and sought response from the state government, in the public interest litigation filed by P Ramasubbu, a resident of Srivilliputhur. In his petition, the petitioner stated that an outdoor police shooting range is situated at Poovani village near Srivilliputhur. He complained that safety norms were not followed since the shooting range does not have a compound wall. He said that several vehicles pass through the highway that connects Madurai and Kollam in Kerala every day. Lack of a compound wall around the shooting range could endanger lives of the people taking the highway as well as the wild animals. The petitioner stated that a compound wall should be constructed around the shooting range in order to avoid any untoward incidents. He stated that though he submitted a representation to the authorities, no steps were taken in this regard. Hence, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-build-compound-wall-around-shooting-range/articleshow/88864786.cms||---

Meanwhile, bull tamers and owners are trying to get themselves registered for one of the events. As many as 4,544 bull owners and 2,001 bull tamers have registered online for participation in the jallikattu games till January 12, said district collector Aneesh Sekhar. Commercial taxes minister P Moorthy inspected the venues along with the collector, corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan and others on Wednesday. The minister said that all steps were being taken to ensure that the games are conducted without any problems and that everyone should adhere to the norms without fail. When pointed out that there was a request to increase the number of spectators from 150, the minister said that it would be advisable for people to view the games through television and in social media, as they would be telecast live. Moorthy said that though it was claimed that people were facing difficulties to register online for the games, more than 3,500 registrations have been done in five hours since it was open on Tuesday evening. He said that the numbers were expected to go up. On Wednesday, the registrations continued and they were to be shortlisted and the eligible candidates would be declared soon, said sources. When asked about the number of bulls that would be permitted to enter the games, the minister said that the district administration would announce its decision on the same soon. Many bull owners said that the rule to allow only two people to accompany a bull would be difficult as at least three people are needed to catch the bull ,at the exit of the arena, otherwise the animal can run into the crowds. As eateries mushroom around the jallikattu venues every year and large crowds gather there, this year the district administration would supply lunch to the participants and spectators on the day of the games, the minister added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/4500-bull-owners-register-for-3-jallikattu-events/articleshow/88864787.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Woman raises more than Rs 7 crore for daughter’s life-saving treatment||BAREILLY: Saba Parveen, a single mother of one-year-old Manha Parveen, was ecstatic after being able to raise Rs 7.13 crore via a US-based crowdfunding platform for her child's life-saving treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) -- Type 1. The disease causes nerves and muscles to become extremely weak. Doctors had predicted that this winter might be Manha's last, adding that her treatment would require a whopping Rs 16 crore for the administration of the world's most expensive drug. Saba approached everyone for help but arranging such a huge amount was nearly impossible and time was running out.  "The only hope for her life is to be able to import Zolgensma, a one-time gene replacement therapy which costs Rs 16 crore. I couldn’t think of such a colossal amount of money in my dreams but I wanted my daughter to live so I approached everyone including the Prime Minister, chief ministers, and even celebrities. A few people shared my information on social media. I was on the verge of losing hope when some people from a crowdfunding platform told me that several people are trying to help my daughter. We have started Manha's treatment at Sir Gangaram Hospital in Delhi with over Rs 7 crore raised so far,” Saba said. Most donations have come from abroad. There's still a big shortfall, but Saba is hopeful that her child will make it. “We are nearly Rs 9 crore short but now I have full faith in God that my daughter will get the required treatment and live a long and happy life," Saba said.  Saba was abandoned by her husband when she was pregnant but she decided to give birth to the baby. Manha was born in February 2021 and was diagnosed with the rare disease at just 4 months. Khushboo Jain, co-founder of fundraising platform, Impactguru, told TOI, “During the last few weeks, Manha's fundraiser has received an overwhelming response, with more than 25,000 social media shares and over 1 lakh donors contributing over Rs 7 crore in less than a month. 2021 was a notable year for us as we observed four successful SMA crowdfunding campaigns on our platform, which helped administer the world's most expensive medicine to each of these children. There are many other SMA patients who are in the process of raising funds as we speak."  Last year, parents of Ishani Verma, a toddler from Meerut district in West UP, had raised funds successfully for the treatment of the same disease. They had also launched a crowdfunding campaign and the infant was treated at AIIMS Delhi. Three girls, one from Bengaluru and two from Hyderabad, also received the drug through similar initiatives.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/woman-raises-more-than-7-cr-for-daughters-life-saving-treatment/articleshow/88864789.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Patna||Congress in talks with RJD, eyes six to seven seats in Bihar council election||PATNA: Amid the tough stand of the RJD, the Congress party wants to contest 6 to 7 seats in the council polls in state. Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha said that the party had contested 4 seats last time. Now, we are expecting at least two to three more seats in the 2022 MLC elections. “I had a meeting with Tejashwi Yadav a few weeks ago on this issue, though the discussions on particular candidates did not take place that time. Then I got infected with Covid and was in home isolation. Hence, the names of candidates are yet to be discussed," Jha said. “The Congress has strong candidates for the MLC election.We will give tickets to only those candidates who have the ability to win,” Jha said. “I want an official meeting with the RJD to discuss the seat-sharing formula for MLC election 2022. We are expecting an official meeting soon. The outcome of the meeting will then be discussed by our central leadership and the decisions of party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will be final," Jha added. Meanwhile, the RJD said that the Congress should give the list of candidates. “The Congress should provide the names of its candidates. The RJD will evaluate their strength before offering them seats. Tickets of MLC election are not "prasad of Satyanarayan Bhagwan" which could be given to anyone. If any candidate of the Congress has potential, the RJD will consider it,” said RJD national spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari. Political parties in the state have started working on the equations with alliance partners for the 24 seats for MLCs. The Election Commission has cleared the decks after completion of the panchayat elections on December 15. According to RJD sources, Tejashwi Yadav knows that Congress has lost ground in Bihar. It was proven in the by-elections when its candidates could not even save their deposits. “Tejashwi Yadav and the party president had taken a tough stand at that time and they will repeat the same in the MLC elections. Tejashwi has already sent the probable candidates to get in touch with the elected members of panchayats and urban local bodies,” the official said, requesting anonymity. He added that the names of the candidates will be shortlisted by Tejashwi. Out of the 24, 13 of the BJP, 8 of the JD(U), 2 form the RJD and 1 of the Congress are sitting MLCs at present. These MLCs were elected after the 2015 assembly election. At that time the RJD, JD(U) and the Congress were part of the Mahagathbandhan. Now, the JD(U) has separated from the Mahagathbandhan, hence the RJD wants to contest on all 24 seats. The RJD had 81 seats in the 2015 assembly election and the Congress had 27 seats. Now, in the 2020 assembly election, the RJD has 75 MLAs and the Congress has 19 MLAs.

He is charged with the murder of Parmanand Tuddu, the newly elected head of Azimganj panchayat in Munger, on December 24 last year. According to ASP (operations), Kunal Kumar, police apprehended Koda as he was about to flee into the forest area under the Ladayatand police station area. Numerous serious charges against the arrested Maoist have been filed, including murder, kidnapping, and violation of the Arms Act. Police sources said, “Koda recently slit the throat of Parmanand Tuddu. He was previously charged with blowing up the Jamalpur rail tunnel. Police are now questioning the criminal.” Police have arrested and detained six people in connection with Tuddu’s murder. Yogendra Koda, the former head of Azimganj panchayat, is one of them.  Police launch probe: A day after a woman staff at the secretariat in Patna was reportedly humiliated by the SHO of Sachivalaya (secretariat) police station, SSP Manavjeet Singh Dhillon on Tuesday constituted a committee headed by ASP Kamya Mishra to investigate the incident. A video grab of the incident has gone viral on social media in which SHO CP Gupta could be seen threatening to put the woman behind bars. The complainant, an employee with the secretariat, had gone to the Sachivalaya police station on Monday evening to register an FIR against unknown persons who had snatched her cellphone from near the gate of her office. “I was standing near the gate of my office when some bike-borne snatchers took away my cell phone. My colleagues suggested me to file a complaint with the police station concerned. Accordingly, we went there and submitted a written complaint before the SHO. When I demanded an acknowledgement for my complaint, the SHO suddenly became angry with me and my friends,” complainant Kanchan Kumari told IANS. “He not only denied to give me an acknowledgement, but also threatened that he would put me in the lock-up. Luckily, my friends made a video of the entire incident. His behaviour was not only rude, but outrageous as well,” she said. “We have constituted a team led by an ASP rank officer to investigate the matter. Based on the findings of the report, we will take action,” said SSP Manavjeet Singh Dhillon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/team-of-cops-from-nalanda-attacked-in-patna-asi-hurt/articleshow/88864795.cms||---
---||Patna||PU cultivates environment conducive to research for improved NAAC rating||Patna: Patna University (PU) is working diligently to improve its NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) rating by cultivating an environment conducive to research.Not only has the university budgeted a lump sum of Rs 2 crore from its own internal resources for funding genuine research projects submitted by faculty members, but it has also made the submission of at least one research proposal mandatory for teachers applying for promotion under the Career Advancement Scheme.PU vice-chancellor G K Chaudhary has already announced the formation of a committee of senior academics to review proposals submitted by teachers in order to sanction necessary funding for conducting research. The amount of funds sanctioned by the committee will vary according to the nature of the research and the precise amount of money required.“All teachers have been asked to submit proposals to various national funding agencies for the purpose of receiving small and large research grants. The University Grants Commission (UGC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Indian Council of Social Science Research, and Indian Council of Historical Research, among others, award generous grants to individuals whose research proposals are deemed meaningful and socially relevant. Even if they are unable to obtain financial assistance from these national agencies for whatever reason, the university will assist them in their endeavour,” the VC told this reporter.Birendra Prasad, the director of the Internal Quality Assurance Cell, noted that during PU’s most recent NAAC assessment in 2019, the university was not awarded an ‘A’ grade, owing primarily to its dismal performance in research and innovation. While it received 3.57, 3.3, and 3.21 (out of 4.0) points for curricular aspects, institutional values and best practices, and teaching-learning and evaluation, it received only 1.22 points for research and evaluation. As a result, the university received a B+ grade in the overall assessment.“Around a decade ago, at least four postgraduate departments of PU were included in the UGC’s special assistance plan, which sanctioned funds for the conduct of their research projects. However, no department is currently receiving funding through this programme,” Birendra explained.Parimal Kumar Khan, the university’s development officer, said several young faculty members recently received start-up projects and research associateships from the UGC and the DST, respectively. “PU’s new initiative will undoubtedly motivate faculty members to pursue research projects, which will ultimately contribute to the university’s grade improvement,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pu-cultivates-environment-conducive-to-research-for-improved-naac-rating/articleshow/88864796.cms||---

It has directed that doctors, nursing staff, and paramedical staff remain on duty 24 hours a day to deal with any emergency situation. “The railways has arranged for a total of 228 beds for Covid-19 patients at the Danapur hospital in Khagaul, of which 34 are in the intensive care unit. It has already designated Danapur divisional railway hospital as a dedicated Covid hospital,” the CPRO told this reporter on Wednesday, adding that a new oxygen plant was recently installed at the hospital and made operational to cater to the needs of the patients. Besides, the railways has launched a massive awareness campaign at the Patna Junction and other congested stations about the importance of following social distancing norms and strictly adhering to the safety protocols on platforms and in trains. Thermal screening and Covid testing are ongoing at several stations, with coordination from RPF and GRP personnel. According to sources, 78,000 of the ECR’s 80,000 employees have received their second dose of Covid vaccines, and the drive to inoculate 100% of the staff, including frontline workers such as loco pilots, station masters, guards, and paramedics in each division, continues.

They also recorded the ill impact of chromium on human beings and animals.These trainee scientists belong to Rajiv Gandhi National Underground Water Training and Research Institute and are in Khanchandrapur on a four months training tour. They said the students who had done M.Sc in zoology, chemistry or geophysics, and successfully competed in the GSI exams conducted by the Union Public Service Commission were termed as trainee scientists B and were later posted as hydrogeologists. The trainee scientists are from 15 states including Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand etc.Trainer TVN Singh, PK Singh, Rajeev Ranjan Shukla (Raipur Institute), KS Rana, TK Pant and Sudhir Srivastava (all from Central Underground Board North Zone Lucknow) taught the trainee scientists about the procedure to collect polluted underground water sample and chromium sulfate.TK Pant informed that the collected samples of chromium sulfate and the underground water would be tested in the Lucknow lab. After completing the field training, the trainees would leave for Lucknow to be trained at the regional training center. Khanchandrapur came to limelight at the national level when the ill effects of illegal storage of chromium waste were exposed. The National Green Tribunal in the case (Chandni Chemicals Pvt Ltd Vs UP Pollution Control Board) observed that the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board had failed to take action when violation of environment norms started and “kept its eyes shut for 14 years after the companies had closed”.The chromium dump in Kanpur Dehat is still causing damage to the environment and the public health.People who are responsible for dumping the hazardous waste, which has contaminated the groundwater to the detriment of the inhabitants, cannot disown their responsibility for such a damage being caused to the underground water, the NGT observed.The NGT had also directed UPPCB to fix liability of the industries within three months as chromium waste is still dumped underground near the village.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/chromium-samples-taken-from-kanpur-dehat-village/articleshow/88864798.cms||---

Expressing gratitude for your love and concern, I want to inform you that the state government has accepted my VRS application and I will be retiring on January 15”. The time between taking the decision to join the BJP on January 8 and retiring on January 15 is the time for planning and preparation, he stated. "This is the time in which I am trying to bring some changes from a police officer to public figure and to see the needs of myself and family. The first thing I did after I decided to join the BJP was that I went on leave because it would have been wrong to sit in the police commissioner's chair. Although my colleagues wanted to hold a farewell ceremony, but I felt it would not be appropriate in the present circumstances, so I left after expressing my feelings for the uniform and the department in a short video," the official said. "I apologize to the people of Kanpur that I haven't met them since January 8. I assure you that after retirement I will come back to Kanpur to seek your blessings. I will start a new journey from January 15 by taking membership of the country's greatest party Bharatiya Janata Party and then going to my ancestral place Khairnagar in Kannauj to take blessings from the elders of my family," he concluded. To recall, on January 8, Asim Kumar Arun had surprised everyone by releasing a post on the Social media informing about his taking voluntary retirement from the post of police commissioner. In the letter, he shared his views about serving the nation and the society. Later, he released a video in which he gave a message to his colleagues asking them to consider the video to be a farewell party.

But none of these announcements have been realized. Only nine impounded autos were released and their challans waived.”“Yellow lines were painted for 1-km each at four chowks for the movement of autos. But those have been encroached upon by either illegal mini-buses or roadside vendors. As many as 101 auto-rickshaw drivers will go to the CM next week and gift him lollipops and rattle toys because he has given the same to us. From Ludhiana district, 30,000 autos are on road and they all have decided to boycott the Congress in elections.

---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Haven’t quit BJP, but will go with Swami Prasad Maurya, says Vinay Shakya||KANPUR: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Bidhuna assembly seat of Auraiya district, Vinay Shakya on Wednesday dismissed the allegations that he had been kidnapped. He said he was safe and sound with his family at his ancestral home in Etawah. On Tuesday, the MLA’s daughter had released a video message claiming that her father had been kidnapped. Her statement, however, was dismissed by the police as “unsubstantiated”. He said that he was with his family at his ancestral residence in Shanti Colony of Etawah with his mother Draupadi Devi and brother Devesh Shakya. Vinay further told reporters that he has not resigned yet from the BJP. “I will hold discussions with my people but my allegiance lies with Swami Prasad Maurya as I have a personal relationship with him (Swami Prasad Maurya) for 26 years. So, wherever he stays, I will go with him.” On being asked about the viral video released by his daughter Riya Shakya, he said, "All the allegations of Riya are false and baseless. My brother Devesh has not taken me hostage, she has been tricked by some people. It's a political gimmick, due to which she is making such allegations. My brother took me to SGPGI in Lucknow on Tuesday for treatment," said the MLA further. Superintendent of police Auraiya, Abhishek Verma, said, "I have spoken to him (MLA Vinay Shakya) on a video call and found that he is currently staying at his Etawah residence. Police security given to him is also present at the location. I have also deputed a deputy SP rank official at his residence. The viral video (of Riya Shakya, daughter of MLA Vinay Shakya) is baseless. If the family members of MLA Vinay Shakya give any complaint, action will be taken." Riya Shakya had on Tuesday accused her uncle and grandmother of taking away her father with them and requested the state government to investigate and reunite her father with the family. "My father is not well. We're working for BJP in the area but our uncle took my father to Lucknow. I request the government to help us in finding the whereabouts of my father," Riya had stated. She also said in the video that her father had suffered a brain stroke on May 1, 2018, after which he was admitted to the SGPGI in Lucknow. His father cannot speak clearly and after the operation, his thinking power has also reduced. Vinay Shakya has been a two-time MLA from Bidhuna. In 2002 he contested on a BSP ticket from Bidhuna and was the winner. In 2017, he was elected on a BJP ticket. In the year 2012, while being MLC, Vinay had made his brother Devesh Shakya contest the elections though Devesh did not win the election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/havent-quit-bjp-but-will-go-with-maurya-shakya/articleshow/88864805.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The project was worth Rs 650 crore initially but the tender cost was finalised at Rs 519 crore. Under this project, two sewage treatment plants (STPs) are coming up at Jamalpur and Balloke with a capacity of 225 million litres a day and 60 MLD, respectively. The Balloke project is yet to begin, while the Jamalpur STP is 32% finished.For the six intermediate pumping stations that are to be built, the work is on at five of those sites. Also in progress is the work to lay an 11-kilometre-long pipeline along the nullah to carry the waste water from the intermediate pumping station to the respective STPs. This line is 58% laid. The drain’s biggest sources of pollution are the dairy units of the Tajpur and Hambran roads. Effluent treatment plants were to be the solution but those projects could no begin because the government didn’t take a call on shifting the dairies outside the city limits.The two existing STPs at Bhattian and Balloke are also being rehabilitated under this project. One of the project officials said on the condition of anonymity that: "The civil work at Jamalpur and at a few other sites started first and that takes the longest, usually. The 225-MLD-capacity sewage treatment plant coming up at Jamalpur is almost 30% complete. Now machinery has come in, so the project will gather pace unless Covid interrupts the supply of labour and raw material all over again."The official claimed that even last year, the project team they could not work with a consistent rhythm because the Covid cases had increased and that had triggered a shortage of not only labour and raw material but also oxygen for operating the cutters. All the industrial oxygen was diverted to patient care. Mayor Balkar Sandhu showed satisfaction over the pace of work and said he was confident that the work will finish withing the deadline as they still have a one full year to complete the task.Politics over drain The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from the Ludhiana East constituency said: "This project is a mere eyewash. The Congress is trying to fool the public into believing that it’s cleaning the drain, while in the past one year, the drain has remained just as polluted as ever. The Congress is selling this project as its achievement, claiming that it made the Buddha Nullah pollution-free, while in reality it has achieved nothing on the ground." Reacting to the allegations, Congress MLA from Ludhiana East Sanjay Talwar said: "It is perhaps for the first time that a good project was designed for the rejuvenation of the Buddha Nullah. The work progress is also fine. The opposition will crib, no matter what, and try to demoralise us. Ask them about their contribution to ridding the drain of pollution, and they’ll have nothing to show."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/buddha-nullah-rejuvenation-only-30-complete-in-1-year/articleshow/88864813.cms||---

On Wednesday, the BJP district unit was called up to Jalandhar for submitting its feedback about the probable candidates, so that those names could be sent to the screening committees. Up to 250 BJP office-bearers from Ludhiana, Khanna, and Jagraon went to Jalandhar, hoping for some decision in another week at least. From every constituency, the party has received at least three names. It will recommend names out of those to the national-level screening committee. Party insiders said the BJP was yet to decide about seat-sharing with Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Dhindsa). From the city, the PLC has suggested probable candidates from East, North, and South constituencies but the alliance has not finalised those candidatures yet. After the BJP’s central government repealed the farm laws, the party’s ticket aspirants had started contacting the voters even before their names had not yet been announced as candidates. In the Ludhiana central constituency, Gurdev Sharma Debi was seen distributing kites among children. They kites carried his picture and some messages along with Lohri wishes. Debi is a ticket hopeful from that seat. In the 2017 contest for this seat, Surinder Dawar of the Congress had defeated him. The ticket seekers also get restless seeing the other parties get a head start in campaigning. The BJP’s rivals have covered a lot of ground already and interacted with voters in many parts of the respective constituencies. Confronted, district BJP president Pushpinder Singhal said: "The BJP is a national party and we follow a system of ticket distribution. The party workers demand honest and clean candidates, a wish they have conveyed to the BJP leadership. We have worked at the ground level and out booth level workers are geared up for the contest. As soon as the candidates are named, they will start canvassing.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/jitters-in-bjp-no-candidates-yet/articleshow/88864814.cms||---

He had claimed that the nexus between the Ludhiana Congress and the local Akalis had caused a big revenue loss to the municipal corporation. Reacting to that, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said: "These are nothing but baseless allegations, so I would not comment on those, but Sidhu should come out with names, if he has anything on record."Another senior Congress member said on the condition of anonymity that: "Sidhu himself was a failure as the state’s local bodies minister and now as state Congress president, he has divided the party, so he has no right to question others. First he should fix his own flaws." Asked about Sidhu’s allegations, senior Akali and former state cabinet minister Maheshinder Singh Grewal said: "There is no point in reacting to what Navjot Sidhu says, because whatever he says, he himself doesn’t understand. Before hitting out at the Akali Dal, he should first come out with evidence against members of his own party. Handle them first before commenting about the Shiromani Akali Dal."Former district SAD president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said: "With Sidhu as its president, the Congress doesn’t need an opposition. How can the state president of a party issue the party’s model for that state without taking the chief minister along. Sidhu has this problem that except for himself, everyone else seems wrong to him. As far as this 75-25% share allegation is concerned, Sidhu should first name its own party members."Navjot Singh Sidhu was local bodies minister in 2019 when the Ludhiana MC had floated tenders for outdoor media advertisement and allotted the contract to Leaf Berry company, projecting an annual return of Rs 23 to 28 crore. But last year, due to Covid-19, the state government relaxed the bidder conditions and waived 50% of the ROI amount. In turn, the company was asked to leave 50% of the allocated sites.Surprisingly, in this year’s budget, the MC’s income from advertisement is projected to be Rs 4 crore, even though the officials claimed that it was sanctioned at the government level and they had nothing to do with it. But these things prove the allegations of Sidhu to some extent.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/share-remark-cong-sad-dare-sidhu-to-take-names/articleshow/88864815.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa Election 2022: Secret ballot gives BJP insight into karyakartas’ preferences||MARGAO: BJP on Wednesday held a secret ballot exercise at the party’s district office in Margao to gauge the popularity of aspiring candidates before finalising the candidature for various constituencies of South Goa. A similar exercise was conducted for North Goa constituencies in Panaji on Tuesday. The ballot was conducted in the presence of CM Pramod Sawant, Union minister G Kishan Reddy, national secretary of BJP in-charge of Goa, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, C T Ravi, party’s general secretary (organisation) Satish Dhond, and others. The exercise was conducted for four to five constituencies of South Goa, including Margao, Quepem and Canacona, party sources privy to the meeting told TOI. Office bearers of the party’s mandals of all South Goa constituencies attended the meeting. The ballot assumes significance as BJP is facing the threat of rebellion in several constituencies of South Goa once the tickets are announced. Aspirants who fail to get the ticket are likely to work against the party candidate or contest as independent candidates as, as one political observer put it, “the BJP leadership is facing a tremendous trust deficit among its cadre”. “The outcome of the secret ballot,” the political observer said, “will serve as a justification for denial of tickets to those rejected by the party.” In Margao, though BJP has zeroed in on deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar after Jagannath ‘Desh’ Prabhudessai withdrew from the fray citing factionalism within the party, BJP is apprehensive about the Pernem MLA’s acceptability among the upper caste voters in Margao. The town has always been represented by a Saraswat brahmin in the assembly. In Canacona, incumbent MLA Isidore Fernandes, who had defected to BJP from Congress in 2019, as well as former minister Ramesh Tawadkar, are strong contenders for the BJP ticket. In Quepem, though deputy chief minister Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar appears to be in the safe zone, his wife Savitri is a strong contender for the party ticket in neighboring Sanguem constituency along with former MLA Subhash Phal Dessai. Sawant told reporters that a meeting of the party’s parliamentary board will be held on January 16 in Delhi to finalise candidates. Sawant, as well as BJP president Sadanand Tanavade, will be attending the meeting. “Names of those shortlisted in most constituencies have already gone to the party leadership, rest will be sent soon. The list will be declared after the meeting,” Sawant said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/secret-ballot-gives-bjp-insight-into-karyakartas-preferences/articleshow/88863401.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

---||Pune||Pune: Use of treated water mandatory for construction works in PMC limits||PUNE: The use of grey (treated) water for construction activities, like concrete mixing as well as curing of buildings, became mandatory in the Pune civic limits from Wednesday. The civic administration passed on order in this regard in a bid to save 100 MLD (million litres per day) water. Even the shopping malls using water-based cooling system have been mandated to use the treated water. “Tests have been carried out on the treated water coming out from STPs (sewage treatment plants). They show that the treated water can be used without further processing,” Aniruddha Pawaskar, the head of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s water supply department, told TOI. TimesViewThe Pune Municipal Corporation’s decision to make the use of grey (treated) water mandatory for all construction activities and water-based cooling systems in malls is a futuristic move. It can go a long way in stopping the misuse of water in the city, which faces water crises in most summers. Now, the civic body should develop a mechanism to implement the decision in letter and spirit, besides closely monitoring the use of water for construction activities and water-based cooling systems in commercial establishments. The civic body has earlier made the use grey water compulsory for the construction of all civic projects. According to PMC officials, around 1 crore sqft constructions, including commercial and residential properties, take place in the Pune civic areas every year. Nearly 4,500 building permissions are given annually. A senior official of PMC said, “The decision to make the use of treated water mandatory has been taken for multiple reasons, including saving potable water and reducing the wastage of groundwater.” The civic activists welcomed the PMC’s move to make the use of grey water for all construction activities but raised doubts about is implementation. “The civic body makes announcements but does not take efforts to see if the directives are being implemented on ground. The monitoring system is absent, so such announcements are seen as hollow promises,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group. The senior PMC official said the civic body was keen to reduce the water consumption after complaints from the irrigation department about its misuse. The civic body has been lifting more than its allotted quota of water over the past few years. Its approved quota is 11.6 TMC. Another civic official said PMC had been demanding additional water from the irrigation department citing reasons like the merger of 23 villages in its jurisdiction and ease of lockdown restrictions. The civic body has requested for 18.58 TMC water to meet the increasing demand of water.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/use-of-treated-water-mandatory-for-construction-works-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/88864818.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

---||Pune||Government officials in Pune demanded bribe despite Covid: ACB||PUNE: A section of government officials continued to demand bribe even in the times of Covid, said Rajesh Bansode, the superintendent of police of the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). “Government officials continued to demand bribes despite the hardships faced by people because of the spread of Covid infection in the state and also due to the lockdown early 2021. This is shocking,” said Bansode. The Pune unit of the ACB laid 165 bribe traps in 2021 in which 201 government officials, including their 51 private aides, were arrested. In 2020, the ACB had executed 139 trap cases, and in 2019, the bureau had registered 185 trap cases. Bansode said, “From February to May 2021, the nation went through a brutal phase of Covid-19 infection witnessing a lot of trauma. People went through a lot of pain and agony during this period and then the situation gradually became normal”. “We thought that during these four months, there would be fewer (bribery) cases, as people were venturing out less from their houses and government offices, too, were functioning with limited employees,” he said. “Despite all these, the ACB executed 17 trap cases in January, 11 in February, 14 in March, five in April and 12 in May 2021. Following this, the ACB executed trap cases between 14 and 18 per month,” he said. In the trap cases, the ACB arrested nine Class-I officers, 26 Class-II officers, 97 Class-III officers and nine Class-IV officers. The ACB also arrested 51 individuals, who accepted bribes on behalf of the government officers. “Many officers prefer to keep aides and direct the victims to pay bribes to these people thinking that the ACB will file cases against these persons only. However, before laying a trap, we verify the role of the government officials and then the private person, who accepts the bribe. But both are arrested,” Bansode explained. Shrihari Patil, the deputy superintendent of police with the ACB, said, “The lockdown was implemented in March 2020, thus, there were fewer cases. As lockdown restrictions were eased, cases increased in 2021, especially in its last four months,” he said. “In one of the most disheartening cases, an engineer with Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran demanded bribe of Rs40,000 to provide water connection to an orphanage. We arrested him,” Patil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/govt-officials-demanded-bribe-despite-covid-acb/articleshow/88864820.cms||---
---||Pune||IMD registers drop in day, night temperatures across Maharashtra||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday registered a drop in both day and night temperatures across four regions of Maharashtra — Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa, Marathwada and Vidarbha. The minimum temperatures in Kolhapur (12.8 degrees Celsius), Sangli (12.1 degrees Celsius), Satara (12 degrees Celsius) and Solapur (16 degrees Celsius) in Madhya Maharashtra dropped in the range of 1-3 degrees. A similar trend was observed at some observatories in the weather stations of Konkan and Goa, Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, a senior Met official said. The western disturbance was lying over northeast Rajasthan in the lower and middle tropospheric levels in the form of a cyclonic circulation, the Met official said. The induced cyclonic circulation was over northwest Uttar Pradesh in the lower tropospheric levels. “A trough line runs from south interior Karnataka to south Chhattisgarh in the lower tropospheric levels. A cyclonic circulation over south Konkan in the lower tropospheric levels and the confluence of winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at lower tropospheric levels is very likely over the east and adjoining central India during the next three days. Under the influence of these weather systems, some areas of the Vidarbha region are likely to receive rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning on Thursday and Friday,” the Met official said. On Wednesday, the weather conditions over the Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune city, mostly remained overcast since morning. “As a result, almost all weather stations in the region recorded a significant drop in the day temperatures. The Shivajinagar observatory registered the maximum temperature of 26.2 degrees Celsius, which was below normal by 3.4 degrees. The Lohegaon observatory recorded the maximum temperature at 26 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal,” an official in Pune said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/imd-registers-drop-in-day-night-temps-across-state/articleshow/88864822.cms||Sandip Dighe

This time, he wants to go back to his village for once and for all. “Aab hamesha ke liye ghar jaana padega (Now I have to go back home forever). It has been around 10 days already that I haven’t been able to find even a single customer. I am seriously thinking of going back home as I don’t feel that the situation will improve soon. I won’t return this time,” Birajdar told TOI.Cabbies have been hit hard due to the pandemic, with around 80% of them having left Pune permanently. “Around 5% to 7% of them will return if there is no further rise in cases. Business has already been affected due to the fear of infection and restrictions. Many like us have shifted to a different profession already and a lot many have seen their cabs taken away by finance companies as they couldn’t pay their EMIs,” Guru Katti, president, Swarajya Vahan Chalak Sanghatna, said.Birajdar left Pune in March 2020 after the first lockdown was clamped, and was at home till October. I tried my hand at farming but didn’t do well. When the restrictions eased a bit, I returned to Pune and started driving again. Things were slow but then the second wave hit in April last year and I had to go back to my village again. I returned in August, and have been in Pune since then,” Birajdar said.“Things picked up slowly, and I started seeing a steady rise in customers since early October. However, the income is not what it used to be before the pandemic,” the cabbie added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tired-of-uncertainty-cabbie-wants-to-leave-city-for-good-and-take-up-farming/articleshow/88864832.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Maharashtra wants Covid positive results via rapid tests, home kits to be updated on portal||PUNE: Non-reporting of positive Covid results via rapid antigen test (RAT) kits and home tests, by laboratories and individuals, remains a concern. On Wednesday, state additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas wrote to all divisional commissioners and collectors to ensure that labs update all positive results via RAT on the district portal. Citizens testing themselves using home kits have also been asked to declare and upload positive results to ensure adequate monitoring by local authorities during the home isolation period. Vyas wrote that strict monitoring of cases remains key as genomic surveillance data showed that 70% of Covid cases involved the more serious Delta variant of the new coronavirus, indicating that it’s still in circulation. Senior officials involved in sequencing said this high share of Delta cases is from December’s report and is expected to reduce in key regions due to the fast-moving Omicron variant, which according to research, causes relatively milder Covid. The officials said many key cities and regions of the state, including Mumbai, Thane and parts of Pune, were showing an Omicron surge and their report for January is likely to show a push towards the variant’s dominance over Delta. Officials said Vyas’ caution aims to ensure those carrying out self-tests at home do not completely ignore the presence of Delta, which can cause serious Covid and put pressure on hospitals’ resources. State health minister Rajesh Tope, after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, also said that while most new cases are mild, one has to report positive cases on the portal so as to be properly monitored by health officials. In his letter, Vyas also directed local authorities to seek assistance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to monitor all sales of rapid test kits to pharmacies to spot locations where they’re being used on a large scale. “Chemist shop owners can also be educated to inform the person purchasing such kits to report positive test report to authorities,” the letter stated. Representatives from the chemists’ association said they have been asking customers to immediately report and consult a doctor if they test positive via the home-test kits. Anil Belkar, the secretary of the Chemists Association of Pune district, said there is a high demand for self-test kits, which means people have to be told to upload positive Covid-19 results on the portal. “We will ask everyone who buys a kit to do so,” he told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/state-wants-ve-results-via-rapid-tests-home-kits-to-be-updated-on-portal/articleshow/88864834.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The target adult population for the district is 83.42 lakh. Of them, 67.26 lakh beneficiaries have been administered both the shots of the vaccines till now. A total of 57,516 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district’s 649 government and private vaccination sites till 7pm on Wednesday. A total of 1.59 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V have been administered in the Pune district so far. Of them, 91.43 lakh are first doses and 67.54 lakh are second. The medical experts lauded the district’s achievement in the coverage of the second dose vaccination. But they also observed that around 11 lakh beneficiaries were still due for the second shot in the district. A medical expert, requesting anonymity, said, “Getting the second jab should be the highest priority for all the beneficiaries these days. Those who qualify for the precaution dose should also get their jab to keep the severity of the infection at bay.” State immunisation officer Sachin Desai told TOI, “The instructions to all the districts are very clear -- expedite the second dose vaccination. Over 1 crore beneficiaries are pending for the Covishield alone in the state. With ample availability of doses, the respective health officials have been asked to make sure the pendency is cleared at the earliest.” According to Desai, the state has a stock of around 1 crore Covishield doses. On January 3, a stock of 10 lakh Covaxin doses was received. Desai said the Har Ghar Dastak programme, started in November last year, was still under way across the state. It had been quite useful in identifying the unvaccinated people and those overshooting their second dose deadline, he said. The health authorities, central as well as state, have repeatedly appealed to citizens to take their vaccine doses to check the spread of Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/80-adult-beneficiaries-fully-vaxxed-in-district/articleshow/88864839.cms||---

And there’s no public health benefit in terms of reducing transmission as the virus is now widespread and identifying a few asymptomatic is unlikely to benefit. Importantly, targeted testing of high-risk individuals would mean that limited resources can be used optimally to save lives,” he said.Dr Lahariya said the new plan will also ease the burden on testing laboratories and added that every stage of the pandemic needs tailored strategies. “With the high rate of Omicron transmission, there is very limited value in contact tracing,” he said, adding that the revised strategy will ensure that focus of testing is not on asymptomatic cases, but on the high-risk population who will get timely testing done. Another expert, Dr Srinath Reddy, said contact tracing in areas with high Omicron cases isn’t of much use as counting a huge number of asymptomatic cases will only spark panic. “The decision to employ a diagnostic test should be driven by the decisions that flow from the result. Asymptomatic persons are mostly unknown without an antibody survey and are untested. Mildly ill persons do not need treatment. These categories will not infect others if they wear masks,” said Dr Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India. He added that restricting tests to the at-risk will help to guide specific treatment, without overloading labs. “There is no correlation between testing rates and death rates across countries. Otherwise, the US and the UK would not see such high caseloads and death rates despite high testing levels. The new guidelines are appropriate for the current stage of the pandemic, where mass testing and tracing are no longer as relevant as masks and avoidance of crowded events,” Dr Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/targeted-testing-strategy-will-ease-load-on-labs-save-resources-experts/articleshow/88864840.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Traditional feasts, family time to mark Sankranti||Pune: As a symbolic act of burying the hatchet and starting afresh, members of Maharashtrian community distribute chips or ladoos of sesame and jaggery to relatives, friends and acquaintances on Makar Sankranti on Friday. Vaidehi Suryawanshi, a resident of Bibvewadi, said, “At sunrise, we offer red flowers in water to the sun, after which we recite the Gayantri mantra. Sesame is used in the flat bread called bhakri, in ladoos, and in tempering all vegetarian dishes. Bajra khichdi made in our house, and sent to friends and neighbours on this day. ”Pongal for the Tamil community is a three-day festival. Vidya Shankarnarayana, from Baner Pashan Link Road, said, “On the first day, we offer ‘bogi’. All the old items we have no use for are cast into a bonfire. The next day, we prepare sweet pongal in a traditional brass vessel with moong dal and newly harvested rice and jaggery. In rural Tamil Nadu, it is made in clay pots and in open fields with the entire family present. We wear new clothes and offer pongal to the sun. The third day is kannu where we make small balls of pongal to feed the birds and pray for the family’s well-being. On the fourth day, bullock cart races called jallikattu are held.”Among the Gujarati community the festival is celebrated as Uttarayan with kite-flying at the heart of it. Some make kites at home as part of the celebrations. Priyanka Ramaiya from Kondhwa said, “My daughter has a school project to make kites and til-gud ladoo. Undhiyu, a spicy mixed-vegetable preparation with raw banana, sweet potato, peas, beans, lentil and other winter greens, and a mildly-sweet bajra rotla with jaggery and ghee to balance out the spice, is made in all Gujarati houses. At home, we also make multi-grain khichdi.”In Punjabi and Sindhi communities, the festival of Maghi is a time to seek blessings from goddesses. Poonan Tejwaney, a resident of Salunke Vihar, said, “We conduct a puja and offer sesame to the invitees. It is believed that the prosperity you are blessed with is proportional to the charity. Married women visit maternal homes.”Bengalis celebrate the festival as Poush Sankranti. Madhumita Ghosh from Bhosalenagar said, “Back home, the Gangasagar mela is organised. Jaggery is made from dates, called ‘khejurer gur’. In the villages, people make sweets with date-palm jaggery, coconut, rice flour and thickened milk. In Pune, women of the Bangiya Sanskriti Samsad would organise a pithe puli food fair offering popular sweet dishes such as dudh puli, patisapta, kheer, payesh, rasbora, and savoury items such as koraishutir kochuri with a stuffing of peas, and alu dum. Now, we share photographs of their preparations and send each other thesedishes through delivery services.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/traditional-feasts-family-time-to-mark-sankranti/articleshow/88864848.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Pune||Communication, hobbies & interests lost to screen time||Pune: Among the many perils of online schooling, mental health has been the focal point and teachers are worried that the issues are growing by the day. They have been getting calls from parents who share that their wards, even those from the primary section, feel disinterested in any activity and attending the online class has become just a formality with the screen alive and a one-way communication. Parents have complained that their children have lost interest in extracurricular activities and feel lazy to attend coaching sessions on additional skills. The communication skills of the students is also a big worry, teachers said.Educator Sheetal Parmar said the last two years have been difficult for the children and its effects are evident in them. The teaching community is experiencing drastic changes in children and the most important one is of mental health. “We are getting calls from parents and a common complaint is that their children lack interest in anything that they do. Studies have surely taken a back seat so the parents are trying to engage their children in other activities but there is clear denial for trying new things by the children,” Parmar added.The lockdown last year and online schooling kept children within the four walls of their homes and outdoor activities were also restricted. Teachers felt that after the students started coming to schools in the last two months, they could experience a major change in them. “The use of electronic devices is more for entertainment than studies and parents have complained that their wards have become addicted to the use of smartphones,” senior teacher Arun Raut from Velhe zilla parishad school said.Principal of Sanskriti School in Bhukum, Damini Joshi, said that they were extremely conscious about the mental well-being of their students.“Throughout the pandemic, we have been keeping an eye out for any student who is showing unusual behaviour or signs. Our teachers reach out to the students and parents separately. Moreover, our dedicated team of counsellors work with students and parents on a regular basis. Most importantly, apart from academics, we have been giving impetus to specially designed extra curricular activities which can keep the students engaged in the online mode.”Principal of The Orbis School, Nalini Samuel, said that online schooling has been a challenging experience for students. Feelings of alienation and isolation are common and lack of motivation has become a very real issue amongst them.The stimulation that they were used to in the classroom situation is missing and the connection with classmates and teachers that kept them energized and enthused is lost in a flat screen and remote voices, she added. “Although this is the best alternative in the present situation, the comfort that a school routine brings with it and the opportunity to exchange experiences and learning is sorely lacking. Even communicating has become a chore for them as they miss the human touch and contact and are more comfortable with devices than with people. Teachers feel that integration of our children back into a classroom situation when things normalise will take time, energy and a lot of patience,” she added.The only silver lining of the pandemic cloud has been the acknowledgement of the importance of a sound mind for adults and children alike, Garima Sawlani, principal of the Orchids The International School in Kharadi, said.Being away from the traditional social set-up for almost two years now, students as young as those in lower primary are facing issues pertaining to attention, discipline, confidence and social adjustment. “There is a considerable rise in the parents requests for discussing such issues with the school counsellors. We have always prioritized our children’s well-being, both physical and mental. We are striving to create a safe and amicable environment for our community to be mindful and considerate about the problems faced in the online era. Being open and more communicative about mental issues can steer us out of this metaphorical whirlpool towards a brighter day,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/communication-hobbies-interests-lost-to-screen-time/articleshow/88864852.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Assistant manager Samir Pathan of Sadgurunagar in Wakad had stopped at the bypass to answer nature’s call. He suffered injuries in his left hand, head and an eye in the assault.Pathan told TOI that on Monday night he had gone to Shayari for a birthday party. “While returning home, I had stopped along the bypass around 12.30am after crossing the flyover at Bavdhan,” he said.He said while he was standing, he noticed two men crossing the bypass and running towards him. “I ignored them, thinking they must be running to avoid speeding vehicles. The duo, however, came near me and pushed me from behind due to which I fell into the trench in front of me,” Pathan said.When Pathan stood up, he saw two more men had joined the duo. “One of them was brandishing a sharp weapon. When the man tried to attack me, I resisted. In the melee, I suffered an injury on my hand,” Pathan said.He added, “One of the suspects hit me on my head with the butt of the weapon. They then pushed me down and started beating me with hands and legs. My spectacles too broke and I suffered an eye injury.”Pathan said they snatched his wallet and took out Rs6,000 and threw the wallet towards him. “They took my gold ring and also my smartphones. I was trying to hide my gold chain under my jacket. They, however, forcibly removed it,” Pathan said.While fleeing the spot, he said the robbers took his motorcycle key with them. “After they left, I gathered strength and tried to stop a vehicle on the bypass, but none stopped. A food delivery person had stopped but on seeing my condition he too left,” he said.Pathan then stood in the middle of the bypass and stopped a patrolling van. “The two persons in the van gave me water. One of them alerted the police. By using his phone, I informed my mother. The police too reached the spot and took me to a hospital,” Pathan said.He said, “I can work hard and earn again what I have lost. What I need are my smartphones, where my office data and photographs of my family members are stored. Police should arrest the robbers immediately.”Sub-inspector Yashwant Salunkhe of Hinjewadi police said they have sent out teams to trace the robbers. “We suspect involvement of local robbers, as they did not use any vehicle to flee.
