Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis on Thursday sent a letter to Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Christopher Brasher asking him to impanel a special grand jury.  She wrote in the letter that her office "has received information indicating a reasonable probability that the State of Georgia's administration of elections in 2020, including the State's election of the President of the United States, was subject to possible criminal disruptions."  Willis' office has tried to interview multiple witnesses and gather evidence, and some witnesses and prospective witnesses have refused to cooperate without a subpoena, she wrote. A special grand jury would have the power to subpoena witnesses. Willis has declined to speak about the specifics of her investigation, but in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month she confirmed that its scope includes - but is not limited to - a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a November 2020 phone call between US Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger, the abrupt resignation of the US attorney in Atlanta on Jan. 4, 2021, and comments made during December 2020 Georgia legislative committee hearings on the election. Special grand juries, which are not used often in Georgia, can help in the investigation of complex matters. They do not have the power to return an indictment but can make recommendations on criminal prosecutions. Willis said the special grand jury is needed because it can serve a term longer than a normal grand jury term. It would also be able to focus on this investigation alone, allowing it to focus on the complex facts and circumstances.  And having a special grand jury would mean that the regular seated grand jury wouldn't have to deal with this investigation in addition to their regular duties, she wrote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/georgia-da-asks-for-special-grand-jury-in-election-probe/articleshow/89025883.cms||---

A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari gave the judgment and said self-acquired properties of a person, who died intestate in 1949, would devolve on his sole daughter, despite the man admittedly living in a joint family, and could not have passed on to the deceased person’s brother on the basis of the survivorship law in force prior to 1956 and upon his death to his children. Writing the judgment, Justice Murari said, “Since the property in question was admittedly the self-acquired property of Marappa Gounder, despite the family being in state of jointness upon his death intestate, his sole surviving daughter Kupayee Ammal will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shall not devolve by survivorship.” Referring to the ancient texts and Smritis, Justice Murari said, “It is clear that ancient text as also the Smritis, the commentaries written by various renowned learned persons and even judicial pronouncements have recognized the rights of several female heirs, the wives and the daughter’s being the foremost of them." This could potentially open up disputes over properties partitioned prior to 1956 in which the daughters were not given any share and could result in the daughter's heirs seeking to reclaim their rights over the properties. Accepting arguments of advocate P V Yogeswaran, counsel for the woman petitioner, the bench said succession of properties prior to 1956 would also include the daughter's right. “If a property of a male Hindu dying intestate is a self acquired property or obtained in partition of a coparcenary or a family property, the same would devolve by inheritance and not by survivorship, and a daughter of such a male Hindu would be entitled to inherit such property in preference to other collaterals.” It said, "The rights of women in the family to maintenance were in every case very substantial rights and on whole, it would seem that some of the commentators erred in drawing adverse inferences from the vague references to women’s succession in the earlier Smritis. The views of the Mitakshara on the matter are unmistakable." Under the 1956 Act, the bench said, "If a female Hindu dies intestate without leaving any issue, then the property inherited by her from her father or mother would go to the heirs of her father whereas the property inherited from her husband or father-in-law would go to the heirs of the husband." The SC had in August 2020 ruled that daughters will have inheritance rights equal to those of sons in the properties of fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers right from the codification of the Hindu laws in 1956.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-extends-womens-right-to-parents-property-prior-to-56/articleshow/89026076.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar agreed to the plea for early hearing on a petition filed by US-based NGO Global Peace Initiative which was founded by an Indian and has branches across the world and works closely with many NGOs, including the Missionaries of Charity. It passed the order after Senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde and lawyer Pranjal Kishore, appearing for the petitioner, mentioned the matter. The organisation, founded by Kilari Anand, submitted in the apex court that NGOs played a very crucial and important role in reaching out to people and helped the country during the Covid pandemic which had been duly acknowledged by the government and the Prime Minister’s Office and cancellation of the licenses of close to 6000 NGOs at this juncture will hamper relief efforts and lead to denial of aid to citizens in need. It requested the court to pass appropriate order for quashing the decisions/orders of the government by which it has refused the renewal of the FCRA registration or cancelled the registration of the NGOs. It also pleaded the court to pass direction to extend the validity of registration of those organisations that had failed to apply for renewal of registration, "till such time as Covid-19 continues to be a ‘notified disaster’ under the Disaster Management Act". "The work done by these NGOs helped millions of Indians. The sudden and arbitrary cancellation of FCRA registration of thousands of these NGOs violates the rights of the organisations, their workers as well as the millions of Indians who they serve. This is especially relevant at a time when the country is facing the third wave of the Covid-19 virus," it said. "These NGOs, which play a prominent role in the society, have been mandated to renew their registration certificates, under Sections 12 and 16 of the FCRA. In the absence of such renewed and relatively more onerous registration licences, the NGOs have been prohibited from receiving and/or utilising foreign contributions to their organisations. The foreign contributions, in fact, are generally of vital importance for the smooth operations of such organisations. Therefore, any prohibition on the NGOs from receiving or utilising such foreign contributions severely and unfairly impacts the financial viability of running such organisations, and is violative of fundamental rights of such organisations," the petition said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-against-refusal-to-renew-fcra-registration-to-6000-ngos/articleshow/89026156.cms||---
---||World||Meta removes Iran-based fake accounts supporting Scottish independence||Facebook parent Meta Platforms removed a network of fake accounts that originated in Iran and targeted Instagram users in Scotland with content supporting Scottish independence, the company's investigators said on Thursday.  The network used fake accounts to pose as local residents of England and Scotland, posting photos and memes about current events and criticism of the United Kingdom's government, Meta said.  The accounts posted commentary about Scottish independence and organised their content around common hashtags promoting the cause, though they at times misspelled them, the company said. The accounts also posted about football and UK cities, likely to make the fictitious personas seem more authentic.  The network used photos of media personalities and celebrities from the UK and Iran as well as profile pictures likely created through AI techniques, Meta said.  In a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, Scots voted 55%-45% to remain in the United Kingdom, but both Brexit and the British government's handling of the Covid-19 crisis have bolstered support for independence among Scots and demands for a second vote.  Meta said its investigation found links to individuals in Iraq, including people with a background in teaching English as a foreign language.  It said the operation had some connections with a small Iran-based network it previously removed in December 2020, which mostly targeted Arabic, French and English-speaking audiences using fake accounts, but did not provide further details on who might be behind the activity.  "We've seen a range of operations coming from Iran over the last few years," said Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, in a press briefing. "It's not a monolithic environment."  The social media company said it had removed eight Facebook accounts and 126 Instagram accounts as part of this network in December for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behavior.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meta-removes-iran-based-fake-accounts-supporting-scottish-independence/articleshow/89026196.cms||---

Priyank Sukhija, the owner and founder of the club, shared the news on Facebook and wrote, “End of an era. We shut RPM at Vasant Vihar after 20 years today.” RPM is the latest in the list of nightlife hangouts in the city that were shut during the pandemic. Last year, around six dining outlets at Khan Market, faced closure due to lack of business and this was followed by more restaurants and bars shutting down across NCR. “Shutting down RPM was a very difficult decision for me. Ever since I’ve shared the news on social media, I’ve been flooded with messages from people about how much they are going to miss this place and how many memories they have of evenings spent at RPM. But I can’t run a business purely on nostalgia and emotions that are invested in the place. For a complete one year (2021), I tried not to take this harsh decision, as it was emotionally very difficult for me, but I have to think in terms of business. How can I run other outlets when we are facing so many adversities during the pandemic? We all know that the hospitality industry has suffered the most during the last one-and-a-half-year, and it is a difficult phase for all of us. Most of us have to take such tough decisions (shutting businesses) to plan better for the future,” says Priyank. Read AlsoNo dining-in rule will result in slow death for industry: RestaurateursSince last week, restaurateurs in NCR say they have witnessed an 80% slump in business.The nightclub was opened in 2001, and Priyank says that at that time it was one of the first standalone bars and clubs in the city, and that was one of the reasons it became popular in no time. “I opened it when I was 21 and I have so many people writing to me that they had their first drink at RPM. Not just guests, but there are so many professionals, including music artistes, etc, who wrote to me saying that they started their career from here. I have been getting messages like, ‘One of the initial party places of our generation’, and ‘I have so many memories, starting from the days when we used to bunk college to hang out there. RPM was the only bar in Delhi which was famous for its crowd, music and chitchat in 2000,’ among several others,” shares Priyank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rpm-club-at-vasant-vihar-shuts-down-due-to-lack-of-business/articleshow/89023131.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||Delhi||Delhi restaurants plan to make vaccination certificates a must for dining when they reopen||Since January 1, Haryana has made vaccination certificates mandatory for entry at malls, restaurants and other public places. So, if you are stepping out for dinner or drinks in Gurgaon, you’ll have to keep your jab certificate handy. In Delhi, there was no such mandate declared, but some restaurants and bars had introduced the ‘entry for only fully jabbed’ rule before they were shut for dining earlier this month. Several Delhi restaurateurs tell us that when they are allowed to reopen, they plan to make vaccination certificates a must, even if they are not directed by the government to do so. ‘We are planning to voluntarily introduce this rule’“From the time we reopened after the first lockdown, we have been keeping a strict check on regular sanitization, wearing of masks and social distancing. Allowing entry for vaccinated people only is the most needed safety measure right now. We are already doing it at our restaurants in Gurgaon (where it is a government mandate) and also in Mumbai, where we are doing it as part of our own rules. Once we reopen in Delhi, we will be communicating to all our patrons that entry will be allowed only to those who are fully jabbed,” says restaurateur Goumtesh Singh. Restaurateur Dinesh Arora adds, “This is something we discussed internally. To ensure safety of our guests we will make it a rule at all our outlets across NCR that entry will only be for fully vaccinated people. I think this is important to make guests feel comfortable while dining out. Also, when I was in Europe recently, even to buy a cup of coffee you need to show your vaccination proof. I think it should be done here, too. Even if this doesn’t come as a guideline from the government, we will check vaccination certificates at our outlets once we reopen.” “It’s evident that vaccinated people have a better defence against the virus, and therefore, for the safety of our staff and guests, we are planning to make vaccination certificates mandatory for dining at all our outlets,” says restaurateur Rahul Singh. Diners say that it will be a responsible move by restaurants if they voluntarily start to check vaccination certificates to ensure everyone’s safety ‘Patrons will be informed in advance that vaccination certificate will be needed for dine-in’To avoid waiting time and rush at the entrance, restaurateurs say they will encourage guests to make prior reservations and while making the reservation, restaurant staff will be directed to inform people that entry will only be for fully jabbed. “We started checking vaccination certificates at both our outlets in Delhi before we were shut for dining. So far, I have not seen any resistance or discomfort from anyone if they are asked to show a vaccination certificate at the entrance. Once we reopen, we will make it more formal to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding at the entrance. Guests will be informed in advance that at our outlets, vaccination certificates will be a must,” says restaurateur Akshay Anand. However, not everyone has taken this decision yet. “We will welcome the step if it comes as a guideline from the government. Till then, we will continue to offer additional benefits to those who are fully jabbed. We are evaluating internally if we would like to make it a rule on our own,” says restaurateur Amit Bagga. Restaurateur Varun Khera, Noida chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says that most restaurant owners in Noida are discussing if they should limit the entry at their outlets to only fully vaccinated. “Some outlet owners may voluntarily introduce this, but right now most of them haven’t made a decision yet as anyway footfall is low and we have time and seating restrictions,” says Varun. Makes you feel at ease that everyone around you is vaccinated, say dinersDiners say that it will be a responsible move by restaurants if they voluntarily start to check vaccination certificates to ensure everyone’s safety. “I didn’t go out for dining with my parents in Delhi once COVID cases started rising. Even if restaurants operate on 50% seating capacity and social distancing is maintained, I am not sure about the health status of other guests who are dining with me in the same area. A check on vaccination certificate at least makes you feel at ease that everyone around you is vaccinated,” says Neelam Sehgal, a resident of GK I. “Restaurant is one place where one has to take off their mask, so I think it is important for restaurants to only allow entry to fully vaccinated, like many countries are already doing,” adds Nishtha Verma, a resident of Dwarka, Sector 7.

---||World||US panel probing Capitol attack seeks interview with Ivanka Trump||WASHINGTON: The United States House of Representatives' panel investigating the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol on Thursday requested an interview with former president Donald Trump's daughter and White House aide Ivanka Trump.  In a letter to Ivanka Trump, lawmakers said they were seeking her voluntary cooperation as part of their ongoing probe and would limit their questions to issues related to events surrounding that day, including activities leading up to or influencing it and her role in the White House at that time.  The panel noted that she "was present in the Oval Office" during key conversations leading up to Jan. 6, and observed a telephone conversation between her father and former vice president Mike Pence on the morning of the Capitol attack. Donald Trump had attempted to persuade Pence to reject the results of the election.  A statement released by Ivanka Trump's spokesperson did not address whether she would cooperate with the committee's investigation.  "Ivanka Trump just learned that the January 6 Committee issued a public letter asking her to appear," a spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said in a statement. "As the Committee already knows, Ivanka did not speak at the January 6 rally. As she publicly stated that day at 3:15 pm, "any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.'"  The committee said in its letter to Ivanka Trump that it was also probing whether Donald Trump's own White House lawyers determined that he broke the law by attempting to interfere with the election outcome.  "The committee has information suggesting that President Trump's White House counsel may have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice President Pence to take would violate the Constitution or would be otherwise illegal," Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, wrote in the letter to Ivanka Trump.  The committee said it also wanted to ask whether her father made any effort to deploy federal agents or troops to end the Jan. 6 violence, saying it so far has no evidence of that.  The former president has blasted the committee's probe as a partisan effort, and has sought to block other aides' testimony and White House documents from reaching the panel.  United States Representative Liz Cheney, vice chair of the committee and one of its two Republican members, said earlier this month that the panel has "first-hand testimony" that Ivanka Trump asked her father to intervene during the Capitol riots.  "We know his daughter -- we have first-hand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to 'please stop this violence'," Cheney said in a Jan. 2 interview with ABC News's "This Week."  Cheney last month shared text messages sent by Donald Trump Jr. pleading with then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to have the former president urge an end to the Capitol assault.  "He's got to condemn this shit ASAP," Cheney read aloud from a text sent by Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, to Meadows.  CNN reported on Tuesday that the committee has subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with one of Trump's children, Eric Trump, as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr.  The committee has spoken to about 400 witnesses and has issued dozens of subpoenas to compel testimony.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-panel-probing-capitol-attack-seeks-interview-with-ivanka-trump/articleshow/89026380.cms||---
---||India||Govt may push change in IAS-IPS rules, citing shortage of personnel||Amid a raging controversy, the Centre may go ahead with tweaking rules for central deputation of IAS, IPS and forest service officers, arguing the amendments are required due to an acute shortage of personnel to man key posts and also to deal with flagship schemes, national security and disaster management. The department of personnel and training has proposed changes in key provisions, which are being opposed by some of the opposition-ruled states with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee dashing off a second letter to lodge her protest, calling it ”draconian”. Maharashtra, too, is going to oppose the amendments on the grounds that officers will be selected without the states’ consent. The current rules allow states to depute up to 40% of the sanctioned posts of their respective cadres at the Centre, which is also used for calculating the promotion quota for IAS officers. But over the years, the number of officers from the All India Services—IAS, IPS and IFoS—has been coming down, government sources said. For instance, official data showed that at the level of joint secretaries, the number of IAS officers on central deputation reserve has dropped from 309 in 2011 to 223 now, resulting in the utilisation rate dropping to 18% from 25% a decade ago. The number of IAS officers at the deputy secretary and director level in the country has increased from 621 in 2014 to 1,130 now, but despite the higher recruitment, the number of officers on central deputation dropped from 117 to 114 during this period, prompting a plan to change the rules. Official sources said in the absence of a sufficient number of officers, functioning of ministries and departments at the Centre is affected. As a result, it has now been proposed that the state cadre should provide the number of officers after adjusting them proportionately with the number available in the cadre. “This will address the issue of genuine shortage of officers in any particular cadre. The requirement from the states is only to sponsor an adequate number of officers for posting at the Centre. The actual number of officers to be deputed to the Centre will be decided only in consultation with the state government,” a source said. Officers at the Centre said the need to meet national security, disaster management and manning of flagship schemes and programmes are not currently provided for in the rules, which are now sought to be altered. “There may be officers who have developed a domain expertise in certain areas, but often we are unable to tap them as states are reluctant to relieve,” explained a senior officer. Currently, not just the number but even those who will be sent on central deputation from a list of officers who opt for working at the Centre in a year is decided by the states, leaving little headroom for the government in Delhi, which is sought to be rebalanced through the changes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-may-push-change-in-ias-ips-rules-citing-shortage-of-personnel/articleshow/89026349.cms||---

A sequel to his National Award-winning film titled ‘I Am’, the film was scheduled to be partly shot in Kolkata from April. Lt-Colonel Sachin Ujjwal, in the the ADG strategic communication wing of the Army, sent an email to the director on Wednesday stating that the “the script has not been cleared by IHQ of MoD (Army). Wishing you best of luck in all the future endeavours”. In July last year, the defence ministry had written to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and the ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology to advise production houses to obtain an NOC from it before the telecast of any film, documentary or web series on the Army due to the portrayal of Army personnel and military uniform in “an insulting manner”. “My protagonist is a jawan. His love remains unrequited till he leaves the Army and meets his lover in Kolkata,” he said. The filmmaker’s plan was to develop the story for one of the films of ‘We Are’. “The idea behind ‘We Are’ is to celebrate the Supreme Court verdict while highlighting four queer love stories about how society (including the Army) needs to take steps to be more inclusive and celebrate diversity ” Onir said. Onir is now talking to lawyers about his future course of action. “Filmmakers are ssupposed to question through cinema. True democracy does not exist unless it applies equally to all citizens irrespective of gender, sexuality, caste class or religion,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defence-ministry-rejects-script-of-onirs-next-feature-film-based-on-gay-major/articleshow/89026487.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||World||Austria makes Covid vaccination mandatory in EU first||VIENNA: Austria's parliament on Thursday approved making Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for adults from next month, becoming the first European country to do so despite a wave of protests opposing the measure.  Tens of thousands have demonstrated against mandatory vaccination in regular weekend rallies since the measure was announced in November in a bid to drive up the country's vaccination rate.  All parties, except the far-right, supported the measure, with the new legislation passing with 137 votes in favour and 33 votes against it in the 183-seat parliament.  "It is adopted with the (necessary) majority," Doris Bures, second president of the National Council, said.  To date, 72 percent of Austrian residents have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus -- in line with the European Union-wide average of just more than 70 percent, but several percentage points below regional neighbours such as Italy and France.  Under the new law, which takes effect on February 4, those holding out against the jab can face fines of up to 3,600 euros ($4,100) from mid-March after an initial "introductory phase".  The government initially wanted to cover everyone aged 14 and older, but now the measure only applies to adults, except pregnant women and those with a medical exemption. Charged debate The overwhelming majority of MPs from all parties voted in favour of the law, with the leaders of the opposition Social Democrats (SPOe) and the liberal NEOS lending their backing to the centre right-green coalition.  The only significant opposition came from the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), which has courted anti-vaccination voters.  FPOe leader Herbert Kickl railed against the law in the charged parliamentary debate on Thursday, claiming it "paves the way to totalitarianism in Austria".  He vowed that he himself would continue to refuse vaccination in defiance of the new law.  "Vaccination is an opportunity for our society to achieve lasting and continuous freedom, because the virus cannot restrict us any further," centre-right Chancellor Karl Nehammer told reporters earlier ahead of the debate.  Green Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein appealed during the debate on "all citizens to question myths around vaccination", insisting that "all the evidence indicates that the vaccines available in Austria are safe". Security zonesHowever, some Austrians remain to be convinced of the merits of vaccination, with a couple of hundred opponents of the law gathering for a noisy protest near parliament on Thursday morning.  Teacher Kerstin said she felt the law ran against the constitution and ignored the fact that "we are meant to have certain basic rights".  Others present maintained that too few studies had been carried out on the long-term effects of the jabs and that they would resist paying any potential fines.  On Wednesday, the government announced it was setting up "security zones" around health facilities and vaccination centres so that the police can turn away anyone "causing difficulties", including demonstrators.  To incentivise those who may still be wavering, the government is launching a lottery for all those vaccinated with prizes of 500-euro vouchers to be used in shops, hotels, restaurants and culture and sports venues.  Austria has to date seen almost 14,000 Covid-related deaths and 1.5 million cases in a population of around nine million.  The daily infection tolls continue to break records, hitting a new high of more than 27,600 on Wednesday.  Compulsory vaccinations against Covid remain rare worldwide, though Ecuador, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Indonesia and Micronesia have introduced such schemes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/austria-makes-covid-vaccination-mandatory-in-eu-first/articleshow/89026566.cms||---

The incident occurred during an all-night Christian worship event at New Kru Town, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital, Jalawah Tonpo said.  "The doctors said 29 persons died and some are on the critical list," Tonpo said, calling into state radio from a nearby hospital. "This is a sad day for the country."  Exodus Morias, a resident who attended the event, told Reuters the stampede began after a group of armed men rushed the crowd in an attempt to stage a robbery.  "We saw a group of men with cutlasses and other weapons coming toward the crowd," Morias said. "While running, some people dropped and others fell on the ground and walked over them."  Bands of Liberian street gangs known as Zogos commonly commit robberies with machetes and other small weapons.  Police spokesman Moses Carter declined to comment on what caused the incident. He said an investigation is under way.  President George Weah, who was expected to visit the site on Thursday afternoon, declared a three-day period of national mourning and said the Liberian Red Cross and Disaster Management Agency had been called in to assist victims, his office said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/stampede-at-liberia-church-gathering-kills-29/articleshow/89026569.cms||---
---||India||2 lakh home tests in 20 days against 3,000 in all of last year||NEW DELHI: The uptake of home tests to detect Covid-19 infection has increased significantly during the current surge with 2 lakh home tests used in last 20 days, against 3,000 in the whole of 2021, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said even as he asserted that overall testing in the country is being maintained at a level comparable with the second wave. “Testing commodities are in plenty, whether it be for RT-PCR, whether it be for rapid antigen tests or for home antigen tests, or ancillary equipment like viral transport medium or RNA extraction kits. What is important is that we have noted an increase in uptake of home tests,” Bhargava said. “Few districts and states are witnessing a dip in test performance and they have been encouraged to ramp it up.” The comment assumes significance as it comes in the wake of recent criticism over drop in testing last week even as infection continues to spread across the country. The government said the recent surge in daily cases and high positivity rate is accompanied by rise in daily testing for last four days on a day on day basis. The number of districts with over 5% positivity rate has increased significantly to 515 districts from 335 in the week. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh are among the ‘states of concern’ with soaring positivity rate and caseload. The active caseload on Thursday morning stood at 19.2 lakh as 3.1 lakh new cases were added in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra and Karnataka alone accounted for 28% of the total active caseload. More than 11 states and UTs recorded more than 50,000 active cases, whereas 13 states have active cases in the range of 10,000-50,000. Rest 12 states have less than 10,000 active cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-lakh-home-tests-in-20-days-against-3000-in-all-of-last-year/articleshow/89026617.cms||---

Comparing key indices during the second and third Covid-19 surge, officials said an average of 380 deaths (7-day moving average) were recorded on January 20 when the total active caseload stood at 19.2 lakh with 72% adults fully vaccinated, as compared to average of 3,059 deaths on April 30 when active cases stood at 31.7 lakh with merely 2% adults fully vaccinated. “Vaccines have remained beneficial in India. Vaccine online tracker shows the benefit of its ability to reduce deaths considerably among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said. “Current surge in India is not witnessing an increase in severe illness and deaths following high vaccinations. Because of high vaccine uptake, we are not witnessing severe disease and death. However those with comorbidities should watch their health.” A total of over 160.3 crore doses have been administered across the country till Thursday. While 94% adults have received at least the first dose of Covid vaccines, over 72% of those above 18 years age are now fully vaccinated. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said wider coverage of vaccination during the current surge has aided mild infection and despite having over 3 lakh daily cases, the active caseload as well deaths are lower at present, as compared to the second wave. Niti Aayog member (Health) VK Paul emphasised the vaccine shield is very important along with social precautions to combat the pandemic. “In this relatively low phase of Covid pandemic, those with co-morbidities and elderly are most vulnerable,” Paul said urging those above 60 years age with co-morbidities to come forward for ‘precaution dose’. “More healthcare and frontline workers should also come forward. Availability is not at all an issue here,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaccination-has-kept-severe-illness-deaths-low-in-third-wave-icmr/articleshow/89026694.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Experts study possibility of vaccinating 12-14 age group||NEW DELHI: Deliberations are on to expand the Covid vaccination programme to cover youngsters of 12-14 years of age though the decision will be governed by scientific evidence, health officials said on Thursday as coverage of first dose of jabs climbed over 53% among adolescents of 15-17 years. Meanwhile, the uptake of precaution dose or boosters continued to be moderate as many health and frontline workers got infected during the latest surge. Around 63% of 35 lakh eligible healthcare workers, 58% of 33 lakh frontline workers and 39% of nearly 48 lakh eligible senior citizens received precaution dose, official data till January 20 shows. Only those health, frontline workers and elderly above 60 years with co-morbidities who have completed a gap of nine months since their second dose are eligible for receiving the booster shot that was rolled out by the government from January 10. The fear of contracting infection at the vaccination site is also seen as a factor responsible for the low footfall for precaution doses, particularly among the elderly. While the proportion of people overdue for their second dose of Covid vaccine has dropped recently, around 6.5 crore people have still not taken their second dose even after their scheduled date, the government said urging people to seek vaccination on time to ensure protection against severe disease and death due to Covid-19. Officials said that while the focus is to maximise coverage among the existing eligible population, it is working with a holistic approach looking at scientific evidence, availability of vaccines and production of jabs to ensure all those above 12 years can be immunised. “Our objective is to vaccinate those above 12 years of age. Work is happening on that frontier and deliberations are going on in the matter,” NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. At present, the coverage of first dose among adolescents of 15-17 years is above the national average in 21 states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-study-possibility-of-vaccinating-12-14-age-group/articleshow/89026799.cms||Sushmi Dey

Doctors across hospitals said these patients are not suffering from Covid complications but are occupying Covid ICU beds as they have tested positive. That said, demand for Covid ICUs is comparatively less in this wave. Nearly 1,000 Covid ICU beds out of 3,000 reserved for the viral disease in the city are occupied at present. “The trend of people being hospitalised in critical units ‘with Covid’ rather than ‘for Covid’ is being seen world over during the third wave,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of the state Covid taskforce. At his ICU in Mulund’s Fortis Hospital, Covid-19 is not the primary ailment in 65% of patients. In Andheri’s Kokilaben Hospital, almost 80% of ICU patients are ‘incidental Covid’ cases, said executive director Dr Santosh Shetty. “Patients who are admitted with heart attacks, strokes, kidney diseases and even accidents are testing positive for Covid when they are screened as part of our routine protocol,” he said, adding that his 35-bed Covid ICU is filling up with people who don’t have Covid complications. The same trend is visible at other hospitals too. When a seven-year-old girl was brought in gasping to the emergency ward of Bhatia Hospital last week, doctors assumed it was Covid induced. But when tests were carried out, it turned out her heart function was down to 20%. She did test positive though when an RT-PCR was carried out. Intensivist Dr Gunjan Chanchalani said up to 40% of their patients who were coming for stroke or heart problems were turning out to be positive. Dr Pandit said once ‘incidental’ patients come to an ICU, they are no doubt treated for the primary ailment but they cannot be moved out before ten days. “In terms of Covid symptoms, most are either asymptomatic or have a scratchy throat that heals in a few days,” he said. Dr Chanchalani said since the Centre’s new testing guidelines were released on January 10, they have stopped swabbing all patients. In the third wave, most patients are not deteriorating unless they have premorbid conditions, or they are elderly, said Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine of Sion Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/66-of-those-in-mumbai-covid-icus-are-incidental-patients/articleshow/89026828.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||World||US fugitive who faked death, skipped UK court date arrested||A Rhode Island man who fled the United States and faked his death to evade prosecution for rape and financial fraud has been arrested after skipping his court date in Scotland, authorities said Thursday.  Police Scotland said officers arrested Nicholas Alahverdian in the Woodlands area of Glasgow after a warrant was issued by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court earlier in the day. The 34-year-old, who has gone under a number of other aliases, is now due in court Friday.  A police spokesperson deferred other follow up questions to Scotland's Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, but a spokesperson for that agency declined to comment. Spokespersons for the Edinburgh Sheriff Court also didn't return emails seeking comment.  Utah County Attorney David Leavitt's office, which has charged Alahverdian in connection with a 2008 rape in Utah, declined to comment on the extradition proceedings.  "We again express our gratitude to the law enforcement agencies for their diligent efforts in this matter to bring this individual to justice," he said in a statement.  It's not clear whether Alahverdian has a lawyer; an email seeking comment was sent to the "Alahverdian Family Office," which had sent a notice in 2020 about his funeral and memorial service in Rhode Island.  Alahverdian was discovered at a hospital in Glasgow last month under the assumed name of Arthur Knight after becoming seriously ill with Covid-19. He was granted bail last week as he awaits extradition to the U.S., WPRI-TV reported.  Leavitt's office says Alahverdian, at the time going by the name Nicholas Rossi, sexually assaulted a former girlfriend in Orem, Utah, in 2008.  Authorities in Rhode Island have said he's also wanted in their state for failing to register as a sex offender and the FBI has said he faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he also was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.  In recent years, Alahverdian had been an outspoken critic of Rhode Island's Department of Children, Youth and Families, testifying before state lawmakers about being sexually abused and tortured while in foster care.  Then in 2020, he told local media outlets he had late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had weeks to live.  An obituary published online claimed he died Feb. 29, 2020, but by last year, Rhode Island state police, Alahverdian's former lawyer and former foster family were publicly doubting whether he actually died.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-fugitive-who-faked-death-skipped-uk-court-date-arrested/articleshow/89026834.cms||---

---||India||Supreme Court cases adjourned as 12 of 32 judges hit by Covid-19||NEW DELHI: Fourteen Supreme Court judges have tested positive for Covid in the third wave so far, throwing haywire scheduled hearing of cases before benches with a pre-specified composition of judges. Two judges have recovered and resumed work, but as of Thursday, 12 of the total 32 were in various stages of quarantine. Most have mild symptoms. As the SC registry notified non-availability of many judges, cases suffered adjournments. The rearrangement of the composition of benches resulted in lead judges adjourning hearings on cases that had been heard in part previously. Justice D Y Chandrachud, while presiding over a bench also comprising Justice Bela M Trivedi, told lawyers that “a lot of uncertainty is going on in the Supreme Court as many judges have tested positive, putting the CJI in much difficulty regarding fixing the composition of benches for scheduled hearing of matters. The situation will improve once colleagues join back”. A central government team led by Dr Shyama Gupta is working almost round the clock to look after the medical needs of the infected judges and staff. To add to the woes of Dr Gupta, three of the five doctors in the team have also tested positive and have been quarantined.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-cases-adjourned-as-12-of-32-judges-hit-by-covid-19/articleshow/89026891.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

And, Sakkarbaug in Junagadh is one of the six zoos in the country where clinical trials will be conducted on lions and leopards. Sakkarbaug zoo, a nodal facility for lion breeding, houses more than 70 lions and 50 leopards. The trial will be conducted on 15 animals. The vaccine will be administered in two doses with a gap of 28 days. The animals will be observed for antibodies for nearly two months after the second dose. Zoo director Abhishek Kumar said the trials would begin once the Centre grants the final approval. Officials said the Centre directed ICAR-NRCE to develop a vaccine for big cats in zoos after 15 lions at Vandalur zoo in Chennai tested positive for coronavirus in June 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-covid-vaccine-trial-on-lions-leopards/articleshow/89026925.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||World||Jury selection begins in US trial of officers involved in Floyd arrest||SAINT PAUL: Former Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin is serving 22 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American. Now the other three ex-police officers on the scene are going on trial for their actions that day -- or rather their failure to take action.  Jury selection began Thursday in the federal trial of Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, accused of violating Floyd's civil rights.  Chauvin was convicted of murder in a state trial and pleaded guilty last month to federal charges of using excessive force during Floyd's May 25, 2020. arrest for allegedly using a fake $20 to buy a pack of cigarettes.  Floyd's death, which was filmed by a bystander on a cellphone, set off months of protests in the United States against racial injustice and police brutality.  Chauvin kept his knee on the handcuffed Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes, while Kueng was on his back and Lane held his legs.  Thao kept back bystanders who were pleading with Chauvin to get off the neck of a visibly distressed Floyd, who eventually passed out and died.  Chauvin was an 18-year-old veteran of the Minneapolis police force; Thao had served for eight years while Kueng and Lane were new recruits, having joined the department in December 2019.  Thao, Kueng and Lane are to face Minnesota state charges in connection with Floyd's death in a trial scheduled to begin on June 13.  But in a sign of the importance of the case, federal prosecutors also filed charges against them.  The indictment charges Thao, Kueng and Lane with showing "deliberate indifference to (Floyd's) serious medical needs".  Thao and Kueng also "willfully failed to intervene" to stop Chauvin's "use of unreasonable force" against Floyd, according to the indictment.  Lane does not face the second charge. Video of the arrest shows that on two occasions during Floyd's arrest, Lane suggested that he be rolled over on his side. Not guilty pleas The federal trial is being held in a heavily guarded courtroom in Saint Paul, the sister city to Minneapolis.  All three men have pleaded not guilty.  Lawyers for Kueng and Lane are expected to argue during the trial that the men were not in a position to challenge the authority of Chauvin, the senior officer on the scene.  Thao's attorney is expected to claim that his client's attention was focused on keeping back the onlookers, and he was not aware of Floyd's condition.  The judge hearing the case has set aside two days for jury selection. The trial, which is expected to last at least two weeks, could start on Monday.  Unlike Chauvin's state trial, the federal trial is not being televised.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jury-selection-begins-in-us-trial-of-officers-involved-in-floyd-arrest/articleshow/89026987.cms||---
---||World||Europe considers new Covid-19 strategy: Accepting the virus||MADRID: When the coronavirus pandemic was first declared, Spaniards were ordered to stay home for more than three months. For weeks, they were not allowed outside even for exercise. Children were banned from playgrounds, and the economy virtually stopped.  But officials credited the draconian measures with preventing a full collapse of the health system. Lives were saved, they argued.  Now, almost two years later, Spain is preparing to adopt a different COVID-19 playbook. With one of Europe's highest vaccination rates and its most pandemic-battered economies, the government is laying the groundwork to treat the next infection surge not as an emergency but an illness that is here to stay. Similar steps are under consideration in neighboring Portugal and in Britain.  The idea is to move from crisis mode to control mode, approaching the virus in much the same way countries deal with flu or measles. That means accepting that infections will occur and providing extra care for at-risk people and patients with complications.  Spain's center-left Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, wants the European Union to consider similar changes now that the surge of the omicron variant has shown that the disease is becoming less lethal.  "What we are saying is that in the next few months and years, we are going to have to think, without hesitancy and according to what science tells us, how to manage the pandemic with different parameters," he said Monday.  Sanchez said the changes should not happen before the omicron surge is over, but officials need to start shaping the post-pandemic world now: "We are doing our homework, anticipating scenarios."  The World Health Organization has said that it's too early to consider any immediate shift. The organization does not have clearly defined criteria for declaring COVID-19 an endemic disease, but its experts have previously said that it will happen when the virus is more predictable and there are no sustained outbreaks.  "It's somewhat a subjective judgment because it's not just about the number of cases. It's about severity, and it's about impact," said Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO's emergencies chief.  Speaking at a World Economic Forum panel on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases doctor in the U.S., said COVID-19 could not be considered endemic until it drops to "a level that it doesn't disrupt society".  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has advised countries to transition to more routine handling of COVID-19 after the acute phase of the pandemic is over. The agency said in a statement that more EU states in addition to Spain will want to adopt "a more long-term, sustainable surveillance approach".  Just over 80% of Spain's population has received two vaccine doses, and authorities are focused on boosting the immunity of adults with third doses.  Vaccine-acquired immunity, coupled with widespread infection, offers a chance to concentrate prevention efforts, testing and illness-tracking resources on moderate- to high-risk groups, said Dr. Salvador Trenche, head of the Spanish Society of Family and Community Medicine, which has led the call for a new endemic response.  COVID-19 "must be treated like the rest of illnesses," Trenche told The Associated Press, adding that "normalized attention" by health professionals would help reduce delays in treatment of problems not related to the coronavirus.  The public also needs to come to terms with the idea that some deaths from COVID-19 "will be inevitable", Tranche said.  "We can't do on the sixth wave what we were doing on the first one: The model needs to change if we want to achieve different results," he said.  The Spanish health ministry said it was too early to share any blueprints being drafted by its experts and advisers, but the agency confirmed that one proposal is to follow an existing model of "sentinel surveillance" currently used in the EU for monitoring flu.  The strategy has been nicknamed "flu-ization" of COVID-19 by Spanish media, although officials say that the systems for influenza will need to be adapted significantly to the coronavirus.  For now, the discussion about moving to an endemic approach is limited to wealthy nations that can afford to speak about the worst of the pandemic in the past tense. Their access to vaccines and robust public health systems are the envy of the developing world.  It's also not clear how an endemic strategy would coexist with the "zero-Covid" approach adopted by China and other Asian countries, and how would that affect international travel.  Many countries overwhelmed by the record number of omicron cases are already giving up on massive testing and cutting quarantine times, especially for workers who show no more than cold-like symptoms. Since the beginning of the year, classes in Spanish schools stop only if major outbreaks occur, not with the first reported case as they used to.  In Portugal, with one of the world's highest vaccination rates, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa declared in a New Year's speech that the country had "moved into an endemic phase". But the debate over specific measures petered out as the spread soon accelerated to record levels - almost 44,000 new cases in 24 hours reported Tuesday.  However, hospital admissions and deaths in the vaccinated world are proportionally much lower than in previous surges.  In the United Kingdom, mask-wearing in public places and COVID-19 passports will be dropped on Jan. 26, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Wednesday saying that the latest wave had "peaked nationally."  The requirement for infected people to isolate for five full days remains in place, but Johnson said he will seek to scrap it in coming weeks if the virus data continues to improve. Official statistics put at 95% the share of the British population that has developed antibodies against COVID-19 either from infection or vaccination.  "As COVID becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others," Johnson said.  For some other European governments, the idea of normalizing COVID-19 is at odds with their efforts to boost vaccination among reluctant groups.  In Germany, where less than 73% of the population has received two doses and infection rates are hitting new records almost daily, comparisons to Spain or any other country are being rejected.  "We still have too many unvaccinated people, particularly among our older citizens," Health Ministry spokesman Andreas Deffner said Monday.  Italy is extending its vaccination mandate to all citizens age 50 or older and imposing fines of up to 1,500 euros for unvaccinated people who show up at work. Italians are also required to be fully vaccinated to access public transportation, planes, gyms, hotels and trade fairs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/europe-considers-new-covid-19-strategy-accepting-the-virus/articleshow/89026998.cms||---

A part of the flame at the Amar Jawan Jyoti will be carried to the NWM during a solemn ceremony to merge the two flames at 3.30 pm,” a defence ministry official said Thursday. Amar Jawan Jyoti (L) was placed in 1971 under the India Gate arch in memory of 3,843 Indian soldiers who died liberating Bangladesh. National War Memorial (R), built in 2019, honours 26,466 soldiers martyred since 1947There is divided opinion on the decision to extinguish the Amar Jawan Jyoti. “It’s sacrilege…The Jyoti holds a special place in the hearts of our citizens,” said a veteran, who did not want to be named. Others like former Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd). saw nothing wrong with the move. Times ViewThe Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate is part of the nation’s collective psyche. For nearly five decades, it has been integral to Republic Day festivities, mentioned reverentially by commentators on radio and television. The inextinguishable flame, memorialising the bravery and sacrifice of the Indian soldier, is also a magnet that draws thousands every day from across the country. Surely, the neighbouring National War Memorial also deserves a similar flame for the bravehearts. But there is little point in extinguishing one for the other. Let both spark the fire of patriotism among all."India Gate was built (by the British) to pay homage to (84,000) soldiers who died in World War-I and earlier. The Amar Jawan Jyoti was later added as an ad hoc arrangement. Now that we have a proper NWM, it is appropriate to shift the eternal flame to the new location," said former Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd). The redeveloped Rajpath and India Gate are gearing up for Republic Day celebrations: Apart from Rajpath being relaid, 10 canals on its both sides have been refurbished and 16 permanent bridges constructed. Aerators have also been installed in the canals for automatic cleaning of water and layers of grass laid after completion of underground services. For the ?rst time, a bleacher seating system has been set up for Republic Day spectatorsThe Amar Jawan Jyoti was built under its arch by the Indira Gandhi government to honour the 3,843 soldiers who died liberating Bangladesh in 1971. All national-level functions to pay homage to fallen soldiers, including the Republic Day and Independence Day, have been shifted from the Amar Jawan Jyoti to the NWM after it was inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi in February 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amar-jawan-jyoti-to-be-put-out-merged-with-flame-at-national-war-memorial/articleshow/89026955.cms||---

Karhal is 4km from Saifai – the native village of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. The SP chief’s decision to take the plunge comes soon after BJP nominating CM Yogi Adityanath to contest his first assembly elections from Gorakhpur (Urban) and fielding deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya from Sirathu. Political observers feel it is a bid to blunt any attack from BJP over Akhilesh not contesting elections. He, and most members of the family, have studied at Karhal’s Jain Inter College. The constituency has been with SP since 1993 (SP came into being in 1992) except for the 2002 assembly polls when sitting MLA Sobaran Singh contested on a BJP ticket. Thereafter, he joined SP and has won the elections three times consecutively.

Launching the "Azadi Ke Amrit Mahotsav se Swarnim Bharat Ke Ore" at a gathering of Brahma Kumaris, the PM said: “We cannot get away from this by saying that this is just politics. This is not politics, this is the question of our country. Today, when we are celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, it is also our responsibility that the world should know India properly.” The PM said organisations like the Brahma Kumaris, which have international presence, should convey the correct picture of India to the people of other countries and tell the truth about the rumours being spread about India. He said Brahma Kumaris can invite at least 500 people from foreign countries every year from its international chapters to come to India and learn about the country. Others who joined the event virtually included Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra and CM Ashok Gehlot, besides Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel. Modi said that the programme by Brahma Kumaris in the "Azadi Ke Amrit Mahotsav" celebrations exemplifies the feeling, spirit and inspiration for a golden India. He said there is no difference between personal aspirations and successes on the one hand and national aspirations and successes on the other.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tendency-to-tarnish-indias-image-must-be-shunned-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/89027055.cms||---

Rejecting the challenge to the constitutional validity of 27% OBC quota in the sought-after AIQ seats in MBBS and MD courses, a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said, “Merit can’t be reduced to narrow definitions of performance in an open competitive exam which only provides formal equality of opportunity.” “High scores in an exam are not a proxy for merit. Merit should be socially contextualised... as an instrument that advances social goods like equality. In such a context, reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers its distributive consequences,” the bench said. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, “Competitive exams assess basic current competency to allocate educational resources but are not reflective of excellence, capabilities and potential of an individual which are also shaped by lived experiences, subsequent training and individual character. Crucially, open competitive exams do not reflect the social, economic and cultural advantage that accrues to certain classes and contributes to their success in such exams.” The bench said the 10% EWS quota for undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses would also continue for the 2021-22 academic year, as judicial propriety would not permit the SC to pass an interim order staying the criteria for determination of the EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) category. “It is a settled principle of law that in matters involving challenge to the constitutionality of a legislation or a rule, the court must be wary to pass an interim order, unless the court is convinced that the rules are prima facie arbitrary,” the bench said while scheduling the exercise for detailed scrutiny of the constitutional validity of EWS quota to the third week of March. It said, “At this stage, without hearing all the interested parties on arguments such as (i) extent of judicial review of materials relied on for providing reservation under Article 15; (ii) the power of the states to determine EWS in view of the explanation to Article 15 and in view of an alternative criteria proposed by the committee formed by the government of Kerala; and (iii) the meaning of EWS — the identification of the poor or the poorest, it would be impermissible for us to form a prima facie opinion on the alleged arbitrariness of the criteria.” Importantly, the SC clarified that the Centre was not required to seek its permission before providing reservation in AIQ seats. “Therefore, providing reservation in the AIQ seats is a policy decision of the government.” Returning to the debate over merit vs quota, the bench rejected the argument that once an OBC candidate secures an undergraduate AIQ medical seat, he/she should not be entitled to again fall back on his backwardness to secure seat in the AIQ post-graduate medical seat, where merit alone should be the criteria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scores-dont-reflect-merit-says-supreme-court-upholds-obc-quota/articleshow/89027146.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

There is more than enough space apart from these lands to construct on,” Aaditya, who is the state’s environment minister, tweeted on Thursday. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad also opposed the move. The statements come a day after the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority received bids for appointing a consultant to draft the master plan for the development of the city’s salt pan lands.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ecology-booster-no-construction-in-salt-pans-say-maharashtra-ministers/articleshow/89027248.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Taking into account the fact that videos such as tutorials to make guns and bombs are available on YouTube, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that if a person who is witnessing such videos commits an offence, then the social media platform is an abettor of the offence. The judge said social media platforms are being used to tarnish the image of some people and abet crimes. The judge sought response from the Tamil Nadu government on the mechanism put in place to prevent such misuse. The judge appointed advocate K K Ramakrishnan as amicus curiae to assist the court in this case. The court made the observations while hearing the petition filed by Thanjavur police seeking to cancel the bail granted to YouTuber and NTK functionary ‘Sattai’ A Duraimurugan. He was arrested for posting a defamatory video on his YouTube Channel named ‘Saattai’ using pictures of late DMK leader M Karunanidhi and BJP functionary Kushboo Sundar in June last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-not-book-social-media-platforms-as-abettors-remarks-hc/articleshow/89027272.cms||---

The chief judicial magistrate had earlier in the day turned down the bail application of Dasna temple priest Yati Narasinghanand in the same case. Yati was one of the organisers of the Dharam Sansad in Haridwar recently. The case against Tyagi came up for hearing on Thursday morning and the verdict was announced late in the evening. On January 15, too, Tyagi's bail plea was rejected by chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Mukesh Chandra Arya. Tyagi is an accused in the Dharam Sansad hate speech case along with Yati and was booked under sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups and act prejudicial to harmony) and 298 (deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person) of IPC. After the CJM had rejected the bail application of Tyagi on January 15, a fresh bail application was moved in the district sessions court on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dharam-sansad-bail-petitions-of-dasna-priest-rizvi-rejected/articleshow/89027321.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||India||Modi unveils projects with Mauritius PM, stresses on sovereignty||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Kumar Jugnauth virtually inaugurated a social housing project in Mauritius, and launched a couple of other projects, as the two sides signed an agreement for extension of a $190 million Line of Credit by India to Mauritius. The credit line will be used for Mauritius’ Metro Express and other infrastructure projects. Speaking on the occasion, Modi said India’s developmental assistance was marked by respect for sovereignty. As India looks to further strengthen its presence in Indian Ocean, the two countries signed another MoU for implementation of Small Development Projects. “On this occasion, the two Prime Ministers also took part in a virtual foundation stone laying ceremony for two other projects - construction of a state-of-the-art Civil Service College and a 8 MW Solar PV Farm - also undertaken as part of India's development support,’’ said the government in a statement. Speaking at the occasion, Modi highlighted the vision powering India's development assistance, defined by the “needs and priorities of our friends and respectful of sovereignty’’, and at the same time enhancing the well-being of the people and bolstering the capacities of the country. Modi acknowledged the importance of Civil Service College project in nation-building and offered to share learnings of ‘Mission Karmayogi’. “Prime Minister recalled the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative that he put forth at the First Assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in October 2018 and said that the 8 MW Solar PV Farm project will help mitigate the climate challenges that Mauritius faces through avoidance of 13,000 tons of CO2 emissions,’’ said the government. In May 2016, India had extended a grant of $353 million to Mauritius as Special Economic Package (SEP) to execute five priority projects. These included the Metro Express Project, Supreme Court Building, New ENT Hospital, Supply of Digital Tablets to Primary School Children, and the Social Housing Project. With the inauguration of the Social Housing Project today, said the government, all the high profile projects under the SEP have been implemented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-unveils-projects-with-mauritius-pm-stresses-on-sovereignty/articleshow/89027342.cms||---

And he died giving his life for this country,” said Bena Devi (48), mother of 26-year-old Sachin Dagar, a jawan who lost his life after getting buried under a glacier in northern Kashmir’s Kupwara district on Monday.The signboard on the road leading to Sachin’s village in Gurgaon’s Alipur now has a poster of the soldier holding the Tricolour that reads,” Sachin Dagar amar rahe, Gaon Alipur, Gurgaon.”Sachin’s elder brother Nitin (27), who is also in the Army, said that his Kashmir posting was going to end in two months. “Sachin loved Kashmir. He said after two months, he would again insist on his posting in Kashmir. He always wanted to serve his country and he died while doing so.” Beena also recalled how his son would send her photos of snow and kahwa (tea) and talk to her about how beautiful Kashmir was. “He would video call me showing beautiful places around. A day before his death, he called me and spoke to me for half an hour,” said Beena, her voice choking with emotion.Sachin came home in December to attend his cousin’s wedding and stayed for a month. He had brought saffron, Kashmiri shawls and kahwa for the family, his mother said.When asked if the family visited Kashmir to meet him, Beena said he would never allow them. “We did plan in the past, but he would never allow us. He would always say that as beautiful as Kashmir is, it is also dangerous. Don’t come.”Sachin’s family was offering kahwa to everyone coming to offer condolences. “We have a lot of kahwa. It was his favourite tea,” said one of his relatives who was serving tea.Hundreds had turned up to pay homage to Sachin during his last rites on Tuesday.

A day after sealing 10 commercial establishments running from residential plots in the colony, the department targetted unauthorised jhuggis constructed despite ban on construction in the colony.District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said the department had received information about hundreds of jhuggis which had been constructed in violation of the norms. “On Thursday, the enforcement team during a six-hour long drive razed these jhuggis and a four-storey building which was being constructed without approved building plan,”he said.He also said the offenders, mostly locals from adjoining villages, had rented out these jhuggis to the labourers and daily-wagers and were collecting money in illegal manner from them on monthly basis. Set up in 1983, the society had been under legal tussle since 2004 after 9,000 applicants were alloted the plots whereas the society could accommodate only 4,000 houses. The cooperative group allegedly allotted plots against money thus putting the entire project in jeopardy. However till now, only 1,500 plots have be alloted.In 2016, the state government formed a commission headed by retired IAS officer SP Sharma to identify original owners and suggest a way out of the stalemate. The matter is presently under Punjab and Haryana high court. Due to the legal issues, the DTCP is not approving any building plans or giving clearance to any construction in the society. But the locals have carried out unauthorised construction in the society over the period of time. In November 2020, more than 650 jhuggis, which came up on a five-acre plot in Saraswati Kunj, were demolished by the DTCP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/1k-jhuggis-near-golf-gourse-rd-razed/articleshow/89027365.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Gurgaon||Why are we charged for infra: Residents to discom||Gurgaon: Residents seeking new electricity connection or load enhancement in 16 prominent colonies of the city will soon have to shell out anywhere between Rs 3,000 and Rs 45,000 per KW. However, this decision of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) to recover the ‘development charges’ from new consumers or existing ones seeking load enhancement has drawn flak from the residents.In fact, the discom has stopped providing new connections in these colonies since July last year. This is because 13 private developers have failed to provide the much-needed power infrastructure in the 16 plotted colonies and 32 housing societies developed by them, and collectively owe over Rs 317 crore to DHBVN. The state government has said that it will return the amount once it’s recovered from the builders. However, residents say that they have already deposited the external development charges (EDC) and internal development charges (IDC) with developers while purchasing their property and so it is unfair on the government’s part to put additional burden on the consumers instead of recovering the dues from the defaulting builders.“This is not only unfair and unjustified, but is unconstitutional and illegal. Instead of recovering the EDC and IDC dues from the builders and holding them accountable for any deficiency in their electrical infrastructure, they are putting the burden on the common residents,” said Sukhbir Singh, vice-president of the Palam Vihar Residents’ Association.Apart from Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok-1,2 and 3, South City-1 and 2, Suncity, Malibu Towne and Mayfield Garden are on the discom’s list of 16 colonies. “This is a clear case of DHBVN bailing out the developers. It would set wrong precedence if at all the HERC grants DHBVN this unethical request. Even in Ardee City, the power discom collected Rs 26,000 from each household in the name of infra deficiency but did little to solve the problem,” said Chaitali Mandhotra, RWA member of Ardee City.The discom, which has filed a petition with the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission in January against these developers, has, however, defended its decision, saying it has been taken in public interest.PC Meena, managing director of DHBVN, said, “These developers have not installed adequate electricity infrastructure in their respective realty projects. It was their responsibility to complete the power infrastructure and hand over the same to the electricity department. Due to lack of requisite infrastructure, we had to stop giving new connections or any other services in these colonies.”“As we have been receiving several requests from residents saying that they are ready to bear their share of cost, we have devised this interim measure to provide some relief to them. The government has approved the proposal and this amount will be refunded to consumers once we recover the amount from the developers,” he added.But residents refuse to buy the discom’s arguments. “The DHBVN is only making excuses of not taking over the colonies as most of these developers are either in legal mess or not at all interested in doing anything about these colonies,” said Dhramvir Yadav, a resident of Mayfield Garden.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/why-are-we-charged-for-infra-residents-to-discom/articleshow/89027366.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The foggy conditions may continue, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. IMD also forecast the possibility of rainfall in Delhi and surrounding areas between the night of January 21 and the morning of January 24 due to passage of an active western disturbance in the region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/light-showers-likely-in-city-today-imd-issues-yellow-alert/articleshow/89027367.cms||---

RWAs will be asked to share data on eligible recipients in this category for setting up such camps. To begin with, officials said, condominiums with a large number of eligible recipients will be targetted. Gurugram has inoculated 95,074 children in the 15-17 age group with the first dose of a Covid vaccine since January 3. It, however, has a target of covering 1.51 lakh children. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “There are more than 1,000 residential societies in the district. Our teams have already started reaching out to the RWAs of some of these societies. We will involve societies which are big and have a large number of eligible recipients in the age group. Children from the nearby smaller societies can visit these camps and get themselves vaccinated.” According to Dr Yadav, the camps will have an observation room, a verification room, a vaccination room and an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) room. “If needed, Gurugram may also set up evening vaccination camps in societies. We will continue our house-to-house drives as there is a possibility that several children, besides the elderly and sick persons, have not got their booster doses yet.” With a view to speed up the vaccination process, Gurugram has already extended the house-to-house drive for children in rural belts by setting up camps at 81 health sub-centres. At present, Gurugram has 160 centres for Covid vaccination. It will jump to 260 by next week. As many as 50 session sites each will be set up for those aged between 15-17 years, and those aged 60 years and above. Meanwhile, ASHAs and auxiliary nurse midwives equipped with AEFI kits will carry out door-to-door jab drives in 37 rural areas on Friday. On Thursday, 1,318 people in the 15-17 age bracket got vaccinated in Gurugram while 7,713 people in the 18-44 group, 974 people between 45 and 59 years and 1,344 people aged above 60 got their jabs.

This is an annual bird census to assess the bird population in wetlands across the state.The wildlife department has constituted two teams with eight members each to cover Sultanpur National Park and Najafgarh Jheel. Similar teams will also cover Bhindawas and Mandhoti wetlands in Jhajjar.It is important to note that on August 10, 2020, two wetlands of Haryana — Sultanpur National Park in Gurgaon and Bhindawas wildlife sanctuary in Jhajjar — have been included in the Ramsar list.Haryana has some 1,441 wetlands, but only two are protected under the Ramsar treaty. Last year, the forest department had recommended Sultanpur and Bhindawas wetlands for the Ramsar tag for the World Wetlands Day in 2022.With binoculars in their hands and cameras hanging from their necks, the wildlife officials on Sunday will venture into the wetlands in Haryana. “It is a day-long birding event to mark the upcoming Wetlands Day. Teams will count as many birds as possible and make a list of them,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurgaon.Meanwhile, the Asia Waterbirds census will be conducted on January 29 and 30 across the state. Experts on birds said that Sultanpur National Park has a good variety of wintering and resident waterfowl. After many years there has been a successful nesting of Black-necked Storks at Sultanpur National Park, birders said. Meanwhile, experts appreciated the idea that the state is carrying out a census of wetland birds. “The government should now expand its census to lesser-known wetlands in the state. Haryana has several such small patches where birds visit every year. These small areas need protection,” said Pankaj Gupta, a birder from Delhi Bird Society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/wetland-bird-count-to-be-held-in-hry-on-jan-23/articleshow/89027370.cms||Ipsita Pati

The accident took place on Wednesday morning, hours after a blast carried out to break the rocks. The accident comes a couple of weeks after five persons were killed in a landslide in the Dadam mines of Bhiwani. Sources said while the boulder crushed Subash under it, it missed his father, Jagdish, by a whisker as he managed to jump to one side. He, however, suffered grievous injuries in the legs. The police said six members of the same family from Rajasthan worked at the illegal stone quarry. Since the area comes under the Aravalis, it is managed by the forest department. SDM Manoj Kumar, who visited the accident site, assured action against the owners of the quarry. “Illegal mining was taking place here. This is a forest area and we are investigating the matter. Strict action will be taken against those found involved in this,” said Kumar. Villagers asked why the administration had woken up to illegal mining now when it had been taking place for years. “Almost every day, we hear an explosion to break the rocks. It happens both in the night and morning. A siren is sounded and the workers are required to leave the place before the blast is carried out. In the last 4-5 years, the number of blasts has increased manifold,” said a villager. “We have confiscated tractors and trucks in the past and even sealed roads leading to the mining site.” Kumar said. He, however, did not give a clear answer on why the government wasn’t putting a stop to illegal mining once and for all. Subash’s cousin, Rakesh, has been arrested for working at the illegal quarry. “Those who were involved in illegal mining will be arrested. No one will be spared. Forget the past, now we will take action,” said Mehar Singh, the SHO of Nangal Chaduhari police station. Villagers doubted if the police vigil would continue for long. “There have been deaths in the past as well, but they have brushed them aside. They hardly take action. In the end, they arrest poor workers like us. But the private contractors move about freely,” the villager said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/man-dies-father-injured-as-boulder-falls-on-them/articleshow/89027373.cms||Sagrika Kissu

KK Khandelwal, the chairman of H-Rera, Gurgaon, said the company will offer technical expertise to the authority to facilitate dispute resolution and delivery of justice in a simpler, quicker, safer and transparent manner under the pilot project.“The authority will use the digital court to conduct end-to-end proceedings for easy and effective dispute resolution for the disputants and other stakeholders involved in the process,” Khandelwal said, adding that the user will be provided with end-to-end abilities to plead and conduct all proceedings under the quasi-judicial mechanism, from filing disputes to decision making, all the platform.Another H-Rera official said the pandemic has speeded the adoption of digital technologies in the past couple of years. “Now, the consumers need not visit the Rera office for their case proceedings,” Khandelwal added.Raman Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Jupitice Justice Technologies, said with this partnership, the authority can support large, scalable and evolving needs of the complainants/disputants in the real estate industry for enhanced access, quick and inexpensive settlement of commercial disputes by leveraging new age technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and Blockchain. The digital Rera court, Aggarwal said, will also support AI-enabled self-representation, while all the useful documents related to respective cases will be secured through the Blockchain-enabled digital locker.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/soon-rera-to-kick-off-digital-court-for-redress-of-disputes/articleshow/89027375.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Noida||Uttar Pradesh polls: Will he, won’t he? After daylong exit buzz, Avtar Singh Bhadana says he will contest from Jewar||NOIDA: There was high drama in the SP-RLD camp on Thursday around the candidature of new entrant Avtar Singh Bhadana from Jewar. Bhadana, who was believed to have withdrawn his candidature in the morning, announced in a late-evening tweet he was going nowhere and would contest in RLD colours from the airport town, where he was jetted in only last week. The talk in the RLD camp was that Meerapur MLA Bhadana, who was officially with BJP till he made the switch last week, had contracted Covid and had opted out. This in turn led to talk of discontent among the cadre about his candidature. The name of Indraveer Bhati, an advocate and a member of the Bar Association, started doing rounds as the possible replacement. Eventually, the first official word from Bhadana came at 9.48pm, via a tweet from his handle, reaffirming his candidature from Jewar. “Our ancestors have a glorious history. No matter what the field! They have fought valiantly for society, for their rights, for the poor. There were initial symptoms of Covid, but the RT-PCR is negative. I will fight election for my people,” he tweeted. Senior RLD members had remained tightlipped on Bhadana through the day. One of the party’s seniormost functionaries said only national president Jayant Chaudhary could make a statement on Bhadana. However, RLD national convener Anupam Mishra confirmed on Thursday night Bhadana would remain the joint candidate of SP-RLD from Jewar. Bhadana had been active on Twitter till Thursday morning and also posted a video of his door-to-door campaign at 11.55am. Bhadana (64), a four-time MP, had filed his nomination papers three days ago from the Jewar seat. His entourage drew attention as Bhadana went in a tractor. Originally from Haryana, Bhadana had earlier been in Congress. He was an MP from Faridabad thrice and Meerut once on a Congress ticket. In 2017, he contested the Meerapur seat on a BJP ticket, but contested the 2019 polls from Faridabad as a Congress candidate, an election he lost. He remained with BJP, meanwhile, as his resignation never got accepted. Bhadana joined RLD on January 12 and was given the ticket from Jewar the next day.

After daylong exit buzz, Avtar Singh Bhadana says he will contest from Jewar||NOIDA: There was high drama in the SP-RLD camp on Thursday around the candidature of new entrant Avtar Singh Bhadana from Jewar. Bhadana, who was believed to have withdrawn his candidature in the morning, announced in a late-evening tweet he was going nowhere and would contest in RLD colours from the airport town, where he was jetted in only last week. The talk in the RLD camp was that Meerapur MLA Bhadana, who was officially with BJP till he made the switch last week, had contracted Covid and had opted out. This in turn led to talk of discontent among the cadre about his candidature. The name of Indraveer Bhati, an advocate and a member of the Bar Association, started doing rounds as the possible replacement. Eventually, the first official word from Bhadana came at 9.48pm, via a tweet from his handle, reaffirming his candidature from Jewar. “Our ancestors have a glorious history. No matter what the field! They have fought valiantly for society, for their rights, for the poor. There were initial symptoms of Covid, but the RT-PCR is negative. I will fight election for my people,” he tweeted. Senior RLD members had remained tightlipped on Bhadana through the day. One of the party’s seniormost functionaries said only national president Jayant Chaudhary could make a statement on Bhadana. However, RLD national convener Anupam Mishra confirmed on Thursday night Bhadana would remain the joint candidate of SP-RLD from Jewar. Bhadana had been active on Twitter till Thursday morning and also posted a video of his door-to-door campaign at 11.55am. Bhadana (64), a four-time MP, had filed his nomination papers three days ago from the Jewar seat. His entourage drew attention as Bhadana went in a tractor. Originally from Haryana, Bhadana had earlier been in Congress. He was an MP from Faridabad thrice and Meerut once on a Congress ticket. In 2017, he contested the Meerapur seat on a BJP ticket, but contested the 2019 polls from Faridabad as a Congress candidate, an election he lost. He remained with BJP, meanwhile, as his resignation never got accepted. Bhadana joined RLD on January 12 and was given the ticket from Jewar the next day. Bhadana could not be contacted for a comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/will-he-wont-he-after-daylong-exit-buzz-bhadana-says-he-will-contest-from-jewar/articleshow/89037599.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Noida||RWAs want freehold status for property, but without extra fee||Noida: RWA umbrella bodies in the twin cities have demanded a uniform policy that would give ownership rights to residents over their properties, but without any extra payment, in response to the state government seeking suggestions on a proposal of converting leasehold land into freehold in Gautam Budh Nagar.As per the freehold system, an allottee gets outright ownership of the property. The leasehold system gives an allottee the ownership of the property only for 90 years.The Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Associations (CONRWA) and Noida Citizens’ Forum have written to the principal secretary of the UP housing and urban planning department in favour of outright ownership of properties. Other residents’ groups such as the Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) and Jan Shakti Sewa Samiti have also sent their objections against the existing system. In fact, the matter has been pending with the state government since 2018 when the Noida Authority board gave in-principal approval for freehold property in the city. According to PS Jain, president of CONRWA, nowhere does the UP Industrial Development Act, 1976, provide for leasehold properties of residents “and as such it is neither justified nor legal”. CONRWA has filed a petition on the matter in the Allahabad high court.AN Dhawan, former secretary-general of FONRWA, said, “On October 31, 2018, we organised a dharna outside the Noida Authority office to press for our demand for freehold properties. Noida MP Mahesh Sharma had addressed the gathering too. Consequently, the Authority agreed to place on record our demand for freehold property. But since then, the residents have been pursuing the matter.” While the government is also mulling over a proposal for conversion of leasehold properties into freehold ones based on the current circle rates and called for suggestions on the same, all the residents’ bodies have unilaterally declined to make any additional payment. “All the allottees in the seven towns covered by the industrial development authorities in UP, including Noida and Greater Noida, have already made requisite payments from time to time, taking into account the development charges. There is no logic whatsoever to bring out the freehold policy on the basis of conversion charges, in accordance with the current circle rates,” said Dhawan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/rwas-want-freehold-status-for-property-but-without-extra-fee/articleshow/89027380.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

While the youngest among them is a 25-year-old housewife, the oldest is a 71-year-old pensioner, a retired SBI manager. Apart from them, there are two Delhi University (DU) teachers who would contest elections from Sahibabad and Ghaziabad, respectively, an illiterate candidate who earns his livelihood through marketing products and an MA student. Also among the 18 independents are a BJP rebel — Loni Nagar Palika Parishad chairman Ranjeeta Dhama, who resigned a day earlier. Of the total independent candidates, five are women. While there are three candidates each from Noida, Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, Jewar and Dadri seats, two from Muradnagar and one from Loni, no independent candidate has come forward in Modinagar for far. Most candidates want to make a difference to the society and say they have the support of the people in their constituency, while there are some who want to set an example that “genuine” and qualified people should represent the communities above the party line and dynasty politics. Many of them do not have political backgrounds and would contest for the first time. Anita Yadav (25), the homemaker from Sahibabad, decided to contest the polls just 15 days ago. “I want to do something for women. I faced a lot of discrimination while visiting government offices, which made me think about our plight. I have the full support of my family.” Natthu Singh Chaudhary, the retired SBI manager and Muradnagar candidate, contested UP assembly polls in 2017 and Lok Sabha elections in 2019. “I am asking people to move over caste and dynasty and vote for people who can raise your issues,” he said. Sapna Bansal, a DU professor having MBA and PhD degrees, said she would fight as an independent from Sahibabad. “I was associated with ABVP and BJP for a long time and also wrote 14 books, two of which are on former prime minister AB Vajpayee. But, I am contesting independently and wish to resolve local issues if elected.” She promises to open five government schools, one hospital and 100 pink toilets in Sahibabad. Likewise, Ashutosh Gupta, another professor of Satyawati College and a candidate from Ghaziabad constituency, said, “I am contesting against local MLA Atul Garg, who did not fulfil even 5% of promises he made during the last election. I am a PhD holder and want to work for the people.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/du-profs-homemakers-farmers-independents-throw-hat-in-ring/articleshow/89027381.cms||Aditya Dev

Noida Traffic Police to paste glow tapes on cars, trucks||NOIDA: To curb accidents during inclement weather conditions, Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police has rolled out a drive to paste reflective tapes on vehicles, barricades and pillars. Dense fog conditions, DCP (traffic) Ganesh Prasad Saha said, during winter lead to a reduction in visibility and make city roads prone to accidents and the initiative was aimed at curbing mishaps. “We have started pasting these tapes on tractors, trucks and other vehicles. It has been observed that speeding vehicles often hit dividers near the DND flyway toll plaza due to poor visibility. So, reflective tapes are being put up on the flyway too,” Saha said. More than 2,000 people have lost their lives in nearly 4,600 road accidents in the district in the last five years. A Noida traffic police volunteer, Raghavendra Kumar (35), who has earned the sobriquet of ‘helmet man of India’, advised people to use indicators and put reflective tapes on their vehicles to avoid accidents. “Two-wheeler riders should wear helmets and observe all the precautionary measures.

---||Bengaluru||Match-fixing not a Section 420 offence: Karnataka high court||BENGALURU: Match-fixing by a cricketer could lead to a feeling that he has cheated lovers of the game but it could not amount to an offence, the Karnataka high court has said, quashing proceedings against four accused in a 2019 case pertaining the Karnataka Premier League (KPL). "Match-fixing may indicate dishonesty, indiscipline and mental corruption of a player. For this purpose, BCCI (Indian cricket board) is the authority to initiate disciplinary action," Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar said in an order last week, adding that registration of FIR under Section 420 of IPC (cheating) is not permitted. The court also noted that cricket being a sport, any incident of betting cannot be brought under the definition of ‘gaming' in the Karnataka Police Act. Allowing the petitions filed by KPL players CM Gautam and Abrar Kazi, bookie Amit Mavi and Ali Ashpak, owner of Belagavi Panthers team, the judge said section 2(7) of the Karnataka Police Act clearly says that "a game of chance does not include any athletic game or sport". The prosecution had invoked section 420 of the IPC, considering match-fixing as ‘cheating'. "For invoking the section, essential ingredients are deception, dishonest inducement of a person to deliver any property or to alter/destroy a valuable security. It was argued by the additional advocate general that cricket lovers go to watch the match by buying tickets and, thereby, they are induced to part with their property – money. His argument that they are induced to buy tickets can't be accepted. They may have a feeling that they are going to witness a fair game being played, but they buy the tickets voluntarily. The question of inducement to buy tickets can be ruled out," the judge observed. The judge also negated the state government's contention that the accused can be proceeded against under section 120B of the IPC for criminal conspiracy. "There is no second word with regard to his argument that section 120B is an independent offence… The allegations in the chargesheet do not constitute an offence under section 420 and, therefore, section 120B can't be invoked," the judge noted. While interrogating cricket players, coaches and owners of franchises in connection with a crime on November 6, 2019, K Prakasha, inspector of central crime branch (SIT) Bengaluru, got to know about fixing in the KPL matches played between August 15 and 31, 2019.

---||Mumbai||65% in Mumbai’s Covid ICUs have other primary ailments||MUMBAI: Almost two-third patients in the city's Covid intensive care units are those admitted for other reasons but incidentally came positive when tested during routine screening. Doctors across hospitals said these patients are not suffering from Covid complications but are occupying Covid ICU beds as they have tested positive. That said, demand for Covid ICUs is comparatively less in this wave. Nearly 1,000 Covid ICU beds out of 3,000 reserved for the viral disease in the city are occupied at present. “The trend of people being hospitalised in critical units ‘with Covid’ rather than ‘for Covid’ is being seen world over during the third wave,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, an intensivist and member of the state Covid taskforce. At his ICU in Mulund’s Fortis Hospital, Covid-19 is not the primary ailment in 65% of patients. In Andheri’s Kokilaben Hospital, almost 80% of ICU patients are ‘incidental Covid’ cases, said executive director Dr Santosh Shetty. “Patients who are admitted with heart attacks, strokes, kidney diseases and even accidents are testing positive for Covid when they are screened as part of our routine protocol,” he said, adding that his 35-bed Covid ICU is filling up with people who don’t have Covid complications. The same trend is visible at other hospitals too. When a seven-year-old girl was brought in gasping to the emergency ward of Bhatia Hospital last week, doctors assumed it was Covid induced. But when tests were carried out, it turned out her heart function was down to 20%. She did test positive though when an RT-PCR was carried out. Intensivist Dr Gunjan Chanchalani said up to 40% of their patients who were coming for stroke or heart problems were turning out to be positive. Read Also66% of those in Mumbai Covid ICUs are incidental patientsAlmost two-third patients in Mumbai’s Covid intensive care units are those admitted for other reasons but incidentally tested positive during routine screening. Doctors across hospitals said these patients are not suffering from Covid complications but are occupying Covid ICU beds as they haveHospitals in US, particularly in Massachusetts and New York, are maintaining a separate list of those coming ‘for Covid’ and ‘with Covid’. Closer home, the state health department in Kolkata has created a six-member team to visit ICUs and high dependency units to gauge what share of patients were chance Covid infections. Dr Pandit said once ‘incidental’ patients come to an ICU, they are no doubt treated for the primary ailment but they cannot be moved out before ten days. “In terms of Covid symptoms, most are either asymptomatic or have a scratchy throat that heals in a few days,” he said. Dr Chanchalani said since the Centre’s new testing guidelines were released on January 10, they have stopped swabbing all patients. The testing guidelines state that asymptomatic patients undergoing surgical/non-surgical invasive procedures including pregnant women in/near labour who are hospitalized for delivery should not be tested unless warranted or symptoms develop. “We don’t test them but ensure they are isolated from each other. As for healthcare workers, we always wear masks and protective gear,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/65-in-mumbais-covid-icus-have-other-primary-ailments/articleshow/89027407.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Cases have been mostly dipping this week after a sudden and steep climb since December. The trend is the opposite in the state, with Covid cases rising every day this week, including 5% on Thursday to 46,197 from Wednesday’s 43,697. In fact, the Thursday tally is almost 48.5% more than the Monday caseload of 31,111. Fatalities in the state reported a drop to 37, including 12 in Mumbai. The city had reported a dozen deaths on Wednesday too. The daily test positivity in the city has stayed steady at 10% for the last few days. Nearly a month after the sudden spike, Mumbai is no longer driving the Covid-19 graph of the state. As per the weekly Covid presentation to the state cabinet, Pune and Thane district have higher active cases than Mumbai. The city has reported a nearly 70% decline in active cases in just one week. From over 1 lakh patients under treatment on January 12, the number went down to 31,856 on January 19 and further dropped to 21,838 on Thursday. A senior civic doctor said while Mumbai is on a decline, the rest of Maharashtra is witnessing a surge. The weekly positivity rate of the state stood at 23.5% and there were 10 districts with a higher rate. Nashik was leading the charts with nearly 39%, while Mumbai’s rate is much lower than smaller districts like Latur, Nandurbar and Dhule. “Mumbai was the epicentre of the first and second waves in the state. The population density is so high in Mumbai that the surge is first noticed in Mumbai and, as migration occurs, cases spread to other parts of the state,” said intensivist Dr Kedar Toraskar, a member of the state government’s Covid task force. “The worst seems to be over for Mumbai. The city’s population has at least got a natural booster against Covid,” he added. The contribution from Mumbai and the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to the state tally has dropped in the last 15 days. On January 7, MMR contributed 33,235 of the state’s total of 40,925 while MMR’s share on Thursday dropped to 12,054 of the state 46,197 tally. However, despite the growing Omicron wave in the state, active cases have been dropping — from 2.7 lakh on Tuesday to 2.6 lakh on Thursday. Health minister Rajesh Tope said due to consistent testing, nearly 95% of the critical care beds in the state were lying unoccupied as most of the patients were getting treated in home isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/state-cases-up-but-daily-city-tally-falls-to-lowest-in-2022/articleshow/89029503.cms||Bhavika Jain

Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said a proposal will be sent to the CM. “Only fully vaccinated students will be allowed on campus,” said Samant. The minister, however, clarified that all exams declared till February 15 will be held online. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said all existing standard operating procedures (SOPs) will have to be adhered to by schools. Parental consent will continue to be mandatory for students’ physical attendance. Environment minister Aditya Thackeray tweeted that all schools in Mumbai, including pre-primary, can restart from Monday. The CM’s decision cleared the proposal to allow nursery and kindergarten students to attend physical schools for the first time since the March 2020 lockdown. There are over 5,000 pre-primary schools in the city waiting to reopen. Welcoming the decision to reopen pre-primary after around 22 months, Dr Swati Vats, president, Early Childhood Association, said schools and parents should maintain all safety protocols. Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents Association, felt schools in rural areas where online classes is a problem should be reopened first. “Parents in the city are still not confident about sending kids to schools. Transportation is another issue,” said Sahai. Kavita Chatterjee, principal, Orchids - The International School, Kurla, said they need to monitor the situation for a while keeping the safety of students in mind. “Parents are equally frazzled and strained due to the new strains that show up at regular intervals,” she said.

Senior counsel Anil Anturkar for the Maharashtra government said the HC, while judicially reviewing the state’s decision, has to only see if four points were considered in the decision-making process, and has to see whether the state has “authority”. “Have we surpassed our authority and encroached on Centre’s jurisdiction as argued by petitioner's counsel? Have we considered all relevant factors and, fourth, is there a single irrelevant factor which has crept into the decision-making process so as to vitiate it, is what has to be seen,’’ said Anturkar during the hearing via video conferencing. The court was hearing two PILs filed by Feroze Mithiborewala and Yohan Tengra who, through counsel Nilesh Ojha with Vijay Kurle, had submitted that banning unvaccinated persons from suburban train travel was unconstitutional. They cited reports to show even vaccinated persons could be infected and pass the Covid-19 virus on. The state endeavoured to show that its decision-making process cannot be faulted. The submissions before the HC will continue on Friday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/ban-on-train-travel-for-those-unvaxxed-is-in-public-interest/articleshow/89029492.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Only 14% beds taken in Mumbai, BMC may fold up some jumbos||MUMBAI: Considering that less than a fifth of the 38,093 Covid beds in the city are occupied at the moment, the BMC will soon take a call on whether all its jumbo field hospitals should be operational next month. The BMC Covid dashboard for January 20 showed only 14% (5,475) of the total available hospital beds were occupied. Most of these patients are admitted in BMC’s jumbos or Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri. The BMC is running nine jumbo hospitals between Worli in the south, Dahisar in the northwest and Mulund in the northeast. “By this month-end, we expect the daily caseload to drop to three-digit figures as against the four digits now. At that time, we may only keep some jumbos operational and put others in reserve,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Already, the BMC has asked the deans of the jumbos to restrict admission to a few wards so that the manpower and resources can be used optimally. When the second wave started declining, the BMC had put most of the field hospitals in reserve, notably the BKC and Mulund jumbos. “Almost 70% of the Covid beds in most public hospitals and around 60% of the beds in private sectors are unoccupied,’’ said a senior BMC doctor. Instead of keeping the beds vacant, doctors in the private sector believe more beds should be made available for people with non-Covid ailments. Almost 95% of cases in L ward (Kurla West) in the current wave were from highrises, said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, ward medical health officer. “As people have mild symptoms and the fever subsides within a day, there is no need for hospitalisation in a majority of the cases,” he said. With extra rooms for isolation with toilets, people in highrises prefer home isolation, he added. At times, their treating physicians give a letter that their health will be monitored while they are in home isolation and “therefore we do not insist on hospitalisation or institutional quarantine”. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah (BJP) said the third wave has been very different from the first two Covid waves. “Previously, we would get calls post-midnight for hospital beds. However, this time the symptoms are so mild that even the free oxygen concentrators kept in our party office are not being used,” said Shah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/only-14-beds-taken-bmc-may-fold-up-some-jumbos/articleshow/89027411.cms||Richa Pinto

After the drop seen in 2020, organ donations recovered to some extent last year when 33 cadaver donations were materialised. Incidentally, the state government has formed a 15-member taskforce to boost the organ donation numbers in Maharashtra further.  The Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), which distributes cadaver organs between transplant centres, said that the donor’s liver could be transplanted. The kidneys, heart and lungs were medically unfit for donation. The cadaver donation was facilitated by Apollo Hospital in Navi Mumbai. Dr SK Mathur, president of ZTCC, who is also a part of the taskforce now, said that before the pandemic, Maharashtra was carrying out about 160 donations. “If all systems and institutions participate, we can definitely push that number much higher,” he said. He added that the taskforce will be analysing why the existing NTORCs are unable to deliver and help them to improve.tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/city-records-first-organ-donation-of-the-year/articleshow/89027412.cms||---

Police sources said they will investigate the matter.Initial complaints were from Pune and Nagpur, but there are consumers in other parts of state as well who received these messages, an official said. The SMS would be sent from an unkown number, stating: “Dear consumer, your electricity power will be disconnected tonight at 9.30pm from electricity office because your previous month bill was not updated. Please immediately contact with our electricity officer 9xxxxxxxx0. Thank you.”Consumers who called the number were given a payment link which was bogus. Minister Raut said that all power consumers should make online payments only on the official website or app of MSEDCL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/fir-filed-after-users-get-sms-to-pay-power-bill-on-fake-link/articleshow/89027414.cms||Somit Sen

The circular also directed 150 traffic controllers to don the role of conductors in view of the crisis faced by the bus corporation due to workers’ indefinite strike. The protest entered its 85th day on Thursday. “The senior mechanics and ATIs were previously drivers of our buses and they have been promoted over the years. We are just seeking their assistance in operating more buses so that passengers get more services. This is temporary arrangement and they will be back to their actual postings soon”, said MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/workers-stir-msrtc-asks-sr-mechanics-to-drive-its-buses/articleshow/89027416.cms||---

Wankhede said that Malik had last “tendered an unconditional apology by way of affidavit dated December 10, 2021,” and that the HC was pleased to accept it. Malik, however, breached the order as recently as January 2 and 3, he claimed. Wankhede, a retired government official, sought orders to hold Malik in contempt under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/contempt-plea-filed-against-malik-by-wankhedes-father/articleshow/89027417.cms||---

In what is good news for the construction industry, the state cabinet on Thursday approved a new sand mining policy for the state. The 2015 and 2019 policies will be scrapped. In a press release, the government said the new policy will ensure that river and creek sand and gravel is available at a more reasonable rate and the license for sand mining will be valid for five years after the successful auctioneer has obtained a letter of intent along with environmental permits. Sumaira Abdulali, who has campaigned against illegal sand mining, said, “The attempt is to ensure there is less illegal sand mining and more revenue to the state.

---||Mumbai||Streets project: Firms find BMC terms too tough||Mumbai: Several city-based architects have raised concerns over BMC’s Mumbai Street Transformation Project. According to them, the conditions laid down by the civic body for empanelment of urban design consultants are so stringent that it is impossible for the vast majority of architects and urban designers to participate in the project. Earlier this month the BMC floated a tender for empanelment of urban design consultants for retrofitting of municipal streets under the project for three years. The consultants are to study the sites allocated, map all activities and issues, conduct requisite surveys and prepare conceptual and detailed design plans for making streets safer, accessible and resilient.Some architects who are in the process of writing a letter to the BMC have opined that the terms and conditions of engagement are onerous. Some of these include conditions like Rs 25 lakh cash in the bank account, minimum turnover of Rs 50 lakh and 10 years of experience in street design.Architect Samir D'monte, one of the signatories to the letter being sent to the BMC, said it was impossible for many of the young consultancy firms to comply with the Rs 25 lakh condition and such a condition would not guarantee quality of work. He said the Rs 50 lakh turnover condition would exclude a majority of the good firms. Architect Pranav Naik from Studio Pomegranate said that one of the BMC conditions is earnest money deposit (EMD) of Rs 1 lakh retained for three years or more, forfeitable if consultant does not meet eligibility criteria or if consultant does not want to accept a particular project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/streets-project-firms-find-bmc-terms-too-tough/articleshow/89027421.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||OBC political presence data is key, says panel||Mumbai: With the Supreme Court allowing the state government to provide data relevant to the OBC quota to the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC), members of the panel told TOI that it was important to get data on the political representation of OBCs, not their socio-economic status or their numbers. In the past, the MSBCC had rejected data provided by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics since it reflected the socio-economic status of communities. “For the purpose of a quota in local bodies, we will have to examine data on the political representation of the OBC community in such bodies in the past to the present. We will have to examine political backwardness in local bodies,” said a member of the commission. Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the state had multiple sources of data on OBCs and would soon provide them to the MSBCC. “There are many sources of data. The Gokhale Institute is just one of them. There is also data from the NSSO on OBCs and from several government departments,” he said.In the SC hearing on Wednesday, the state government had requested that it be allowed to conduct the remaining elections with the OBC quota on the basis of data already available with it on the OBC category. The court said the state should present the data it has to the MSBCC, which should then examine its correctness and then make a recommendation to the state. The apex court said states would still have to fulfil the requirements of the triple test. This includes setting up a dedicated commission to conduct a “contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness of the concerned group” before deciding on the quantum of reservation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/obc-political-presence-data-is-key-says-panel/articleshow/89027422.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai man gets 15 days to hand over home to mother he cheated||MUMBAI: Holding that a son had deprived his widowed mother of her right to “live a normal life”, Bombay high court directed him to vacate the house in 15 days, and hand over vacant possession to her of the only abode the elderly woman had. Justice Girish Kulkarni observed of the case: “Facts are quite peculiar and, to some extent, which would shock the conscience of the court.’’ Justice Kulkarni said that the subject matter of the “unfortunate proceedings’’ before him was the mother’s “plight’’ to get a roof over her head in a 300 sq ft tenement owned by her and the “hard struggle faced by her from one of her sons.’’ The woman was dishoused from her only abode in Prabhadevi, south Mumbai. The HC said the son had “foisted’’ himself and his family on her, saying his children were studying nearby. In a “novel’’ method to dishouse her, he entered into a rent agreement with her. But he took advantage of her old age and lack of education and did not pay rent — which was her source of livelihood — observed the court, remarking that it was “astonishing’’. The son paid only when the senior citizen complained to the police. The son also failed to maintain and support her livelihood, said the HC in a January 18 ruling. The petition was filed by the woman’s son under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. He challenged a February 2018 order passed by the presiding officer of the Parents and Senior Citizens Subsistence Tribunal, Mumbai. The mother had moved the tribunal for relief from her plight. Her husband had been a tenant in a building taken up for redevelopment, but he expired and the landlord — the BMC — incorporated her name as tenant. The developer had issued her the allotment letter and had given her possession of a new 300 sq ft flat, from which she was dishoused and did not receive rent for either. The HC said the woman was entitled to invoke the senior citizens’ welfare law and dismissed her son’s petition in the interest of justice. The court further rejected the son’s plea to continue interim relief in his favour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/man-gets-15-days-to-hand-over-home-to-mother-he-cheated/articleshow/89027423.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Panel rejects Param Bir Singh plea to produce documents||MUMBAI: The Justice K U Chandiwal commission on Thursday rejected former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s plea to allow production of documents, mostly annexures to his special leave petition and several orders, including copies of FIRs suffered by him. Singh’s counsel Anukul Seth submitted before the commission that the purpose of production of these set of documents is nothing but to complete the record of the commission. Justice Chandiwal is probing the allegations made by Singh in his letter of March 20 to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Subsequently, Singh stated before the commission that he will not lead the evidence neither would he like to be cross-examined. Barring Yogesh Naidu, counsel for Sachin Waze, others opposed the production of these documents. Sanjeev Palande’s counsel Sairuchita Choudhary objected to the application, saying Singh had not stepped into the witness box or filed exhaustive affidavit to put up his case so far projected by him. “If the documents in the form of SLP and annexures thereto are taken on record, it will have to be exhibited and without opportunity of either cross-examining Parambir Singh or traversing with the documents, would get on record with prejudice to other parties,” she said. “In the above situation, there should not be scant disrespect to the process that is going on and avoidance of appearing in person would not now facilitate Parambir Singh to produce the documents to be used whenever he so desires. Such exercise is wholly uncalled for and ... production of documents is refused. Accordingly, the application is rejected,” Justice Chandiwal said in his two-page order.  Justice Chandiwal also rejected intervention application by Bimal Agarwal and Stephen D’mello. Agarwal had complained against Waze, while D’mello had a grievance against Singh and had sought inquiry by the commission. D’mello’s application dealt with events in 2009 about police officers collecting hafta from sand, diesel, petrol and illicit liquor mafia and bar owners under support of Singh. “Task assigned to this commission is in relation to the event that has transpired after transfer of Parambir Singh and the allegations contained in the letter of March 20, 2021 addressed to the CM. ... In the situation, therefore, there cannot be a roving inquiry into the allegations made by the intervenor…even Agarwal’s complaint too is travelling beyond the scope of work assigned to the commission. In the result, applications of Agarwal and D’mello are rejected ... ,” the order said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/panel-rejects-param-plea-to-produce-documents/articleshow/89027425.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Theme parks in selective wards in Mumbai, rues Congress||MUMBAI: Two days after TOI reported on civic authorities’ plan to develop four theme-based recreational grounds in the city, Congress corporator from Kalina Tulip Miranda on Thursday took strong objection to it. Miranda said that theme- based gardens have been chosen specifically in wards represented by corporators from the ruling party in the BMC. “I have been personally following up for the revamp of the Kaka Joseph Baptista maidan in the past two years which has a pond that requires urgent restoration. The answer to this has only been the existing paucity of funds and that the same cannot be done at this juncture. The visits made by senior civic officials have also borne no result at all,” said Miranda. Times ViewDeveloping recreational grounds in a space-starved city is always welcome, but the allegations that these public amenities are selectively chosen must be dispelled. The BMC cannot be seen favouring only certain ruling party corporators and must ensure open spaces which need proper maintenance in other wards are not starved of funds.Miranda said that the Kaka Baptista maidan was built on a dumping ground and happens to be the only open space in the area. “Therefore it is even more important that the BMC looks at revamping it but it has continued turning a blind eye to it,” said Miranda. Recently a barefoot meditation park, science themed park, traffic based theme park and multipurpose sports facility have been proposed in Mumbai at four different recreational grounds. Civic officials they said that the selection of the gardens was done by the district Planning Development Committee (DPDC. “We are only the executing agency and have no role in the selection process,” said the official. The 300-year-old Kalina talao, once a natural water reservoir, had been encroached on in the past years, and it housed at least 200 shanties till the year 2014. It was revived and turned into a garden with walkways and sports facilities after almost a two year struggle by locals. The pond played a key role in the East Indian wedding tradition called ‘Umbracha Pani’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/theme-parks-in-selective-wards-rues-cong/articleshow/89027429.cms||Richa Pinto

A former employee of a private bank pulled this ‘twin’ stunt by pretending to be ‘a colleague’ at the same bank and allegedly duped a bank customer of Rs 9.5 lakh. Showing unusual alacrity, the police arrested this alleged fraudster within two hours of the FIR being registered. Three of his accomplices have also been nabbed. The complainant, a businessman, had spoken to the ‘bank employee’ — actually the former bank staffer himself — about a problem in his online transactions. Later, he shared his account details and OTP with the ‘employee’ to solve the problem but ended up losing Rs 9.5 lakh. The FIR was registered at V P Road police station on Tuesday.. Within two hours the police nabbed Dattaram Solanki (43), a Khar resident. Later, three others — a bank employee Vijay Ghadge (29), and two real estate agents, Nilofar Saifi (36) and Naresh Pawar (42) — were held. All are in police custody. The complainant, Hitesh Chaudhary, who has his account with the private bank knew the employee, Ghadge. Last month, he called him up for help about online transactions. “Ghadge told him he had quit the bank but gave him the number of ‘another person, Sanket, from the bank’ who could help,” said sub-inspector Ravindra Lambhate. Later, Sanket called up Chaudhary and sought details about the problem and the account. On Tuesday, Sanket called up Chaudhary to say that he had solved the problem and told Chaudhary to share an OTP that he would get on his phone. Chaudhary shared the OTP. “He was shocked to see a message that Rs 9.5 lakh was transferred from his account,” said an officer. The police went to Chaudhary’s bank, got information of the account where the money was transferred. Soon, police reached Solanki’s home and nabbed him. “He had withdrawn Rs 6.5 lakh,” said an officer. Solanki admitted to sharing his account details with the other accused who were also arrested. Ghadge sought help for an account to transfer the money. “Ghadge played the role of ‘Sanket’ too. Solanki got Rs 3 lakh, Saifi kept Rs 1 lakhand forwarded the rest to Pawar and Ghadge who worked at the private bank at the time.

---||Mumbai||Moody’s: LIC IPO to boosttransparency, governance||Mumbai: The listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and other government-owned non-life companies will bring about reforms in terms of better focus on underwriting & products, transparency, governance and risk management, according to Moody’s.In an interview with TOI, Moody’s vice-president and senior analyst Mohammed Ali Londe said that any change that the initial public offering (IPO) will bring about in LIC would have an impact on the wider market as well because of the corporation’s 70% market share. “What we have seen elsewhere in terms of what happens after large IPOs is that the governance standards run through and through — the credit profile, the business they select and how they manage the assets and the risks. It becomes much more advanced or sophisticated,” said Londe. He added that the benefits of listings would outweigh the pressures to focus on short-term on quarterly results. “I think what governance and focus on risk management does is that in terms of risk management heat map it brings all the risks on the table, whether it is short-term or long-term,” said Londe.According to him, the three unlisted non-life insurers, which have been under pressure, have displayed an improvement in performance after a capital infusion by the government a couple of years ago. In March 2018, the state-owned non-life insurers had 46% of premium but 84% of underwriting losses. “Our figures show that as of March 2021, it dropped to 67% of underwriting losses, and for FY22 until June 2021 they were only 57% of underwriting losses,” he added.Moody’s sees an opportunity for the state-owned insurers to hold on to market share given that there is a lot of room for growth and the companies have an advantage in terms of geographical penetration and brand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/moodys-lic-ipo-to-boosttransparency-governance/articleshow/89027434.cms||Mayur Shetty

For one, 70% women are going for antenatal check-up in the first trimester, which has increased significantly since 2015-2016 (about 59%), while 78% women have got postnatal care within 2 days of delivery.Key segments of the baby care market — including toiletries, diapers, apparel and toys — are said to be growing at 13-14% per annum, with baby care makers expanding their reach and beefing up their digital capabilities. “India has the lowest per capita consumption of baby care products and thus it presents a lot of scope for growth,” said Sakshi Mody, promoter of JL Morison (JLM). “Similarly, the penetration of baby care products is also very low as compared to nations like China, Brazil and Russia,” said Mody, while adding that India will remain in the high-growth phase for the baby care industry for 10 years.Kimberly-Clark India MD Mainak Dhar said, “While current reports indicate that the country is witnessing a dip in population growth rate, there are significant opportunities for the continued growth of the baby care market as category penetration continues to rise and consumers trade up within established categories.”The growing working woman population is said to be a big driver of baby care category growth. Further, the digital revolution has been a growth enabler, with 33% women (urban+rural) and 52% urban women having internet access. However, the working woman population took a slight beating since the pandemic. JLM’s VP (sales & marketing) Nitin Manchanda said, although this has not had a direct effect on the market, “we have seen some shifts happening from premium segment to mass segment, which seem to be temporary”. He added, “The hypothesis is that with the economy coming back on track, there will be a reversal in 2 to 3 quarters.”JLM, which operates in the mass segment with brand Morisons Baby Dreams, has strengthened distribution reach by more than 50% in last 2 years. JLM has also launched smaller value-add packs to spur higher trials.

---||Mumbai||HUL Q3 net up 17% at ₹2,243cr amid inflation||MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has reported a 17% growth in standalone profit after tax at Rs 2,243 crore during the third quarter ended December 31, 2021, as compared to Rs 1,921 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Domestic consumer growth was at 11%, driven by product price increases to offset inflationary pressures, with total income rising 10% to Rs 13,183 crore. However, the company’s strategy to combat input cost pressures through grammage reduction on certain product packs impacted its volume growth, with rural markets now in negative volume growth terrain. Almost 30% of HUL’s business comes from such low price point packs of Re 1, 5 & 10, which largely get consumed in rural India. Consequently, the underlying volume growth at 2% is the lowest that HUL has seen in a quarter since July-September of 2020 when it grew at 1% year-on-year (YoY) to mark a revival after the first wave of Covid. HUL said the 2% volume growth in the latest December quarter was ahead of the FMCG market, which is considered to be the barometer for the economy. Commodity headwinds continue to be a significant challenge. HUL’s CMD Sanjiv Mehta said he expects a moderation in inflation in the second half of this calendar year. “We have not seen inflation like this in many years. This is absolutely unprecedented. And it’s a global phenomenon,” he said at a virtual media meet. Mehta said while FMCG price increase has a minimal impact on people with higher living standards, there is a large number of consumers who have a limited income. “I believe that all the relief provided by the government in the last two years is something which ought to be extended in the new fiscal year,” said Mehta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hul-q3-net-up-17-at-2243cr-amid-inflation/articleshow/89027440.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Wearing hijab to college act of indiscipline: Karnataka minister B C Nagesh||BENGALURU/UDUPI: Coming to school or college in hijab or headscarf is tantamount to indiscipline, said state primary and secondary education minister B C Nagesh on Thursday. "Uniforms were introduced in 1985 to bring a sense of oneness among students and to ensure educational institutions don't become a place to practice one's religion," Nagesh told TOI, reacting to the headscarf row at the Government PU College for girls in Udupi district. Six students of the college have been staging a protest since December-end for not being allowed to sit in class with the hijab. He also referred to the students' protests as ‘politically motivated,' accusing vested interests of influencing the Muslim students to stage a stir. "If the six students are so adamant about practicing their faith in college, they are welcome to leave the college and enrol in an institute that allows hijabs," he added. Defending the decision of college authorities not to allow hijab in class, Nagesh said barring the six students, the rest of the 94 Muslim students are attending classes in uniform. Moreover, he said the six students had attended college without the hijab for last one-and-a-half years. On Thursday, the six girls continued their protest in front of the college holding placards. On Wednesday, at a meeting with government officials, including the assistant commissioner, tahsildar, representatives from the minority welfare department, parents, and the students, to resolve the row, it was decided that the girls could be in the hijab in the classroom until the teacher enters the class. Once classes begin, they have to remove it. It was also decided that they could wear the hijab on sports days, cultural days, or during similar social gatherings. The students did not agree to the conditions set by the college and resumed protest on Thursday. "They have been harassing us mentally by not allowing us to attend classes wearing the hijab. We would have no problem if all the lecturers were women, but there are many male lecturers here. We cannot sit in class without our hijab when a male teacher is taking class," said one of the six students. The six students also alleged that the college authorities were not even allowing them to talk to their classmates.  "There are 76 Muslim students in our college. It is their choice if they want to wear the hijab or not. It is an individual choice. We six want to protect our rights and we will continue our protest," said another student. College betterment committee president and Udupi MLA K Raghupati Bhat said they have written to the government asking whether uniforms are mandatory. "We are yet to get a response. If the government decides not to make uniform compulsory, then the college will allow the six students to attend classes with hijabs," he added. Masood Manna, a member of the Campus Front of India, said that it is a violation of the right to education and the right to practise religion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/wearing-hijab-to-college-act-of-indiscipline-min/articleshow/89027446.cms||---

The city's highest until now was 26,756 daily cases on April 30, 2021. Karnataka reported 47,754 cases on the day, a shade less than its highest ever of 47,930 recorded on May 9, 2021, during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. The state logged 29 deaths in the past 24 hours. Having conducted nearly 2.6 lakh tests in a day, the state's daily positivity rate was 18.5% on the day. With 1.2 lakh tests, Bengaluru recorded a positivity rate of 25.7%. Apart from Bengaluru, four other districts reported more than 1,000 cases: Hassan logged in 1,840 cases, followed by Tumakuru 1,622, Mandya 1,512 and Mysuru 1,352. With that, the active caseload in the state is nearing the 3-lakh mark. Health minister K Sudhakar said the state, as per estimates, would witness daily fresh cases between 70,000 and 1.2 lakh in the coming days. Of the 29 deaths in the state, eight victims were from Bengaluru. The victims included a 40-year-old man from Mandya who died at his residence on January 17. The youngest victim was a 27-year-old woman from Mysuru suffering from breathlessness who died on January 17 after three days of hospitalisation. The woman had no comorbidities. In Shivamogga, a Covid-positive person died by suicide and the case has been reported as non-Covid death as per the state's bulletin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bluru-logs-30k-new-covid-cases-highest-ever-single-day-spike/articleshow/89027484.cms||---
---||Mumbai||2,498 farmers ended their lives in 11 months of 2021 in Maharashtra: RTI reply||MUMBAI: Distress among farmers in the state pushed 2,498 of them to end their lives in the 11-month period from January to November 2021. In 2020, 2,547 debt-ridden farmers had committed suicide. Data from the state revenue department shows that despite loan waiver schemes of the government, farmers continue to commit suicide for inability to repay loans. Region-wise Aurangabad saw 804 suicides in the 11-month period in 2021 and Nagpur division reported 309 cases. Konkan division had no suicides in the last two years. “Even after several loan waivers and multiple other schemes for farmers, the suicide rate has seen no major reduction as 2,547 farmers committed suicide in 2020 while 2,498 ended their lives in 11 months from Jan to Nov 2021,” said Jeetendra Ghadge, RTI activist who sought data. Vidarbhahas always been the worst-hit with almost 50% suicides in the state. Amravati district (331) surpassed Yavatmal (270) as the leading one to record the highest suicides compared to 2020. Ghadge of ‘The Young Whistleblowers Foundation’ added, “Ignoring the mental health aspect of farmers and just giving loan waivers to all will never address the problem. A bankruptcy scheme for only bankrupt farmers with mental health support would cost less and solve the problem more effectively. It’s important to filter out distressed farmers so that help is channelised to the ones who need it the most.” A shift in cultivation in favour of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and vegetables, according to suitable agro-climatic conditions of Marathwada and Vidharbha is necessary, said Dnyandev Talule, head of the department of economics at Shivaji University. In his December 2021 research paper titled, ‘The Signs of Persistent Agrarian Distress; Suicide by Maharashtra Farmers’, he said, “Effects of government relief packages in the past were short-lived and could not address problems in the long run. Elimination of corruption in the implementation of these packages is also important.” Under the state’s Rs 1 lakh relief, an average of only 50% of farmers’ kin were found eligible for compensation, said Ghadge who added that outdated criteria framed 15 years ago only provide financial aid to kin only if loan is from a nationalised bank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2-5k-farm-suicides-in-11-months-of-2021-in-maharashtra-rti-reply/articleshow/89027485.cms||Hemali Chhapia

N Madhu of Ambedkar Nagar in Vijinapura had put up an advertisement on social media saying he wanted to sell a Honda Dio scooter. The scooter belonged to Santosh Kumar, also a driver. Santosh wanted to sell the vehicle and Madhu said he’d help.“I got a call on January 11 and the caller said he is ready to buy the scooter. We met on Nagasandra main road in Peenya around 2pm. After looking at the scooter and the original documents, he agreed to purchase it for Rs 60,000. He then went on a test ride but did not return with the scooter,” Madhu stated in his complaint. Madhu said Rs 1 lakh cash, meant to repay a personal loan, was kept in the scooter’s glove compartment. “I had taken a hand loan of Rs 1.5 lakh from my uncle. To repay it, I sold my mini-goods vehicle for Rs 60,000 some days ago and pledged gold ornaments of my family members to raise another Rs 40,000. I was planning to meet my uncle and hand over the money when I got the call from the man,” Madhu said. When the man did not return, Madhu called him but his mobile was switched off. After waiting a couple of days, he approached the cops. Police said they are looking into the call records of the suspect and trying to trace him.

---||Bengaluru||Sewage inflow damaging lake rejuvenated 6 yrs ago||Bengaluru: Kasavanahalli Lake, spread over 57 acres and rejuvenated by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) six years ago, was free of sewage for only three years. A MAPSAS (Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti) volunteer for the lake said, “The issue become more visible since last year after the city received a good amount of rainfall. Had it been resolved immediately, matters wouldn’t have reached this far. All BBMP did after we complained several times was place a couple of sandbags in the stormwater drains, which was not helpful as the quantity of sewage was very high.” Residents claim raw sewage entering the lake has gone up significantly with several new residential properties coming up in the waterbody’s vicinity. “Chief engineers and officials from KSPCB and BWSSB visited the lake multiple times, but they have not taken any concrete action for stopping raw sewage from flowing into the lake. Unless BBMP sees a big issue such as a lake breach, it is not ready to act. This problem does not seem big enough to them yet,” the volunteer said. MAPSAS volunteers were recently informed the civic body would construct an additional diversion drain to stop sewage from entering the lake. “This will solve only part of the issue. Further, this construction will happen at the cost of taxpayers’ money,” the volunteer said. Lake experts have explained the ill-effects of sewage entering the lake several times. Nagesh Aras, an expert, said, “Even if sewage is treated in a well-run STP (sewage treatment plant), it still contains nutrients. Raw sewage is even worse as it has biodegradable material also. So when raw or treated sewage enters a lake, it promotes wild growth of algae and hyacinth. This causes rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen in the lake, which leads to fish kill.” A polluted lake can still host insects that live above the water surface and feed on vegetation. These insects attract wader birds. “But you will not find diver birds that feed on fish in polluted lakes,” Aras said. A BBMP official told TOI, “BWSSB is carrying out work to establish a network of trunk lines in the area, which has led to the flow of 25 MLD of sewage into stormwater drains. It is not only entering Kasavanahalli Lake but five other lakes along the same line. There are many unauthorised constructions in the area. This makes it difficult even for BWSSB, which is likely to finish its work in 5-6 months. Once that is done, BBMP will clear out the sludge/slush from the lakes using bio-enzymes.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sewage-inflow-damaging-lake-rejuvenated-6-yrs-ago/articleshow/89027493.cms||---

The question, which generally triggers a verbal duel between animal lovers and stray dog detesters, took a violent turn in an apartment at Ramachandrapura near Vidyaranyapura on Wednesday: Two neighbours clashed over dog poop and lodged police complaints against each other — a 45-year woman, who is a stray dog lover, and her neighbour, a 35-year-old homemaker.The 45-year-old woman first filed a complaint stating her neighbour and the latter’s daughter were throwing dog poop outside her door. In her counter-complaint, the homemaker accused the woman of abusing them over stray dogs.In her complaint, the dog lover said: “For two-and-half years, I have been feeding stray dogs. They enter our apartment since some occupants do not close the main gates. The mother-daughter duo, who live next door, regularly throw dog poop outside my door. This morning, I caught them red-handed. When I questioned them, they attacked me with a flower pot and beat me.”The homemaker countered: “Today around 8.30am, she started abusing me saying I was throwing dog poop outside her door. Then she beat me up and threatened my daughter at knifepoint when she tried to save me from being attacked.”Cops booked the women under several IPC sections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/neighbours-fight-over-dog-poop/articleshow/89027494.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka government slashes sick leave period to tide over staff crunch||BENGALURU: With a huge spike in Covid-19 cases, the Karnataka government has decided to “rationalise” sick leaves of government officials by reducing recovery days to anywhere between three and seven days. As the Omicron strain of Covid-19 spreads quickly, the government is facing a serious manpower crisis with officials forced to take sick leave after testing positive. It is being said that at least one in three government officials is testing positive, and, in several cases, the situation is being “misused” to work from home or skip assignments. Making excuses“We have been seeing a lot of our officials using Covid-19 as an excuse, even if they are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, to extend sick leave. As a result, departments have been initiating action to bring them back to work immediately after seven days of quarantine,” said one government official. In the education department alone, as many as four deputy directors of public instruction (DDPI) have tested positive on a single test, along with scores of their subordinates testing positive as primary contacts. “With this being the case, we are facing a shortage of manpower and have instructed those who have tested positive to return to work on the 8th day of recovery. We can no more afford long recovery periods,” said DPI commissioner R Vishal. Health workers testing +veThe bigger concern, however, is healthcare workers — government doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel — who are getting infected on a regular basis, leaving the healthcare system overstretched. According to health secretary TK Anil Kumar, the government has issued a circular stating that all healthcare workers who are primary contacts of a Covid-positive patient can return to work after three days if no symptoms are present. “Our healthcare workers turn primary contacts every other day. We cannot afford to have them out of action for long. As a result, we have issued a circular saying they can return to work after three days,” said Kumar. A similar order has been issued in the revenue department, which has one of the highest number of government employees after education and health. Department principal secretary Tushar Giri Nath said that as per the Government of India protocol, a seven-day mandatory period has been issued. “So, we are trying to maintain the same protocol even now,” said Nath. Health secretary Kumar said the world over, recovery period has been reduced to anywhere between five to seven days andthe same norm is being followed in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-slashes-sick-leave-period-to-tide-over-staff-crunch/articleshow/89027496.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

She was admitted to the hospital on January 16 and delivered a girl the next day through C-section. Her husband Asad Ali Sayed and her parents were all Covid negative and the newborn baby also tested negative. Anjum was discharged on January 19 and the family filed a police complaint the same day, alleging she was forced to stay in unhygienic conditions. Anjum alleged that after the delivery, she was shifted with her infant to a room that had cockroaches and red ants. “When questioned, staffers sprayed pesticides that led to us experiencing burning sensation in the nose, eyes and mouth. This forced us to rush out of the room with the baby,” the couple said. In three days, they were shifted to three different rooms and her entire birthing experience was ruined, she said.No reaction from hospTOI contacted Cloudnine Hospital for their comment through calls, messages and mail, but there was no response.When contacted, Jayanagar police said they registered a non-cognisable case based on the family’s complaint and both parties were called to the police station on Thursday. “The hospital told police they were short-staffed because some staffers were Covid positive.

---||Bengaluru||9 Karnataka districts report more Covid cases in rural areas||BENGALURU: With a surge in Covid cases, rural areas are carrying higher caseload in at least nine districts of Karnataka in the past 14 days ending January 18. These districts are: Udupi, Hassan, Mandya, Uttara Kannada, Ramanagara, Chikkamagaluru, Chikkaballapura, Chamarajanagar and Kodagu. In four districts, the number of Covid infections in rural areas far outstrip those in urban clusters. For instance, Mandya rural areas account for 2,576 cases against the urban count of 1,124 for the 14-day analysis period. In Ramanagara, rural pockets reported 1,029 cases and urban areas 428. In Chamarajanagar, it’s 850 to 248. In Kodagu, rural areas have 623 cases and urban clusters 320. Udupi (2,260 in urban and 2,737 in rural) and Haveri (108 to 109) are the only districts in this list of nine which have near-parity in distribution of cases. Mandya health officer Dr Dhananjaya TN explained the district should not be compared with other districts as 90% is rural areas. “Every day, we get about 900 cases despite conducting targeted testing of symptomatic persons. Against the government target of 5,000, we conduct 6,000 tests a day and isolate positive cases early on,” said the officer, adding cases in the district saw a big jump after devotees returning from Om Shakti temple in Tamil Nadu and Sabarimala in Kerala started testing positive in big numbers. Officers said testing in rural areas is relatively tougher as people don’t volunteer for Covid checks and believe in home remedies saying what they have is only cold. “In this wave, many have had mild symptoms, and there is more reluctance towards testing. That Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed is a major concern behind fast spreading of the cases in rural areas, though population density is far less,” said an officer. D Randeep, commissioner, health and family welfare department, said the weekend curbs are in force across the state, but wearing of mask is not strictly followed in rural areas. “The focus should now be on visits of doctors to the residences of home-isolated patients. The initiative of ‘Vaidyara Nade Halliya Kade’ (doctors’ village reachout), which was discussed during a recent meeting with the chief minister, will soon be taken up. We want a team of doctors, including a few from Ayush stream, to take this up in rural areas. They will check the health status of the home-isolated patients and giving them assurance,” said Randeep. He said medical teams will ensure patients have received home-isolation medical kits and guide them on maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Wherever home isolation is not possible in villages, Covid care centres will have to be opened,” said Randeep.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/9-ktaka-dists-report-more-covid-cases-in-rural-areas/articleshow/89027501.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Reduce Covid testing, give 3rd dose, say experts ahead of CM Basavaraj Bommai’s review meet||BENGALURU: Many experts have suggested that Covid tests in Karnataka be scaled down further as this measure is no longer relevant given the rapid rise in cases and the third wave inching towards a peak. Instead, they have advocated an extensive vaccination drive to inoculate all adults with the preventive third dose. Currently, 83% of the state’s eligible population has been administered with two vaccine doses. The suggestions have come ahead of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s review meeting on Friday, where the government will take a relook at the state’s Covid management strategy. Concurring with the experts’ views, members of the Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) said they have prepared a fresh advisory to present at the meeting. “It is time to review the testing strategy which should be in line with the January 10 guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Testing should be purposive in nature, focusing on the targeted group. Hence, the number of tests will come down,” said TAC chairman Dr MK Sudarshan. ICMR has said tests should be limited to symptomatic cases, and asymptomatic individuals needn’t be tested. Even contacts of positive cases do not need to be tested, unless they are identified as high-risk due to age (over 60 years) or comorbidities. In fact, at the previous Covid review meeting held on January 11, officials had broached this issue and suggested that the government reduce the number of Covid tests from 1.5 lakh a day to 75,000. However, the chief minister decided to scale it up to 2 lakh. But given the surge in the third wave, the government even did up to 2.8 lakh tests a day. Currently, the state is doing around 2 lakh tests daily. “Extensive testing is not necessary at this point when the third wave has evidently peaked in urban localities and rural areas are set to witness the peak in a week or two. What is required is to save resources such as testing kits and vaccinate all eligible people with a third dose,” said noted virologist T Jacob John. Considering the rapid surge in the third wave, the experts estimated that at least 30 more people have been infected for every positive case detected, and most of them are asymptomatic. As the infection is widespread in the community, detection of the virus through testing only indicates the tip of the iceberg. Also, with symptoms being milder and the infection cycle being as short as five days, recovery rate is very high without testing and treatment at hospitals. An official from the health department said it is likely to reduce the tests to 75,000 per day, of which 30% will be rapid antigen tests (RAT) and the rest will be RT-PCR. ‘With this, the number of fresh cases recorded daily will drastically come down although test positivity (TPR) will remain high. However, the TPR is not a cause for concern as the wave is expected to taper shortly,” he said.

As a result, departments have been initiating action to bring them back to work immediately after seven days of quarantine,” said one government official. In the education department alone, as many as four deputy directors of public instruction (DDPI) have tested positive on a single test, along with scores of their subordinates testing positive as primary contacts. “With this being the case, we are facing a shortage of manpower and have instructed those who have tested positive to return to work on the 8th day of recovery. We can no more afford long recovery periods,” said DPI commissioner R Vishal.Health workers testing +veThe bigger concern, however, is healthcare workers — government doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel — who are getting infected on a regular basis, leaving the healthcare system overstretched.According to health secretary TK Anil Kumar, the government has issued a circular stating that all healthcare workers who are primary contacts of a Covid-positive patient can return to work after three days if no symptoms are present.“Our healthcare workers turn primary contacts every other day. We cannot afford to have them out of action for long. As a result, we have issued a circular saying they can return to work after three days,” said Kumar.A similar order has been issued in the revenue department, which has one of the highest number of government employees after education and health. Department principal secretary Tushar Giri Nath said that as per the Government of India protocol, a seven-day mandatory period has been issued. “So, we are trying to maintain the same protocol even now,” said Nath.Health secretary Kumar said the world over, recovery period has been reduced to anywhere between five to seven days andthe same norm is being followed in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-reduces-sick-leave-period-to-tide-over-staff-crunch/articleshow/89027504.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

It will be launched using Ariane-5 launcher operated by French firm Arianespace. Space PSU NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), which has contracts to launch GSAT-24 as a dedicated satellite for TataSky, is looking to launch it in the early part of the first quarter of next fiscal. “...Advanced testing is ongoing at the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSAC) and we are looking at shipping the satellite at the end of this quarter for a launch early in the first quarter of 2022-23,” a senior official said.The TOI was the first to report (on Feb 18, 2021) that NSIL would launch a dedicated satellite for TataSky. Isro, through URSAC, is building the satellite for NSIL, which will procure the satellite and launch it for TataSky. Arianespace too has said that “...the satellite will be placed into orbit during an Ariane-5 mission scheduled for the 1st quarter of 2022.” GSAT-24 — the 25th Indian satellite Arianespace will be launching — will be shipped to Guiana Space Centre, Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, from where the Ariane-5 will lift off.A Ku-band satellite, GSAT-24 is a four-tonne class communications satellite that will be placed into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).

---||Bengaluru||Many med PG aspirants want NEET deferred||Bengaluru: A section of medical PG aspirants is caught in a dilemma: While PG NEET counselling for the 2021 batch is under way, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for 2022 is scheduled for March 12. Seeking a gap between the two, many want the exam to be postponed.Students from several other states can’t even appear for NEET 2022 as it is mandated that aspirants complete internship by end of May. Students from Karnataka do not have this problem as they would complete internships by March. Their concern, instead, is the clash of counselling dates and the next exam schedule, which is robbing them of precious time they could have used in preparation. Karnataka Examinations Authority has started the document-verification process. While it was offline until recently, on January 19 KEA provided the option to upload documents online so as to help students testing positive for Covid-19 or those facing travel difficulties. “I am from Chintamani. While KEA took the document-verification process online a couple of days ago, my turn was before that and I had to travel all the way to Bengaluru. I lost two days in travel and the process,” said Dr M Reddy, an aspirant.“Last year, when a similar problem had occurred, they had postponed the exam. We hope they do it now as well. We are spending a lot of time on the counselling process, including document verification, option entry, looking at college profiles among others. There is so much pressure,” said Dr Sarath from Dharwad.The dilemma is bigger for students in borderline ranks. “Students ranking between 15,000 and 20,000 are facing a bigger problem. The mop-up round when some seats will be available will be around mid-March. Do we wait for the counselling or prepare for the exam? Had there been a gap after the counselling, we would have been in a better position,” said Dr Satyajeet Das, who studied in Bengaluru.Process time-consumingThe Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors joined the chorus from across the nation to say that exam postponement will be helpful for students. “We want it to be deferred by at least two months because students will be confused over whether to give the exam or attend counselling rounds. The counselling process takes a lot of time. It’s a bigger concern for students in borderline ranks,” said Dr Tejas J, president of the association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/many-med-pg-aspirants-want-neet-deferred/articleshow/89027507.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||House panel to inspect elite clubs from next week||Bengaluru: Legislators have turned the heat on elite social clubs yet again for allegedly violating bylaws and other irregularities in terms of issuance of membership. A special house committee of the legislative council will inspect the clubs from Monday.The house committee was constituted in May last year, but it could not take up the task because of the devastating second wave of Covid-19, and it is now set to resume the study amid the surging third wave which is seemingly milder. Terming the move a “harassment”, club managements alleged that disgruntled MLAs and MLCs who were denied membership are behind it. N Ravikumar, chairman of the panel and BJP MLC, said the team comprising select members of the council from all parties will pay surprise visits to at least four clubs a week, covering all major institutes across Karnataka.There are 182 clubs in the state registered with the Federation of Clubs of Karnataka of which 40 are in Bengaluru. While clubs in cities including Mangaluru, Kalaburagi and Belagavi are under scanner, the focus is mainly on the upscale clubs in Bengaluru. “Some clubs are indulging in several activities which they are not supposed to do. Our visit will aim at nailing such clubs and recommending the government about new rules to regulate them. We will suggest cancellation of licence and other punishment if we find any violation,” said Ravikumar. The general complaint against clubs is that a few have commercially exploited the property developed on civic amenity (CA) sites, been selective in issuance of membership and framed their own laws to charge exorbitant membership fees as high as Rs 25 lakh, and restricted entry in the guise of dress code. “We need to discipline some clubs which have become law unto themselves,” said SR Viswanath, chairman, Bengaluru Development Authority. This is not the first time the government is cracking the whip on elite recreation clubs for their alleged defiance. Two house committees were set up during the Congress regime led by Siddaramaiah — headed by Congress MLA NA Haris and BJP MLA A Manju. One of the panels had even recommended a legislation mandating all clubs to give membership to legislators and stringent punishment, including six-month imprisonment, for violating norms.The government had introduced Karnataka Entry into Public Places (Removal of Restriction on Dress and Regulation of Membership and Fee) Bill in 2015, but withdrew it owing to legal issues. Ex-IPS officer RP Sharma in 2014 had complained that a century-old club was violating norms in terms of serving liquor, prompting the government to frame new excise rules. “The so-called inspection is happening repeatedly. Let them do it; we are not worried. We have partially commercialised the property as the rule allows us to use 20% of it,” said ANK Raju, ex-officio member, Cosmopolitan Club, which rented out a portion to Reliance Fresh and a bowling alley.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/house-panel-to-inspect-elite-clubs-from-next-week/articleshow/89027509.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Soon, drone survey of properties in 31 Karnataka districts||BENGALURU: The government will soon begin a drone survey for property digitisation in all 31 districts at a cost of Rs 287 crore. Revenue minister R Ashoka on Thursday told reporters the move is in line with the Centre's flagship Digital India programme. He said the department has already begun a pilot project in five districts, including Ramanagara, under the central government scheme. “Following the discovery of benefits of this drone survey, several district administrations expressed increased interest. As a result, we’ve decided to expand the programme to all districts,” he added. Ashoka said the government will be reaching the doorsteps of 45-50 lakh farmers to provide one-time information about their land records. “There are thousands of farmers who are unaware of the fact that their land continues to be registered in their father’s or grandfather’s names. There are cases where, without their knowledge, the landowners have changed titles. To ensure that every farmer knows the details of land records as registered with the revenue department, the government will be reaching the doorstep of every farmer in the state and provide their land records,” said the minister. Ashoka said the documentation will be provided to farmers free of cost and that he along with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will soon launch the exercise. While the initial launch was scheduled for January 26 to coincide with Republic Day, he said they have decided to defer it for some time due to spike in Covid-19 cases. The revenue minister also said the Centre has released funds of Rs 504 crore under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) against the claims of Rs 841 crore raised by Karnataka for the flood damage in 2021.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/soon-drone-survey-of-properties-in-31-dists/articleshow/89027511.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Mekedatu padayatra: Will KPCC president DK Shivakumar emerge Vokkaliga strongman?||BENGALURU: The fight for political dominance in the Vokkaliga heartland of Old Mysuru region has begun in earnest following KPCC president DK Shivakumar’s recent padayatra seeking the implementation of Mekedatu project across Cauvery, the lifeline of south Karnataka. Through this outreach programme, the 59-year-old leader is apparently looking to emerge the champion of the Vokkaliga community, that comprises 15 percent of the state’s population, ahead of the 2023 polls as it would hold the key to Congress’ return to power. There are 70 seats up for grabs and its proximity to the power hub, Bengaluru, makes the region all the more critical for any party hoping to win the assembly elections. Traditionally, the Vokkaliga community has always backed HD Deve Gowda and his family. But since 2019, JD(S)’ support base among the Vokkaligas has been eroding, following a series of poll debacles, especially in its strongholds, leading to mass defections. Shivakumar, a protege of former chief minister SM Krishna, now in BJP, sees it as a huge opportunity to step into the big shoes of the Gowdas by taking up the community’s cause. There are many in Congress who admit that none, including Shivakumar, can match Deve Gowda when it comes to influence over the community. But many also feel there is none other than Shivakumar to replace him since HD Kumaraswamy, who is seen as Deve Gowda’s successor, has been increasingly losing confidence of party members. There’s also a perception that the Gowdas have put the family interest ahead of the community and have been steadily losing ground even in their fiefdom of south Karnataka. But it’s easier said than done. Shivakumar’s career has followed an upward trajectory since his first win in Sathanur assembly constituency in 1989. He has won all subsequent elections, shifting to the Kanakapura seat in 2008 after his former constituency ceased to exist as a result of a delimitation exercise. While his financial clout has improved manifold, according to the affidavits submitted by him before the Election Commission, his political clout has been limited to Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural over the past 15 years and he has not been able to emerge as a mass leader. His image took a hit after he was raided by income tax officials in 2019. Senior Congress functionary BL Shankar said the recent padayatra has provided Shivakumar a perfect platform to accomplish his goal to emerge a Vokkaliga strongman and it’s only a matter of time. “Shivakumar does not necessarily have to overthrow the Gowdas to become a community leader. When Deve Gowda was at his peak in the 1990s, SM Krishna had made a space for himself and emerged leader and even went on to become CM,” Shankar pointed out. “Deve Gowda undoubtedly is still champion of the Vokkaliga community but not Kumaraswamy. Shivakumar, through the padayatra, has sent out a clear message that he will represent the community after Gowda but not Kumaraswamy,” said Ramesh Babu, former JD(S) MLC and Congress functionary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/will-dks-emerge-vokkaliga-strongman/articleshow/89027512.cms||---

KSRTC has decided to operate 50 AC electric buses on six inter-city routes from Bengaluru. Of these 12m AC buses, 15 will be operated to and from Davanagere, 10 to and from Shivamogga, eight to and from Mysuru, seven to and from Madikeri, and five each to and from Chikkamagaluru and Virajpet. Officials said Hyderabad-based Evey Trans Pvt Ltd has received the work order under the second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. It will be a 12-year contract under which KSRTC will pay on a per km basis. Evey reportedly quoted Rs 62/km, including electricity, on the tender and reduced it to Rs 55/km after negotiations with KSRTC. “These AC electric buses will have 43 seats. The firm will also deploy a driver and set up charging stations at these locations. The company will run 450km per bus a day. The conductor will be from KSRTC and the fare will be the same as that aboard diesel AC buses,” said a senior KSRTC official. He said converting diesel buses to electric ones will also help reduce operational costs. “The firm will take care of cleaning and maintaining these electric buses. We identified these routes after a proper study. We are hoping these services become popular among people,” he said. This is the first time KSRTC is inducting electric buses. States like Telangana, Maharashtra and Goa are also planning to operate electric buses on long-distance routes. KSRTC has been struggling because of soaring diesel prices. The operational cost of a diesel Volvo bus is Rs 56/km. According to many passengers, environment-friendly buses are the need of the hour. “But they should ensure electric buses are charged to cover long-distance trips. Otherwise, passengers will suffer. Steps should be taken to set up more charging stations en route,” said K Venugopal, a regular KSRTC passenger. BMTC recently began inducting 90 non-AC electric buses on Metro feeder routes using Smart City funds. Separately, it will operate 300 12m electric buses under the FAME II scheme.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/ksrtc-to-run-50-e-buses-on-inter-city-routes-from-april/articleshow/89027514.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||After cabbies, auto drivers oppose bike taxis in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: After cabbies, autorickshaw drivers in the city are opposing bike taxis. On Thursday, auto drivers caught around 30 Rapido bike taxi riders at KSR Bengaluru city railway station and asked police to intervene. Many auto drivers saw the riders booking through the app. “How can the transport department allow these white-board two-wheelers to operate as bike taxis? They are plying without permission. We are not even earning Rs 500 a day due to Covid restrictions, but they are getting Rs 2,000- 3,000 daily without paying taxes,” said Kumar P, an auto driver at the railway station. He said police and the transport department should take action against “illegal” bike taxis. Earlier, cab union leaders had threatened to stop bike taxi services in the city. Rapido, which has been operating non-electric bike taxis since 2016, was unavailable for comments. L Narendra Holkar, additional commissioner of transport (enforcement), said: “We received several complaints from drivers against illegal taxis but our hands are tied. Rapido recently got a stay from the court, so we are unable to take action against them.” In July, the government unveiled the ambitious Karnataka electric bike taxi scheme to allow bike taxis to provide first- and last-mile connectivity, mainly in urban areas, to and from Metro, bus and railway stations. However, only app-based two-wheeler rental firm Bounce, which recently launched Infinity E1 (electric scooters with swappable batteries), has applied so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/after-cabbies-auto-drivers-oppose-bike-taxis-in-city/articleshow/89027515.cms||---

Suma (name changed), a private firm employee, approached police a day after her father Raj (name changed) allegedly assaulted her for not allowing him into her bedroom while she was changing clothes. Suma told police her mother died five years ago and she was living with her father. “My father has been harassing me mentally and sexually for a long time. He used to touch me inappropriately. He even hid in the room and saw me changing clothes. On Monday morning, he forced me to open the door of my room. I resisted and pushed him, and he fell on the floor. Later, he beat me with a wooden stick,” she alleged in her complaint. Suma said she informed a cousin about the incident and he rushed to help her, but Raj allegedly assaulted him too. Raj subsequently threw Suma out of the house. She decided to approach the cops after discussing the matter with some relatives. Police registered a case under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty), 354a (sexual harassment), 354c (voyeurism), and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means).

A special court for PMLCA in Bengaluru granted six-day police custody of Ahmed to ED. He was in judicial custody at Puzhal Central Prison, Chennai, and had been arrested by Chennai Criminal Investigation Department (CID) earlier. In the same case, CID sleuths had, in June 2021, arrested nine persons, including the Chinese wife of Ahmed, for being involved in the Rs 290-crore money-laundering racket. Ahmed was among the suspects named in the FIR and had evaded arrest. Later, he succeeded in getting interim bail. A press note from ED read: “We initiated money-laundering investigation into operations of the accused entities that induced the public to invest certain amounts through Power Bank and other such fraudulent apps by promising to remit interest on daily or weekly basis on the investment made. The accused entities closed their purported business after collecting huge sums of money from the gullible public and went incommunicado. They neither paid interest nor returned the principal amount to the public and withheld the investment, which amounted to cheating.” It added: “Ahmed is partner in two accused firms — H and S Ventures and Clifford Ventures — which collected approximately Rs 84 crore from the public. He has Chinese links and is the suspected kingpin of the racket. Ahmed indulged in corrupt and illegal activities through his partnership firms by deviating from the declared line of business/activity of gaming...” The proceeds generated through the criminal activities were routed out through shell entities and invested in cryptocurrencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bizman-accused-in-mobile-app-fraud-case-in-ed-custody/articleshow/89027523.cms||---

The deadline to respond to the proposed changes is January 25. The proposed changes mean that if the services of the cadre officers are required by the Centre in public interest, the state shall give effect to the decision within the specified time. The officers will stand relieved from the cadre even if the state does not give effect to the decision. “Of course, the TN government will oppose it. The state will send its response in a day or two,” said a senior bureaucrat. Tamil Nadu has its own share of issues with the Centre on transfer of all-India service officers. Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had refused to send some IPS officers on central deputation. A section of TN cadre sees the proposal as contrary to the spirit of all-India service rules. “This amendment can convert the AIS into a central service,” said a senior bureaucrat. The Centre does not take the concurrence of the states for services like revenue or income tax. Bureaucrats are of no two opinions that the Centre needs officers. “But the case of the chief secretary of West Bengal vitiated the environment. A talk between the cabinet secretary and chief secretary should resolve deputation issues,” said a senior bureaucrat. Only 23 TN cadre officers, of 300 are on central deputation now. ‘Faulty policies’, wherein the officer cannot go on deputation if he or she has not worked or is not empanelled at the Centre is also being discussed. “The proposed amendment takes care of only a portion of states’ unwillingness to relieve officers, which may be minuscule compared to officers interested in going, but not empanelled for want of previous work experience at the Centre. The Centre should change the British-era empanelment policy along with this amendment, if it aims to fill vacancies,” said another officer. “In Delhi, most joint-secretary-level posts are being manned by non-IAS officers because of shortage. So, the Centre wants some leverage to take officers on deputation.

Chennai Wildlife warden E Prasant said on January 10, they received a complaint from IIT-M authorities that a monkey had an injury in its belly and was bleeding profusely. A team from the wildlife headquarters range rescued the animal. The monkey was then taken to the Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary on Besant Avenue, where a team of veterinarians found that it had intestinal perforation. A portion of its intestine was damaged. The monkey was sedated and after a scan, the procedure to push the intestine back into its body began. The doctors removed the damaged portions of the intestine and performed an ‘enterectomy and anastomosis’. Under this procedure, intestine is flushed with fluids, which helps it regain its shape. “It took three hours for the doctors to complete the procedure,” Prashant said. It is now ready to be sent back to the Guindy National Park.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/monkey-cured-of-intestinal-injury/articleshow/89027534.cms||P Oppili

Justice S M Subramaniam also made it clear that the club cannot open a permit room, in violation of TNHB rules, on its premises. “In the event of any violation or otherwise, the registration department is empowered to initiate action for cancellation of registration of the club and it is needless to state that the jurisdictional police are also empowered to monitor the activities of the club,” the court said. If any irregularity or illegality is identified, then immediate actions are to be initiated in the manner known to law, the judge added. The court passed the interim order on a plea moved by the club challenging a letter issued by TNHB dated October 26, 2016, demanding immediate payment of the rental arrears for seven grounds of land belonging to the board on which the club is functioning. According to the club, it approached the TNHB for a no-objection certificate (NOC) to open a permit room for its members. While the police had issued the NOC, the board demanded payment of arrears. The club said it had already paid a substantial amount of Rs 20 lakh towards the arrears. Recording the submissions, the judge said, “The club had stated that the TNHB has not granted NOC for running the bar. In the event of no provision under the TNHB Rules for grant of any such NOC for opening a bar they cannot give any NOC at all. Therefore, the actions of the TNHB can never be faulted in this regard.” Further pointing out that the board is collecting only Rs 20,000 a month as rent for such a prime property, the court directed TNHB to fix a fair rent, calculate the arrears as per the new rent within 30 days and communicate the same to the club.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-orders-eviction-notice-on-anna-nagar-club-for-arrears/articleshow/89027535.cms||Suresh Kumar

The state, led by its government counsel, made the submission in view of an allegation made by NGO Arappor Iyakkam that the station has been constructed on a water body. In April 15, 2021, the court had said it could order demolition of the station if it was built on a water body. “We have traced the document pertaining to 1906. Since it is an old document we are trying to obtain a clear copy to be produced before the court,” government counsel said. Recording the submissions, the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu directed the state to ascertain whether a water body can be reclassified in Tamil Nadu. “Some states do not permit such reclassification,” the court said. The court then adjourned the hearing to the first week of February.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-can-a-water-body-in-the-state-be-reclassified/articleshow/89027536.cms||Suresh Kumar

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Repeat entries, missing voters in new electoral rolls||CHENNAI: Several voters have complained that their names are missing from the latest electoral rolls for the upcoming urban local body polls. In ward 130 in Virugambakkam, there are two Abdullah’s, two Chandrans and two Muniammals. In the ward with 1,309 voters, 670 of whom are women and 638 men, activists have found at least seven double entries, each having two voter identity cards. Their addresses are also different. The civic body that released its latest electoral roll recently claimed to have removed 30,156 entries, of which 4,725 had voluntarily submitted form 7 to remove their names that were entered twice. In this list, 2,580 were names of people who are dead and 21,255 people who have changed their address and have received new voter cards. “We keep revising the list. We conduct camps, create awareness using our revenue officials and booth level officials. However, the electoral roll only has names which were present in the election commission rolls. We cannot suo moto remove or add names unless people send us signed forms to do so. We can conduct camps and ask officials to visit homes whenever such cases come up. However, removal or addition cannot take place without the person’s or their family’s consent,” said Vishu Mahajan, deputy commissioner, revenue. K Vishwanathan, a civic activist who went door-to-door to confirm the names in booth number 140 in Virugambakkam, said if the ECI mandates that Aadhar card should be linked to voter cards, then the issue of repeat or double entries can be removed easily. Ma Radhakrishnan, another civic activist, told TOI that bogus votes cannot be polled without the knowledge of booth agents. “In 2011, we had conducted a survey and found many bogus votes. We tried and helped remove many deceased person’s names and repeat entries. I have seen how booth agents block booths in the evening and allow bogus votes to be casted,” he said. As per the latest electoral rolls, Chennai has a total of 40,80,578 voters of which 20,04,860 are men and 20,74,616 are women. The third gender has 1102 voters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/repeat-entries-missing-voters-in-new-electoral-rolls/articleshow/89027538.cms||Komal Gautham

---||Chennai||Illegal transfer of property: Doctor given no breather||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday confirmed an order passed by the Tamil Nadu medical council suspending the licence of a Coimbatore-based doctor who issued a false medical fitness certificate and aided illegal alienation of property worth 50 crore to his son-in-law. “The facts are not only glaring but blatantly shocking. Justice is not blind; her blindfolds only represent impartiality. It is the duty of the court to make sure that the scales are always balanced,” Justice R Mahadevan said. The court passed the order while dismissing a plea moved by doctor S Radhakrishnan challenging the suspension of his licence to practice for two years. The issue pertains to a complaint preferred by S Shri Subhita, daughter of N Pitchaimani (since deceased) whose properties were alienated to the son-in-law of the petitioner. According to the complaint, the alienation was executed based on the medical fitness certificate issued by Radhakrishnan dated October 8, 2015, certifying that her father was fit, sane and conscious enough to execute the alienation. The petitioner said that during the said period her father was admitted in a private hospital and was not conscious and sane enough to understand and execute any legal document. Based on her complaint, the disciplinary committee of the medical council conducted an inquiry and passed an order dated May 4, 2021, suspending the licence of Radhakrishnan. Challenging the suspension, Radhakrishnan contended that there was undue delay in preferring the complaint. He added that the council merely placed reliance on uncorroborated or unsubstantiated allegations of the complainant. The court, however, said, “This court is firm that where the circumstances so warrant, erring medical professionals such as the petitioner must be dealt with in a manner known to law and no misplaced lenience can be shown to such professionals.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/illegal-transfer-of-property-doctor-given-no-breather/articleshow/89027545.cms||---

The numbers have come in at a time when institutional investment in the country's real estate sector slid 14% to $4.3 billion in 2021 from $5 billion in 2020. Hyderabad led the pack with deals worth $687 million in 2021 as against $100 million in 2020, followed by Mumbai Metropolitan Region with deals worth $683 million ($267m in 2020), Delhi NCR with $548 million ($301m) and Bengaluru with $379 million ($3720m) in 2021, as per JLL's `Capital Markets Update Q4 2021'. With this, Hyderabad accounted for 16% share of the institutional investments made in the country's realty sector in 2021 (2% share in 2020) along with Mumbai which also registered a 16% share (5% in 2020) followed by Delhi NCR with 13% share (6% in 2020). While Hyderabad's realty also witnessed the highest jump in institutional investment in 2021 vis a vis the previous year, Bengaluru saw the steepest decline with its share plummeting from 74% in 2020 to just 9% in 2021. According to JLL, Hyderabad has been leading the investment scenario with core and development stage transactions by leading global funds. "The city has been preferred with marquee office space developers attracting quality tenants at the pre-commitment stage. Office supply in 2022 has already witnessed 25% pre-leasing in select projects and driving the investment momentum," it said. Institutional investments include investments by family offices, foreign corporate groups, foreign banks, pension funds, private equity players, real estate fund-cum-developers, foreign funded NBFCs, sovereign wealth funds and anchor investors in REITs, among others. The report pointed out that 2021 also witnessed an overall jump in the number of deals at 57 in the country as compared to 27 deals in 2020. Also, though investments during the year were spread across various sectors and were much more diversified as compared to 2020, the office sector accounted for the largest share of 31% during 2021 with deals worth $1,323 million followed by residential segment with 25% share of the deals pie ($1,081 million), warehousing with 20% share ($866 million) and retail with 13% share ($560 million). "One of the major reasons for the decline in investment volume has been the intermittent breakdown in the investment process due to the severe impact of the second Covid wave during the first half of 2021. Though the investment climate showed signs of recovery during Q3 of 2021, the onset of a new variant and the uncertainty about its impact disrupted deal closures in Q4, 2021," said Lata Pillai, managing director and head, Capital Markets, India, JLL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hyd-realty-pips-top-7-cities-in-institutional-investments-in-21/articleshow/89027548.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

At present, the terminus is functioning from a small piece of land near Vijayanagaram junction. But it is in shambles, and bus movement has become difficult ever since the government started constructing a flyover at this stretch in 2016. There is no space even for passengers to wait until their bus arrives. Since then, residents have appealed to shift the terminus to a new location. The MTC tried to move it near Velachery railway station in 2018. But the attempt could not bear fruit as talks between various government agencies failed. Against this backdrop, the transport corporation is trying to shift operations to another six-acre land near the station (abutting Velachery Bypass Road). "The land has been allotted to us. We are taking steps to pay for the land in instalments," said A Anbu Abraham, managing director of MTC. The land alone might roughly cost ₹38 crore. S Kumararaja, a resident-activist from Velachery, said that MTC said, "If this becomes a reality, not only MTC buses but mofussil services can also be operated from this location. Currently, government mofussil buses to Villupuram, Pudhucherry, and Tiruvannamalai are operated from Adyar. Instead of parking them along congested Indira Nagar roads, operations can be smoother from the proposed site in Velachery". This project, which was launched 10 years ago during the DMK regime, was left in the lurch. Only now, some steps are taken. However, MTC might not have adequate funds to construct a new bus stand or workshop, it can seek financial assistance from Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), he opined. The CMDA, the nodal planning agency, constructed two terminuses at Koyambedu and Kilambakkam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/velachery-bus-terminus-to-be-shifted-near-rly-stn/articleshow/89027549.cms||Ram Sundaram

The corporation had booked one drivers for not closing bus doors which didn’t exist. M N Prakash, driving an MTC bus on route 49 (Thiruvanmiyur-Iyyappanthangal), was issued a memo for working in a negligent manner by keeping the bus doors open. Disciplinary action was initiated against Prakash for putting the lives of passengers at stake and defaming the corporation. But the bus he was driving (TN 01 AN 0505) is 10 years old and has no automatic doors, the Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) said, its banners criticising MTC for baseless charges. It requested action against those framing such false accusations and collecting penalties (from their monthly pay) from employees. When contacted, MTC managing director A Anbu Abraham on Wednesday said, “We have revoked the memo issued now.” R M Swamy of SVS-AAP Transport Workers' Union said this was not an isolated incident. “MTC has continuously taken action against its staff for personal reasons and vengeance. Most of the reasons pointed out are baseless or silly.” Not issuing tickets for women and luggage and mismatch in ticket sales and revenue are the three most common reasons cited while taking such action. After the government announced free travel for women, they tend to not ask conductors for a ticket (indicating zero rupees). While the rule book allows luggage charges only for goods transported for commercial reasons, authorities insist on fare even for personal goods. Conductors have lost years in proving that they were not at fault for a deficit of just three to five rupees during checks, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mtc-driver-booked-for-not-closing-non-existent-doors/articleshow/89027550.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Chennai||Chennai may be near or at peak of third wave: Epidemiologists||CHENNAI: After hovering around 8,000 for five days, fresh cases in Chennai dropped for the third consecutive day on Thursday, when Chennai reported 7520 new cases. Epidemiologists now say that Chennai may be near or in the peak of the third wave, but cases must continue to drop for a few more days before they can declare that the hotspot city has crossed the hump. The effective reproduction number (R-naught) — one of the key epidemiological factors — has been steadily dropping since the first week of January. R-naught indicates how many new cases one infected person generates. On December 21, when Chennai reported around 130 new cases, the R-naught was 1.2 and by December 31 when the infections increased to more than 500 cases a day, R-naught was 3.8. “If the R0 is three, then we would expect each new case of a disease to produce three other infections. With any R value greater than 1 the infection will increase, spreading through the population,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur. As cases began to stabilise, the number has now dropped to 1.3. Health officials say the drop is good news as they are beginning to see a drop-in test positivity rate and a decreased growth rate of daily infections. At the peak of the second wave, senior virologist Dr T Jacob John pointed out the first indicator of the epidemic curve falling in the drop in the infection growth rate. “When the infection starts falling, fresh cases will begin to fall followed by active cases and death. So when cases begin to fall you may actually see an increase in deaths,” he said. On January 15, the city added six covid deaths to its registry, two days later it increased to nine. On Wednesday it was 12 and on Tuesday it was 14. More than 80% of the deaths were among people above 60 years. This trend is repeating. Analysis by the public health and corporation officials showed signs of early dip for comparable testing. “We have not reduced testing. Although the average TPR is still above 20%, we are beginning to see a small but consistent drop in the daily test positivity rate,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. On January 15, results of at least 30 out of every 100 people tested positive returned negative. The next day it dropped to 29.7% and on Wednesday it was 27.4%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/city-may-be-near-or-at-peak-of-3rd-wave-epidemiologists/articleshow/89027554.cms||---

After Chennai and Coimbatore, Chengalpet reported 2,196 new cases and Kanyakumari reported 1,148 new cases. With 123 new cases Perambalur had the least number of new cases followed by Sivaganga (138) and Ariyalur (145).

The IMD has forecast that these conditions will continue for at least two days, with temperatures being slightly different from the normal. Weather bloggers, however, said minimum temperature may rise by weekend with a change in wind directions. For the next 48 hours, the IMD has forecast the maximum and minimum temperatures to be around 30 degree C and 20 degree C in the city and suburbs, with skies being partly cloudy. “Normally, when the sea surface temperatures are high and easterlies move in, they bring in moisture. Such conditions are absent now,” said an officer at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai. Experts said the absence of warm easterly winds and the presence of a high-pressure zone in the upper atmosphere sending dry cold winds have caused the minimum temperature to drop slightly in the past two days. On Thursday, Nungambakkam recorded a maximum of 30.2 degree C, which was 1 degree above the normal, and a minimum of 20.6 degree C, which was 0.6 degree C below the normal. Meenambakkam registered 30.1 degree C during the day, which was 0.7 above the normal, and 20 degree C before sunrise, which was 0.7 degree C below the normal. The city received 161% excess rainfall with 52.5mm against a normal 20.1mm this month and weather watchers say the rainy season may be over. “From Saturday, minimum temperature may be above 20 degree C, but days will continue to be pleasant . Models show some rainfall by mid-February, which is rare,” said blogger Pradeep John.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/more-pleasant-days-nippy-nights-likely-as-temp-drops/articleshow/89027557.cms||---

The district recorded 3,889 cases as on Wednesday. The 24x7 OPDs are at the district hospital, KIMS, Railway Hospital, Chitaguppi Hospital, ESI Hospital, and in Covid care centres in the Hubballi Anjuman Hostel, Dr B R Ambedkar Community Hall of Sangolli Rayanna Nagar and Morarji Desai Residential School, Anchatgeri, deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said. Sources said that many symptomatic and asymptomatic people were roaming about in the city, spreading the virus among others. The district administration has started the OPDs and fever clinics so that timely tests, treatment and medicines can be given to suspected persons round the clock. Besides, the number of OPD counters in the civil hospital has also been increased for non-Covid patients. Patil told TOI: “We had already started the 24x7 swab collection centres three days back and now we have also started 24x7 OPDs and fever clinics in eight places to encourage more and more people with symptoms to undergo tests and get treatment immediately. These OPDs are meant for both infected people and those who suspect they have an infection.” Round-the-clock fever clinics have been set up at KIMS, the District Civil Hospital in Dharwad, the Chitaguppi Hospital, ESI Hospital, Railway Hospital and SDM Hospital where swab samples will be collected, he said. Patil added that the number of swab collection counters have been increased in the district hospital, KIMS and other centres in the city to avoid crowding. There are 58 collection counters now. Five vehicles are dedicated for swab collection and testing. He appealed to people to cooperate with the district administration to undergo tests and take immediate medicines to curb the virus in the district. District surgeon Dr Shivakumar Manakar said: “We have also made arrangements to provide treatment to non-Covid patients from 8 am to 4.30 pm by increasing counters in the OPD. We have also made separate counters for children and pregnant women to avoid crowds,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/24x7-opds-fever-clinics-start-to-check-covid-infection-rate/articleshow/89025509.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

Diginoor, which launched in 2021 with Rajinikanth movie NFTs, aims to make NFT adoption mainstream in India with curated Indian entertainment content adapted for the web 3.0 space. Some of their partners already include India’s oldest and largest production houses like AVM Productions, Reliance Entertainment and a host of other major studios. The company said it was also the first to introduce the option to buy NFTs using debit and credit cards — a first in the industry. NFTs (Non fungible tokens) are digital representations/assets representing real-world objects like art, music, videos, etc. and have recently taken the tech world by storm. “We plan on using these funds to hire a talented team across functions and tap into the plethora of content in the Indian media industry,” co-founder of Diginoor, Shaamil Karim said. “We’re here to build the web 3.0 revolution, homegrown out of India, through cinema & gaming. We’re building exciting projects at Diginoor using NFTs and smart contract-powered decentralized gaming,” co-founder, Diginoor, Yash Rathod said.  Both Karim and Rathod graduated from Sishya School in 2021. Shaamil is a computer science student at an Ivy League institute - Dartmouth College and Yash is a computer science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. They’re both currently on a break from university pursuing Diginoor full-time. “We're currently on academic leave from our colleges to pursue Diginoor. In recent times, colleges have been more flexible and supportive of taking breaks to pursue entrepreneurial ventures,” Karim said. The duo said they intend to give 100% of their time to building Diginoor ‘while continuing to quench [their] thirst for knowledge through traditional or new forms of learning.’ Diginoor has sold out its first NFT collection from the Rajinikanth starrer ‘Sivaji’. They recently launched NFTs from ‘Chandramukhi’ and ‘Kabali’ as well which included songs from AR Rahman and metaverse versions of movie set props. It also plans to start selling Bollywood NFTs along with exclusive music and celebrity NFTs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/chennai-teen-entrepreneurs-raise-1-mn-for-nft-venture/articleshow/89025767.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The Rs 165 crore facility, which has come up over 30 acres in the electronics manufacturing cluster, Tirupati is expected to move into commercial production in the first quarter of the next financial year.  It will be the first manufacturing facility for Lithium cells in India to go into commercial production and will make cells for consumer electronics industry. “Most of the machines have arrived from overseas. Due to Covid restrictions, we debugged all the machines in China itself to ensure quick shift from trial run to commercial production. This project is in true sense is a make in India, since most other projects are banking on mere assembling in the country,” Jaswant Munoth, vice chairman and director, Munoth Industries told TOI. Munoth Industries has joined hands with Tianjin Lishen from China and a top five player in the world as its technology partner. It also worked closely with Chennai-based CSIR – CICRI to fine tune the technology. The installed capacity of the plant is 270MW hour of cells and the company will cater to 40% of power bank cell requirements which will be fully import substitution. The 16,000 sq m factory building is fully airconditioned and with controlled atmosphere. — D Govardan “This is just the first phase as we plan to scale up and become a GW hour factory in next couple of years and list the company,” said Munoth, who is a member of the expert review committee for Centre of Excellence RBT (Pre Cell), MEITY, Government of India.

For the calendar year 2021, market share of standalone health insurance companies increased to 8.8% from 7.3% at the end of 2020. In the same period, the state-owned or PSU non-life insurance companies’ share stayed flat at 42.2% as of December 2021, from 42.9% in December, 2020. Share of specialized PSU insurers also saw marginally decline to 6.6% from 6.7% a year ago. Under the non-life insurance category, private insurance companies such as ICICI Lombard grew its market share from 7.2% to 8.26%. In 2021, the only PSU insurer who bucked the trend and grew its market share was The New India Assurance Company Limited from 14.6% to 15.8% This growth is largely attributed to scaling of health insurance business by privately owned players like ICICI Lombard, whose strategy to hire 1,000 employees to develop its retail health insurance business is good for the long term. A research report of Kotak institutional equities said health Insurance would see sustained growth in premium and claims ratio to rise from January, 2022. Overall, premium underwritten in 2021 by non-life insurance companies grew by 11.18% at Rs 1,61,081 crore. A senior official from the General Insurance Council says we have seen aggressive business expansion approach from private insurance companies, especially with increased digital adoption among consumers. They have also gained credibility among the users who now purchase on online platform in the last few years. This is besides, continuous growth seen in distribution models such as bancassurance and agency models. He added, health insurance business has contributed to this market share growth for private players, especially since the pandemic outbreak. The industry is now seeing some pick up in fire and property insurance with resumption of production activities in the second half of 2021. However, motor or vehicle insurance business has slowed down since last two years, with reduced sales.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/standalone-health-insurance-cos-gain-mktshare-by-120-bps-in-2021/articleshow/89025830.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Business||HUL Q3 net up 17% at Rs 2,243cr amid inflation||Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has reported a 17% growth in standalone profit after tax at Rs 2,243 crore during the third quarter ended December 31, 2021, as compared to Rs 1,921 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Domestic consumer growth was at 11%, driven by product price increases to offset inflationary pressures, with total income rising 10% to Rs 13,183 crore. However, the company’s strategy to combat input cost pressures through grammage reduction on certain product packs impacted its volume growth, with rural markets now in negative volume growth terrain. Almost 30% of HUL’s business comes from such low price point packs of Re 1, 5 & 10, which largely get consumed in rural India. Consequently, the underlying volume growth at 2% is the lowest that HUL has seen in a quarter since July-September of 2020 when it grew at 1% year-on-year (YoY) to mark a revival after the first wave of Covid. HUL said the 2% volume growth in the latest December quarter was ahead of the FMCG market, which is considered to be the barometer for the economy. Commodity headwinds continue to be a significant challenge. HUL’s CMD Sanjiv Mehta said he expects a moderation in inflation in the second half of this calendar year. “We have not seen inflation like this in many years. This is absolutely unprecedented. And it’s a global phenomenon,” he said at a virtual media meet. Mehta said while FMCG price increase has a minimal impact on people with higher living standards, there is a large number of consumers who have a limited income. “It is very clear that the only way for the rural consumers to cope with this kind of inflation is by getting more money in their hands. This could be done through various interventions. I believe that all the relief provided by the government in the last two years is something which ought to be extended in the new fiscal year, because the economy is still in the process of recovery,” said Mehta. HUL said it continues to manage the business dynamically, driving savings harder across all lines of P&L and taking calibrated pricing actions using the principles of net revenue management. Mehta said, “We have delivered a strong and resilient performance in the quarter despite moderation in market growth and significant levels of commodity inflation. I am particularly pleased that the growth is extremely competitive with our market share gains being highest in more than a decade.” The market share gains, said Mehta, are both in value and volume terms. However, the near-term, operating environment will continue to remain challenging. Calibrated pricing actions are expected to continue. Overall, ebitda margin at 25.4% improved YoY 100 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). The company cut its advertising and promotional spends by 14% to Rs 1,189 crore during the quarter. Among its portfolio of categories, growth in home care was at 23%, beauty & personal care 7%, and food & refreshment 3%. What clearly reveals a demand revival is that the discretionary part of the portfolio, which was impacted due to Covid, reported 5% growth in the December quarter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hul-q3-net-up-17-at-rs-2243cr-amid-inflation/articleshow/89026399.cms||---

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for Bajaj Finance and insurance subsidiaries. The company said that the consolidated profit would have been 43% higher if the marked-to-market losses for insurance subsidiaries were to be excluded. The company said that under the Indian Accounting System, insurance subsidiaries have chosen to hold a large part of the equity securities portfolio as fair value through profit and loss. As a result there is an impact on consolidated profit. Bajaj Finance had reported an 85% jump in consolidated profit-after-tax of Rs 2,125 crore compared to Rs 1,146 crore in the third quarter last year. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance’s profit-after-tax fell marginally to Rs 304 crore in Q3 FY22 as compared to Rs 330 crore in Q3 FY21. “Consolidated top line growth came healthy at around 10.4% year on year to Rs 17,620 crore, owing to strong revival in lending business and healthy performance in life insurance premium off-take. Lower provisioning in the lending business was partially offset by lower profitability in the insurance business,” ICICI Securities said in a research note.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bajaj-finserv-net-drops-3-to-rs-1256-crore/articleshow/89026055.cms||Mayur Shetty

The company said in an exchange filing, “We refute the allegations by the outgoing directors, which were due to our adherence to best corporate governance practices under the guidance of promoter, regulator and the government of India. The matter will be addressed at the board level and an update will be communicated to all stakeholders appropriately.” The independent directors were former LIC MD Thomas Matthew T, Kamlesh Shivji Vikamsey and Santosh B Nayar. One of the outgoing directors, Mathew, said in his letter that the MD did not allow Ratnesh to function as director finance and CFO despite his appointment being done following a board process. “Only on January 10, 2022, we were informed by the company secretary that Ratnesh had rejoined NTPC on December 6, 2021. No explanations were given as to why he re-joined NTPC and the circumstances that led to his returning to NTPC,” the letter said. Mathew also said that there were issues regarding a loan to NSL Nagapatnam Power & Infratech, which was headed for insolvency. He said that the management had held back a forensic report on the company for more than two years. Subsequently, a two-member committee looking into this non-disclosure recommended that the loan account be reported to the RBI as suspected fraud. In addition to these issues, he had highlighted other transactions where the board members had concern over the performance of the company’s management.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ind-directors-quit-ptcs-finance-arm/articleshow/89026341.cms||---
---||Business||Moody’s: LIC IPO to boost transparency, governance||MUMBAI: The listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and other government-owned non-life companies will bring about reforms in terms of better focus on underwriting & products, transparency, governance and risk management, according to Moody’s. In an interview with TOI, Moody’s vice-president and senior analyst Mohammed Ali Londe said that any change that the initial public offering (IPO) will bring about in LIC would have an impact on the wider market as well because of the corporation’s 70% market share. “What we have seen elsewhere in terms of what happens after large IPOs is that the governance standards run through and through — the credit profile, the business they select and how they manage the assets and the risks. It becomes much more advanced or sophisticated,” said Londe. He added that the benefits of listings would outweigh the pressures to focus on short-term on quarterly results. “I think what governance and focus on risk management does is that in terms of risk management heat map it brings all the risks on the table, whether it is short-term or long-term,” said Londe. According to him, the three unlisted non-life insurers, which have been under pressure, have displayed an improvement in performance after a capital infusion by the government a couple of years ago. In March 2018, the state-owned non-life insurers had 46% of premium but 84% of underwriting losses. “Our figures show that as of March 2021, it dropped to 67% of underwriting losses, and for FY22 until June 2021 they were only 57% of underwriting losses,” he added. Moody’s sees pricing inadequacy as a key driver for the weakness that was there among public sector non-life insurers. However, there has been a renewed focus on underwriting after the capital injection and this has an overall impact on the market in terms of competitive pricing. Moody’s sees an opportunity for the state-owned insurers to hold on to market share given that there is a lot of room for growth and the companies have an advantage in terms of geographical penetration and brand. “They can make the retail segments tech-savvy through digitalisation and reduce acquisition costs to make it more profitable,” said Londe.While reforms in terms of listing, consolidation, or consolidating with an entity with better governance would be beneficial, a consolidation would only work if there were synergies to be had in terms of geographies, lines of business or operations. “If those synergies are to be had, then consolidation will make sense by going ahead and driving force to overcome operational hurdles. If those synergies are not available, we have seen a lot of M&A transactions fall through,” said Londe. Moody’s sees the pandemic as being a big driver for the health and term insurance business, but expects the property and casualty business to pick up as economic activity gathers steam and more investments are made in metros, roads and other projects.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/moodys-lic-ipo-to-boost-transparency-governance/articleshow/89026425.cms||Mayur Shetty

Co gets approval for trademark||MUMBAI/CHENNAI: After planning a foray into the steel industry, Gautam Adani, India’s second-richest person and head of the eponymous Adani Group, appears to be looking to enter the automobile sector. Group entity S B Adani Trust received trademark approval to use the name ‘Adani’ for vehicles operating on land and in water. The move is part of the ports-to-power conglomerate’s broader play in green projects. The plan is to enter the electric mobility space, said sources. It will look at electric commercial vehicles — coaches, buses and trucks — to begin with. It will initially use them for its in-house requirements in airports, ports and for other logistics purposes. It also has plans to manufacture electric vehicle batteries and set up charging stations across the country. Recently, the government, in a bid to power up the electric vehicle-charging ecosystem, decided to offer land to private entities to install charging stations on a revenue-sharing basis. The infrastructure conglomerate also plans to establish an R&D centre in its special economic zone (SEZ) in Mundra, Gujarat, for its proposed play in electric mobility. The move pits the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate against the Tata Group and Reliance Industries, which too have ambitious plans in low-carbon projects. Auto industry watchers said Adani’s entry into electric commercial vehicles will shake up the scene. “I am not aware of Adani’s plans, but it’s great to see large conglomerates getting into electric vehicles,” said Sun Mobility co-founder and vice-chairman Chetan Maini. Currently, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland control the last-mile and first-mile connectivity segment with the Ace and Dost brands. Light and medium cargo carriers are rapidly electrifying because the per-km cost of operation of an e-LCV (light commercial vehicle) is 80 paise compared to Rs 4 for a diesel vehicle. State and ‘Fame 2’ subsidies have also brought down the capital cost. The other big bang segment is buses, particularly with Convergence Energy Services conducting a combined tender for 5,450 single-decker and 130 double-decker e-buses for cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Surat, Hyderabad and Kolkata. With battery prices expected to fall below $100 in 12-18 months, the game will get more competitive. Battery prices have come down from $1,300-1,400 per kilowatt hour nearly 18 years ago to $110-120 now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-vehicles-co-gets-approval-for-trademark/articleshow/89026433.cms||Reeba Zachariah

According to FACE, its member companies cater to more than half of the consumer lending market volumes in India. The organisation is already working with regulators, stakeholders, industry players and other consumer groups on measures to promote consumer empowerment, including financial literacy and consumer protection. FACE members came together after digital lending faced a regulatory backlash in the wake of, what it describes as, “fringe elements hurting consumer trust in the system”. The application comes after the RBI sought suggestions from industry groups to enforce regulations for digital lending platforms to curb illegal apps. “We at FACE intend to work with the RBI and all official stakeholders to promote responsible lending, which will uphold ethical lending practices, data security, cyber security, consumer privacy and to weed out predatory lenders,” said Ram Rastogi, governance council member at FACE. “With our expertise and collective addressable market, we believe FACE is well prepared to take on the task of a formal self-regulatory body, that can promote and refine practices and streamline the sector, with guidance from the RBI,” Rastogi added. FACE was formed as a not-for-profit industry association in September 2020 to drive ethical lending practices among the Indian fintech sector and establish thought leadership in consumer finance. According to its website, members include EarlySalary, Kissht, Loantap, Cashe, KreditBee, PaySense and CredAvenue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fintechs-seek-self-regulatory-status-from-rbi/articleshow/89026389.cms||---

While the NFHS recently detailed how India’s total fertility rate has fallen below 2.1 for the first time (2.1 being the benchmark replacement rate), factors such as maternal health, fertility, nutrition, women’s empowerment and digital uptake also have a direct impact on the baby and mother care market. For one, 70% women are now going for an antenatal check-up in the first trimester, which has increased significantly since 2015-2016 (about 59%), while 78% women have got postnatal care within 2 days of delivery. Key segments of the baby care market — including toiletries, diapers, apparel and toys — are said to be growing at 13-14% per annum, with baby care makers expanding their reach and beefing up their digital capabilities. “India has the lowest per capita consumption of baby care products and thus it presents a lot of scope for growth,” said Sakshi Mody, promoter of JL Morison (JLM). “Similarly, the penetration of baby care products is also very low as compared to nations like China, Brazil and Russia. So, there is a lot of scope for growth — both through width and depth expansion,” said Mody, while adding that India will remain in the high-growth phase for the baby care industry for 10 years. Kimberly-Clark India MD Mainak Dhar said, “While current reports indicate that the country is witnessing a dip in population growth rate, there are significant opportunities for the continued growth of the baby care market as category penetration continues to rise and consumers trade up within established categories. We believe that the baby care market will continue to evolve.” The growing working woman population is said to be a big driver of baby care category growth. Further, the digital revolution has been a growth enabler for the industry, with 33% women (urban+rural) and 52% urban women having internet access. However, the working woman population took a slight beating since the pandemic. JLM’s VP (sales & marketing) Nitin Manchanda said, although this has not had a direct effect on the market, “we have seen some shifts happening from premium segment to mass segment, which seem to be temporary”. He added, “Downtrading happens in all the categories when there is pressure on income and we have seen this happening in the baby care segment as well. The hypothesis is that with the economy coming back on track, there will be a reversal in 2 to 3 quarters.” JLM, which operates in the mass segment with its brand Morisons Baby Dreams, has strengthened its distribution reach by more than 50% in the last 2 years. “JLM products are available in 1 lakh outlets across India. We are continuing our efforts in enhancing our reach every year,” said Manchanda. To increase the penetration of the category, JLM has also launched smaller value-add packs to spur higher trials. Kimberly-Clark India too is stepping up its digital capabilities to engage with consumers. Dhar said the pandemic brought in a new wave of awareness among parents who became more conscious about meeting the needs of their babies, laying greater emphasis on comfort and convenience. It also gave rise to changes in shopping behaviour, such as an increasing reliance on online shopping. “Consumers have become more conscious about the importance of health and hygiene and are turning to trusted brands that can meet their needs. There has been growth across different segments in the baby care category and Huggies has a broad portfolio, catering to different consumer needs, price points, and sizes to meet consumer expectations across these segments,” said Dhar. Over the last two years, with travel restrictions coming into play and people spending more time at home, Dhar said there has been a significant change in the purchasing behaviour of the consumer, with accelerated adoption of online shopping. “In parallel, social media has become a key platform of engagement for our target audience wherein new age parents are seeking curated information on parenting and baby care. We recognise the need to create relevant consumer experiences using these platforms and have designed robust social media campaigns, as well as forged partnerships to engage and stay connected with our consumers,” said Dhar. According to NFHS, the number of currently married women who usually participate in decisions like those relating to personal healthcare or household purchases has inched up to about 89% in 2019-20 from 84% in 2015-2016.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/baby-care-mkt-to-boom-despite-population-dip/articleshow/89026244.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Business||Sensex tanks 634 points, loses 1.8k in 3 days||MUMBAI: Strong selling in Reliance Industries and leading software exporters dragged the sensex down by 634 points to 59,465 as fears about commodity inflation and rising crude prices hurt investor sentiment. In the last three sessions, the sensex has lost over 1,800 points. On Thursday, investors became poorer by Rs 1.4 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation at Rs 276.2 lakh crore, official data showed. Rising inflation in the US may force its central bank to raise rates aggressively, in turn choking the easy availability of funds for investors to invest globally, market players said. The rising fears about a rate hike by the US Fed is also forcing foreign fund managers to take some money off emerging markets like India, they said. This is reflected in the daily trading data by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) that net sold stocks worth Rs 4,680 crore on Thursday, BSE data showed. So far in the month, FPIs have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 8,700 crore, data from BSE and CDSL together showed. On Dalal Street, Thursday’s session started flat but lost ground through the day with the intra-day low at 59,068. But bargain hunting at the day’s low helped the index regain some lost ground and close nearly 400 points off the intra-day trough. According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, continuing concerns over global inflation and likely US Fed rate hike acted as major headwinds for the domestic market on Thursday to tumble for the third consecutive day. “High volatility due to rising bond yields is pressuring foreign investors to pull out funds from highly valued markets like India. As the recent earnings failed to excite the market, the on-going global volatility drained investor confidence,” Nair wrote in his post-market note.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-tanks-634-pts-loses-1-8k-in-3-days/articleshow/89026225.cms||---
---||Delhi||Pedestrians, bikers biggest victims of road accidents in Delhi in 2021||NEW DELHI: Pedestrians and two-wheeler riders were the biggest victims of road accidents in the city last year, Delhi Traffic Police data has revealed. Most of the accidents were caused by private cars and heavy transport vehicles. The total number of road accidents saw a rise of around 12% in 2021 compared with the previous year. Senior traffic police officers said the primary causes of accidents were human factors, vehicles, infrastructure and environment. Last year, 4,720 accidents were reported in the city out of which 1,239 were fatal. In 2020, despite a lockdown, 1,196 people were killed in fatal accidents. There were three major causes of road accidents : human, infrastructure and vehicles. “When we say human error, we mean it could be the driver’s fault or the victim’s. Apart from this road environment, faulty designs, such as no central verge, potholes, sharp curves, inadequate facilities for pedestrian crossing and vehicle issues, were three major factors,” said a traffic officer. According to the data, 59 two-wheeler deaths were caused by private cars last year. The number of those killed in two-wheeler accidents rose from 441 in 2020 to 471 in 2021. Last year, 471 two-wheeler riders were killed compared with 441 in 2020, showing a marginal rise of around 6%. On the other hand, the number of injured in two-wheeler accidents rose from 1,613 in 2020 to 1,866 in 2021, a rise of around 15%. A senior traffic officer said most two-wheeler riders died after being hit by private cars. “The number also saw a slight rise from 2020 compared with 2021. Private cars were involved in 59 accidents in 2021 and 51 accidents the year before. Similarly, buses were involved in 30 accidents in 2021 compared with 22 in 2020,” he added. “In some scenarios, we saw that those behind the wheel were either drunk or driving rashly. But in some cases we saw that two-wheeler riders didn’t have proper headgear. Since the maximum number of people in the city use two-wheelers, they must ensure wearing proper headgear to ensure their safety,” said the traffic officer. Piyush Tewari, CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, said, “Unfortunately in our country, hundreds of people die in two-wheeler-related crashes every day. In fact, if we look at the mortality burden due to road crashes, two-wheeler users are the biggest victim category nationally and they face high exposure to risk, either due to lack of infrastructure or due to reckless driving on part of the driver of the offending vehicle. If we look at the data for 53 megacities from National Crime Records Bureau, Delhi has the highest number of deaths due to dangerous and reckless driving.” “Strengthening the implementation of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act and ensuring enforcement of drink-driving provision by using any standardised field sobriety test can go a long way in preventing such road crash deaths. Two-wheeler users are the most vulnerable and face high-risk exposure,” added Tewari. In Delhi, data suggests that around 40 two-wheeler users die every month. “It’s important that vulnerable road users are segregated and provided safe access. Also, forensic investigation of the crash to understand and mitigate causal factors can help improve the safety for all vulnerable road users,” Tewari said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pedestrians-bikers-biggest-accident-victims/articleshow/89026370.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Delhi||Delhi: For this grandmother, fresh paint can’t hide riot scars||NEW DELHI: Manori dreads knocks on her door after sunset. She shivers to recall the night when her house in northeast Delhi was set ablaze and her belongings, including her buffalo, carried off by rioters in February 2020.  “There was a time when men and women gathered outside my house to talk and relax, but now we shut our doors as soon as the sun sets,” said the 75-year-old “And every time a fight breaks out or we hear sloganeering, we prepare to flee our house because we don’t know what will happen.” Manori was affectionately known in the locality as bhains wali amma for the buffalo milk she sold. But there is a change now. “Ab woh pyaar nahi raha. Ek time par aurate roti bhi yahi khaati thi aur ab aati bhi nahi na bolti (The bond has vanished. Once women used to come and eat at my house, now they don’t even speak to us),” shrugged Manori. The old woman’s two-storey house has been repaired and repainted by an NGO, though some scars of the flames still remain on the walls. She stays there with her daughter and her two grown-up grandchildren. A lock remains the only memento of the earlier life. “My mother got the lock when she got married. I was born in 1947 so it dates back to even before that,” the old woman remembered. “The men who looted my house tried to break this lock when we were hiding in the neighbour’s house. We could hear them cursing when they couldn’t break it. They eventually opened another lock on the staircase and entered my house. This lock is special to me.” It is no longer usable, but Manori passionately holds on to it. Recalling the fateful February 25 evening, Manori said, “I had just milked the buffalo when it dawned on us that our house would be the next target of the mob. We escaped by hiding in our neighbour’s house and then stayed for a month at a relative’s house in Loni.” She said the looters hadn’t left anything behind in the house. “From the 20kg of wheat and the 16 litres of milk to the utensils, even my milk bucket, they took everything,” said Manori. The family had put the buffalo and the calf in the rear room and blocked the door with a bed. “Imagine, they made the buffalo and the calf climb over the bed and took them away. The buffalo we bought with a hard-earned one lakh rupees was gone, depriving us of our only source of income. The government gave us a compensation of Rs 50,000, but that money ran out during the lockdown.” When asked about riot-accused Dinesh Yadav’s sentencing, the septuagenarian said, “I am unaware of the development.” Amid the painful memories, she smiles wanly, “Even though I have lost my buffalo, I continue to be known as bhains wali amma.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/for-this-grandmother-fresh-paint-cant-hide-riot-scars/articleshow/89026842.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Illegal resorts, hotels in core heritage zone of Hampi shut; owners allege bias||HAMPI (VIJAYANAGARA): Acting on multiple complaints against resorts operating illegally near the ruins of the mediaeval metropolis, the Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority (HWAMA) sealed more than 53 commercial establishments. All of these establishments were situated within the core zone on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River. The owners of these establishments, who are all understandably upset, have pointed out that the HWAMA has not initiated action against resorts, hotels, et al, operating illegally on the southern banks of the river. The owners have called on the HWAMA to be bipartisan in the dispensation of its duties, and demanded that establishments operating illegally in the core heritage zone on the southern banks of the Tungabhadra be closed as well. Sources said that many illegal resorts and hotels had been set up without requisite permission in Kaddiramapur, Kamalapur and other villages on the southern banks of the river, which fall under the purview of the core heritage zone. “Many of these establishments are set up on farmland that is not converted, and without obtaining permission from the competent authorities. However, the HWAMA has not initiated action against these establishments,” said a source. The owner of a hotel in Sanapur in Gangavati taluk that was recently forced shut by the HWAMA questioned the agency’s discriminatory attitude towards establishments on the other side of the river. “HWAMA officials and authorities of the revenue department ordered us to shut shop, and we raised no objection since this was the law. But the HWAMA appears to be blind to the commercial activities being conducted in violation of the same rules on the southern banks of the river. If the heritage authority is really concerned about the sanctity of Hampi, then it must close all illegal establishments,” the owner said. Commissioner of HWAMA Siddarameshwar Hiremath said that they had identified 14 resorts operating illegally on farmland on the southern banks of Tungabhadra. “We will not allow establishments to operate illegally within the heritage zone. There is no question of our being biased. We will initiate action against all illegal resorts and hotels without delay,” said Hiremath. Chairman of HWAMA Aniruddha Shravan, also the deputy commissioner of Vijayanagara district, said that more than 50 illegal commercial establishments in Gangavati taluk, and we will initiate action in all places surrounding Hosapete at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/illegal-resorts-hotels-in-core-heritage-zone-of-hampi-shut-owners-allege-bias/articleshow/89025706.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

Sarita Arya, the former women's cell chief of Uttarakhand Congress, has been fielded from the Nainital seat. She left Congress earlier this week after being denied a poll ticket by the opposition party. Similarly, Durgeshwar Lal, who joined the BJP on Thursday, hours before the party released its first list, has been given a ticket from Purola assembly seat. This has come as a major setback for incumbent Purola MLA Rajkumar, who left Congress in September last year to join the saffron party. Ram Singh Kaira, who also switched his loyalty from Congress to BJP last year, has been fielded from Bhimtal. Meanwhile, Pritam Singh Panwar, an Independent MLA who joined BJP in 2021, has been given the party ticket from his Dhanaulti constituency. For the Yamkeshwar seat, BJP has decided to replace sitting MLA Ritu Khanduri, daughter of former state chief minister BC Khanduri, with Renu Bisht, who joined the party last year after leaving Congress. Requesting anonymity, a senior BJP leader said that the party was forced to change the candidate in Yamkeshwar to mitigate anti-incumbency against the sitting MLA. Besides Ritu Khanduri, BJP has dropped nine other sitting MLAs from its first list. The most prominent among them is Khanpur MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh ‘Champion’, who was expelled from the BJP for a while in 2019 after his gun-brandishing video went viral. This time, the party has fielded his wife, Kunwarani Devyani Singh, from Khanpur. The party has also dropped Dwarahat MLA Mahesh Negi, who has been accused of rape, from its first list. He has been replaced by Anil Shahi. Also, Kashipur MLA Harbhajan Singh Cheema has been replaced by his son Trilok Singh Cheema. Other sitting MLAs who failed to secure a party ticket this time are Munni Devi from Tharali, Surendra Singh Negi from Karnaprayag, Mukesh Singh Koli from Pauri, Meena Gangola from Gangolihat, Balwant Singh Bhauyal from Kapkot and Raghunath Singh Chauhan from Almora. While the BJP is yet to announce names for 11 assembly seats, it is already known that the party would select two new faces for Kotdwar and Doiwala seats as the incumbent Kotdwar MLA Harak Singh Rawat has been expelled from the BJP for anti-party activities, and Doiwala MLA and former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced that he won’t contest assembly polls this time. The BJP had won 57 out of 70 assembly seats in Uttarakhand in 2017.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cong-defectors-headline-bjps-first-ukhand-list/articleshow/89025118.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The move comes at a time when awareness about having an insurance cover for protection from uncertainties such as the pandemic has hit a high. Future Generali India Insurance MD & CEO Anup Rau said the government can consider increasing the limit for health cover under section 80D from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh for self and family as it can help in deepening penetration of this category. Budget 2022 expectations: Take this survey to let FM know what you think“Rising medical costs and the increase in the incidence of critical illnesses make it an unmanageable expense for middle-income and lower-income groups. So, a higher tax deduction limit for health insurance plans is the need,” he said. Meanwhile, on the life front, Edelweiss Tokio Life Insurance ED Subhrajit Mukhopadhyay mooted that premium paid for this product must not be clubbed with other investments that are eligible for deduction under the 80C provision. Instead, the government must come up with a separate provision for this category. “Life insurance is a long-term solution, unlike other financial products which have a shorter investment horizon and are covered under the 80C provision. Currently, all financial purchases are clubbed under the same I-T deduction section (80C) capped at Rs 1.5 lakh. We expect the Budget to consider creating a separate section for tax deduction on premium paid towards life insurance,” he said. He also suggested that special incentives be considered for women who currently account for barely over one-third of the country’s life insurance covers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insurers-seek-more-tax-sops-to-up-coverage/articleshow/89027575.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Hyderabad||CCMB develops cancer cure from turmeric||HYDERABAD: In a novel therapy, CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology( CCMB) developed nano-curcumin structures derived from turmeric for cancer cure. The nano-curcumin structure encapsulates the RNAi and other molecules that aid in targeting specific tissues. RNA interference (RNAi), a gene silencing approach, is a promising tool for targeted and focused therapy for chronic diseases like cancer. So far, the lack of safe and effective delivery methods for RNAi molecules is one of the key challenges against using the RNAi-based therapy. Dr. Lekha Dinesh Kumar and her group at CSIR-CCMB, in collaboration with the Polymer Science and Engineering Division at CSIR-NCL, have developed the novel method. Dr Dinesh Kumar said,“The proposed bio-drug is non-toxic and bio-compatible with a higher uptake efficiency and shows effective site-specific delivery with regression of tumors in two different mouse models of colon and breast cancer. The use of curcumin, a well-known nutraceutical with high anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties with RNAi showed tumor retardation with six months survival in aggressive models of colon and breast cancer.” The research has been published in the journal Nanoscale. In another study with the School of Nanosciences, Central University Gujarat and other agencies, scientists designed an eco-friendly dietary fibre inulin-based nanodevice to target colon cancer. This device suggests the possibility of substituting synthetic substances with natural compounds in bio-drug formulations for better biodegradability, tissue accumulation, and lesser toxicity. Dr. Kumar said, “In our studies, we have demonstrated that RNAi combined with appropriate targeting agents and encapsulations made of natural biomaterials have high translational capacity in mice models of cancer. This group of bio-drugs can revolutionize the field of cancer therapeutics in the future. It should be assessed in other cancer model systems to bring out the utility of these therapeutics in the clinical trials.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ccmb-develops-cancer-cure-from-turmeric/articleshow/89027582.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||ED: NBFC with less than Rs 10 crore gave Rs 2,000 crore loans||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigating Chinese rogue loan apps cases and their money-laundering activities has opposed the bail petition of Pavitra Pradip Walvekar, the Pune-based promoter director of Kudos finance and investments company. ED had arrested Pradip on charges of assisting the Chinese money launderers providing short-term loans while charging exorbitant interest and using coercive methods of recovery. According to ED counsel Anjali Agarwal, Kudos, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) registered with RBI having a total share capital of not more than Rs 10 crore, was found to have extended loans of more than Rs 2,220 crore to scores of people. ED in its probe found out that several Chinese fintech loan app companies were using Kudos as a legal cover for their illegal financing. These Chinese firms raked in more than Rs 560 crore profit in a short span of time with the help of Kudos for loans with durations not more than one or two weeks. The ED further informed the court that as many as 43 FIRs were registered by cybercrime police in Hyderabad and Cyberabad against several persons and call centres involved in instant personal loans. ED had initiated a money-laundering probe in Jan 2021. “A look at the 43 FIRs reveals that as many as 365 loan apps are run by various fintech companies whose roots are in China. Kudos transgressed the laws of the land, RBI norms and connived with Chinese app firms. If Pradip is set free on bail now, he would continue the conspiracy and erase evidence from these fintech app web zones and records,” the ED counsel told the HC. In all the FIRs, complainants have availed loans through various instant loan apps charging interest rates of around 36% per annum along with high processing fees and GST. These loan apps were being used for running non-banking finance without valid licences from RBI and various government authorities. These companies collected customers’ personal details and used it to threaten and blackmail them to pay up the dues. Telecallers also told victims to take fresh loan from apps to make repayments of existing loans, the ED said. Justice K Lalitha, who heard the plea of the petitioner and the argument of the ED, posted the case to January 24 for further hearing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-nbfc-with-less-than10cr-gave-2000cr-loans/articleshow/89027592.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The five were going to the neighbouring village to work as farm hands. Their employer Parmanand Tijare himself was rowing the boat. Rowing across is the only means for the villagers to reach their fields, says locals. The deceased, Gita Nimbarte, leaves behind a two-year-old daughter. The accident brings out a larger issue of villages located near the backwaters of Gosikhurd dam. Villages like Khusba in Kuhi tehsil are not included in the original relocation list as they don’t come under the dam’s submergence area. Yet, the backwater reach their doorstep and locals live under the threat of floods. Now, with water level in Gosikhurd dam at the highest level of 245.5 metre, the situation has worsened. Cut off due to water, locals travel by boat to reach the other side. The detours are long, they say. In Khusba, a village of 2,000, there are nearly a dozen boats. The self-taught boatmen ferry themselves and others to the other side. The demands for relocation to a safer side remain unheeded, say the villagers. The problem has aggravated in the last three years. A proposal to rehabilitate Khusba and around a dozen other villages remains under process since over a year. The local leaders say their demand is much older, however. Influential politicians have been able to get villages with their voters included in the relocation list, say the local leaders. The village was marooned in 1994. Recently, a 30-year-old person who was himself rowing the boat died. The incident went unnoticed, say the locals. Former Zilla Parishad member Shyam Dubey said that the Aam river has been flowing there since generations. “Earlier, the water used to be there only during monsoons. In the older generations a member of the fishermen community had the job to ferry others. In turn the persons was paid in kind with foodgrains,” he said. As per Dubey, the situation worsened after the dam was built and water level increased gradually. “Now, the level is at its peak at 245.5 metre further increasing the waters. Slowly, other villagers bought their own dongas (small boats) and learnt to row instead of depending on others,” he said. There is another approach but it takes 10km. Even that road is cut off by a canal. So, the only option left is to row through the backwater for over a half a km. Residents of Khusba have their fields on the other side. “As they row the bullocks swim along,” claimed Dubey and added that rehabilitation is the only way out. A meeting was held three years ago under the leadership of the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Nagpur’s then guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. “Nothing happened after that. Bachchu Kadu, now a minister of state for water resources in the MVA government, had led a protest. It now remains a forgotten issue,” said Dubey A team of officials of the irrigation department had rushed to the village after the incident on Thursday. An official in the irrigation department accepted that the village comes under the flood zone. “The submergence water reaches close to it but does not engulf the village which is at an elevation. The proposal was initiated in December 2020. A decision is awaited at the state government’s level,” said the official. Former deputy Sarpanch Ishwar Lambat said that the locals mainly depend on boats. “Apart from people going the other side even farm inputs are largely brought on the small boats. It has got worse in the last two years,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/boat-tragedy-kills-woman-from-village-threatened-by-dam-water/articleshow/89026382.cms||Shishir Arya

Around 99% of the patients admitted in hospitals showed fever, cough, irritation in throat as common symptoms. Patients are also experiencing muscular weakness and tiredness along with other common symptoms. Among pediatric patients of 11-18 years of age in hospitals, fever along with upper respiratory tract infection were common symptom, whereas Covid pneumonia cases were low. “In Delhi, during the second surge, the hospital bed occupancy remained significantly high from April 1 to almost May 20,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. “However, despite an increase in the positivity rate in the current wave, those requiring (hospital) beds and hospitalisation during the third wave is significantly lower.” The number of active cases in Delhi is in the range of 75,000 to 78,000. Of these, only 2,500 to 2,600 patients are hospitalised, he added.

---||Hyderabad||Absenteeism, lack of resource slow down Hyderabad realty sector||HYDERABAD: The steady rise in Covid-19 cases has started slow down work in the city’s real estate sector. Industry insiders say that while construction activity has remained unaffected — labourers are mostly not opting for tests -- a 25% to 30% drop in attendance among other staff, including engineers and architects, is resulting in delays in launching new projects and completing other due diligence. Speaking to TOI, Ashwin Rao, managing partner of Akshara Group said: “Absenteeism is being reported among the 25% regular employees who are responsible for office work. Also, many government employees are affected which has delayed the process of procuring permissions . In our case, our architect is down with Covid-19 and the whole office is closed.” The other problem — access to resources. “There is a delay in the availability of overall resources. Thankfully, though, there has so far not been an urgency for steel, cement, sand, bricks etc,” said Veera Babu, managing director, Cushman & Wakefield, for Hyderabad & East India . Builders now hope there’s no lockdown in the offing. “That would directly hitus with additional wages and loan interests to be incurred during the delay period,” said Chaitanya Kumar, director of Eco Infra group .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/absenteeism-lack-of-resource-slow-down-hyd-realty-sector/articleshow/89027596.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

He urged Union railway minister Ashwini Vishnaw to sanction new railway projects to the state in the upcoming budget and at the same time expedite the pending projects. In a letter to the Union railway minister on Thursday, Vinod Kumar said as per the Section 13 of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2013, railways should, within six months from the appointed day, examine the feasibility of establishing a rail coach factory in Telangana and improve rail connectivity in the state. “Unfortunately, no action has been taken regarding the railway coach factory till now. How many more years will this step-motherly treatment continue? Progressive states such as Telangana must be encouraged with more resources,” the former MP said. “Geographically, Telangana is a landlocked state and was strategically located interconnecting all parts of the country from north to south and east to west. But unfortunately rail connectivity has not improved at all in the past seven years,” Vinod said. “Since the formation of the new state, Kothapalli-Manoharabad railway line is the only project that has taken off and is being implemented with major support from the Telangana government in terms of free land provision as well as 1/3rd cost contribution,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/centre-ignored-telangana-in-awarding-rail-projects-vinod/articleshow/89027611.cms||Koride Mahesh

The decision was taken by tourism minister V Srinivas Goud during a review meeting on PPP projects with officials on Thursday. The minister ordered officials to take action as per the lease agreements with firms running these projects on government land. He asked officials to write to power utilities and water board to disconnect services to these establishments. Goud said that about half-a-dozen firms that developed projects on government land, especially around Necklace Road such as Prasad’s Imax, Jal Vihar and Snow World have not been paying government its revenue share for the past few years. He said previous governments allotted land to these organisations with an intention to convert them into tourist spots and now many of them were making profits. “Many of these organisations have been earning huge revenue, but not paying the amount due to the government. If these commercial organisations do not fall in line and clear the arrears, action should be taken immediately as per the agreement conditions unless there is a valid reason for default,” the minister told tourism department officials. When officials informed that some organisations have got a stay from courts preventing any action against them, Goud said that the tourism department should also take appropriate legal measures to counter them. The minister asked officials to submit an action taken report at the earliest. Tourism development corporation managing director Manohar was also present at Thursday’s meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/necklace-road-fun-zones-told-to-pay-t-dues/articleshow/89027614.cms||Koride Mahesh

The accused were identified as Imran Ansari, 32, Mukesh Kumar Saini, 28, and Deen Dayal Prajapathi, 27, from Rajasthan. Police recovered 318 grams of stolen gold from their possession. In March 2021, Imran Ansari came to work at a construction site in Bandlaguda and stayed at the victim’s pent house. When the victim’s family went to UK, locking the house in the first half of 2021, Ansari along with his friend, Mukesh, who was at Koti, stole the valuables from his landlord’s house and fled to Rajasthan. They sold the gold to Prajapathi. Police arrested the trio in Rajasthan and recovered the stolen property.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/four-burglars-held69l-booty-seized/articleshow/89027620.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC allows RTC to cancel fuel outlet contract||HYDERABAD: A division bench, comprising Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice A Venkateswar Reddy of the high court, on Thursday vacated an order of restraint issued by a single judge and allowed TSRTC to cancel a contract with Malothu Nehru, who was entrusted with running some petrol pumps it had set up in its vacant spaces. RTC had secured 10 HPCL retail outlets in Hyderabad zone and was running them through its contractor. Three fuel outlets became operational and the rest would open soon. Following complaints of tampering with petrol dispensing equipment, legal meteorology officials raided one such petrol pump at Hakimpet and, on finding evidence of tampering, filed a complaint against Nehru, who was running the pump. RTC MD then cancelled the contract with Nehru. The contractor filed a petition in the high court. A single judge earlier said that the action of the RTC was unilateral and was done without notice to the contractor. The single judge stayed the termination of the contract. RTC filed an appeal against the stay order. RTC counsel N Praveen Reddy said that the contractor was given notice and he had even furnished his reply to the allegations. Nehru’s counsel said that RTC was acting against him with mala fide intentions. The bench perused the record and said that when malpractices surface, the contract could be closed and there was no requirement for the aggrieved party to follow principles of natural justice in a contract. In any case, the RTC gave an opportunity to the contractor and he furnished his reply too. “And, hence this is not a fit case for stay,” the bench said and vacated the stay issued by the single judge. The bench posted the case to February 21 for deciding the issue finally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-allows-rtc-to-cancel-fuel-outlet-contract/articleshow/89027621.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad has more active Covid-19 cases than Mumbai||AHMEDABAD: The exponential rise in Covid cases continued on Thursday as the state recorded 24,485 new cases, the third consecutive day of highest ever daily tally. With this, Gujarat crossed 10 lakh cumulative Covid cases, becoming 7th Indian state to cross the tally. Gujarat has one lakh active cases as of Thursday evening – crossing the one lakh-mark after May 16 or eight months. On Wednesday, Gujarat and Ahmedabad made a record during the ongoing pandemic having recorded more than 20,000 and 8,000 cases respectively for the first time. Ahmedabad also achieved another landmark – the district had 31,870 active cases, higher than Mumbai's 31,856. Ahmedabad district was ranked 9th across India as of the morning of January 20. In terms of cases per 1,000 population, Ahmedabad had 44 active Covid patients, compared to 26 in Mumbai and 35 in Delhi. Surat had slightly higher share at 50 active cases per 1,000 population. India has 15 active Covid patients per 1,000 population. Among major cities, Bengaluru had 192, Kolkata 93 and Chennai 87 active cases. "The rise should be seen in the perspective of the very viral spread of Omicron variant – out of overall cases we see in Ahmedabad, more than 80% have more than one family member infected. Thus, the number is much higher compared to the first and second waves. With the rise in testing, the number is expected to rise further," said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA). "The next couple of weeks are going to be crucial in deciding the course of the pandemic, and we urge all to exercise all caution. The only silver lining is low hospitalization." Gujarat in 24 hours recorded deaths of 13 active patients, third consecutive day of 10 or more deaths, the highest since June.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-has-more-active-covid-19-cases-than-mumbai/articleshow/89027625.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Defence ministry rejects Onir film script inspired by gay Major who quit||KOLKATA: The defence ministry has rejected the script of Onir’s next feature film inspired by the real-life story of a gay Major who quit because it was no longer tenable for him to remain a homosexual and be in the Indian Army. A sequel to his National Award-winning film titled ‘I Am’, the film was scheduled to be partly shot in Kolkata from April. Lt-Colonel Sachin Ujjwal, in the ADG strategic communication wing of the Army, sent an email to the director on Wednesday stating that the “content of the script received via email dated 16 December 2021 has been analysed in detail. It is regretted to inform that the script has not been cleared by IHQ of MoD (Army). Wishing you best of luck in all the future endeavours”. In July last year, the defence ministry had written to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and the ministries of information and broadcasting and electronics and information technology to advise production houses to obtain an NOC from it before the telecast of any film, documentary or web series on the Army. The letter said it had received complaints about the portrayal of Army personnel and military uniform in “an insulting manner”. Onir wrote to the MoD seeking a no-objection certificate for his script, which was denied. Calls to Lt-Col Ujjwal went unanswered on Thursday. Two years ago, Onir said, he had watched a television interview of a gay Major who had quit the Army. Thereafter, he had wanted to write a story about a gay man who loves to serve the Army but is unable to do so because of his sexual identity. “My protagonist is a jawan. His love remains unrequited till he leaves the Army and meets his lover in Kolkata,” he said. The filmmaker’s plan was to develop the story for one of the films of ‘We Are’. “The idea behind ‘We Are’ is to celebrate the Supreme Court verdict while highlighting four queer love stories about how society (including the Army) needs to take steps to be more inclusive and celebrate diversity. My script has been extremely respectful about our Army,” Onir said. “I wrote this script based on a story that is in the public domain. There are 56 countries in the world that have recognized the presence of the LGBTQI community in the Army. It has taken years for women to find space in the Indian Army. As a film-maker and queer rights activist, it is important for me to be able to tell this story,” the filmmaker said, adding that this was all the more important after the decriminalization of homosexuality. “Ahead of the celebrations of the 75th year of our independence, I am very disappointed with this rejection. ” Onir is now talking to lawyers about his future course of action. “Film-makers are supposed to question through cinema. This attempt to stop dialogue is unfortunate. True democracy does not exist unless it applies equally to all citizens irrespective of gender, sexuality, caste, class or religion,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mod-rejects-onir-film-script-inspired-by-gay-major-who-quit/articleshow/89027628.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||91% bereaved families apply for Covid relief in Bengal, 80% paid||KOLKATA: Bengal has received as many as 18,554 Covid death compensation claims, or 91% of the total recorded deaths of 20,231, and honoured nearly 80% of those, spending nearly Rs 75 crore from the State Disaster Response Fund, even as claims from Kolkata — which has had the highest share of Covid deaths — hover around the 40% mark. Experts are of the view that the shortfall from the city could be attributed to a section of the city’s affluent, who are not willing to spend time and energy on the process of making the claim. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court had hauled up some states for “insensitivity” over not taking proactive steps, and asked the authorities to reach out to the families of the victims without waiting for them to file claims. State disaster management minister Javed Ahmed Khan said instructions had been given to clear all claims as early as possible. “We have got a fund of Rs 100 crore from the state disaster management authority for paying compensations and, if needed, we will ask for more. Till Tuesday, we released Rs 74.4 crore as compensation.” Applications from Kolkata, however, have been low. Just about 2,200 applications have reached KMC (of which more than 1,500 have been cleared), though total deaths from the city, till date, is 5,458.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/91-bereaved-families-apply-for-covid-relief-in-bengal-80-paid/articleshow/89027567.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Centre’s overriding powers on officers unconstitutional, says CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee shot off another letter to PM Narendra Modi on Thursday opposing the “overriding powers” the Centre was seeking to appropriate in the transfer of all-India service officials. This is Banerjee’s second letter to Modi on the issue. The revised draft changes in the all-India service rules allow the Centre to take out officers from states at any point of time without the consent of either the officers or the states where they may be posted. Banerjee’s letter urged Modi to withdraw the amendments and “requested” him “not to push us to the point of greater movements on this issue to protect the soul of this great democracy that India is and has been”. “The power proposed to be usurped by the central government, by resorting to over-centralisation, is going to destroy the morale and freedom of all-India service officers... (and is) unconstitutional on the face of it. It is going to completely render them and all the state governments at the mercy of the central government since the all-India services serve as the backbone of a state’s administrative machinery,” Banerjee said. “It will hang on the head of each officer of the all-India services like Damocles’s sword,” the letter said, adding it would “create fear psychosis”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/centres-overriding-powers-on-officers-unconstitutional-cm/articleshow/89027629.cms||Debashis Konar
---||India||Govt unveils plan on closure, merger of film media units||NEW DELHI: The Union information and broadcasting ministry on Thursday put in public domain the recommendations of the Bimal Julka-led expert committee’s report on rationalisation, closure and merger of film media units, seven months after it was submitted to the ministry. The contents of the June 2020 report were made public months after the government announced a merger of all film units and brought them under an umbrella body — the National Film Development Corporation. The formal merger is to be executed this month. The expert committee, headed by former I&B secretary Bimal Julka, filmmakers TS Nagabharana, Shayama Prasad, AK Bir and Rahul Rawail, along with two representatives of the I&B ministry, had unanimously proposed the need for an umbrella organisation with four verticals dealing in film production, festivals, heritage and knowledge, each of which would perform different activities to avoid overlapping, duplication, wastage of financial resources and for a more efficient and coordinated management of the films wing. Though four of the seven members of the expert committee represented the film industry, the announcement of the merger led to strong opposition by a large posse of people associated with the film industry. In December, over 1,500 persons affiliated in various capacities to the film industry sent a letter to the I&B ministry against the government’s decision to merge all branches of the Films Division (FD), Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF), National Film Archive of India (NFAI) and Children’s Film Society of India (CFAI) with the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). The letter had demanded putting off the merger till transparency issues are settled. It also said public-funded institutions like FD, NFAI and CFSI must not be merged with a corporation like NFDC and demanded that government should declare them as national heritage. However, the committee, in its report had unanimously proposed that NFDC’s mandate may be expanded through the expansion of its Article of Association. It had said the film production division under the merged corporation can also operate a “separate ‘film production fund’ that can facilitate production of ‘independent cinema’ and can fund, perhaps up to 20% of the cost of production”. “This will be limited to small and medium producers and can be funded through equity infusion in the corporation,” the committee said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-unveils-plan-on-closure-merger-of-film-media-units/articleshow/89027568.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Kolkata||NGT asks PCBs to conduct noise pollution survey||KOLKATA: The Eastern Bench of National Green Tribunal on Thursday asked the central and state pollution pollution control boards to conduct a joint survey of sound pollution levels in Kolkata, including silence zones. The report has to be submitted by February 23. The PCB, along with the state chief secretary and the DGP, will have to submit an action taken report against the offenders on the same day. Though air pollution had reduced in the past two years owing to pandemic restrictions that has led to lesser traffic on the roads, sound pollution has continued unabated except for the period of lockdown between March-end and June-beginning 2020. “The sound limit during the day in residential areas is 55 decibels and 45 decibels at night. Similarly, it is 65 decibels in commercial areas during the day and 55 decibels in night. These limits are violated everyday. No one adheres to the ban on loudspeakers and honking near silence zones,” said petitioner Subhas Datta, who had filed a non-compliance complaint. NGT bench of judicial member Justice B Amit Sthalekar and expert member Saibal Dasgupta demanded to know how many microphones and air horns had been seized by PCB and police, and what action had been taken against offenders including levy of penalty. Justice Sthalekar also remarked on the motorcycle racing menace and the racket they racers created at night, honking without, waking up people from sleep and spreading terror.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ngt-asks-pcbs-to-conduct-noise-pollution-survey/articleshow/89027631.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Smog envelops Kolkata pockets due to pollution spurt, drives up AQI||KOLKATA: Although the minimum temperature dropped by a degree in Kolkata on Thursday, the air quality index (AQI) worsened at most monitoring stations. Parts of the city were covered by smog, which could be the result of a spurt in pollution levels, said experts. With the mercury set to remain low for the next 48 hours, conditions may not change for the better, they said. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 12.7°C on Thursday. Most automated air quality monitoring stations in the city revealed that the air quality was poor, while a station at the Rabindra Bharati University campus recorded very poor air along with another station in Howrah. Readings at 2pm showed the RBU station had the worst AQI in Kolkata at 348, high enough to cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. In Howrah, Ghusuri recorded an AQI of 374. The monitoring station at Bidhannagar just about managed to stay in the poor category with an AQI reading of 295. Rabindra Sarobar recorded the best ambient air at 229, followed by Belur Math in Howrah at 243, Victoria Memorial at 251 and Fort William at 277. The only station that recorded ambient air at the moderate level, with AQI of 171, was Ballygunge. Private weather forecasting service AccuWeather said the city’s AQI was 350 on Thursday evening. Fog now exists in the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh-Bihar belt and it could be floating into Kolkata soon, said weathermen. “Often in winter, fog from north India floats into south Bengal and Kolkata, triggering smog due to high pollution. Since pollution levels are already high, we may experience more smog soon. But on Thursday, Kolkata didn’t have very dense fog,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. Meanwhile, Kolkata is set to remain chilly till the weekend when the mercury is expected to rise. Minimum temperature could rise marginally to 13°C on Friday. “Over the weekend, it could slide up to 15°C-16°C due to an approaching western disturbance. It is set to form by Saturday and will trigger north-south low-pressure trough across Bihar and Chhattisgarh. It will be aided by moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal even as the chilly northwesterly wind gets cut off. Another trough is set to form across Rajasthan and Bengal, which will contribute to the cloudy weather. These will combine to push the mercury up and keep the city cloudy,” said Das. The Met office has not ruled out possibility of light rain in the city over the weekend.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/smog-envelops-kol-pockets-due-to-pollution-spurt-drives-up-aqi/articleshow/89027630.cms||---

To be run on solar energy, the bench has been installed as a prototype and would be set up in other places in New Town if found viable and successful. New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) chairman Debashis Sen who inaugurated the solar bench on Wednesday said this is a prototype which has been developed by a company which as of now will act as a proof of concept. “An NKDA team will look into how the prototype works to see if more such solar benches could be spread out across the township,” he said. The smart solar bench will be open for 24 hours for people to use free of cost. People who would like to take rest can sit on the bench and spend time browsing the net, using the Wi-Fi user ID and password which is mentioned on the side panel along with other features. The bench has been made with fiber metal. A LED panel has been fixed on top of the side panel which will generate solar power from sunlight. The bench will light up automatically when somebody sits on it after dark. There is also a display board on the panel which will continuously mention the temperature and humidity level of any given time of the day. There are three USB charging points and two wireless charging pads along with a charging point for e-cycles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/solar-energy-powers-new-town-smart-bench/articleshow/89027632.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: For second time in 205 years, Presidency University goes online with Founder’s Day celebration||KOLKATA: Presidency University and its alumni association observed the institution’s 205th Founder’s Day on Thursday. Like last year, this year, too, the Founder’s Day celebration went online due to the pandemic. Ashok Sen, eminent physicist and Padma Bhusan recipient, was awarded Atul Chandra Gupta Distinguished Alumnus Award 2022. Sen served as the post-doctoral associate at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) from 1982 to 1985 and at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a United States Department of Energy National Laboratory operated by Stanford University, from 1985 to 1988. In 1988, Sen joined Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai in the faculty of physics and moved to Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad in 1997, where he is currently a Distinguished Professor. Sen earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1975 from then Presidency College and completed his Master’s from IIT Kanpur. He did his doctoral work in physics at Stony Brook University. On Thursday evening, as the Founder’s Day event started, current students of the university, faculty members, officials as well as former students from across the globe logged in to reminisce and celebrate the legacy of the institution. “I am honoured to receive this prestigious award and deliver the Founder’s Day lecture. During my four years in the college, I learnt physics and friendship, but I also learnt valuable lesson in humility and modesty from our teachers,” said Sen, after receiving the award. In the past, Nobel laureates Amartya Sen and Abhijeet Vinayak Banerjee, along with economist Bimal Jalan, economist Mihir Kanti Rakshit and scholar-author Nabaneeta Dev Sen had also been conferred with the award. “The pandemic has forced us to observe Founder’s Day online. The silver lining is that we are now joined by our alumnus from across the world. In future, whenever we get an opportunity to hold the event on the campus, we will ensure that it is done in the hybrid mode so that those not present in Kolkata at that time can also get the opportunity to participate in it,” said Bivas Chaudhuri, vice-president of the Presidency Alumni Association.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/for-second-time-in-205-years-presidency-goes-online-with-founders-day-celebration/articleshow/89027634.cms||Subhojyoti Kanjilal
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Forest officials bust banned Shahtoosh shawl racket, arrest three Kashmiri men||KOLKATA: Forest officials have busted a racket in Kolkata that used to sell and transport banned, but expensive, Shahtoosh shawls — manufactured from the skin of Tibetan antelope, a schedule I protected animal. Each shawl ranges between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, and one shawl apparently requires poaching of at least three-five of the animals. Forest officials seized 27 such shawls, worth more than a crore, and arrested three from Kashmir who were selling those along with Pashmina and Angora shawls. An endangered species listed in Schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and Appendix-I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the Tibetian antelope (Pantholope hodgsonii) is also called Chiru and importation of any part or products of Pantholopes is prohibited by the US Law. “Inhabitants of the Tibetian plateau in China, a small population of the animals are found in the high Himalayas of Tibet, western China and far northern India, where they are killed for parts. Their pelts are converted into Shahtoosh and the horns of the males are taken as trophies. No Chirus are kept in captivity and it usually takes three-five animals to make a single shawl,” a senior forest official said. A majority of the world’s Shahtoosh are illegally woven in India, but all source countries prohibit the killing of the animals and trade in Shahtoosh. It is even illegal to own a Shahtoosh shawl, the official said. Every process, right from obtaining the wool to manufacturing a shawl, is carried out by hand. “The fabric is extremely soft and so lightweight that it can be passed through a wedding ring and is hardly felt around the shoulders. Its warmth is incomparable,” the official added. On Monday, officers of Wildlife Crime Control Cell received a tip about a group who would be passing through the Chirpore area to deliver the shawls to Alipore. Accordingly, officers in plainclothes were posted along the route and while the car carrying three men and the products were passing by Nakhoda Masjid, the officers stopped them. “The driver sped off and our officers gave chase. Finally, they were stopped near Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and arrested,” said a forest official. The officials found 296 shawls, of which 27 are suspected to be Shahtoosh. Police said all three arrested men — Abdul Samad Shah (58), Asif Ahmad Bhatt (21) and Sudarshan Kuswaha (45) — are from Kashmir and had been selling and transporting the banned shawls in Kolkata and other states for some time.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/forest-officials-bust-banned-shahtoosh-shawl-racket-arrest-three-kashmiri-men/articleshow/89027635.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Early February may see liquor supply hiccup||KOLKATA: The new liquor distribution model, involving private distributors, will be rolled out from February 1. The new distributors will coordinate between both liquor companies and Bevco, the state beverage corporation, and also carry out the last-line distribution to retailers. Excise sources pointed out the role of Bevco would now be of a facilitator, while the logistics would be taken care of by the distributors. Sources indicated there could be some disruption in supply chain due to the switchover. “Retailers should immediately stock up on enough consignments as there may be a supply chain disruption during the first two weeks of February. Procurement should be ensured immediately so that the stocks at the Bevco depots are cleared and future stocks can be kept there within 29th January,” an excise official told retailers. In 2017, Bevco was formed to take over the wholesale business of liquor and private distributors were discontinued. In the new model, Bevco will not operate warehouses after March 31. “Bevco will act as a portal for booking consignments for retailers, while distributors will take care of the entire logistics. This will be one of the most advanced liquor distribution models in the country,” a source said. In this new structure, distributors will have a commission of 1.5%, while Bevco will have the same margin for booking. Nine distributors have so far been appointed, some of whom were distributors before Bevco was established. “New distributors will set up their own warehouses or can take over Bevco’s warehouses after March 31. Retailers will place orders on the Bevco portal. Every other thing will be performed by distributors,” added the source. According to the excise circular, breweries and distilleries will not produce any liquor on January 30 and 31 for the switchover.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/early-feb-may-see-liquor-supply-hiccup/articleshow/89027636.cms||---

Justice Subramonium Prasad sought a status report from police and listed it for further hearing on March 16. The accused, Shahrukh Pathan, has been facing charges under various offences dealing with rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder in an FIR 49/2020 registered at Jafrabad Police Station. He is also accused of obstructing police officials/public servants, who were posted there to maintain law and order, in discharge of their public functions. Police have alleged that the accused caused injuries to police personnel and gunshot injury was sustained by one Rohit Shukla. Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly opened fire at police personnel in February 2020 during the protest and violence against the Citizenship Amendment Act, is facing charges in various other cases too. Pathan is named as an accused in the case related to pointing a gun at the head constable Deepak Dahiya. He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in the Tihar Jail. According to police, Pathan after the incident in February 2020 initially kept hiding in Delhi before slipping away to Punjab and Uttar Pradesh from where he was arrested later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-notice-to-police-on-pathans-bail-plea/articleshow/89026869.cms||TNN
---||Kolkata||Aliah hostels go without power, water||By Poulami Roy KOLKATA: Aliah University officials cut off electricity and water connection to the girls’ and boys’ hostels on Thursday apparently in a bid to force boarders to vacate the buildings. Many boarders are taking online exams. The move drew the ire of students, most of them from outside the state and some Bangladesh, and flak from activists who pointed to court orders against severing electric and water connections. When power was switched off, practical exams for MCA was reportedly on. MCA 2nd year student Mehedi Hassan said, “I’m from Bangladesh. It is impossible for me to return now. At present, more than 30 borders are in the boys’ hostel. I have a practical exam on Friday.” The authorities said they had asked the borders several times to vacate the hostel. The state had stated if borders could not return, hostel authorities would have to take care of them. But Kazi Alfred, hostel chairman, said, “Who will take the responsibility if someone gets infected and then it spreads?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/aliah-hostels-go-without-power-water/articleshow/89027637.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Civic cop, driver in net for Strand Road robbery||KOLKATA: A 27-year-old Park Circus traffic guard civic volunteer and his 28-year-old contractual driver was arrested by Burrabazar police for allegedly carrying out a robbery on Strand Road on Tuesday night. Cops claimed the two accused — civic volunteer Sk Akbar and driver Sk Jamir Mondal — had reached the scene of the crime a little before midnight in a red SUV belonging to Kolkata Police and started assaulting the driver of a pick-up van. Local shopkeepers who tried to intervene were assaulted too. The accused left with around Rs 5,000 in cash, a silver chain, a purse, PAN card, Aadhaar card and the driving licence of the pick-up van driver. The motive, sources said, was loot. Burrabazar police said the victim, Rajakumar Das (24) from Posta, alleged the incident took place close to the Armenian Ghat-Strand Road crossing around 11.45pm on Tuesday and continued till 12.10am on Wednesday. “Das had parked his vehicle on Strand Road when the accused arrived in a police car. They allegedly wrongfully restrained the complainant, assaulted him, and snatched his belongings. A specific case under IPC 392 was registered at Burrabazar police station and an investigation was started,” said an officer. “During investigation, footage from CCTV cameras installed by the traffic unit, as well as private owners, were collected and local sources were engaged. Subsequently, we used technical evidence and nabbed the two. We are questioning them and trying to make some recoveries. We are also questioning them to ascertain if they had been involved in similar cases earlier,” said an officer. Cops said they are ascertaining how a civic volunteer — not entitled to use the official vehicle — could travel beyond his traffic guard’s jurisdiction. The incident took place almost two hours after naka checking had started. According to traffic police sources, Akbar, a resident of Bibi Bagan Lane in Entally, was one of several reformed drug addicts who were inducted in the police force under the Shuddhi programme. The project is an effort by the narcotics cell of the detective department to rehabilitate a few chosen drug addicts after providing them with necessary training and counselling. The cops also help them find meaningful jobs whereby they can earn a livelihood and gain acceptance among their family and neighbours. Senior traffic department officers claimed Akbar was one of the three civic volunteers inducted at Park Circus traffic guard a few months ago under this scheme. “He was visited each week by counsellors and has excelled in art painting therapy. He has been a quick learner, which made us trust him. Unfortunately, he failed to live up to the trust. But we do have multiple examples of drug addicts reforming themselves and joining several private firms too. For now, we see this case as our only aberration in the past four-five years,” said a detective department officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/civic-cop-driver-in-net-for-strand-road-robbery/articleshow/89027638.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

While many lauded the police’s “intellect and humour”, others wondered if its social media content writers were chucking the usual “gyan” after it failed to “drill sense among Kolkatans”. The latest meme is a rip off from the cult movie “3 Idiots”. The virus referred to has a direct link to the character of the engineering college principal played by Bomani Irani. He was nicknamed Virus by his three students, Aamir Khan, R Madhavan and Sharman Joshi. In this meme, all three are seen wearing masks and using sanitizers. Uploaded on Kolkata Police’s Twitter and Facebook accounts, the caption reads “Virus Jokhon Smart, Suraksha Hok State-of-the-art’. Barely seven hours after going online, the Facebook page had 4.6k likes, 405 shares and 182 comments. “When you are a member, but became a cop due to family pressure!” commented Anish Kumar. Its Twitter versionattracted a large number of likes and responses. Other memes have a more direct reference to the cricket field where actual footage of batsmen wearing helmets has been compared with wearing masks and staying safe vis-a-vis not wearing them and getting out. One shows a particular episode from the recent Ashes series played between England and Australia. A batsman is seen getting bowled out behind his legs. The caption reads: “When you go out without wearing a mask”. A third meme is a direct Bengali pun on soap. “Sera ban (arrow) Sa-ban (soap)” it says, showing Rama killing the Asura Omicron with soap.  “The whole idea is for people to react and appreciate the main message,” said a joint commissioner at Lalbazar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mask-awareness-memes-a-hit-on-social-media/articleshow/89027639.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In the past week, the officials have arrested five men and unearthed multiple hideouts in the city. Sleuths said the fraudsters provided fake appointment letters to collect large amounts from the victims and had procured property worth several crores in Bihar and Kolkata. Cops have also found a large number of fake Army documents, stamp pads and other papers which bore resemblance with original documents. “It’s a large gang and we are certain there are some former and current Army officials who help the fraudsters train Army etiquette, details about the set up and documents they used to forge the appointment letters,” said an official. Cops said further arrests are likely and raids will be carried out in Bihar. The gang would never have been nabbed if not for a man from Haryana — whose father is serving in the armed forces — who came to Kolkata after being duped.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/five-arrested-for-army-job-racket/articleshow/89027640.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation combs ‘high-infection’ areas to detect new Covid cases||KOLKATA: The drop in the number of Covid cases and micro-containment zones notwithstanding, civic health department officials are wary about the numbers and fear the actual numbers may be a lot more. They feel the situation may spiral out of control if corrective steps are not taken immediately. "In several neighbourhoods, there are many people who have Covid symptoms but they are either not getting themselves tested or undergoing tests with home kits and keeping quiet about the infection. There are also instances of people giving fake contacts when they are undergoing tests at clinics. This has come to light when tele-medicine callers are failing to reach out to those who are testing positive," said a civic health official. The issue was discussed at length at a meeting convened to chalk out a strategy for Borough X that has most containment zones. KMC health department brass and local councillors interacted with cops to find a solution to the under-reporting problem. But there were no easy answers. Large areas of Borough X had become a major concern for the KMC health department team a week ago as the infection was spreading fast in at least eight of the 12 wards. Areas under Borough X comprised nearly 40% of the city’s micro-containment zones. “Though we had set up 12 containment zones here, we were actually struggling to contain the infection that was spreading in areas such as New Alipore, Anwar Shah Road, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens, Golf Green and Netaji Nagar, among other areas,” said a civic official. :That cases are declining does not mean the threat is over. Everyone has to stay on the guard. We need to be more vigilant as the infection rate is still high in some complexes and stand-alone building,” said deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, who chaired the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-combs-high-infection-areas-to-detect-new-covid-cases/articleshow/89027642.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘Incidental Covid’ responsible for most deaths during third wave||KOLKATA: Around 30% of Bengal’s 554 Covid fatalities in the past month were from Kolkata, the state health department data revealed on Thursday. A majority of those who succumbed to Covid in the state during the period had mild Covid infections but severe comorbidities. Kolkata on January 19 reported highest single-day Covid fatality of 14 in this current surge of the pandemic. For Bengal, the highest single-day Covid fatality was on January 15, when 39 deaths were reported. On Thursday, Bengal recorded 37 deaths, nine of which were from the city. In the past month, Bengal had reported 3,12,430 Covid cases, a third of which — 1,04,325—were reported from Kolkata. But Covid fatalities in the past one month threw up curious patterns. Among the 554 who died of Covid in this period in Bengal, 423 had comorbidities, while 131 didn’t have any diagnosed comorbidity. More than 76% deaths had been caused by comorbidities during the first wave. Non-comorbid deaths had increased sharply in the second wave. “This time, severity of Covid infection is comparatively less but deaths due to comorbodity in Covid-infected people still remains a concern. People are taking the pandemic very lightly this time but the reality is something different. People with uncontrolled comorbid conditions may suffer a quick deterioration when infected by Covid. Even if the Covid infection is mild and incidental, they need immediate treatment,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui. While Covid aggravated the comorbid conditions, leading to hospitalization and deaths during the previous waves, this time, most people with comorbidities have had mild infection. Among comorbidities in males who died due to Covid, hypertension and diabetes remained the biggest killers and they had remained constant over the past month. But there has also been a slight rise in patients dying of cardiac ailments and chronic kidney diseases (CKD) in the third wave. Among females who died of Covid in the past month, patients with hypertension have been the highest in number. There is a dip of around 4% in diabetes as the primary comorbidity. Covid deaths in female patients with cardiac ailments have remained constant but there is a slight increase in female patients with CKD. “We have had five deaths in the past four days and comorbidity added to Covid-related complications,” said Sudipta Mitra Peerless Hospital CEO. In the past month, fatality rate in various age groups is also showing some definitive trends. For example, deaths in the 75-plus age group has dropped from 7.4% to 6.4%, but that in the 60-75 age group has risen from 2.9% to 3.4%. All the lower age groups have recorded a fall. Across gender, Covid fatality in males remains more than in women.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/incidental-covid-responsible-for-most-deaths-during-third-wave/articleshow/89027643.cms||Saibal Sen

Civic officials said a formal proposal will be placed to the state government for approval. “There are many who are yet to pay their tax dues. We cannot give any relaxation in the current tax amount. But to encourage people to complete their vaccine doses, a 25% relaxation on their unpaid tax dues (of the previous quarters, if any) will be given if the assessee can prove vaccination completion status of all the family members,” said a South Dum Dum civic official, adding that a letter on the proposal is being forwarded to the state government authorities for approval. The civic authorities are also encouraging those between 15 years and 18 years to take their vaccine. Former South Dum Dum Municipality chairman-in-council member Debashis Banerjee has taken up an initiative in Ward 15, encouraging 15+ students to take the jab by gifting them footballs, volleyballs, cricket and badminton sets and school bags after they get inoculated from the civic body-run vaccination centres. From over 150 daily new cases, the number of new Covid cases in South Dum Dum Municipality areas has come down to about 50-60 on an average. At present, there are 17 micro containment zones in the area. “Our aim is to see that the 100% vaccination target is achieved. We are also trying our best to bring down the Covid graph,” said a civic official. With a surge in Covid cases in the first week of January, the South Dum Dum civic authorities had come up with a thrice-a-week market and commercial establishment closure on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. It will continue till the end of this month. “We will review the situation to withdraw the closure notice in February,” a civic official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/get-jabbed-twice-claim-property-tax-discount/articleshow/89027645.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rise in Covid pneumonia patients prompts hospital concern over emerging variants||KOLKATA: Doctors are seeing a steady rise in the number of patients being admitted to ICU with Covid pneumonia over the past couple of days. While Delta-like symptoms have been noticed in them, some hospitals have requested the health department to carry out random genome sequencing of their samples to confirm whether their variants are Delta, Omicron or a yet new strain. “In the past four to five days, I have been coming across an increasing number of patients coming in with bad Covid. Currently, four of them, including a patient in his late 40s, are on ventilation and three on high oxygen requirement. We know about 80% cases are now Omicron and the rest are Delta, but we need to keep an eye out for new variants. That is why we have sent request for genome sequencing on a few samples,” said pulmonologist Raja Dhar of CMRI. Doctors pointed out most patients in the ICU were with comorbidities and incidental Covid, but the number of patients with Covid pneumonia was also rising. “Not all landing up in ICU are with stroke or cardiac patients with incidental Covid. Some are coming in with Covid pneumonia, requiring significant amount of oxygen and their number has started climbing,” said Sushmita Roy Chowdhury, pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital. Even if patients have Delta-like symptoms, what worries doctors is the rising number amid Omicron dominance. “We really do not know whether it is Delta or Omicron, which is causing the pneumonia at a later stage. Therefore, we have also requested for whole genome sequencing on the samples of a few of these patients,” said Roy Chowdhury. Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra also said they were getting cases of positive patients coming with decreased oxygen saturation and persistant high-grade fever that looked like Delta symptoms. Currently, whole genome sequencing is being done only on positive samples of patients with international travel history. The decision to sequence all samples from the community below 30 CT value from Kolkata was withdrawn within a week in December-end. But the state is likely to start sending random samples from Covid patients with severe diseases. “Whether it is Delta or Omicron, treatment will stay broadly the same. We should not miss out on any emerging variant and hence genome sequencing from random samples will help with public health policy,” said critical care specialist Saswati Sinha of AMRI Dhakuria.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rise-in-cov-pneumonia-patients-prompts-hospital-concern-over-emerging-variants/articleshow/89027646.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: For kids, docs stress early detection of post-Covid illness||KOLKATA: Early detection of MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) while adhering to multiprong diagnostic markers has been advised in the revised protocol for clinical management of Covid-19 in children. A detailed guideline on how to investigate and manage MIS-C cases forms a large part of the revised protocol — issued by the health ministry on Thursday — for management of Covid-19 among those below 18 years. TOI had on Thursday reported how paediatricians are cautioning parents to look out for MIS-C symptoms in their children so that the condition can be detected early and intervened on time. This is a post Covid-19 condition in children that is more challenging for doctors than Covid-19 infection itself in children. Paediatricians also said that there had been cases of overdiagnosing of MIS-C during the previous wave. Since most children suffering from the condition need steroid, incomplete or over-diagnosis could often do more harm than good. “If children who did not fit into the criteria of MIS-C are given steroids, it can cause more harm, including flaring up of underlying ailment. Hence, the diagnosis has to be done keeping all yardsticks in place” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor of paediatrics at the Institute of Child Health (ICH). MIS-C is a severe condition in children as a result of delayed immune response to the virus. While in most cases children develop the symptoms after one month to eight weeks post the infection, some children could get into the condition when they are still positive to the virus. Children suffer from various complications, including multi-organ dysfunction. The revised guideline says caution should be exercised while interpreting an isolated increase in Covid antibodies. “There was a tendency to over-diagnosis of MIS-C by just looking at the Covid-19 antibody with fever or few signs, but not fulfilling the whole criteria for diagnosis. At this stage of the pandemic, many children as well as adults will be Covid-antibody positive due to mild or asymptomatic infection. There lies the importance of ruling out other tropical infections like malaria, dengue, enteric fever, rickettsial illness (scrub typhus),” said Mihir Sarkar, professor of paediatrics at the Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MCHK). ICH, with about 180 cases, and MCHK with 80 cases of MIS-C are the two hospitals in the state that had handled the maximum number of such cases during the pandemic. Majority of these children have been between five and 12 years of age. “As of now, it is not very clear as to who are more at risk of developing MIS-C. Even as genetic background is suspected, it is not very clear yet,” added Sarkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/for-kids-docs-stress-early-detection-of-post-cov-illness/articleshow/89027648.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The last time bread price was hiked was four years ago in 2018. Then, too, the MRP of bread had gone up by Rs 4. “The price of refined flour, edible oil and fuel have gone up in the past four years. The margins have been under tremendous pressure for the last couple of years. We would have actually revised prices last year but did not do so, keeping the pandemic in mind. But we have been forced to do so now to cover the losses,” said an official of Modern Breads, the largest supplier in Kolkata. Apart from Modern, Moreish Foods, Britannia, Metro Gold, Barron, Mother, Anurag, Subhnarayan and Bajaj — all mechanized bread manufacturers — have hiked the price of bread across categories. Moreish Foods assistant vice-president (sales & distribution) Sasi Panda said cost of flour had gone up by 32%, edible oil by 100% and fuel by 120% in the last couple of years. “Around 40% of the hike will also go into commission that has also increased,” he said. Despite the hike, the price of regular white bread remains the lowest in Kolkata among cities in the east.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rising-input-cost-pushes-up-bread-price-in-city/articleshow/89027649.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Breathalyzer tests back as Covid dips||KOLKATA: With a spurt in drink-driving cases as well as a dip in Covid cases, cops have reintroduced breathalyzer test on Wednesday night. A late evening order on Wednesday from the commissioner of police, Vineet Goyal, after he had reviewed the prosecutions by cops, led to the reintroduction of the test, which was suspended in the past two weeks due to the rising Covid cases. The decision came 72 hours after spot fines were reintroduced in the city. After cops resumed breathalyzer test, the number of prosecutions went up from mere three cases each night since January 6 to 22 on Wednesday night. “The high number in drink-driving cases even on weekdays makes it clear that prosecution is our only tool to curb it,” said a senior officer of Lalbazar. However, Goyal has laid out certain guidelines on how these checks should be conducted at the nakas. “He has asked cops to ensure that there is only one time usage of the disposable straws. Sanitizing the equipment after use each time is must. The cops, who have received booster dose, will only conduct the test. On Wednesday, we tested around 271 motorists, of whom 22 were prosecuted for drink-driving. We will ask for the temporary suspension of the licences of some of these motorists and bikers,” said an officer. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said they will ensure that breathalyzer tests are carried out in keeping with the SOP. According to police sources, around 1,021 motorists and bikers were prosecuted for breaking the night restrictions. The maximum drink-driving prosecutions took place in the east and south guards — the areas in and around New Market, Park Street, Middleton Street and Park Circus. The Kasba traffic guard, under which several pubs are located along the Bypass, also registered three prosecutions pertaining to drink-driving. Cops insisted on carrying out breathalyzer tests to reduce accidents owing to drink-driving in the wake of a fatal accident that was reported barely 45 minutes after the imposition of the night nakas on Tuesday. A mini-truck allegedly mowed down a man on Nirmal Chandra Street. “A breathalyzer test on the accused driver, Md Mustaq (42), proved that he had consumed alcohol above the limit,” said DC Sinha. Earlier, the Kolkata Traffic Police had reintroduced breathalyzer test from November 8, which had been suspended for almost 20 months due to the pandemic, before stopping it yet again on January 6.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/breathalyzer-tests-back-as-cov-dips/articleshow/89027651.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Kolkata’s lifeline, with only 33 stations at its disposal, now ranks fourth among all zonal railways in terms of cumulative non-fare-revenue (NFR) earnings.Kolkata is the only city where Metro is run by the railways. Officials said Kolkata Metro has earned Rs 2.7crore in December, 2021, ranking third among all zonal railways after Central and Western Railway in terms of monthly non-fare revenue (NFR) earnings. From 1 April to 31 December 2021, the utility earned Rs 10crore and ranked fourth among the zonal railways in terms of cumulative NFR earnings.In all other cities, Metro is jointly owned by the respective state governments and the Union urban development ministry. While Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRC), which are joint ventures between the respective state governments and the Centre and function independently, have taken up brand exercises, it’s only after the pandemic struck that Metro Railway launched initiatives to increase its non-fare earnings.

Unlike the RT-PCR, they are available in the market and throw up a result in 10 minutes.

Inspectors in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s assessment department have been asked to bring all unassessed properties under the mandatory assessment scheme. These properties include vacant land, buildings and flats that are yet to be assessed. The move is part of a revenue augmentation drive. KMC assessment department inspectors were asked to prepare a list of unassessed properties and then bring them under the assessment ambit so that the civic body starts receiving property tax from these addresses. Mayor Firhad Hakim on Thursday held a revenue meeting and asked the civic officials to ensure that no major properties are left unassessed. The KMC assessment department will also invite property owners to step forward and apply for self-assessment online. The assessment department will also identify apartments where promoters haven’t obtained completion certificate and left buyers stranded. “In such cases, we will assess the property and give an opportunity to flat owners to do the mutation of their flats,” said a KMC assessment department official. “If the common citizens can pay property tax in time, why should the owners of commercial establishments or expensive apartments hesitate to clear their dues? If they don’t pay, we will have to act stern,” Hakim said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/unassessed-properties-under-kmc-scanner/articleshow/89027657.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||Ensure all hawkers are removed from Nehru Place: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court asked Delhi Development Authority on Thursday to ensure compliance of its orders on removing all hawkers from Nehru Place. A bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla stressed to the land-owning agency not to be slack in enforcing the order. The bench also heard various parties, including South Delhi Municipal Corporation and NGO Manushi Sangathan which is representing some vendors. Appearing for SDMC, senior advocate Sanjay Poddar urged the bench to direct the 95 identified vendors at Nehru Place to immediately relocate to the alternate site in Govindpuri denoted by the corporation. He pointed out that 62 vendors under Manushi Sangathan continued to remain at the commercial centre citing a status quo order obtained from the Supreme Court. Poddar informed the court that on January 6, the apex court had upheld the high court’s orders designating Nehru Place a no-hawking zone and dismissed Manushi’s appeal while vacating the protection granted earlier. In its affidavit, SDMC claimed that by the hawkers illegally carrying on business at Nehru Place, “the rules relating to fire, etc, are flouted with impunity”. The affidavit added that the multi-storeyed complex was “exposed to fire and other hazards due to the continued squatting therein. There is no vacant space for free movement of people or for movement of emergency vehicles in case of any emergency.” However, advocate Indira Unninayar, appearing for Manushi Sangathan, contested SDMC’s claims and submitted that the Supreme Court’s order of January 6 restored the earlier protection granted by the high court to 67 vendors in its 2017 and 2018 orders. Unninayar maintained that any action to remove the squatters would attract contempt of court proceedings against SDMC. The court, which was hearing a batch of petitions concerning vending at Nehru Place, had said last year that such an expansive commercial area shouldn’t turn into a slum. On August 13 last year, the high court suo motu initiated litigation after a blaze in a building there. The court said that a video on the incident circulated on social media clearly showed that the presence of hawkers and vendors caused difficulties for the fire tenders to access the building where the fire had broken out. Following the high court’s order, a mock drill was conducted by the Delhi Fire Service last year, the report of which claimed that none of the fire engines could reach the blaze and only the upper plaza was accessible to the fire service vehicles.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ensure-all-hawkers-are-removed-from-nehru-place-hc/articleshow/89026401.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Kolkata||Goa polls: TMC hits out at Congress, but says still willing to ‘walk extra mile’||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Thursday took on Congress but made it clear that they were still willing “to keep egos aside” and “walk the extra mile” to take on BJP in Goa. The party also rubbished statements attributed to Congress leader P Chidambaram suggesting that TMC never approached it for alliance talks. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said party national vice-president Pavan Verma had met Chidambaram at his Lodhi Road residence in Delhi on December 24 at 1.30pm, urging all opposition parties to come on board against BJP. While all opposition parties have pitched in the Goa assembly polls announcing their initial candidate lists, the withdrawal of nominations is on January 31 for the polls to be held on February 14. Trinamool, which is fighting in Goa with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) with a 31-9 alliance formula for the 40-seat assembly, has till now only declared a candidate list of 11, fielding two ex-chief ministers, Luizinho Faleiro and Churchill Alemao. “The Congress is trying to set a narrative that TMC has come to Goa to split anti-BJP votes. This is misleading and wrong,” Abhishek said at a press conference in Goa. “CM Mamata Banerjee had given a call to all opposition parties to come together in this fight against the BJP. MGP responded and we are fighting in an alliance. We had approached Congress. It is they who should explain why they couldn’t rise above petty personal and political interests for the people of Goa. If our intent was to split votes, why would we choose BJP-governed Goa and not a Congress-governed Punjab? TMC is fighting in Goa and Tripura which are governed by BJP and in Meghalaya which is governed by NDA allies,” he said. “Congress has failed to live up to the people’s mandate in Goa. In 2017, they had 17 MLAs, but BJP formed the government. Why? BJP and Congress are in cohorts. They are in a non-formal alliance. On the other hand, CM Mamata Banerjee has given BJP its worst electoral defeat in recent times. Bengal has rejected BJP’s politics of hatred and division. Goa will do it too. The difference between TMC and Congress is that for the last seven years we have been defeating BJP and in those seven years Congress has been losing to BJP. We hope Mr Chidambaram will hold on to the moral high ground once the results are out on March 10,” Abhishek said. On the possible unease on Faleiro being asked to vacate a seat he held, he said, “He is a stalwart. He was the first leader to take the party flag from Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. And look at who he is taking on: Vijay Sardesai. He is leading from the front.” Abhishek said that TMC will soon announce other candidates, but refused to spell out a time-frame. The last day for filing nominations in Goa is January 28.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-hits-out-at-cong-but-says-still-willing-to-walk-extra-mile/articleshow/89027659.cms||---

Three of them were in their 20s and another was 30. Four of them — two in Indore and one each in Sagar and Sehore — died within a day of getting hospitalized. Another patient in Sagar died two days after hospitalization. In Jabalpur, three patients died within three days of hospitalization and the Chhattarpur patient was admitted for five days. It’s a strong indicator that the ongoing wave is not to be taken lightly, especially since the symptoms associated with the first and second waves — respiratory distress, high fever and cough — are not always seen with the new Omicron variant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/most-deaths-in-mp-within-3-days-of-hosp/articleshow/89027685.cms||Amarjeet Singh

The complainant had accused the doctor of raping her on the pretext of marriage and then refusing to tie the nuptial knot. The accused, however, said in the court that they were in a relationship and he had never said "no" to marriage. The complainant also withdrew her application to oppose bail to the accused. The court, however, gave liberty to the complainant to come back to court, if the accused goes back on his words to marry her. A doctor in his bail application had said that the girl with whom he was in a relationship filed an FIR in Mahila police station accusing him of rape on the ground that he had refused to marry her after making physical relationship with her on the pretext of marriage. The accused said that he had never said "no" to marriage and he is still ready to marry her. The complainant also withdrew her application praying the court not to grant bail to the accused. Though advocate for the prosecution objected to grant of bail, the court of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi turned down the objection stating that the accused and the complainant have been in a relationship for a long time and during this period, they developed physical relationship. It was with mutual agreement and based on an understanding that they would get married in course of time. Since they are now ready for marriage, granting the accused bail would only be appropriate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-grants-bail-to-rape-accused-after-assurance-that-he-will-marry-her/articleshow/89027687.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh HC dismisses plea on Habibganj station renaming||BHOPAL/JABALPUR: A division bench of MP high court on Thursday dismissed a PIL filed by a Seoni lawyer challenging decision of the Railway Board to change the name of Habibganj railway station in Bhopal to Rani Kamlapati railway station and imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000 on the petitioner for wasting time of the court on a "frivolous and vexatious piece of litigation filed to get cheap publicity". The petitioner Ahmed Saeed Qureshi had contended that in 1973 Guru Habeeb Miyan donated his land to the railways on which Habibganj railway station was constructed and thus it was rightly named after the donor as Habibganj railway station. He had furrher submitted that with mala fide intention and to hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community, the name of the railway station has been changed. Counsel for the petitiioner cited various provisions of the Constitution to raise the issue of equal protection of all communities and to argue against the change of name of the railway station and prayed for a direction against the change of name. . The division bench of Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Sunita Yadav, while dismissing the petition, said: " This court fails to comprehend as to how the name of a particular railway station would lead to furtherance of public cause. The cause of public is served by the quality and quantity of amenities and facilities available at a railway station so as to facilitate the ease of travelling by train. This act of facilitation has nothing to do with the name of a particular railway station. The court said that it does not perceive any public cause involved in this petition, which appears to have been filed to gain cheap publicity. "In the absence of any public cause , the present petition is a frivolous and vexatious piece of litigation which has consumed precious time of this court, which could have been utilized in hearing & deciding more pressing matters and, therefore, the petitioner deserves to be saddled with cost.".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/hc-dismisses-plea-on-hbj-station-renaming/articleshow/89027688.cms||---

My sister-in-law Dr Megha Dubey came from Jabalpur and after taking stock of my condition she coordinated with Dr Hari Kishan in Yashoda Hospital, Hyderabad. My oxygen level dipped to 45 by then. I was airlifted to Hyderabad where after three weeks of treatment doctors on May 8 doctors decided to change my lungs.“But god was with me and as a miracle in my last medical examination on May 12 before the lung transplant my body started responding. It took four months in hospital for recovery. My weight was 78 before corona that came down to 42 kg. I was unable to stand on my own. After hospital I stayed in a rehab centre in Hyderabad for a month before coming back. I owe my life to my sister-in-law Dr Megha Dubey and Dr Hari Kishan.” “Months long treatment cost a crore and half, but my family members did everything to get me back,” he added.

Going by the Rajasthan Agricultural Credit Operation (Removal of Difficulties) Act, commercial banks, which are under direct control of the RBI, carry out attachments and auctioning of agricultural lands.

The state government is also ready to offer its share in this effort, it added. “Our government had passed a bill in the state assembly that sought to stop the auctioning of agricultural land of farmers up to five acres. But the bill couldn’t become law yet as the governor hasn’t given his assent to it.

Though it houses some swanky shops, the complex itself had become an assault on the senses, compelling DDA to refurbish it. The renovation is slated to be completed by mid-2022. Of the 11 district centres it has built since the 1970s, DDA has identified three for renovation: Nehru Place, Bhikaji Cama Place and Basant Lok Community Centre. While the upgrading of Basant Lok Community Centre has been completed, work on the other two centres is expected to be finished later this year. The land-owning agency provided Rs 26.6 crore for these in its budget estimate for 2022-23 approved on Monday. A DDA spokesperson said that the Nehru Place district centre, built in 1972 over 94.4 acres, had 89 buildings. The complex was handed over to South Delhi Municipal Corporation for maintenance about 30 years ago. He entire market was in a dilapidated condition and required immediate remodelling. “DDA started the upgradation work in December 2019 after getting clearance SDMC,” the spokesperson said. The renovation involves improving the building façades, drainage system, plazas and the tensile structures and seating arrangement, including overhauling the staircases. DDA is also constructing 10 new toilet blocks at the complex. The spokesperson added, “An amphitheatre is also planned in the plaza. Work has also started on a multilevel car park. All these are likely to be completed by June.” A proposed skywalk from the Nehru Place metro station to the plaza near Satyam Cinema would come up later. DDA also started the revamp of Bhikaji Cama Place after getting clearance by SDMC in 2019. The spokesperson said that work on a multi-level car parking is part of the project there and work is expected to start from March. He said the Bhikaji Cama Place project involved façade improvement, renovation of the basement area, improvement of space, etc. “Various plazas are being developed in between the buildings using granite flooring and featuring tensile structures of different heights along with new seating arrangements,” the official said, adding that kiosks would also be put up on the complex, apart from escalators and elevators at several locations. “An amphitheatre with LED screens has also been proposed in the central area of the district centre which is under construction. Stalls of various sizes and a double-storied shop have been planned and are under construction,” the official said, adding that the overall work is likely to be completed by July.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/nehru-palace-complex-to-don-a-new-look-as-it-turns-50-this-year/articleshow/89026432.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It’s a powerful indication not to take this recent surge lightly or consider Omicron a ‘mild’ variant because in most of these cases, the patients were brought to hospital late. These 18 deaths have taken place in seven districts — Indore (7), Bhopal (3), Jabalpur (3), Sagar (2) and one each in Chhattarpur, Gwalior and Sehore — in a 30-day period between December 20 and January 18. Three of them were in their 20s and another was 30. Four of them — two in Indore and one each in Sagar and Sehore — died within a day of getting hospitalized. Another patient in Sagar died two days after hospitalization and the Gwalior death happened after three days in hospital (another was reported on January 20). In Jabalpur, three patients died within three days of hospitalization and the Chhattarpur patient was admitted for five days. The longest hospital stays (11-12 days) prior to death were in Indore, and both happened in the early days of the wave on December 20 and 21. Since then, the longest stay is just five days in Chhatarpur. In many cases, the patients weren’t brought in for seemingly other ailments, but tested positive during mandatory testing at the time of hospitalization. Sehore CMHO Dr Sudhir Dehariya said, “A 63-year old patient, suffering from cardiac issues, was admitted to a hospital in Bhopal and died the very same day. His sample later came positive for Covid-19. He was not admitted for treatment of Covid.” The Chhattarpur patient was 70 years old and was admitted for treatment of chronic diseases, like tuberculosis, anaemia and other health complications, said CMHO Dr Vijay Pathuria said. “His samples tested positive for Covid. He was in hospital for five days before he died,” he added. In Gwalior, a 25-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for delivery in a serious condition on January 8, CMHO Dr Manish Sharma told TOI. She was not vaccinated and died. Another youngster who died was a 30-year-old from Morena, who succumbed within a day of hospitalization. “He was suffering from severe chest ailments and a disease that causes blood vomit. His rapid antigen test came positive but the RT PCR was negative. The death was not of a Covid-19 patient. So far, there have been no deaths due to Covid-19 in Morena in the recent wave,” CMHO Dr Rakesh Sharma told TOI. In Jabalpur, the three men who died were aged 88, 59 and 50. All three had various chronic complications and were admitted for treatment of those diseases but tested positive later, CMHO Dr Ratnesh Kuraria told TOI. In Sagar, both patients who died were aged 22 years. Officials said that while a woman died after two days of hospitalization, a man died within a day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/66-deaths-in-3rd-wave-happened-within-3-days-of-hospitalisation/articleshow/89027700.cms||Amarjeet Singh

He doesn’t even have the time to meet a former chief minister. After waiting for one-and-half months for an appointment, the CM’s office on Wednesday gave me time to meet him at his residence at 11:15 am on Friday. However, the appointment was cancelled on Thursday. Today, I have been told that the CM cannot meet me because he is busy.”“ I will sit in protest outside his residence on Friday from 11:15 am. He won’t meet me, that is alright. I will still sit in front of his residence. You have to arrest me, do it. But this kind of behaviour will cost you dear, Shivraj Singh ji,” he said.Singh said that thousands of acres of land is coming under submergence because of the two irrigation projects and many villages across four districts will be either partially or fully submerged. “The government is paying very little compensation to the affected farmers,” he said.Last month, Digvijaya toured many of these villages and spoke to the affected farmers there. Congress claimed that the farmers are protesting against the insufficient package being offered to them by the state. Digvijaya Singh had wanted to take 15 affected farmers of each of the two proposed irrigation projects to meet the chief minister, but the appointment has been cancelled by CM’s office, Congress alleged.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/digvijaya-singh-to-protest-outside-cm-house-today/articleshow/89027704.cms||Suchandana Gupta

A video went viral on Thursday in which Pragya is seen explaining, “Alcohol, whether cheap or expensive, also works as medicine. In Ayurveda, alcohol is medicine when taken in limited quantities. But when consumed in an unlimited manner, it is poison. Everyone should understand. Those who take it in large quantities should stop doing so.” Pragya said this when asked for her reaction to the new excise policy in which the government has cut duty on foreign liquor by 10% to 13%.  Reacting to Pragya’s statement, PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja tweeted, “Bhopal’s BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur says liquor does the work of a medicine, but harms if taken in unlimited quantity. She says liquor is not harmful if taken in a limited amounts. This everyone should understand. The MP is not opposing alcohol, only its quantity.” In another tweet, Saluja said, “Seems like the entire BJP is working to drown the state in liquor. It is being made cheaper and is being made available in homes, malls, supermarkets and airports. In BJP rule, drink with a lot of love and be intoxicated so that you never know the truth of government.” Watch Madhya Pradesh: Congress launches attack on Pragya Thakur regarding her ‘alcohol’ comment||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cong-takes-a-dig-at-pragya-thakurs-alcohol-comment/articleshow/89027706.cms||---

We are convening meetings of health officials concerned to devise ways to properly ensure home isolation,” said a panchayat representative. According to officials, an index patient is leaving behind a trail of primary contacts which also results in such a huge number of positive cases. Eleven other local bodies in the district also recorded TPR above 60% on Thursday. About 43 local bodies in the district now have a weekly TPR of above 40% while only 15 local bodies have recorded a weekly TPR of less than 30%.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Devikulam title deeds: Order based on 2019 decision, no one will lose land, says K Rajan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In the wake of protests, revenue minister K Rajan on Wednesday justified the government decision to cancel title deeds — known as Raveendran pattayams — issued in violation of the Land Assignment Rules, 1964, in Devikulam and said the order was issued on the basis of a cabinet decision taken on August 7, 2019. He also said no one would be evicted from their land. The decision has kicked up a row in Idukki, with CPM leader M M Mani openly expressing his displeasure and the CPI district leadership and various groups opposing the move to cancel the deeds after 23 years. They contended that the deeds were issued at a 'Pattaya mela' and they should have been regularized instead. The minister said the government's objective is to give authentic title deeds to deserving people. No one will lose their land and the titles have been cancelled as there were rule violations while assigning them. He said the titles (that are now being cancelled) are of no use to many assignees because of irregularities in assigning them. They can't avail loans, remit taxes or even sell their land. Rajan said select titles alone cannot be cancelled, but all those eligible will get fresh titles and steps are being taken to issue fresh titles within two months. The government decision is to cancel 532 titles, which include 426 assigned as per the Land Assignment Rules, 1964 and 106 titles assigned as per the Kanan Devan Hill (reservation and assignment of vested lands) Rules, 1977. Only a tahsildar is empowered to issue titles according to the Land Assignment Rules while it is the district collector who issues titles as per the KDH Rules. M I Raveendran had issued these titles while he was holding the charge of additional tahsildar in Devikulam for some time. The minister said these titles would not pass the test of law owing to this reason. The government has decided to cancel the titles as per rule 8 (3) of the Land Assignment Rules, 1964 and rules 21 (1) and 21 (4) of Kanan Devan Hill (reservation and assignment of vested lands) Rules, 1977. These rules allow cancellation of the registry in case of misrepresentation of facts, assignment in excess of powers delegated to the assigning authority or irregularity in procedure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/order-based-on-2019-decision-no-one-will-lose-land-minister/articleshow/89027709.cms||---

It is a method of germinating seeds in a medium which is made with medicinal plants. As the farming method is adopted from Wayanad, the paddy variety they cultivate, namely ‘Manuratna’ has been selected.The cultivation is being started by Kalliyoor grama panchayat and krishi bhavan as part of the carbon neutral project. As the first stage of the programme, 25 acres of fallow land which is closely connected to the Vellayani backwaters have been obtained from 15 landlords. The cultivation will be executed by the Pandarakari Padasekharam committee by utilizing the employees of national rural employment guarantee scheme. The land preparation started on January 17 and will finish within 25 days which includes digging channels and other soil preparations.This method of farming does not use any type of chemical fertilizers and manures. As the seeds are sprouted in a medicinal medium, the plants will have a good immunity power, taste, pest control and disease control abilities. The Vellayani lake is the only water source for three panchayats. Organic farming will maintain the backwaters pollution free. The scheme will also provide employment opportunities to national rural employment guarantee workers. The budget for the scheme is around 30 lakhs.“This project is the result of our one-year of hard work. We had to organize several meetings and convince the landlords to give their lands for cultivation. Presently, more people are enquiring at the agricultural offices about giving their lands for cultivation. In the coming years, further steps will be taken to expand paddy cultivation by adopting more fallow land organic farming methods and to market unique organic products. As the summer season is arriving, we should also take care of the availability of water. We are planning to supply the rice in markets under the panchayat’s brand name,” said Swapna C, Kalliyoor agricultural office official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/panchayat-takes-a-leaf-out-of-wayanad-tribals/articleshow/89027712.cms||---

The development comes in the wake of a rise in Covid cases across the state. Currently, Dehradun is conducting nearly 10,000 tests per day and the number may increase in the coming days, causing a rush at medical facilities. To prevent crowding at hospitals, the health department-run booth will test around 300 samples per day. “The booth will operate from the Parade Ground. We will start conducting RT-PCR tests from 9 am. Personnel from our department will man the booth, which has the capacity to conduct around 300 tests per day. Gradually, we will increase its capacity and also the time for which the booth remains operational,” said Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer. Residents can get themselves tested at the booth for free without the hassle of going to a hospital. They just need to carry their identification cards. The results of the test can be checked online in a day’s time. Officials believe that after the booth starts working, people, who avoid going to hospitals for fear of contracting the virus, will come forward to get themselves tested. “Every day, we will send 15% of the total samples for genome sequencing to check for Omicron. Once this project takes off, we will start similar booths at other public places, including the Clock Tower and Paltan Bazaar, in the city,” said Upreti. District authorities told TOI that in order to set up the testing booth, the ground was levelled and provisions were made nearby for a proper drainage in case of a rainfall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/to-avoid-rush-at-hosps-health-dept-sets-up-covid-testing-booth-at-parade-ground-in-doon/articleshow/89025206.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has already raked up a controversy saying that rejection of the tableau, which included the image of Sree Narayana Guru, was the rejection of Guru by the BJP government in the Centre. Vijayan said the proposed tableau of Kerala carries a ‘very strong social message' and it has ‘high relevance in the contemporary social scenario'. “Our tableau included the image of Sree Narayana Guru, the great philosopher and social reformer, who led the renaissance movement of Kerala in the last century. His thoughts and actions attracted not only national but worldwide attention…he has fought obscurantist practices which had led to division among human beings and he propagated the philosophy of universal brotherhood, freedom and right to education for all,'' he said in the letter. “The message the tableau can send to the younger generation of the country is very valuable and I seek urgent intervention of the Hon'ble Prime Minister to get it included in the coming Republic Day parade'', Vijayan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/include-kerala-tableau-in-r-day-parade-cm-writes-to-modi/articleshow/89027725.cms||---

There were widespread complaints that several college authorities were suppressing Covid infection levels on campus to facilitate for the student union election.  The syndicate has also decided to restart the convocation ceremony. Whom all to be made part of the convocation programme, apart from doctorate degree holders, would be decided after further deliberations. It was governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s suggestion to invite President Ram Nath Kovind to the convocation ceremony and offer him DLitt that led to the recent controversies.  The syndicate has also decided to issue notification for private registration for degree and postgraduate courses. The decision in this regard was taken in view of the special sanction given by the government. As per the provisions in the yet to be functional Sreenarayanaguru Open University, no other university in the state has the right to offer private studies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-college-union-polls-on-jan-25/articleshow/89027726.cms||---

The women volunteer group, to be formed under the Nirbhaya programme, will be named ‘Nirbhaya volunteers’. They will offer voluntary service to women, especially those who are vulnerable, with an aim to eradicate sexual assault and violence against them. As per the proposal, women squads will be formed in each of the districts by selecting 10 members from each panchayat, 30 members from each municipality and 100 members from each municipal corporation. The members selected will be given uniformly coloured saris with a metal badge for pinning and an identity card. A Nirbhaya volunteer can report to police officers ranging from the rank of a sub-inspector to a district police chief. They will have to wear the special uniforms only when they are on duty along with police officers.Though they are provided a uniform and a badge, a Nirbhaya volunteer are expected to adopt passive policing techniques and not active aggressive methods. They can operate covertly and overtly with the primary objective of preventing crimes against women. Their tasks include informing the police about any crime against women in their locality, gathering relevant data related to offences against children and women, keeping a watch on mentally challenged girl children in the wards, girl children who are living with their stepfathers, girl children in the house of alcoholic addicts etc.They will also covertly maintain surveillance of vulnerable spots where there are incidents of violence against women and children or such places which are potential spots of such crimes. Further, the volunteers will keep a vigil in the public transport, and public places and will also share information regarding sale of arrack, drugs, pan masala or any other contrabands to the police.The police have come up with the proposal as the crime against women and children are on the rise, in spite of numerous awareness campaigns.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/police-propose-setting-up-of-nirbhaya-volunteer-groups/articleshow/89027728.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Lions at Sakkarbaug zoo to be part of coronavirus vaccine trial||AHMEDABAD: As the third wave of the Covid pandemic sweeps the country, no one is safe – not even the king of the jungle. With the novel coronavirus claiming the lives of two lions in a Chennai zoo, the Centre has decided to give the vaccine developed by ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE) in Hisar, Haryana, a shot. And, Sakkarbaug in Junagadh is one of the six zoos in the country where clinical trials will be conducted on lions and leopards to test its efficacy in keeping animals safe. Sakkarbaug zoo, which is a nodal facility for lion breeding in the country, houses more than 70 lions and 50 leopards. The trial, however, will be conducted only on 15 animals. Designed specifically for animals, the vaccine will be administered in two doses with a gap of 28 days between the two. The animals will be observed for antibodies for nearly two months after the second dose is administered. Confirming the news, Abhishek Kumar, deputy conservator of forests, who is also the director of Sakkarbaug zoo, said: “We received communication from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) that the zoo will be a centre for clinical trials on lions and leopards. The trials will begin once the ministry grants the final approval.” Trials at zoos with more than 15 animals of same speciesOfficials said the ministry directed ICAR-NRCE, Hisar, to develop a vaccine for big cats in zoos. The direction was given after 15 lions at the Vandalur zoo in Chennai tested positive for coronavirus in June 2021, with two of them succumbing to it. After developing the vaccine, the Hisar facility applied to the MoEFCC for clinical trials of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed for lions, tigers, and leopards. “While granting permission, the ministry specified that only those zoos with more than 15 animals of one species in captivity will be permitted to conduct the trials,” the officials said. The other five zoos chosen for trials are in Delhi, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Bhopal, and Jaipur. Meanwhile, Sakkarbaug zoo has still not received the protocol to administer the experimental vaccine. “It is clear that the vaccine will be given to animals in captivity. Under no circumstance will it be administered to the big cats in the wild. However, if any captured wild cat exhibits Covid symptoms, it can be given the vaccine once it is approved,” the officials said. The possibility of animals contracting novel coronavirus first came to light when a fouryear-old female tiger, Nadia, and six others tested positive at the Bronx Zoo in New York City in April 2020. The animals was infected after getting exposed to an asymptomatic zookeeper. The first confirmed incident of animals contracting Covid in India was when eight Asiatic Lions at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad tested positive. Zoo officials raised an alarm when they saw the pack of lions wheezing with dry cough, nasal discharge, and loss of appetite.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/lions-at-sakkarbaug-zoo-to-be-part-of-coronavirus-vaccine-trial/articleshow/89027729.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt reply sought over ‘shorter’ candidates||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has asked the state authorities to reply to the question posed by 10 Lok Rakshak candidates whose heights were found to be less than what was measured in 2019 despite the remeasurement that was carried out following court’s order. The 10 candidates, who had applied for Lok Rakshak Dal and police sub-inspector posts, had approached the high court complaining that their heights met the minimum requirement criteria when measured by the Lok Rakshak Recruitment Board in 2019 recruitment drive. However, in 2021, the same board found their heights to be less than what was measured earlier. To eliminate any doubt, the high court on December 29, 2021 ordered the government to have the candidates’ heights measured again at Sola Civil Hospital. During a hearing on Wednesday, the additional government pleader submitted a report from the Sola Civil Hospital to the court and submitted that during remeasurement, none of the candidates met the minimum height requirement — 165 cm for a male candidate and 155 cm for a female candidate. It was submitted that no change was found in any of the cases. Responding to this, the petitioners’ advocate Sonal Vyas said, “This is not palatable.” She argued that the same board had measured their height during an earlier recruitment drive and certified that they were tall enough to meet the eligibility criteria. She submitted that the height of the candidates could not have been decreased naturally, and hinted at a possible mistake on part of the authorities. She further said, “I am unable to deal with the situation that in the second measurement this has happened. This seems irrational.” The lawyer requested the court to allow these candidates to appear for the written test. The government lawyer informed the court that the written text was scheduled for February end. The high court asked the government to file an affidavit in reply to the petitions and posted further hearing on February 27. The court has permitted the candidates to approach them in case of any difficulty.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-reply-sought-over-shorter-candidates/articleshow/89027731.cms||---

You will spot even senior citizens and persons with disabilities standing in these queues. Call it one step forward and two steps back, while the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) introduced home vaccination facility for citizens above 50 and those with disabilities last October, no such arrangement has been made for testing. Many a time, these AMC domes run out of kits and the long wait is rendered futile, inconveniencing them further. “As there is no home testing service by the AMC, I had to stand in a queue for almost one-and-a-half hours near Vastrapur lake on Tuesday. Around 11.30am they announced that they had run out of kits. They asked us to come back at 2pm but were not sure if they would have the kits by then,” said Alkeshbhai Soni, 67, a resident of Bodakdev. Soni had to call up the private lab to get the test done at home. Shilaj resident Gautambhai Dave, 64, and his wife decided to get themselves tested after some family members took ill with Covid-like symptoms. “I tried searching for AMC’s doorstep testing service and even called up on their helpline. But I was told no such service was being provided,” Dave said. Dave and his wife got themselves tested at home by a private lab. Both of them tested negative but had to pay for this service. He said that during the second wave, the GMRI-run 104 service conducted testing at home but even that had been suspended now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fed-up-of-queues-elderly-seek-home-covid-testing-service/articleshow/89027739.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Around 10,000 doctors had planned to go on strike from January 20. The decision has come as a much-needed respite for the government at a time when the state is grappling with a record-breaking surge in Covid-19 cases. The government held a series of meetings late night on Wednesday and through Thursday to try and avert a situation that could cripple the health administration. This is the third time in the last two years that the doctors have called off their strike upon assurance from the government that their demands would be met. Unlike the previous times, where the government did not come out with a notification approving their list of demands, GGDF members are confident that the situation will be different this time around. “One of the reasons is that in-service, GMERS and Gujarat Medical Teachers’ Association (GMTA) doctors came under the umbrella organization of GGDF to collectively voice their demands. We are sure the government will surely meet all our demands,” said a GMTA member. The state government has decided to form a three-member committee comprising health minister Rushikesh Patel, finance minister Kanubhai Desai and road, building and transport minister Purnesh Modi, said Dr Rajnish Patel, president of the association. He said that the government committee has sanctioned and solved all the issues raised by GMTA, GMERS and other doctors who had joined the protests.

Hoteliers say the dip in tourist influx has in turn resulted in a steep fall in hotel occupancy in the month of January when a brisk business is expected. “Omicron has hit the tourism industry hard. If we talk about Mussoorie, we started seeing a dip in footfall since December and in January, we are witnessing merely 5 to 10% hotel occupancy, which otherwise used to be 30 to 40%,” said Sandeep Sahni, president, Uttarakhand hotel association. Generally, the town witnesses a surge in tourism on weekends but hoteliers say that tourist footfall remained dismal throughout the month. The famous Mall road, which is otherwise crowded with tourists, wears a deserted look these days.  "Local businesses have been severely impacted by Covid- 19 in the past two years. We were looking to recover but the low tourist footfall triggered by Omicron is worrisome for the economy,” says Rajat Aggarwal, president, Mussoorie traders association. Local businessmen said a good spell of snowfall always attract tourists but weather, too, did not work in our favour this time. “Though the town witnessed a mild snowfall last week, we are eagerly waiting for a good spell and hope that the footfall is up by next month,” said a shopkeeper. In Nainital too, the surge in cases has posed new challenges to the hard-hit tourism industry. Though snow prediction on weekend has rekindled hopes of hoteliers, the new set of curbs is likely to be a dampener. Ved Sah, secretary, hotel association, Nainital, told TOI that all bookings have been cancelled. “Since January, there has been a drop in tourist influx. Even if it snows, About 90% hotels in Nainital have zero occupancy. Naresh Gupta, GM, Mannu Maharani, said people are panicky and avoiding travel.

Before Pandya could figure out what was happening, one of them took out a knife and snatched his mobile phone, a smart watch, golden earrings and a chain and a gold ring and Rs 1,500 all amounting to Rs 24,300. The two then took him to the nearby ATM and asked him to withdraw money. However, Pandya in his complaint stated that he entered a wrong PIN and told them that he was not able to withdraw money. He was then taken to another ATM from where he managed to escape.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/30-year-old-robbed-of-24000/articleshow/89027751.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Teacher accuses ex-husband of stalking and harassment||AHMEDABAD: A 37-year-old primary school teacher from Sargasan in Gandhinagar filed a complaint with Infocity police on Wednesday, accusing her former husband of stalking and sexually harassing her. A native of Palanpur in Banaskantha, her FIR states that she has been teaching at the school for the past three years. She had left her hometown following harassment by her ex-husband, a resident of Sector 13 in Gandhinagar. She said that she had married him in 2002 in keeping with the wishes of her family members. They also have a nine-year-old daughter. Nearly 14 years into their marriage, they decided to part ways and got divorced on May 2, 2016. However, soon after the divorce, he allegedly began harassing her and issuing threats for leaving him. Fed up, she had even approached the women’s police in Palanpur but later chose to forgive him and left for Gandhinagar with her daughter. When he learnt that she had settled down in Gandhinagar, he shifted to the capital and began harassing her again. According to her complaint, he had been following her to the school and abusing her for the past two months. He also allegedly threatened to defame her if she refused to go back to him and had been sending her obscene messages on the cellphone. The police have booked him for stalking and criminal intimidation.

---||Ahmedabad||Bank strike on February 23, 24 to protest privatization bid in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Public sector banks across Gujarat are set to join the nationwide strike by banks as well as other central trade unions on February 23 and 24.  Bankers are protesting the proposed privatisation of public sector banks as part of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill. Some 3,669 branches of nationalised banks across Gujarat are expected to remain closed on these two days. Transactions worth Rs 17,000 crore are expected to take a hit due to this. Since the strike will be held on the fourth week of the month, banks will operate only for three days due to bank holidays on Saturday and Sunday. Some 50,000 bank employees are expected to go on strike. Employees of the State Bank of India have not shown their support yet. Sharing the bankers’ grievances, Janak Rawal, general secretary of MGBEA, said, “Bank officials and employees are against the banking regulation act which proposes to privatise national banks. Public money is for public welfare and it should not be moved to private hands. In fact, recruitment in the banking sector will also take a hit with the proposed privatisation of public sector banks.” Government schemes are effectively implemented by public sector banks and instead of strengthening them, the government is pushing to shut them down, Rawal added. Besides the bid for privatisation, bankers are also opposing the proposed amendment in labour laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bank-strike-on-feb-23-24-to-protest-privatization-bid/articleshow/89027761.cms||---

The yellow metal price continued its steady rally over the past 10 days and rose by Rs 300 against Wednesday’s Rs 49,900 per 10 gram. The rally in gold price in the local market traced the trends in the international market as the investors began moving towards safe haven investments. Gold price surged by $30 per ounce in the international market and settled at $1,845.6 per ounce. Analysts said that surge in global inflation coupled with geopolitical tensions just ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting scheduled next week led to panic among investors who made safe haven investments in gold. “The gold price rally coincided with recent announcement by US President Joe Biden, of providing additional defence military aid to Ukraine,” said a source. Sources said that higher inflation numbers are dampening the long-term sentiment in the marketplace and as a consequence, safe-haven buying increased too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/after-a-fortnight-yellow-metal-price-breaches-50k-mark/articleshow/89027763.cms||---

Sustained healthy demand from government initiatives in water sanitation and improving real estate demand will see the sector’s revenues grow another 7-10% next fiscal.  The growth will come despite the high base, the rating agency said, based on an analysis of 15 PVC pipes and fittings manufacturers, which represent about 35% of the organized domestic PVC pipes industry. “Furthermore, operating profitability will also be healthy, despite some moderation from the peak logged last fiscal due to a surge in input prices. Healthy cash accruals and strong balance sheets will keep credit profiles stable, notwithstanding an expected increase in capital expenditure (capex) over the current and next fiscals,” added Crisil.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/pvc-pipe-makers-set-for35-revenue-growth-crisil/articleshow/89027766.cms||---

The court was apprised of the place the accused had allegedly arranged for storage of contraband, for purification and distribution. They were alleged of being involved in payments and clearing of the goods.

A day earlier, Mahto had termed the JPSC and JSSC as the most corrupt councils in the country on social media.“If the Hemant sarkar does not prepare a domicile and recruitment policy based on the Khatiyan (land records) and does not remove the compulsory languages from the list of regional languages within a month, I will resign from JMM on 20/02/2022,” Mahto wrote in his Facebook post. Notably, JMM, in its 2019 assembly election manifesto titled ‘Nishchay Patra’, had promised to undo the state residents’ policy implemented by the then Raghubar Das government and replace it with a new one which will consider those having land records dating back to 1932 as a “Jharkhandi”. However, after assuming office, the government has largely remained ignorant about its promise.While Mahto did not respond to TOI’s calls, the JMM leadership in Ranchi refused to comment on the issue citing it as an internal matter of the party.Sources close to Mahto, however, claimed that his attack at the party leadership was aimed at keeping his young OBC vote bank in the Silli assembly constituency in good humour.Mahto, who shot to fame in 2014 after defeating Ajsu-P chief Sudesh Mahto from the latter’s home turf, Silli, is considered close to the party’s working president and chief minister, Hemant Soren.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/ex-silli-mla-threatens-to-quit-jmm/articleshow/89027779.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The Morcha has, however, asked all its members to remain united for getting pay-scale.The state cabinet chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday approved the rules stating that all 62,000 para-teachers would be called assistant teachers and would serve in schools till attaining 60 years of age. The salary of the trained teachers who have passed teacher eligibility test (TET) would be increased by 50% from January 1, 2022, while others will get 40% hike. The non-TET teachers would get an additional hike of 10% after they pass an assessment test. The teachers would also get an annual hike of four per cent.A member of the morcha, Sanjay Dubey, said that the struggle for our demands started from November 1, 2004 with a protest in front of the Raj Bhawan. Stating that earlier they were being paid between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 per month, he pointed out that with low salary and irregular payment the para-teachers were facing economic hardship.He stated, “Regarding pay-scale, the minister has assured that he would look into the matter. So, now our entire attention is on providing quality education in the government schools.”Another member Pradyuman Kumar Singh congratulated all para-teachers for becoming assistant teachers and expressed gratitude towards the CM and the education minister Jagannath Mahto. He said, “It was result of commitment shown by all members of the organization. The issue of wage scale for assistant teachers is pending. We would all jointly work to achieve the goal.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/para-teachers-welcome-state-cabinet-move-on-service-rules/articleshow/89027780.cms||Sanjay Sahay

---||Dehradun||BJP releases first list of 59 candidates for U’khand, attempts to balance caste equations||Dehradun: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday released its first list of 59 candidates for the state assembly elections, scheduled to be held in a single phase on February 14. The list of 59 out of 70 seats did not spring any major surprises as most of the sitting MLAs were retained by the party. However, the choice of candidates indicated an attempt to balance caste equations by the saffron party. “Out of the 59 candidates, 22 are Thakurs, 15 are Brahmins, six come from the reserved category, and three from the Baniya community,” Prahlad Joshi, BJP’s election in-charge for Uttarakhand, told mediapersons. As for the remaining 11 seats, Joshi said the candidates will soon be announced by the party. Analysing BJP’s social engineering formula based on the first list of candidates, political analyst SMA Kazmi said, “Brahmins and those from the traders’ community have been traditional supporters of BJP in Uttarakhand. By giving 15 tickets to Brahmins and three to Baniya candidates, BJP has tried to woo its traditional voter base.” He added, “According to a conservative estimate, Thakurs make up 35% of the state’s population and 25% are Brahmins voters. Therefore, both Congress and BJP are likely to follow the tried-and-tested Thakur-Brahmin caste equation in ticket distribution.” As was expected, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has been fielded from Khatima, a seat which he currently holds, and state BJP chief Madan Kaushik will contest from his stronghold of Haridwar. Similarly, cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal has been fielded from the Narendra Nagar seat, and Ganesh Joshi will again contest from the Mussoorie constituency. Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj has also been fielded from the Chaubattakhal seat again. Former Congress rebel Umesh Sharma Kau, about whom it was speculated that he may rejoin the Congress along with Harak Singh Rawat, has been fielded from his traditional bastion of Raipur. The saffron party has also fielded Saurabh Bahuguna, son of former chief minister Vijay Bahuguna, from Sitarganj. Besides, urban development minister Bansidhar Bhagat has been fielded from Kaladhungi, Swami Yatishwaranand from Haridwar (rural), Pradeep Batra from Roorkee and Bishan Singh Chufal from Didihat assembly seat. Incidentally, the party denied tickets to 10 sitting MLAs, including Ritu Khanduri, daughter of former CM Maj Gen BC Khanduri (retd). Ritu is presently MLA from Yamkeshwar seat in Pauri Garhwal. In her place, the party has nominated Renu Bisht, who defected from Congress sometime back, for the seat. Among the new inclusions in the list is Ramsharan Nautiyal, father of popular singer Jubin Nautiyal, who has been given the ticket to contest from Chakrata. The BJP also included six women in its first list. Savita Kapoor, wife of eight-time MLA Harbans Kapoor, who recently passed away, has been fielded from Dehradun Cantt, a seat held by her husband. Other major women candidates include Sarita Arya, who recently defected from Congress. She will fight from the Nainital reserved seat. Rekha Arya, the incumbent woman and child development minister, has been fielded from the Someshwar assembly constituency. A surprising inclusion on the list is Kunwarani Devyani Singh, the wife of four-time MLA Kunwar Pranav Singh ‘Champion’. She has been nominated for the Khanpur seat, which is represented by her husband currently. Party sources told TOI that the controversial MLA, known for his gun-toting ways, had been demanding a ticket for his wife. While his wife’s name was included, Champion himself has been left out of the list which poll watchers said was perhaps in keeping with the ‘one family, one ticket’ line adopted by the party. Political observers pointed out that several sitting MLAs who have been given tickets are likely to face the challenge of anti-incumbency. “Anticipating a mass defection -- similar to what recently happened in Uttar Pradesh -- the BJP gave tickets to several sitting MLAs in its first list despite a massive wave of anti-incumbency against them. We were expecting that the party would drop at least 20 sitting MLAs this time. These MLAs will have their task cut out to retain their seats, ” said Jai Singh Rawat, Doon-based political watcher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/bjp-releases-first-list-of-59-candidates-for-ukhand-attempts-to-balance-caste-equations/articleshow/89025255.cms||Gaurav Talwar

It is a method of germinating seeds in a medium which is made with medicinal plants. As the farming method is adopted from Wayanad, the paddy variety they cultivate, namely ‘Manuratna’ has been selected. The cultivation is being started by Kalliyoor grama panchayat and krishi bhavan as part of the carbon neutral project. As the first stage of the programme, 25 acres of fallow land which is closely connected to the Vellayani backwaters have been obtained from 15 landlords. The cultivation will be executed by the Pandarakari Padasekharam committee by utilizing the employees of national rural employment guarantee scheme. The land preparation started on January 17 and will finish within 25 days which includes digging channels and other soil preparations. This method of farming does not use any type of chemical fertilizers and manures. As the seeds are sprouted in a medicinal medium, the plants will have a good immunity power, taste, pest control and disease control abilities. The Vellayani lake is the only water source for three panchayats. Organic farming will maintain the backwaters pollution free. The scheme will also provide employment opportunities to national rural employment guarantee workers. The budget for the scheme is around 30 lakhs. “This project is the result of our one-year of hard work. We had to organize several meetings and convince the landlords to give their lands for cultivation. Presently, more people are enquiring at the agricultural offices about giving their lands for cultivation. In the coming years, further steps will be taken to expand paddy cultivation by adopting more fallow land organic farming methods and to market unique organic products. As the summer season is arriving, we should also take care of the availability of water. We are planning to supply the rice in markets under the panchayat’s brand name,” said Swapna C, Kalliyoor agricultural office official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/panchayat-takes-a-leaf-out-of-wayanad-tribals/articleshow/89025942.cms||---

State capital Ranchi has so far managed to inoculate 23% of its 2.11 lakh eligible beneficiaries while coal capital Dhanbad has vaccinated 22% of its 1.95 lakh beneficiaries.The two steel towns -- Bokaro and Jamshedpur – have vaccinated 37% and 40% of their targeted population, respectively, which is 1.49 lakh (in Bokaro) and 1.66 lakh (in Jamshedpur).The rest of the districts have covered somewhere between 20%-30% of their population.But Jamtara’s vaccination status has emerged as a major concern for health authorities both at the state and at the district level.Speaking to TOI on the matter, Jamtara civil surgeon Dr Surendra Kumar Mishra said, “We conducted an emergency meeting on Thursday to chalk out modalities to push up the vaccination numbers. After the meeting, it was decided that we will organise a special three-day drive in Narayanpur block, where the vaccination coverage is barely 5% and because of which the overall coverage of the district has gone down. We are eyeing to achieve at least 50% coverage through the special drive by January 26.” He added, “Barring Narayanpur, the other three blocks in the district, namely Nala, Kundait and Jamtara, have a coverage rate that ranges from 20% to 25%. In addition to this, some of the vaccine-related data hasn’t been updated completely, which could be a reason why Jamtara is lagging behind.”A health department official said that Narayanpur is largely a Muslim-dominated block where vaccine hesitancy has always been higher compared to other parts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jamtara-plans-special-3-day-vaccine-drive-for-teenagers/articleshow/89027782.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Indore||Covid positivity rate doubles in a week in Indore||INDORE: Positivity rate of samples tested for Covid-19 in the district has doubled in the last seven days from earlier in a week-to-week comparison, shows analysis of record. The analysis of the daily health bulletin showed that the average weekly positivity rate from January 13 to 19 remained at 18.12% that had risen from 9.78% between January 7 to 13. Positivity rate is a measure of the number of samples turning out positive for Covid-19 infections out of 100 samples tested in an area. The rise in positivity rate is a matter of concern because it helps in decoding the spread of Covid-19 infection in the population through testing of suspects. Crisis committee member Dr Nishant Khare told TOI, “Covid-19 virus has been spreading on the expected lines on almost all parameters for now. The district is currently in community spread mode with a very high rate of infection.” “Omicron variant has a very high rate of infection so doubling of positivity rate Covid-19 cases is very fast”, said Dr Khare. On the question of expected positivity rate Dr Khare said, “Whatever the available knowledge suggests that the omicron is peaking in an around 30% positivity rate and then began to dip. Based on it, the district could reach that value anywhere in one week or so.” “The relief among all this is less than two percent hospitalisation and very less requiring oxygen or ICU care. The oxygen requirement hasn’t increased proportionately”, added Dr Khare. The district has been witnessing a major surge in Covid-19 positivity rate since January 1 with a rise in daily infections amidst a third wave spike. The district between December 1 and 15 witnessed a positivity rate of 0.1% which remained between 0.02% and 0.04% from July to November, showed record. Since then, it kept on increasing and crossed over 1% in the last couple of days in December. The records further suggested that the sample testing had increased slightly to 67532 from 59077 in a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/positivity-rate-doubles-in-a-week/articleshow/89027787.cms||Antriksh Singh

The PG-NEET counselling will begin in a few days and these PG doctors will report to hospitals around February-end. Another problem that hospitals could face in the next few months is post-graduate doctors going on a two-month leave before their final exams in April. Medical colleges have requested doctors not to take the two-month leave before exams as that would overwhelm the already staff-strained hospitals. Added to these two challenges is the number of post-graduate doctors testing Covid-positive daily. “Our PGs serve in three major hospitals. The existing PGs are under tremendous pressure since there is a delay in the arrival of the first-year PGs by nearly eight months. The workload is now balanced with the help of MBBS interns. The entire healthcare facility is overburdened. The only blessing is that though there are many cases, the hospitalisation ratio is lower compared to the first and second waves. However, we are worried about what will happen in the coming days when the cases peak,” Dr B Unnikrishnan, the dean of Kasturba Medical College, said. The college takes in130 post-graduates every year. Dr Unnikrishnan said two to three post-graduate interns test positive almost every day. “The PGs who are working long hours without much of a break and are testing positive as the new variant is spreading faster. We have to isolate and quarantine those PGs. As a result, the workforce has shrunk,” said Dr Antony Sylvan D’Souza, the dean of the Father Muller Medical College. Dr Antony also pointed out that since the hospital system is choked and the workforce is under stress, the college has requested final-year post-graduates not take leave but continue to work. “Going on en-masse leave will totally collapse the system. The PGs have agreed to our request,” he said. The medical colleges expect the arrival of fresh PGs latest by the first week of March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/with-no-fresh-pgs-medical-colleges-grapple-with-staff-crunch/articleshow/89025259.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The elephant, which is believed to be 50 years old, had collapsed at a farm near Kururegundi Halla near Hediyala. Though farmers tried to help it, they could not. The foresters with the help of vets had started treatment from Tuesday but it was too late. To help the elephant regain its strength, the vets had administered glucose and multi vitamins and provided sugarcane. But the elephant, which was suffering from liver failure and had sustained injuries near its ears, did not respond to the treatment and died of starvation. Bandipur Tiger Reserve in-charge director V Karikalan told TOI that the elephant was very weak, and it was suffering from liver ailments. “The post-mortem report revealed that the animal died of liver failure. As itwas very weak, we had administered around 30 bottles of glucose and provided multi-vitamins. But due to age factor and liver problem, it died early Wednesday morning,” he said.Spotted deer knocked downA spotted deer was fatally knocked down by a speeding vehicle on the interstate highway at Gundlupet in Chamarajanagar district. According to foresters, a speeding vehicle had hit the deer in-front of Gurubhavana on National Highway 766 on Wednesday morning killing it on the spot. The deer had strayed out of the Maddahalli forest and had entered the town. The driver did not stop the vehicle and fled. The villagers who noticed the animal in a pool of blood informed the forest department. Gundlupet buffer zone range officer Lokesh and DRFOs Mudhuraj and Siddaraju rushed to the spot. Wildlife vet Waseem conducted the post-mortem and carcass was cremated at Kandegala forest area. RFO Lokesh said a case has been registered on the hit-and-run incident and investigation has been initiated to trace the vehicle. Expressing anguish over the incident, an environmentalists said, “if this could happen on the main road of a town, we can well imagine the plight of wildlife species in their habitat, where rapid expansion of the existing six metre roads to four lane (26 metres) highways is being done. People who were driving at 30 or 40 kmph due to speed restriction inside wildlife sanctuaries, will drive at reckless speed if road widening is done inside the forest area.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/ailing-50-yr-old-jumbo-dies-of-liver-failure/articleshow/89027810.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

According to officials, in Chamarajanagar, no Covid-19 cases have been reported from the tribal hamlets in the third wave, while cases are very low in HD Kote taluk in Mysuru district. “Till now no cases are reported among the tribal population of the district,” said Chamarajanagar district health officer Visveshwaraiah K M. A similar trend is reported from HD Kote taluk, which also has a huge tribal population. “The cases are very few among the tribal population,” said taluk health officer Dr Ravi Kumar. According to both these officials, the primary reason for fewer Covid-19 cases among the tribal population is their lifestyle. “They hardly visit cities, or make contact with the outside world. Their movement is limited to forests and hamlets. So there are fewer chances of tribals living in hamlets contracting the virus,” they said.According to Dr Visveshwaraiah the vaccination coverage is good in tribal hamlets, with around 80-85% coverage. “In tribal hamlets in HD Kote, 81% of the target tribal population has now received both doses of the vaccine to protect against Covid-19,” said Ravi Kumar.“Earlier there was vaccine hesitancy among the tribal population, but now it is resolved,” said Ravi Kumar.More cases in cityAccording to the Mysuru district Covid-19 bulletin, out of 9,097 cases in the district, a majority of them are found in Mysuru city.

With uncertainty surrounding the business, drop in footfalls and lower ticket prices, the livelihood of thousands of employees too hangs in balance. In Mysuru, theatres will stop screening movies from Friday.Unable to recoup from the losses suffered in the last two years, owners of single-screen cinema halls have decided to shut shop temporarily from January 21. Owners of Gayathri, Rajkamal, Sangam and Sterling theatres have taken a decision to this effect. The government’s decision to run cinema halls with only 50% seating capacity has come as a big blow.Karnataka Film Exhibitors Federation state vice president MR Rajaram said that there are 587 theatres in Karnataka, including eight in Mysuru. “They all are likely to stop screening movies due to the prevailing situation,” he said. Producers and distributors are not coming forward to release movies due to restrictions in seating capacities. Screening movies for only 50 % of viewers as per state government directive is not enough to sustain, he explained. Prior to the pandemic, there were 636 theatres in Karnataka including 14 in Mysuru. Many theatres closed down, as they could not cope with the lockdown fallout. “In the initial days of the pandemic, we ensured full salary to all our employees and during the second wave we managed to give 50% of the salary to all our staff. Just when we thought the situation was improving, the weekend and night curfews were imposed forcing us to take this call,” Rajaram added.In Mysuru, seven out of eight theatres will stop screening from Friday while one theatre screening a Kannada movie has said they may continue to operate for a few more days. Each theatre has around 12 to 25 employees in Karnataka depending on the size of the theatre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/curbs-hit-single-screen-movie-theatres-decide-to-shut-temporarily-in-mysuru/articleshow/89027817.cms||---
---||Raipur||BJP uses central agencies against oppn leaders during polls: Baghel||Raipur: Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel stepped up his attack on the BJP, accusing the ruling party of using central agencies against non-BJP leaders in election-bound states.The Chhattisgarh CM is a senior Congress observer for the UP polls and has been campaigning door to door there. Talking to the media after returning from UP late Wednesday night, Baghel took a dig at BJP’s ‘strategy’ of using central agencies, and said, “The way it’s said that the Pakistan cricket team plays with 13 players, instead of 11, central agencies are being used to create fear and discredit opposition parties and their leaders.”“Why aren’t ED and other central agencies carrying out raids in BJP-ruled states like Uttarakhand, Goa and UP, or on the house of any of the CMs’ relatives? Because BJP fights polls with the help of central agencies, like CBI, ED and income-tax department, which play as umpires for BJP during polls,” Baghel remarked.Reacting to the recent raids on a relative of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in an alleged sand mining case, Baghel said that opposition-ruled states always come under attack during elections. On UP, he said, “The situation is such that ruling party leaders and MLAs are switching to other parties.”During his tour to Uttar Pradesh, Baghel campaigned in Noida, Dadri, Jewar and Mathura Vidhan Sabha constituencies and met senior party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.In Noida, an FIR was registered against him for allegedly violating Covid SOPs during door-to door-campaign. The CM questioned this ‘selective’ FIR against him and asked why BJP leaders aren’t booked as well. The Election Commission should remain transparent, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/bjp-uses-central-agencies-against-oppn-leaders-during-polls-baghel/articleshow/89027818.cms||---

---||India||Army vice-chief warns Pakistan over terror use||NEW DELHI: Countries with ‘regressive thinking’ like Pakistan, which use terrorism as a political tool, need to understand that terrorism is an equally big threat for them, said Army vice-chief Lt General C P Mohanty on Thursday.  “While terrorism in all its dimensions must be condemned equally, there is nothing as despicable as state-sponsored terror. We are taking necessary steps to address the elaborate nexus — the sources of radicalisation, those that propound ideological hatred, the complex web of finance, the communication network as also sanctuaries,” he said. “When sources of terror receive state support, the consequences for the world are ominous. It is not entirely a coincidence, for example, that the world’s foremost terrorist, Osama bin Laden, found sanctuary with our western neighbour,” he added, addressing an international counter-terrorism conference organised by GCTC. He dwelt extensively upon how terrorism was one of the most potent threats to global peace and security with advances in technology especially in the cyber domain, facilitating indoctrination and recruitment, real-time secure communications, and the flow of funds. India has adopted a “multi-pronged approach” and treats terrorism as a phenomenon with political, economic, social and psychological dimensions, all of which need equal and simultaneous attention. “We have never made a distinction between a ‘Good’ or ‘Bad’ terrorist; the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist,” he said. India has woven together a number of successful strategies to challenge the affliction of terrorism and extremism. These strategies extend across the domains of legislation, diplomacy, socio-economic initiatives, military, intelligence, technological, cultural and civil society initiatives. “India’s approach to counter-terrorism has been multi-dimensional with kinetic actions being one of the subsets of the ‘whole of government’ approach,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-vice-chief-warns-pakistan-over-terror-use/articleshow/89027792.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Top court admits plea seeking relief to NGOs||VIJAYAWADA: The Supreme Court on Thursday admitted a petition filed by evangelist and founder of Global Peace Initiative, Dr K A Paul, seeking restoration of registration to receive foreign contributions. The petition sought striking down of the Union Home Ministry’s order issued on December 31, 2021, cancelling registration of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. The Supreme Court posted the petition for hearing on January 24. This had adverse impact on over 6,000 NGOs across the country including Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charities, besides Paul’s Global Peace Initiative. The government had cancelled the FCRA registrations of the NGOs who have already applied and had also refused to accept the applications for registration in future. The Supreme Court, responding to the petition filed by Dr Paul, directed the Central government to “extend the validity of registration of those organisations that had failed to apply for renewal of (FCRA) registration till such time as Covid-19 continues to be a ‘notified disaster.” The petitioner, Dr Paul, said that the NGOs are helping millions of people across the country and “the sudden and arbitrary cancellation of FCRA registration of thousands of these NGOs violates the rights of the organisations and their workers besides lakhs of people in the country who have been receiving the help.” He further said that the Central government, the Niti Aayog and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself have acknowledged the role of these NGOs in helping the people, particularly during the Covid- 19 crisis. He said that the government’s decision cancelling the FCRA registration to these NGOs during his pandemic “will hamper the relief efforts and lead to denial of aid to citizens in need.” Dr Paul said that the government under section 50 of the FCRA 2010 has the powers to extend the “validity of the registration of various organisations in view of the exigencies arising out of Covid-19 situation. The same exigencies exist today and the registrations be extended, he sought. He also recalled that a case of Noel Harper and Union of India was pending before the Supreme Court related to the FCRA Amendment, 2020. He said that the apex court had reserved the judgment in November 2021 and hence sought restoration of validity of the registration of the NGOs under the FCRA 2010.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/top-court-admits-plea-seeking-relief-to-ngos/articleshow/89027825.cms||Gopi Dara

A statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) stated that the state government has waived farm loans in cooperative banks and urged the government of India to waive the same in commercial banks through a one-time settlement. The state government is also ready to offer its share in this effort, it added.“Our government has passed a Bill in the state assembly that sought to stop the auctioning of agricultural land of farmers up to five acres. But, the Bill has not become a law yet as the governor has not given his assent to it. I am saddened that such a situation has risen as this law has not seen the light of the day,” the CM said in the statement. “I am hopeful that this Bill will be approved soon,” he said.Meanwhile, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait met Dausa farmers, whose lands were allegedly auctioned by commercial banks over non-payment of loans, on Thursday. BJP MP Kirodi Lal Meena, accompanied by peasants, protested against the auction outside the chief minister's residence here.

---||Nagpur||Report finds presence of at least 352 tigers, 635 leopards in Vidarbha in 2021||NAGPUR: The latest (2021) report by the state forest department, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) reveals there are minimum 352 tigers and 635 leopards in Vidarbha. In 2020, the Phase IV monitoring of tigers, an annual exercise conducted by all tigers reserves, had put the tiger numbers at 331, but due to Covid, not all tiger-bearing areas were scanned. The All India Tiger Estimation-2018 (AITE) conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had estimated presence of 312 tigers in Maharashtra. The AITE-2018 figure cannot be considered for comparison now as it is almost three years since the four-year national exercise was undertaken. Tiger numbers in Maharashtra have been consistently rising. In 2006, the state had 103 tigers, the number increased to 168 in 2010, 190 in 2014, and 312 in 2018 and now it is 352. And it is being estimated that the number is even bigger. The 2021 report on ‘Long-term monitoring of tigers, co-predators, and prey in tiger bearing areas of Vidarbha, Maharashtra’ puts the minimum number of tigers at 352 with an estimation of 396 (359-433). The minimum number of leopards is 635 with a population estimation of 731 (663-798) in the Vidarbha landscape. As per AITE-2018, there were 1,690 leopards in entire Maharashtra. PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye attributed the rise in the number of tigers and leopards to strong state government policies and conservation efforts by the forest staff, NGOs and media awareness. Protecting the growing numbers of tigers is a big challenge before the department. “The number increased because this time extensive monitoring and sampling efforts were taken than last year in both protected areas (PAs) and outside PAs. The number of camera traps pairs and sampling days was also more,” Limaye told TOI. In 2020, estimation was done only in limited PAs. The tiger-bearing areas outside TATR like Kanhargaon, Saoli, Rajura, Warora-Bhadravati, Gadchiroli, Pandharkawda division and other areas were left out due to Covid-19 situation. However, in the 2021 estimation, all these areas were included. According to Bilal Habib, head, department of animal ecology & conservation biology, WII, the increase in the number of tigers and leopards is because of effective management of tiger breeding areas in Maharashtra. “One-year-old cubs have not been included in the estimation and all tigers counted are independent of mothers. The data will provide crucial baseline information for better conservation of species,” said Habib. WII was involved in extensive monitoring in all the PAs, while NGO Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) did camera trapping outside PAs. However, experts say even these figures may not be perfect as in 2021, as per the forest department’s own figures, 33 tigers and over 155 leopards have died due to various reasons and it is possible these animals have been included in the estimation. “We have been monitoring tiger populations outside PAs in Maharashtra since 2014. Most of these areas support a steady tiger population and even provided a founding population for the neighbouring state of Telangana. However, it is imperative to now focus on habitat degradation, anthropogenic pressure and wild prey populations in these areas as these are key factors dictating conflict outside PAs,” said WCT’s wildlife biologist Aditya Joshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/report-finds-presence-of-at-least-352-tigers-635-leopards-in-vidarbha-in-2021/articleshow/89026442.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

This is possibly the third reported case of permanent pacemaker implantation to a person above 100 years in the country.The team claimed, such an implant was conducted on two other patients aged 104 years and 102 years in Punjab and Delhi, respectively.The implantation was a challenge because of the lady’s age, but was successfully done by the hospital’s director and head of cardiology Dr Amit Khandelwal. “It is challenging to install a pacemaker at such an old age because of the tortuosity of the vessels and difficulty in getting the right and appropriate threshold,” said Dr Khandelwal.Saraswati Devi, a veteran musician, had come to the hospital with complaints of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, and palpitations.To place a pacemaker, a small incision, two inches below the collar bone is made under local anesthesia. Leads are carried through the blood to the heart, and another end of the lead connects to the pulse generator inside the body. A permanent pacemaker is a life-saving procedure and it usually has no associated complications and not too many medications are prescribed for the same, said the doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/udaipur/pacemaker-gives-a-new-lease-of-life-to-101-year-old-woman/articleshow/89027830.cms||---

Pointing to governments’ apathy in keeping with its heritage status, Khatri said that even after eight years’ of monuments inscription in the world heritage list, no management plan for the conservation and protection of the fort has been submitted by the government despite several reminders by the world heritage committee.“In absence of this plan, this beautiful but endangered fort is feared to lose its status of world heritage site,” he contended.Also praying for immediate framing of the heritage by-laws for the fort, Khatri stated that influx of the tourist who are residing inside the hotels, the guest houses and the restaurants in the monument have triggered rampant commercial and unauthorized activities inside the fort, thereby causing damage due to seepage of water into the bed rock of the sedimentary formation upon which the Sonar Fort is built.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jodhpur/wont-regularise-constructions-within-300-metre-of-sonar-fort/articleshow/89027831.cms||---

In October, Rajasthan police had arrested Batti Lal Meena, who was initially claimed as the alleged kingpin of the racket. Following Meena’s arrest, police claimed that Meena was helped by Lal.

The haul was smuggled into India via Pakistan through Anantnag (Jammu) and was to be delivered in Ajmer and came through Anantnag to Amritsar and then Jaipur. ADG (crime) Ravi Prakash Meherda, stated that the crime branch has been keeping a watch on the smugglers operating in Rajasthan. “We had some vague inputs which were developed by our team and it was found that a man identified as Aarif Ali was bringing charas to Rajasthan and will take it further to Ajmer. We got the breakthrough when the accused was found with illegal possession of 5 kg charas while travelling in a bus.” Deputy superintendent of police, CID-CB, Pushpendra said, “We found that accused Aarif Ali got this haul of narcotics from one Basir, a drug smuggler active in Anantnag of Jammu Kashmir. It was found that Aarif has been in constant touch with Bashir and had brought narcotics in Rajasthan earlier. He has been caught for the first time. It appears that the smugglers of Pakistan through their men in Kashmir are looking for Punjab as well as Rajasthan to be their soft target in narcotics smuggling.” Meanwhile, in the evening the crime branch along with Punjab police detained Bashir while he was on his way to Kashmir from Amritsar in a bus.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/intl-drug-racket-busted-5kg-charas-seized-1-arrested/articleshow/89027838.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bharatiya Kisan Union seeks probe against bank officials over auction of farmers’ lands in Dausa||JAIPUR: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday met Dausa farmers whose lands have been auctioned by commercial banks over the non-payment of loans, while peasants led by BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena protested against the action outside the chief minister’s residence. Land attachment and auction is being undertaken by banks that are controlled by the Reserve Bank of India, he said, urging the Centre to waive farmers’ loans. Notably, many instances of land auction notices being issued to farmers who have been unable to pay back their loans have come to the fore recently. Tikait, who is the spokesperson of the BKU, met farmers in Ramgarh Pachwara in Dausa district whose lands were auctioned by banks after they failed to repay their loans. Talking to reporters, Tikait said, "Why was the auction done? An investigation should be carried out against bank officials and a case registered. You cannot auction a farmer's entire land for a small loan. It was an illegal auction. The land mafia have their eyes on prime land." He claimed several farmers have received land auction notices. "We will meet bank officials on the issue and decide the future course of action," the BKU leader said. Separately, a group of farmers from Dausa led by BJP MP Dr Kirodi Lal Meena managed to reach the high-security zone near Gehlot's residence here, demanding action against bank officials and cancellation of the land auction process. However, the protestors were dispersed and Meena was taken away in a bus by police officials. "Approximately 15 lakh farmers in the state have taken loans worth Rs 10,000 crore from cooperative banks and they are not being waived. The farmers who have come here have less than 5.5 acres of land and have received land auction notices," Meena told reporters from inside the bus. Recently, a farmer committed suicide in Ramgarh Pachwara and the police have not registered a case in the matter, he alleged. A protesting farmer said, "My father had taken a loan from the Rajasthan Grameen Bank. Bank officials harassed my father, who committed suicide two months ago. Still, the bank auctioned 15 bighas land for Rs 45 lakh a couple of days ago. We had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh." Meena was later taken to the Secretariat here, where he met officials from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), according to a statement. He handed over a memorandum to the CMO officials seeking a complete waiver of farm loans, the statement issued by Meena's office said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bku-seeks-probe-against-bank-officials-over-auction-of-farmers-lands-in-dausa/articleshow/89027839.cms||---

While Pauskar said that he will contest as an independent candidate from Sanvordem, Palienkar said that he will contest as an independent, but has kept his options open to contest as any like-minded party’s candidate. A day after he was denied BJP candidature, Pauskar accused BJP of falsely raising Rs 70 crore job scam to deny him a ticket. “The next government has to complete the recruitment in PWD, otherwise people will throw them out. There is no scam. Because of this scam allegation, my image has been tarnished. But it was pre-planned to sideline me and I am confident that people of Sanvordem are with me,” Pauskar said. “We supported BJP for the development of Pernem and Sanvordem constituencies and not for BJP’s benefit,” Pauskar said The former minister also resigned from BJP’s primary membership to contest as an independent candidate. “I will start my campaign from Sunday,” he said. “If I had said earlier that BJP will deny me candidature, then they would have stopped development in Sanvordem. I knew one year ago that I will not get a BJP ticket to contest this assembly election,” he said “BJP doesn’t want good people like me. BJP thinks differently.” Pauskar had joined BJP in 2019 along with Manohar Ajgaonkar after merging MGP legislature wing into BJP. The former minister said that out of 16,000 registered BJP members, 60% have resigned from BJP, including the booth president. He said that since 2019 he has been working for the party. “I am not hurt by the BJP decision to deny me a ticket,” Pauskar said. He said that he will solve the long-pending demands of the Sanvordem constituency within a month after forming the next government. The demands include sugar factory and mining, among others, he added. People of Sanvordem vote for an individual and not for a party, Pauskar said.

NGT further ordered authorities to ensure payment of compensation to the victims.  The environment watchdog also observed that similar incidents were happening repeatedly due to the illegal trade of hazardous chemicals and noted that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) has revoked the closure notices issued to the industries after a few days without taking any strict action. It tersely noted that the vehicles involved in this illegal disposal of waste were not even confiscated. Describing such incidents as detrimental, the NGT even asked the state to formulate a firm action framework to address the issue considering the similar incidents in the past. It recalled the incident of February 9, 2019 when two persons had died due to inhalation of toxic gases in the state. “Such incidents take place from time to time on account of illegal trade. Vehicles involved in illegal disposal of waste are not confiscated. Similar incident of illegal discharge resulted in death of two persons due to inhalation of toxic gases on February 2, 2019 in the state of Gujarat was also dealt in the Hon’ble NGT matter. The NGT had passed an order on May 9, 20-19 regarding illegal disposal of waste into the creek of Surat at Ankleshwar and Vapi,” the order stated. Regarding the incident, the NGT said the accident may have been caused due to mixing of highly acidic water in the natural drain and the liquid waste from the tanker which was highly basic. “The reaction of illegal discharge of liquid waste (highly basic) through tankers and highly acidic wastewater in upstream of the natural drain of the GIDC has resulted in the release of various toxic gases. The causality due to the intensified illegal activity has resulted in the accident,” it noted. Following the incident, NGT took up the case suo motu and issued notices to concerned parties. An environment activist, MSH Shaikh too filed an appeal in NGT. Later merging both cases, NGT announced the judgment on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/nine-member-panel-to-inquire-into-sachin-gidc-gas-leak-tragedyngt/articleshow/89027855.cms||---

A team from the forest department rushed to the spot and found the big cats dead. Both the bodies were sent for postmortem by the forest officials. Prima facie, the injuries indicate that the leopards must have been hit by some heavy vehicle at night. Foresters have started an investigation to identify the leopards. “Both animals are males and around five years of age. Leopards are very clever and alert and so, the chances of accidental death are very less,” a forest official told TOI. “In this case, it seems that the leopards may have been fighting and suddenly came onto the road leading to the accident.

Though beauticians in the district have suffered a lot of inconvenience, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions, the fraternity has not received any support from the government.Despite all these problems, the government has introduced the weekend curfew, that has added to their woes. Mangalore Ladies Beauticians Association members said that nearly 25 parlours have already been closed due to sustaining financial losses in the last two years. Mangalore Ladies Beauticians Association president Babitha U Shetty told TOI, that the association with nearly 350 members, has been collecting details of the status of all beauty parlours. “Many have already closed the parlours due to the financial burden and bank loans. Weekend curfew may lead to severe financial crisis, and beauty parlour owners may be forced to take extreme steps,” she said. “We get only about four to five customers on weekends. We have been following all guidelines of the government, while attending to our customers on Saturdays and Sundays,” she said, and urged the government to withdraw the weekend curfew order. Jessica Kiran, a member of the association, said, “Cosmetics and other items stocked in most of the beauty parlours are getting expired, and they cannot be used any more. Despite facing such difficulties, we are paying for the trade licence and running the business legally. We have already submitted a memorandum to the chief minister, narrating our plight during the past two years, due to the pandemic and lockdowns. We have already gone through tough phases of facing financial losses, and many of us have commitments towards our families too.”Another member, Shalet Pinto, said beauty parlour owners find it difficult to get loans from banks. Members lamented that they do not get loans from banks due to the pandemic. “Earlier, there were good offers from banks, and the CIBIL scores used to be at a good level. However, due to the bad financial situation in the backdrop of the pandemic, the CIBIL scores have also gone below the benchmark, and banks reject loan offers,” the members said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/business-hit-for-500-beauty-parlours-in-city/articleshow/89027864.cms||Vinobha K T

The budget to be presented in the last week of January will give more emphasis to property tax collection and all other resources,” the mayor said. “We have already held public consultative meetings inviting suggestions from the people. Most of the suggestions were all related to their demands, especially on infrastructure. However, some have given suggestions to make the revenue generation more effective. For example, the city corporation has not revised building licence fees for several years. Hence, people have suggested that fees may be revised at least for larger apartments in the city,” Shetty said. The city corporation has been witnessing an increase in the property tax collection, he said, adding that there are lacunae in the system, as the city corporation is yet to ascertain the actual number of properties in the city.“Though the property tax collection under the Self-Assessment System (SAS) has increased with the introduction of online payment facilities, many still do not pay taxes. The city corporation still has no proper data of actual number of properties in the city. We are in the process of digitising the data of properties in the city. Once the process is completed, we will be able to get complete details of the city’s properties, and this will help the city corporation to increase revenue collection,” he said. The MCC Standing Committee on Taxation, Finance & Appeal Standing Committee will meet soon to finalise the next budget, which may be presented at a special council meeting on or before January 28. Thereafter, a general council meeting will also be held by the end of January, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mcc-budget-will-be-focused-on-resource-mobilisation-says-mayor/articleshow/89027866.cms||Vinobha K T

Another problem that hospitals could face in the next few months is post-graduate doctors going on a two-month leave before their final exams in April. Medical colleges have requested doctors not to take the two-month leave before exams as that would overwhelm the already staff-strained hospitals. Added to these two challenges is the number of post-graduate doctors testing Covid-positive daily.“Our PGs serve in three major hospitals. The existing PGs are under tremendous pressure since there is a delay in the arrival of the first-year PGs by nearly eight months. The workload is now balanced with the help of MBBS interns. The entire healthcare facility is overburdened. The only blessing is that though there are many cases, the hospitalisation ratio is lower compared to the first and second waves. However, we are worried about what will happen in the coming days when the cases peak,” Dr B Unnikrishnan, the dean of Kasturba Medical College, said. The college takes in130 post-graduates every year.Dr Unnikrishnan said two to three post-graduate interns test positive almost every day. “The PGs who are working long hours without much of a break and are testing positive as the new variant is spreading faster. We have to isolate and quarantine those PGs. As a result, the workforce has shrunk,” said Dr Antony Sylvan D’Souza, the dean of the Father Muller Medical College.Dr Antony also pointed out that since the hospital system is choked and the workforce is under stress, the college has requested final-year post-graduates not take leave but continue to work. “Going on en-masse leave will totally collapse the system. The PGs have agreed to our request,” he said.The medical colleges expect the arrival of fresh PGs latest by the first week of March.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/with-no-fresh-pgs-med-colleges-grapple-with-staff-crunch/articleshow/89027868.cms||---

On January 17, out of the 4,635 swab samples tested, as many as 1,702 came out as positive — around 39%. Two days later, on Wednesday, the positivity rate shot up to 44% when 3,000 samples out of the total 6,800 tested positive.“The number of testes increased, but with it the rate of positivity also increased,” the health authorities noted. The testing was limited only to symptomatic patients and high risk contacts during the period as a result of which there were more people who tested positive.The authorities also said that the number of cases without belonging to high or low risk contacts was also increasing day-by-day. “We therefore decided to conduct testing of people through all possible ways, including those visiting sub-centres in rural areas,” Dr Kapil Aher, district heath officer (DHO), said. He added that the community health officers (CHO) have been asked to carry out testing of all people they feel are likely to be infected with Covid and the ones who visit the sub-centres of primary health centres. The health authorities in the rural areas pointed out that people were unwilling to test themselves for the infection if they were fit and not showing any symptoms. “The moment we say RAT or RT-PCR has to be done, people simply walk out of the hospital or the sub-centre,” the authorities said, adding tests in rural areas have increased from around 700 to over 2,200 per day. “We have asked the authorities in the urban primary health centres to take all measures for testing people coming to visit the centres for health reasons and who may have slightest of symptoms related to cough, cold, fever. The daily tests in corporation areas have increased from 3,200 to 4,200,” a senior health officer from the NMC said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/health-authorities-increase-testing-across-nashik-dist/articleshow/89027874.cms||---

GFP claimed that while in 2016 approximately 6 lakh youth were employed, in December 2021 the number dropped to 4.8 lakh. GFP has not revealed the source of the data. “Based on the statistics, 1.8 lakh youth have lost their jobs. Employment rate is only 32%. Today, unemployment rate in Goa is higher than in Uttar Pradesh,” said GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat. Kamat said that for every election BJP has promised to create employment opportunities for local youth, but unemployment continues. Ahead of the 2012 elections, BJP promised an unemployment allowance to youth and in 2014 for the Lok Sabha elections, BJP promised to create 50,000 jobs in Goa in the private sector. Ahead of the coming elections, BJP has claimed to have created 10,000 government jobs. “BJP’s Goa Investment Promotion and Facilitation Board (IPB) and tourism policy for creating job opportunities for Goa failed miserably. This is because BJP government has encouraged promotion of wrong policies. They have wrong priorities,” said Kamat. Kamat said that the corruption in the government recruitment process where bribes and favouritism was rampant has left the youth disillusioned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/4-8l-goan-youth-unemployed-says-gfp-blames-faulty-policies/articleshow/89047726.cms||TNN

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tribal district Banswara hailed for 90% first dose vaccination||JAIPUR: Molly M, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) posted at Kotra sub-centre in Banswara, has to travel by boat to vaccinate people against Covid-19. Her designated area is surrounded by Mahi river in Banswara. “Villagers know me here now. They have boats. They help health workers in the area to cover distances by boat for vaccination. Earlier, we encountered vaccine hesitancy here, but now more than 90% of the people in my area are vaccinated,” she said. Despite being a tribal-dominated district with population scattered in areas difficult to reach, Banswara has scripted a success in vaccinating 90% of its 18+ population with the first dose. The ministry of health praised the efforts of health workers who crossed rivers and scaled heights to inoculate people in the district. While, initially, they faced scepticism, they managed to convince the tribal population that vaccines were not harmful and would save their lives.  Banswara shares its boundary with Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Because of the peculiar geography, the migration of labourers to other states is quite common. As agriculture is not conducive in the area due to hills and rocky areas, poverty has forced people to migrate to other states for work, making the task of vaccinators difficult. During rains, rivers and streams cut off several areas in the district. The gritty vaccinators have managed to achieve success despite these odds. Appreciating their work, the ministry of health Tweeted, “#Rajasthan’s Banswara district is a tribal dominated district where the health workers took vaccination to the people by ending myths related to vaccination.” The ministry of health also shared a small video with the tweet showing how health workers reached difficult areas in the district. “It was quite difficult as houses were scattered. In most of these areas, the distance between two houses can be half-a-kilometre,”said Dr HL Tabiyar, chief medical health officer (CMHO), Banswara. It is now among the top districts with the highest vaccination coverage for first dose. Dr Mukesh Maida, in-charge of the Choti Sarvan community health centre in Banswara, said, “Our staff worked hard here. These are not the plains. It has hills and tributaries of Mahi river. Also, we faced vaccine hesitancy. But, now more than 90% of eligible people have been vaccinated here.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/tribal-district-banswara-hailed-for-90-first-dose-vaccination/articleshow/89026945.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The 50-bed dispensary, set up in 1916, is still operational. Malegaon municipal commissioner, Balchandra Gosavi, told TOI, “Our staff members are carrying out renovation work in the dispensary to increase the bed capacity to 100 since Covid cases are increasing again in the textile town. On Wednesday, while cleaning the dispensary premises, our employees opened a locked room behind a toilet block of the dispensary and found a human skull and few bones on the floor of that room.” The senior civic officials found out that the room where the skull and bones were found, had not been opened for over 30 years. The structure is behind the dispensary. It is in a rather dilapidated condition and trees have grown wildly arounf it room. The entire area is unclean. “It is baffling that despite the room being locked, there was a human skull and bones there. A police probe can unravel the truth,” maintained Gosavi. The civic body has informed the local police about the skull and the bones and requested them to investigate the issue. The civic body is in the process of handing over the remeains nto the police. Nashik rural superintendent of police Sachin Patil said that the police have asked the Malegaon municipal corporation to submit a detailed report on the issue. “We have asked the civic authorities to highlight in the report in which part of the room was the skull and bones placed, the employees who initially saw them etc. Based on their report, the local police will initially register an accidental death case before initiating a probe,” added Patil. He added that the police would seek the help of the forensic department to establish whether the skull and the bones are of a male or female and how old are they.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/malegaon-civic-employees-find-human-skull-bones-in-century-old-dispensary/articleshow/89027877.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Track the pollution level in your cityThe sensors will give an accurate picture of the air quality in a neighbourhood, which could vary from the data recorded by a monitoring station located at some distance, Prof Sagnik Dey of IIT Delhi, a researcher working on the Nasa Citizen Science Project, said. “The idea is to deploy thousands of low-cost sensors in neighbourhoods so the data can be analysed,” Dey added. “When 30 such sensors were deployed at IIT-Delhi, there were a lot of variations within the campus itself. For instance, the data recorded from a sensor close to the main road differed vastly from the rest of the campus,” the professor said. Dey said it was critical that every house has the sensors to collect hyper-local data in a city like Delhi, which would help analyse the quality of air one is exposed to. The researchers plan to approach schools in the city as well, he added. “We plan to engage with schools in NCR too later. If people are aware of the exposure to pollution, they will think of ways to tackle it. Appropriate solutions can then be found to reduce the exposure of children as they could be returning to schools soon,” Dey said. The data collected from the sensors will be available online and accessible to all. But first, it will need to be calibrated, he told TOI. “We are also trying to come up with other censors that can measure personal exposure and contribute to health studies. People have shown keen interest in the project,” Dey said. He added that while various types of censors are currently available, several start-ups are also in the process of developing others that can be deployed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/iit-d-sensors-to-record-air-quality-in-neighbourhoods/articleshow/89026468.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

They have admitted to collecting documents from the beneficiaries and bringing those to Dhule for processing. “The two suspects were middlemen between the beneficiaries and the suspects who processed and issued the certificates. The two men are from Dhule town and were always on the lookout of the people who wanted certificates without getting vaccinated,” the police said. Police said the duo would not disclose the identity of the suspects who issued the certificates and how they got the vaccine certificate. They would just ask the beneficiaries for a mobile number and the Aadhaar card details. The police have already arrested four people, including three employees of Dhule Municipal Corporation (DMC), for their alleged role in the issuance of the vaccine certificates without vaccination.The police said the Dhule employees would set up a vaccination session on a particular day and use the details of the beneficiaries in the CoWin application and after successful verification, the certificates would be generated and issued to the beneficiaries. The police said the two middlemen would ensure that the beneficiaries did not know where the vaccine certificates were being generated so that no unwanted person would approach them. All the six suspects have been remanded in the judicial custody by the local court, the police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/malegaon-beneficiaries-didnt-go-to-dhule-to-get-certificates-cops/articleshow/89027879.cms||---

Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that he will hold consultation with the local administration before taking a decision for the district.Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare said that the decision on the issue would be taken after getting the official notification from the state government about reopening of schools.A section of private English medium schools in Nashik city, however, said the government should take steps that will promote children and society to live with Covid. “We have to live with covid and hence, bold decisions have to be taken by the government as well as the society,” Ratan Luth, an educationist and former chairperson of Association of Nashik Schools, said. Luth also pointed out that if at all any child tests positive, relevant measures about quarantine, isolation will be taken up by the schools and the parents to contain the spread of the infection. KOLHAPURKolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar too said that the decision about resuming classes in schools in the district would be taken after government issues its order. Rekhawar told TOI, “I will study the decision. Several villages from Kolhapur district are still Covid free. We will think of reopening the schools in these villages. However, I have to get the details before issuing the final order. Also, I will review the Covid situation before taking the final call.”The school teachers associations are, however, want the schools to be reopened from Monday. Ganesh Naykude, president of English Medium Schools Association of Kolhapur said, “We will meet the authorities and insist that they follow the state government’s decision to open the schools from Monday. Also, the schools from all parts of the district must be reopened instead of just those from Covid free areas.”AURANGABADThe Maharashtra English School Trustees’ Association (MESTA), which was demanding reopening of schools, has welcomed the government decision to resume classroom teaching from January 24 depending upon local situation.“The local authorities also must not raise hue and cry over Covid situation. If malls, theatres and market places can operate, schools can also function by following Covid prevention norms,” MESTA joint secretary Manish Hande said.When contacted, authorities said they would be closely monitoring the Covid situation before taking any call on reopening of schools. “No immediate decision will be taken on reopening of schools. The government has left it to the local administration to take the necessary call as per Covid situation as safety of students is of paramount importance,” education officer with Aurangabad Zilla Parishad Madhukar Deshmukh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/most-schools-want-to-reopen-await-nod-of-local-authorities/articleshow/89027884.cms||---

During the second wave of the pandemic, the Ahmednagar administration had made it mandatory for Covid patients to be institutionally quarantined.“There is an immediate need to contain the spread of the infection even if it is mild in nature or may not be leading to criticality at this point in time,” Bhosale said.The collector also pointed out that the virus was spreading at a fast rate though it was not leading to major health issues among the ones who have tested positive. “Currently, it has been found that the number of Covid cases are rising, but the number of people being hospitalised is still low. However, we do not know when things will change and virus may start creating health issues. Hence taking a cautious approach towards fighting against the infection we have decided to go for institutional quarantine,” the collector said. He stated that if the infected person, even asymptomatic, was at home he could pass on the infection to other members which would lead to increase in cases. During the second wave, authorities had found that most Covid patients, who opted for home isolation, were violating the norm by visiting market places.“It is better to institutionally quarantine everybody. Since the virus dose not discriminate between people, we also do not want to allow only the well-to-do people to stay at home. The CCC have been opened up so that the people can stay there for respective period and then go home,” the collector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/no-more-home-isolation-in-ahmednagar/articleshow/89027885.cms||---

But the scenario has now changed in the last one to two years as many industries are now eyeing Nashik to set up their base here,” said Panchal.“Two new industrial estates have come up recently in Dindori and Malegaon.

The setting up of the girder marks a major milestone in completion of the track between Jalgaon and Bhadali junctions. From there on, the track between Bhadali and Bhusawal has been completed and commissioned. The construction of 21-km of third and fourth tracks between Jalgaon and Bhusawal junctions was sanctioned in 2012 and it involved a 5-km elevated railway track. The entire project is estimated to cost Rs 190 crore.“The work on the fourth track between Jalgaon and Bhadali is being carried out speedily. We hope to achieve the completion within a year’s time at the most,” said a senior officer from Bhusawal railway division of Central Railway. Bhusawal and Jalgaon are key junctions that get heavy traffic. Jalgaon receives traffic from Surat and Bhusawal route towards Khandwa (Madhya Pradesh) branches out to Nagpur and further towards Howrah. Hence, the two additional tracks are being laid between Bhusawal and Jalgaon. The two tracks will also help in smooth movement of freight trains without loss of time and will also further save the time of the passenger trains. It may be noted that the third track between the two stations on the same route was inspected in the month of July last year by the commissioner for railway safety. Travellers are looking forward to its commissioning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/rlys-set-up-girder-for-fourth-line-between-jalgaon-and-bhadali-junctions/articleshow/89027892.cms||---

Hence, the DDMA has banned the tourist places in these areas to stop the spread of Covid-19.The places that are out of bounds for people are Bramhagiri mountain, Anjineri, Harihar Fort, Salher-Mulher fort, Dugarwadi waterfalls, dams, including Bhavali, Gangpuar, Vaitarna, among others.Bhalerao further said that the tourism sector had been badly affected during the first and the second waves of the Covid pandemic, but the sector started revising from October-November onwards.“There are restrictions on international travel and this is a good opportunity to boost domestic tourism within the country. Nashik has emerged as one of the major destinations, and tourists, not only from Mumbai and Pune but from across the country visit various destinations in Nashik,” said Bhalerao.“Hence, there is a need to give relaxations to the tourism sector instead of putting a complete ban on it,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-travel-agents-body-for-curbs-instead-of-total-tourism-ban/articleshow/89027893.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Young seers run camps at Magh Mela, hold online discourses||Prayagraj: They don’t have management degrees under their belt, but young saints and seers, camping in Magh Mela on the sandy expanse of the river Ganga, are expert in handling activities in huge ashrams and camps, visited by thousands of devotees daily, in true ‘Guru-Shishya parampara’ (teacher-taught tradition). Apart from preparing and leading routine puja, yajna, ‘guru sewa’, Yoga and meditation sessions, the seers are also educating people about the importance of vaccination and social distancing to fight against Covid 19.Be it Acharya Anuj Mishra or Acharya Devendra Swaroop Bhramchari, these young seers and saints, from carrying out routine puja, yajna and guru sewa, are also handling the affairs of the camp on a daily basis..Interestingly, the ongoing Magh Mela witnessed lots of young seers and sadhus aged between 18 to 30 years, who are managing meals for all ‘bhandaras’ (community feats) within the camps or ‘kalpwasis’ staying in their tents, puja management, daily routine meetings, yoga and meditation camps. Acharya Anuj Mishra (19), Charkhi Dadri Haryana, said: “Apart from pursuing my Shastri degree in Sanskrit, I have been managing the Charkhi Dadri camp activities by the blessing of my guru and Swami Brahmashram Maharaj.”He added, “Waking up early in the morning and participating in routine puja and yajna, we take care of preparations of meals for saints, ‘kalpwasis’ staying inside camp and visitors arriving to take blessings of Guruji.”“ Besides, we take care of all petty affairs of the ashram, i.e., electricity supply, potable water, special puja arrangements within the camp and also ensure that every visitor gets ‘prasads’.” he said.Besides, they are also educating devotees about the importance of vaccination and social distancing to fight Covid-19.Dandi Devendra Pandey Brahmaswaroop Brahmachari Ji told TOI, “We learn management skills on our own and there is no need of degrees or lectures. Serving mankind is our only motto and we take good care of gurus, seers, saints and ‘kalpwasis’ staying in camps. From preparing meals to arranging beds and serving each and every visitor, inspires us to do better in life.”Most young seers, associated with their gurus for years, have good knowledge of camps’ routine affairs. They are also experts in delivering religious discourses and connect with their devotees/pupils online, too.There are over 3,500 camps of seers and saints across the Magh Mela. A majority of these camps are governed by the teams of young saints and seers who believe that they can carve a niche for themselves by serving humanity and for that they need no degree or special lectures. The grace of their guru provides them skills to run the management of camps and ashrams.“It takes a few years’ time when we learn about all minutes to run a camp for the devotees and welcoming the guests,” said another young seer, adding, “The work and responsibility is assigned to every individual in the camp or ashram and all of us work collectively to make things better,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/young-seers-run-camps-at-magh-mela-hold-online-discourses/articleshow/89027898.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Seers at Magh Mela demand freeing of temples, mutts from Govt control||Prayagraj: President of the Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Swami Parishad, Swami Brahmashram Maharaj besides seers and saints from different Hindu outfits have demanded that temples and Hindu mutts be freed from government control. “Prominent saints and seers on Thursday held a meeting on Mela campus and demanded that all Hindu temples and mutts across the country should be freed from government control. When the government has no control over churches and mosques, why should only Hindu temples and mutts be controlled by it,” questioned Maharaj after holding an important meeting at the camp of Akhil Bharatiya Dandi Sanyasi Parishad, Sector-5 on theMela campus here on Thursday.He said, “According to Sanatan Dharma tradition, ashrams and Sanskrit schools should be run by temples and mutts. Therefore, the government should adopt similar policy and free temples from its control at the earliest.”“Prominent seers, saints of the country would launch a mass movement to free Hindu temples and maths across the country from the control of government,” said Maharaj.He also claimed, “It’s an irony that Sanatan Dharma and its followers have always been on the target of the government since country’s independence. Till now, not a single mosque or church in the country has been controlled by the government.”“None of the government has dared to look into the activities taking place inside religious places of other religions, except temples,” said the Peethadhishwar Swami.The seers claimed that “not only the affairs of many prominent temples of the country are under government control, but some temples and mutts are even being looked after by persons of other religions who are not even aware of our religious practices and rituals”.The Dandi sanyasi also claimed that the , day-to-day affairs or for that matter the religious rituals and practices of temples and mutts.On being asked whom the saint and seers’ community is going to support in the state assembly election, they said, “We will support the party which will work in the interest of the country. It should also have a clear development agenda and is able to provide riot- free environment in the state.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/seers-at-magh-mela-demand-freeing-of-temples-mutts-from-govt-control/articleshow/89027899.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Wary of NOTA, parties doubly cautions in choosing candidates||Prayagraj: Keeping in mind that None Of The Above (NOTA) has been a spoilsport in different assembly segments in Prayagraj region, political parties, which are busy finalising their polling strategy and names of the candidates for the assembly elections, are this time doubly cautious in choosing candidates.Going by the statistics of 2017 assembly polls, NOTA has been fairly popular among voters. In fact, at Pratappur assembly seat, the number of NOTA votes were more than the victory margin of the winning candidate.Although the option of NOTA was available only in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, for the first time in the 2017 assembly elections, this option was given to the voters. The statistics testify that voters of Prayagraj, Kaushambi and Pratapgarh made full use of it, say political analysts.On the directions of the Supreme Court, voters can cast their vote against NOTA if they so wish.In the 2017 assembly elections of Pratappur seat, BSP’s Mujtaba Siddiqui, who was elected MLA from this assembly segment, defeated BJP-backed Apna Dal candidate Karan Singh Patel by a margin of 2,654 votes. The interesting fact is that the number of NOTA votes in this seat was 2,916. Thus, the margin of victory of Mujtaba was less than that of NOTA. Had voters not shown their displeasure, the results could have been different. Of the total 14 candidates contesting from here, nine got less than NOTA votes, political analysts said.The extent to which NOTA was used in the 2017 elections can also be gauged from the figures of all the three assembly segments in the urban area. A total of 63 candidates were in the fray from the three assembly segments of the city, Allahabad North, Allahabad South and Allahabad West. Of these, 45 were those who got less votes than NOTA.Allahabad South too faced more or less the same situation wherein 663 votes were cast in NOTA category. Even with such a small number of NOTA votes, there were 14 candidates who got less votes than NOTA. In this seat, the candidates of CPI, RLD and Nishad Party could not reach the votes of NOTA.Of the total 14 candidates in the Allahabad West constituency, eight got less than NOTA votes. Here 1658 people used NOTA. Eight candidates had longed for so many votes.Commenting on the usage of NOTA, former vice-chancellor of UP Rajarshi Tandon Open University, Prof MP Dubey says, “There should be special mention of Koraon, which is considered to be backward area of the district, but voters openly showed their dissatisfaction against leaders in this assembly. Out of the 12 assembly constituencies of the district, 3,208 NOTA were cast from this seat.”Here Samajwadi Party candidate Ramdev Nidar got only 732 more votes than the votes of NOTA. Here too, CPI, CPM and RLD candidates could get only half the votes from NOTA. Interestingly, even in the 2014 parliamentary elections, the maximum NOTA was used here. “The NOTA figures in the 2014 and 2017 elections are a testimony to the increasing unacceptability of politicians among people facing problems.

Though beauticians in the district have suffered a lot of inconvenience, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions, the fraternity has not received any support from the government. Despite all these problems, the government has introduced the weekend curfew, that has added to their woes. Mangalore Ladies Beauticians Association members said that nearly 25 parlours have already been closed due to sustaining financial losses in the last two years. Mangalore Ladies Beauticians Association president Babitha U Shetty told TOI, that the association with nearly 350 members, has been collecting details of the status of all beauty parlours. “Many have already closed the parlours due to the financial burden and bank loans. Weekend curfew may lead to severe financial crisis, and beauty parlour owners may be forced to take extreme steps,” she said. “We get only about four to five customers on weekends. We have been following all guidelines of the government, while attending to our customers on Saturdays and Sundays,” she said, and urged the government to withdraw the weekend curfew order. Jessica Kiran, a member of the association, said, “Cosmetics and other items stocked in most of the beauty parlours are getting expired, and they cannot be used any more. Despite facing such difficulties, we are paying for the trade licence and running the business legally. We have already submitted a memorandum to the chief minister, narrating our plight during the past two years, due to the pandemic and lockdowns. We have already gone through tough phases of facing financial losses, and many of us have commitments towards our families too.” Another member, Shalet Pinto, said beauty parlour owners find it difficult to get loans from banks. Members lamented that they do not get loans from banks due to the pandemic. “Earlier, there were good offers from banks, and the CIBIL scores used to be at a good level. However, due to the bad financial situation in the backdrop of the pandemic, the CIBIL scores have also gone below the benchmark, and banks reject loan offers,” the members said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/weekend-curfew-business-hit-of-500-beauty-parlours-in-city/articleshow/89025313.cms||---

The ministry on Wednesday announced 10 winning cities for the challenge, in collaboration with Bernard van Leer Foundation (BvLF) and technical partner World Resources Institute India. The challenge is a three year phased initiative aimed at shaping early childhood-friendly neighbourhoods in Indian cities. The list of winning cities also includes Kochi. The finalists were selected following comprehensive evaluation by a jury of representatives from MoHUA, BvLF, and independent experts in the fields of urban design, early childhood development, and behavioural change. Following the challenge kick-off in November 2020, over 60 city agencies nationwide responded to an open call for proposals to implement neighbourhood-level pilot projects to enhance the physical and psychological health of infants, toddlers, and their caregivers. Shortlisted by an expert committee in February 2021 based on the strength of their proposals, 25 cities received technical assistance and capacity building over the next seven months to demonstrate early wins, solicit citizen participation, and build consensus around their projects. Under the challenge the 10 winning cities will receive technical assistance and capacity building to replicate pilots with learnings and influence development plans, regulations and policies in the scale up phase. As part of the proposal, SCTL aimed to provide a neighbourhood where young children can safely move around, play, and connect with nature. The plan was to redesign their streets and green spaces and add safety measures in public spaces.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/tvm-loses-out-in-smart-city-challenge/articleshow/89025977.cms||---

South Western Railway (SWR) has 3,037 route kilometres (RKM) in Karnataka. Out of its total 3,603 route km, SWR has registered only 40.13% electrification as on December 31, 2021. It stands 17th out of 18 railway zones in the country. Goa, in which SWR has 189 RKMs, has not yet got electrification. According to a document released by the Indian Railways on its website on January 17, Karnataka stood 23rd in electrification with 42.49% of rail route electrified. Telangana is at 11th with 88.68% of electrification, Andhra Pradesh is 13th with 85.62%, Kerala at 14th with 81.82% and Tamil Nadu at 16th with 75.44%. National average electrification rate is 73.9% as on December 31, 2021. Arun Javgal, a Kannada activist in Bengaluru, said Mysuru was first princely state in the country to have a railway organisation and to put rail line of thousands of kms. “This organisation was merged with the Indian railway in 1950 and since then Karnataka is getting step-motherly treatment in railway facilities. In the current scenario, all our 28 MPs have failed to ensure electrification of rail line,” he said. Kalyan Karnataka Grahakara Vedike president Sunil Kulkarni stressed on need of incorporating electrification right from DPR stage while constructing new raliway line or line doubling to minimise the cost. ‘25% growth in 5 years’Krishna Prasad KN, member, Karnataka Railway Vedike, Bengaluru, termed it as a progress as electrification was just 17% in the state five years ago. “We have seen growth of 25% in five years. Moreover, the office of chief project director, Railway Electrification was set up in Bengaluru a year ago. So, we expect 100% electrification in Karnataka by the end of 2023, as assured by the Railway Ministry,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/ktaka-lags-in-rail-line-electrification-in-s-india/articleshow/89027904.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

As there is no other regional centre, students must travel to Bengaluru, amid rising Covid cases, for registration, which is mandatory for all nursing students seeking government jobs.  Many nursing students from Hubballi, Gadag, Koppal and other parts of north Karnataka told TOI that the government had invited applications for the community health officer’s post for which registration is compulsory. “We have finished the course but we need to travel to Bengaluru and spend thousands of rupees (to register). Most of us are from poor backgrounds and we cannot afford travel expenses, staying and other expenses in Bengaluru. During this pandemic period, travelling to other cities is nothing but risking our lives. Besides, there is a technical problem to get online appointment,” said an aspirant who did not want to be named. “I went to Bengaluru with an 8-month-old child and I had to stay in a lodge near the council. It was really a tough time for me to get myself registered, the government should start regional centres,” said another nursing student from Hubballi. Mahaboobsab, a techie, who accompanied her sister to Bengaluru from Hubballi, said, there was a huge rush in the council office and staff were not polite to the students. “We spent two days in Bengaluru for registration. The government should start regional centres to avoid this rush and help students of north Karnataka for registration and renewal,” he said. Sanjay M Peerapur, the principal of the KLE Institute of Nursing Sciences in Hubballi, said there used to be regional registration centres in Hubballi, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru and other parts of state for registration. These centres were shut three years back. Over 40,000 nursing students graduate every year in the state and most of them are from north Karnataka region. Most of the students are women and all must go to Bengaluru for registration and renewal. “Many students share their problems with us regarding registration. We have been demanding that the government start the regional KSNC centres in north Karnataka,” Peerapur said. Somashekarayya Kalmath, senate member of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Bengaluru, said: “We came across problems faced by nursing students in registering their names with KSNC. I will take up this issue with the government soon.” Tracking systemWhen contacted, Usha Bhandari, the in-charge registrar of KSNC, said: “We have also received complaints of problems faced by students from north Karnataka regarding the registration. Earlier, we had regional centres but those were closed. The Indian Nursing Council is introducing a Nurses Registration Tracking System in the next 15 days, which will enable students to register and renew their names and nursing certificates online without coming to the KNSC.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/n-ktaka-nursing-graduates-struggle-to-register-on-ksnc/articleshow/89027906.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The case will now come up for hearing on February 4. The petition was filed by AAP’s mayor candidate Anju Katyal and two others. Amid high drama and commotion, BJP won all the three seats of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor in the mayoral elections on January 8.

Sarabjit polled 14 votes while Katyal secured 13. One vote was declared invalid as there was a tick mark on the back of the ballot paper. AAP alleged that a voting slip polled in favour of BJP was torn and it should also have been declared invalid. They also raised doubts over the tick mark on the ballot declared invalid. In polling for the post of senior deputy mayor, BJP’s Dalip Sharma beat AAP’s Prem Lata by two votes. Sharma polled 15 votes against Lata’s 13. One cross voting by AAP helped BJP win the post.

A former advocate general of Goa, Ferreira said he has started with door-to-door visits and the response so far has been satisfactory. Aldona constituency is held by BJP’s Glenn Ticlo who has been elected for two terms since 2012. This time, the fight is expected to be a multi-corned one with more than three parties in the fray. “I promise to repay the faith bestowed upon me and the responsibilities entrusted to me by the Congress leadership and will ensure that the party is victorious in Aldona,” Ferreira said. He said the constituency has been neglected for the last 10 years with several projects stalled. The market has been in a dilapidated condition. There is no bus stand, and, as in the rest of the state, unemployment is rampant. “I plan to rectify all these and will help youth in the constituency to find the right platform to launch into the world with confidence,” Ferreira said. He said the people of Aldona are eager for a change.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/aldona-people-are-eager-for-change-cong-candidate/articleshow/89047748.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: 2 kill man, transfer Rs 2 lakh from his bank account||RAJKOT: The Amreli local crime branch (LCB) has cracked the murder of an Uttar Pradesh native, whose body was buried by the killers, near Port Pipavav. The LCB sleuths arrested Anil Sardar (30) and Babunand Sardar (42) for the murder of Anil Chobali, who was working as labourer at the port. Chobali was killed with sharp-edge weapons on January 13 and the duo then buried his body behind the bushes near the labour colony. On January 14, a security guard alerted police after he reportedly saw a body part protruding out from the land. All three were working with a private company inside the port. Interestingly, Anil and Babunand’s motives to murder Chobali were different. While Babunanad did not like Chobali talking to a woman with whom he had an affair, Anil was in need of money and transferred Rs two lakh from the Paytm account of the deceased to his w ife and brother’s accounts. LCB officials said it was difficult to zero down on the killers and find out the motive as all labourers were working together and living the same colony which doesn’t even have CCTVs. Anil Sardar and Babunand are contractors for the private company and natives of the same village in Bihar. According to police, Babunand had an affair with a lady worker in the company which Chobali did not like. On January 13, Babunand and Chobali had a heated altercation in the latter’s room over the issue. Babunand lost his temper and killed Chobali with a shovel. Meanwhile, Anil suddenly came there and witnessed the murder. Babunand asked Anil not to disclose the murder to anyone by promising him a big amount. Anil immediately agreed as he was under heavy debt and was dire need of money. Later at around 2am, they both buried Chobali’s body in the bushes behind the port. Talking to TOI, Amreli district superintendent of police (DSP), Nirlipt Rai said, “Establishing the motive for the crime was challenging initially. However, after rounding up the suspects, we found the Paytm transactions that were carried out from the victim’s mobile phone application. Total Rs two lakh were transferred using this payment app by Anil Sardar to his relatives.” R K Karamta, in-charge police inspector of LCB said, “Chobali was not mobile friendly and Anil used to often help him transfer money to his family members using the payment application. So, he also knew the passwords and UPI pin. When we traced the transactions initiated after his death, we found that both the accounts belonged to Anil wife and brother.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/two-murder-friend-bury-his-body-transfer-2l-from-his-payment-app/articleshow/89027923.cms||---

He has not availed the said opportunity and now filed this writ petition seeking to quash the notice giving him final chance for submitting his written statement.“This court is of the view that it is only a dilatory tactic to delay the inquiry proceedings and nothing else. Fair opportunity is granted to the delinquent only to defend the case lawfully and not for protracting the matter by not participating in the inquiry proceedings,” observed the judges.Hence, the judges dismissed the petition and imposed a cost of ₹5,000 on the petitioner payable to high court legal services authority of Madurai bench.The judges said that the disciplinary authority shall proceed with the inquiry proceedings on a day to day basis without adjourning the matter beyond seven working days at any point of time and bring the issue to a logical conclusion at the earliest, not later than six months.

---||Madurai||Why not book social media platforms for abetment: Madras HC||MADURAI: Taking a serious view of misuse of social media platforms such as YouTube to commit offences, Madras high court on Thursday orally remarked as to why such social media platforms could not be added as an abettor/accused in cases. Taking into account the fact that videos such as tutorials to make guns and bombs are available in YouTube, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that if a person who is witnessing such videos commits an offence, then the social media platform is an abettor of the offence. The judge said that social media platforms are being used to tarnish the image of some people and abet crimes. Observing that necessary steps should be taken to curb such activities, the judge sought response from the state government on the mechanism put in place to prevent such misuse of social media platforms. The judge appointed advocate K K Ramakrishnan as amicus curiae to assist the court in this case. The court made the observations while hearing the petition filed by Thanjavur district police seeking to cancel the bail granted to YouTuber and NTK functionary ‘Sattai’ A Duraimurugan. He was arrested by police for posting a defamatory video in his YouTube Channel named ‘Saattai’ using pictures of late DMK leader M Karunanidhi and BJP functionary Kushboo Sundar in June last year. After he filed an undertaking affidavit before the court stating that he would not release any such video promoting enmity and hurting the sentiments of anyone in future, the court had granted bail to the petitioner in August. Despite the undertaking given, Duraimurugan was involved in similar offences for which subsequent cases were registered against him. He had also passed derogatory remarks against chief minister M K Stalin during a protest in Kanyakumari district in October. Hence, the police had filed the present petition for cancellation of bail. During the course of hearing, the court was informed that Duraimurugan had been detained by invoking the Goondas Act. The case was adjourned by a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/why-not-book-social-media-platforms-for-abetment-hc/articleshow/89027929.cms||---

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Keeladi excavation to restart in February||MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu government has given the nod for the eighth phase of excavation at Keeladi, excavations in six other places, and the move to identify the ancient Korkai harbour. The excavations will begin in the first week of February and go on till September, for which a fund allocation of Rs 5 crore has been made. In a statement, chief minister M K Stalin said that if the ancientness of Tamil and Tamil culture was to be confirmed, it required detailed excavations. The recent excavations in Keeladi, Alagankulam, Korkai, Sivagalai, Adhichanallur, Kodumanal, Mayiladumparai and Gangaikonda Cholapuram, have reaffirmed the ancientness of Tamil. Keeladi continues to prevail as the forerunner to all other excavations at present. It has disproved the theory that Tamil Nadu did not have an urbanised riverbed civilization like the Indus valley civilization which dates back to the 6th century BC, and that brahmi script was Mauryan in origin. It was Keeladi that gave a reply that was validated scientifically to these previous theories, proving Tamil Nadu’s ancientness. It proved that a riverbed civilization, which had literate people flourished on the banks of river Vaigai, as early as the 6th century BC. The de-husked paddy grains found in a burial urn in Sivagalai, dates back to 1155 BC. It has been proved that the Thamirabarini riverbed civilization is over 3,200 years old, he said. Hence, it has been planned to carry out excavations throughout Tamil Nadu to discover the pre-historic and early historical regions in the state. As a part of this, excavations have been planned in Keeladi and its cluster villages of Agaram, Manalur and Konthagai, in the eighth phase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/8th-phase-of-excavation-at-keeladi-from-feb/articleshow/89027931.cms||---

The counselling for the first and the second rounds of recruitment under different units had started on July 3 and 28 respectively and were completed in time. But the remaining vacancies could not be filled due to the panchayat elections in the state. More than 48,000 teachers have already been recruited.The process of recruitment of secondary and higher secondary teachers in the seventh phase will start soon as teachers are urgently required for more than 5000 newly-upgraded plus two schools in the state. Meanwhile, the state education department has also made district-wise allocation of altogether 8,386 physical education and health instructors recently for elementary schools. The district education officials have been directed to ensure school-wise and recruitment unit wise allocation of these posts by January 24.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/1-25-lakh-teachers-to-get-appointment-letters-by-february-says-minister/articleshow/89027943.cms||---
---||Patna||BJP should rein in its leaders in Bihar: HAM(S)||PATNA: The war of words between the NDA constituents in Bihar escalated on Thursday with Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by minister Mukesh Sahani sharpening his attack on BJP and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi coming out in his support. Sahani has made a dramatic claim that the BJP, the biggest party in the Bihar NDA with 74 MLAs, and VIP with four MLAs have equal value as far as support to the government led by Nitish Kumar was concerned. “Nationally, it is PM Narendra Modi who leads the NDA at the Centre, and in the state, the NDA means CM Nitish Kumar. I am with Nitish Kumar. Back in 2020, our party had given letter of support for the formation of the government by Nitish Kumar, not by the BJP. The BJP with 74 MLAs and VIP with four MLAs hold equal value as far as the stability of the government is concerned,” Sahani said. Sahani’s statement has shocked the state BJP. Panchayati raj minister and BJP leader Samrat Choduahry said, “Anyone is free to leave the government. But in 2020, the BJP had brought Sahani to the NDA. We gave 11 assembly seats to the VIP to contest and they won four of them. We respect the NDA partners.” However, on Thursday, the things within the NDA appeared to have moved too far, as while Sahani appeared cut up and hurt by the recent attacks mounted on him by the state BJP leaders, state HAM(S) spokesman Danish Rizwan appealed to the top BJP brass to immediately “rein in” their state leaders and stop them from attacking Sahani. Rizwan also appealed to Nitish to personally look into the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bjp-should-rein-in-its-state-netas-hams/articleshow/89027944.cms||Abhay Singh

Mayor Premanand Shetty told TOI that the city corporation has received many suggestions from the public, regarding their expectations on the next budget. “To fulfil various demands of people regarding infrastructure, the city corporation will make revenue collection more efficient. The budget to be presented in the last week of January will give more emphasis to property tax collection and all other resources,” the mayor said. “We have already held public consultative meetings inviting suggestions from the people. Most of the suggestions were all related to their demands, especially on infrastructure. However, some have given suggestions to make the revenue generation more effective. For example, the city corporation has not revised building licence fees for several years. Hence, people have suggested that fees may be revised at least for larger apartments in the city,” Shetty said. The city corporation has been witnessing an increase in the property tax collection, he said, adding that there are lacunae in the system, as the city corporation is yet to ascertain the actual number of properties in the city. “Though the property tax collection under the Self-Assessment System (SAS) has increased with the introduction of online payment facilities, many still do not pay taxes. The city corporation still has no proper data of actual number of properties in the city. We are in the process of digitising the data of properties in the city. Once the process is completed, we will be able to get complete details of the city’s properties, and this will help the city corporation to increase revenue collection,” he said. The MCC Standing Committee on Taxation, Finance & Appeal Standing Committee will meet soon to finalise the next budget, which may be presented at a special council meeting on or before January 28. Thereafter, a general council meeting will also be held by the end of January, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/focus-of-mcc-budget-on-resource-mobilisation-mayor/articleshow/89025354.cms||---
---||Delhi||Non-payment of dues to 12 colleges causing hardships to staff: DUTA||NEW DELHI: Raising the recurrent issue of non-release of grants by the Delhi government for payment of teachers’ salaries in the 12 Delhi University colleges that the government funds, DU Teachers’ Association on Thursday said that a system of discrimination was continuing within the university. DUTA members said that while the government spoke about Delhi’s education model elsewhere, it was shying away from paying its employees. Addressing a press conference, DUTA president AK Bhagi said, “The employees and their families are going through a tough time. In the absence of salaries for months, they cannot run their homes due to great financial distress, that too in the tough times of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Is this the education model of the Delhi government where the employees’ salaries are delayed and denied?” “These unjustified fund cuts for two years have resulted into the deficit of the tune of Rs 4 to 34 crore in different colleges and therefore, there is pendency of salaries and other allowances ranging from two to six months,” Bhagi explained. The association also claimed that the state government has kept “shifting excuses” behind the delayed release of grants and the fund cuts. “At times, they say that the money collected from the students’ fund should be utilised while in some other instances, they say that there is financial mismanagement in the colleges. However, despite several audits taking place, nothing substantive has emerged to prove the same. Delhi government seems hell-bent to turn these colleges into financially sick institutions or shift forcibly to self-financing mode with a higher fee structure. There also seems to be a strong apprehension about attempts by the government to take away the colleges to some state university like the College of Arts,” Bhagi said. There was no response from Delhi government officials on the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/non-payment-of-dues-to-12-colleges-causing-hardships-to-staff-duta/articleshow/89026491.cms||---

The seat had fallen vacant following the demise of VIP MLA Musafir Paswan. Sahani issued the statement a day after praising RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari had also called on Sahani on Wednesday. Sahani, a cabinet minister in Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar, has suddenly started showing more inclination towards RJD than his alliance partner BJP. He told a news channel on Thursday that the VIP would not hesitate even for a second to leave the NDA if the Bochaha seat was not left for it by the BJP.Sahnai also hit out at BJP MP Ajay Nishad, saying the latter had no stature in the party. “Elephants do not respond to the dogs who bark from behind,” Sahani said. Nishad had earlier mocked Sahani, saying the latter was not known outside Bihar. “BJP had given 11 seats to Sahani in the Bihar assembly election by ignoring its own Nishad community netas. However, instead of helping people of Nishad community, Sahani had sold the tickets,” Nishad had said.Sahani had also suggested the BJP to withdraw support from the Nitish government if it was unhappy with its functioning. “We are the people who follow Laluji and his ideologies. Tejashwi thinks that he alone can work for Bihar, which is not possible. This is the only difference between us. The day Tejashwi wants, we will work together for 12 crore people of Bihar,” Sahni had said, while describing Tejashwi as his “younger brother”.Asked about his meeting with Sahani, RJD spokesperson Tiwari said it was just a courtesy call. “I am also the president of Bihar Players’ Association. I had met Sahaniji to discuss a matter related to an athlete,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/sahani-will-leave-nda-if-bjp-fields-candidate-in-bochaha/articleshow/89027947.cms||Sheezan Nezami
