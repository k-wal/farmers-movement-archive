In its pre-Budget recommendations, the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) also asked the government to consider upward vision of RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products) rates as the rate notified for the sector at 1 per cent or lower is inadequate to cover the incidence of unrefunded taxes and duties borne on export products. "The auto component industry, being an intermediary, has recommended for a uniform GST rate of 18 per cent on all auto components," ACMA President Sunjay Kapur said in a statement. The industry has significant aftermarket operations that are plagued by grey operations and counterfeits due to the high 28 per cent GST rate, he added. "A moderate rate of 18 per cent will not only address this challenge but will also enhance the tax base through better compliance," Kapur said. With the focus of the government on environment, energy security and vehicular safety, he said it is imperative for the auto components industry to invest in newer technologies and create capacities to meet the growing domestic demand for such products. "Facilitating investments for capacity building and encouraging R&D and new product development will be steps in the right direction by the government," Kapur added. He also welcomed the government's policy announcements on the production linked incentive (PLI) schemes for ACC (advanced chemistry cell) battery, auto and auto components, and extension of FAME-2 scheme. These steps were very timely and "will facilitate the Indian automotive sector in becoming integral to global automotive value chains as also staying relevant", he noted. "The automotive industry is witnessing one of the most challenging, yet interesting times, ever. Disruptions due to the pandemic, new technologies and regulations are redefining mobility," he added. On its demand for upward revision of RoDTEP rates, ACMA said the current rate is deterring the competitiveness of the Indian auto component industry. Seeking reintroduction of investment allowance at 15 per cent for manufacturing companies that invest more than Rs 25 crore in plant and machinery, ACMA said, "This will motivate manufacturers to invest in new technologies, specifically e-mobility and its components/ ancillaries related to plant and machinery." Drawing the attention of the government to encourage domestic R&D and testing, ACMA said retaining the weighted tax deduction on R&D expenditure is critical. "The 2016-17 Budget reduced weighted deduction benefit from 200 per cent to 150 per cent and has further restricted the deduction to 100 per cent from 1st April 2020," it said. Besides these recommendations, ACMA said it has also put forth several suggestions in order to ease the 'cost of doing business' in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-wishlist-acma-seeks-lower-gst-on-auto-components/articleshow/88841133.cms||---

The stock tanked 20.54 per cent to settle at Rs 11.80 on BSE. During the day, it dived 22.55 per cent to Rs 11.50. On NSE, it plunged 20.87 per cent to settle at Rs 11.75. The company's market valuation declined by Rs 8,764.24 crore to Rs 33,907.76 crore on BSE. VIL has decided to opt for converting about Rs 16,000 crore interest dues liability payable to the government into equity which will amount to around 35.8 per cent stake in the company, as per a regulatory filing of the telecom firm. If the plan goes through, then the government will become the biggest shareholder in the company which is reeling under a debt burden of about Rs 1.95 lakh crore. The government has given telecom operators an option of paying interest for the four years of deferment on the deferred spectrum instalments and AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues by way of conversion into equity of the NPV (net present value) of such interest amount. VIL said that since the average price of the company's shares at the relevant date of August 14, 2021 was below par value, the equity shares will be issued to the government at par value of Rs 10 per share, subject to final confirmation by the department of telecommunications (DoT). "The conversion will therefore result in dilution to all the existing shareholders of the company, including the promoters. Following conversion, it is expected that the government will hold around 35.8 per cent of the total outstanding shares of the company, and that the promoter shareholders would hold around 28.5 per cent (Vodafone Group) and around 17.8 per cent (Aditya Birla Group), respectively," the filing said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vodafone-idea-shares-crack-nearly-21-mcap-tanks-by-rs-8764-24-crore/articleshow/88841177.cms||---

He said that oil prices in the country are still lower than other countries. His claims coincided with a fiery debate over a finance bill that the incumbent government has introduced in the parliament. The bill is one of the requirements Pakistan has to meet under the programme agreed with the IMF in July 2019. If passed, the legislation will pave the way for the disbursement of a $1-billion tranche. The controversial finance bill included complete autonomy of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). As the matter was taken up for debate in the National Assembly, leader of the opposition and PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif questioned how it was possible for the country to be an atomic power on one hand and be holding a begging bowl on the other. Assailing the government, the PML-N president said that the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had drowned the country’s economy and was also endangering its security. He called on the government to withdraw the controversial finance bill. “We have our political differences ... but bring another bill and we will support that,” he said on the floor of the house. Shehbaz warned that the opposition would protest in the house and on the roads if the government tried to bulldoze such a bill. “They are selling out Pakistan’s economy and freedom for $1 billion,” Shehbaz warned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-economic-condition-better-than-india-imran-khan/articleshow/88840980.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The Basel capital regulations were implemented for the domestic banks in six phases starting from October 1998 to March 2016. These were put in place to align domestic norms with global regulations. According to the working paper, domestic banking stocks declined only during two of the six phases of the implementation of the Basel norms. The opinions expressed in the working paper are that of the authors and does not represent that of the RBI. The working paper -- prepared by Gaurav Seth, an assistant general manager at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Supriya Katti, a project scientist and BV Phani, a professor at IIT Kanpur -- evaluates the market reaction to different stages of Basel norms implementation. Using event study methodology, it has been found that in the initial phase, banks were not prepared to raise the capital to 9 per cent from 8 per cent and therefore, the markets overreacted to Basel I announcement. However, subsequent announcements received a positive market response since banks benefitted from the previous experiences and were thus prepared to cope with the expected changes, says the working paper titled 'Stock price reaction on the announcement of Basel implementation: Evidence from domestic banks'. It said that a day before the actual implementation of Basel I norms on October 30, 1998, bank counters fell 2.96 per cent. Valuation gained around April 27, 2007, implementation was strongly positive for all banks when the RBI announced final guidelines for implementation of Basel II. For the third phase on December 30, 2011, the market reacted negatively prior to the announcement but later, the banking stocks saw a valuation gain of 2.03 per cent. The fourth phase was on May 2, 2012. However, at that time, all 34 banking stocks plunged 5.82 per cent. As per the working paper, the fifth phase was on March 27, 2014, and the market reacted significantly positively. Similar was the trend when during the implementation in the sixth phase in March 2016. During the third, fourth, fifth and sixth phases, Basel III norms were implemented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banking-stocks-broadly-positive-during-basel-norms-implementation-over-18-years-period-rbi-working-paper/articleshow/88841229.cms||---
---||World||Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell pledges to fight inflation in second term||WASHINGTON: The pressures pushing prices to multi-decade highs are likely to last till the middle of the year, and the US central bank is ready to respond to this risk, but policymakers are committed to extending the economic expansion to promote employment, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said Tuesday. The world's largest economy is on strong footing, and with inflation rising and employment recovering, "The economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policy," provided by the Fed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Powell told lawmakers, underlining the likelihood interest rate increases are coming. Surging prices for cars, housing and food have become a political liability for President Joe Biden, who in November tapped Powell to continue in his role as Fed chief for another four years, and also named Fed governor Lael Brainard, a fellow Democrat, to serve as Powell's vice chair. In the nomination hearing, Powell again vowed that the central bank will do all it can to ensure high inflation does not become entrenched. Economists are projecting that government data due out Wednesday will show annual consumer price inflation hitting seven percent in December, its highest level in 40 years, and the issue dominated the questions from members of the Senate Banking Committee. Inflation is "very near the top of the list" of risks to the economic outlook, Powell said, acknowledging the current rate is now "very far above target." But the Fed chief attributed most of the price surge to a "mismatch" between supply and demand caused by global logistics snarls, although policymakers also are watching wage growth carefully. "We have very strong demand in areas where supply is constrained, particularly around goods, particularly around things like cars," he said, adding the central bank expects a "return to normal supply conditions" in the coming months. But "if we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected... we will use our tools to get inflation back." The Fed is in the process of winding down its bond buying stimulus program, which will end in March, and is expected to raise the benchmark lending rate off zero soon after. While Powell stressed that policymakers have not decided on the timing or any rate increases, some economists and even some Fed officials say that first move could come in March. "It's time to move away from emergency pandemic settings," Powell said, noting that there is "a long road to normal from where we are." "The labor market is recovering incredibly rapidly" with the unemployment rate falling "pretty close to half-century lows" at 3.9 percent in December. Still, removing the stimulus measures "should not have negative effects" on employment, Powell said. In fact, getting prices to return to around the Fed's two percent target is key to ensuring the US economy continues to expand, and brings more people into the labor force, he said. "We see now the great benefits of a strong labor market can bring right across the whole population for the whole economy," he said, adding that "high inflation is a severe threat to the achievement of maximum employment and to achieving a long expansion that can give us that." Businesses nationwide have complained that they struggle to fill open positions, and record numbers of workers have left their jobs while the share of adults in the labor force has barely budged in recent months, even as wages have risen. Powell acknowledged that child care is one factor keeping the participation rate down, as the industry also has struggled to find workers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-reserve-chief-jerome-powell-pledges-to-fight-inflation-in-second-term/articleshow/88841243.cms||---

Park director P Sivakumar said this year’s census holds importance in the light of the devastating floods that wreaked havoc in the UNESCO world heritage site in the monsoon in the last three years. The last census of this sub-species was done in the national park in 2018. After the sample count, the outcomes will be declared on Wednesday. The exercise kicked off on Monday with a briefing. “According to the last estimation, we had 907 deer and then there were three massive floods in Kaziranga. We want to check whether the eastern swamp deer population has gone up or down,” Sivakumar told TOI on Tuesday. He said during the last estimation, the census was done in Kaziranga National Park core area — the Eastern Assam wildlife division. But this year, he said, the survey is being done on a much bigger scale in the adjoining areas as well. “This time, we are doing the census in Eastern Assam, Biswanath and Nagaon wildlife divisions of KNPTR. The sub-species has already spread to adjoining areas and thus, the census will give an idea how the whole landscape is being used by it,” he said. During the last census, 480 sq km area was covered, whereas this time it will be around 1,000 sq km. "The deer population is concentrated basically in particular pockets," the KNPTR director said. Total 35 elephants were pressed into the census, where independent enumerators including researchers assisted the forest department. Forest department sources said that the floods may result in decline in population but this won't be a cause of worry. Ravindra Sharma, research officer at the park, said major portion of this sub-species is mainly found in Kaziranga, though it is also distributed in Manas National Park in Assam. Hog deer has the highest population among deer species in Kaziranga, accounting for over 40,000 population. But eastern swamp deer remain vulnerable. Open spaces around water bodies are the habitats of the eastern swamp deer and thus, this sub-species is quite vulnerable to floods. "Kaziranga has the highest population of hog deer and is the main food of tigers," Sharma added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-swamp-deer-census-in-kaziranga-national-park-after-3-years/articleshow/88841283.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Deaths from the virus, although still very low overall, were rising at a faster rate with each passing day. India recorded 165 deaths on Tuesday — with data from one state awaited at the time of writing — up from 130 on the previous day. This was the highest daily toll in 41 days since 167 fatalities were reported on December 1 last year (discounting 182 deaths on December 15, when Kerala logged 125 fatalities due to the clubbing of data from several days). Read AlsoCovid-19: 7-day average deaths up 66% in India, cases dip after 13-day riseFor the first time in 14 days, daily cases of Covid-19 in India decreased on Monday due to lower testing and detections over the weekend but deaths from the virus continued to creep up.The cumulative death toll in the last seven days was 70% higher than the number reported in the preceding seven days. Tuesday's tally of fresh cases stood at 1,94,711, which is likely to cross 1.95 lakh after numbers from one remaining state comes in. India had reported 1.67 lakh cases on Monday, down from 1.8 lakh seen on Sunday. There has been a distinct slowdown in the growth of cases in the past four days as the daily percentage rise has remained less than 20%, with Monday seeing a fall of 7%. This period corresponds with the fall in daily numbers in Mumbai, where infections appear to have passed the peak, at least for now. Last week, daily cases had increased by as much as 56% on two successive days. However, several states continue to record a rate of growth in cases. Deaths from the virus remain far lower than at a corresponding stage of daily cases during the second wave, when the toll had touched 1,000. However, fatalities are now rising in the country. In the past seven days, 866 Covid deaths were reported in the country, up from 511 in the preceding seven-day period -- a rise of 70%. In these seven days, Kerala recorded 182 deaths, up from 132, Bengal 126, up from 77, and Delhi 87, up from just six in the preceding seven days.

"The talks in Geneva have proven that our strength lies in the unity and coherence of positions against... Russian ultimatums," Kuleba said during a phone conversation with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to a foreign ministry statement. Kuleba and Blinken discussed the further steps to deter Moscow from launching an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour Ukraine, which has battled pro-Kremlin separatists in two eastern regions bordering Russia since 2014, according to the statement. Kuleba said the United States remains Kyiv's number one security partner. Tensions around Ukraine have escalated in recent months, as Washington and Kyiv's European allies accuse Russia of threatening the former Soviet country with invasion. Moscow has demanded wide-ranging security guarantees from Washington and its NATO allies and insists it had been promised that the bloc would not expand to Ukraine and Georgia. After the negotiations in Geneva on Monday, Russian and US officials offered to keep talking, but there was no breakthrough. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against closer ties with Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ukraine-praises-unity-with-west-against-russian-ultimatums/articleshow/88841784.cms||---
---||India||Any ‘material’ demand by in-laws should be considered dowry: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the word "dowry" ought to be given a wider interpretation to include any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature, and held that demand for money for constructing a house comes within the ambit of dowry. A bench of Justices N V Ramana, A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli said interpretation of a provision of law that will defeat the very intention of the legislature must be shunned in favour of an interpretation that will promote the object sought to be achieved through the legislation meant to uproot a social evil like dowry. "In this context the word 'dowry' ought to be ascribed an expansive meaning so as to encompass any demand made on a woman, whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature. When dealing with cases under IPC Section 304-B, a provision legislated to act as a deterrent in society and curb the heinous crime of dowry demands, the shift in the approach of the courts ought to be from strict to liberal, from constricted to dilated. Any rigid meaning would tend to bring to naught the real object of the provision. Therefore, a push in the right direction is required to accomplish the task of eradicating this evil which has become deeply entrenched in our society, " said Justice Kohli, who penned the judgment for the bench. The court set aside a verdict of the Madhya Pradesh high court which had acquitted a husband and father-in-law for a dowry death on the ground that the victim had herself asked her family members to contribute money to construct a house, which cannot be treated as a dowry demand. Read AlsoDemanding money for construction of house is dowry: SCNEW DELHI: The Supreme Court said that the word "dowry" ought to be given wider interpretation to include any demand made on a woman whether in respect of a property or a valuable security of any nature and held that demand of money for constructing a house comes within the ambit of dowry. A benchThe top court said that the demand made by the deceased herself had to be seen and understood in the correct perspective as she was being tortured to bring money from her family. It said the order of the trial court convicting both of them for the dowry death was correct. In this case, the deceased, who was five months pregnant, immolated herself in her matrimonial home. "We are of the opinion that the trial court has correctly interpreted the demand for money raised by the respondents on the deceased for construction of a house as falling within the definition of the word dowry. It cannot be lost sight of that the respondents had been constantly tormenting the deceased and asking her to approach her family members for money to build a house and it was only on their persistence and insistence that she was compelled to ask them to contribute some amount for constructing a house," it said. The court said the evidence brought on the record shows that the deceased was pressured to make such a request for money to her mother and uncle. "It was not a case of complicity but a case of sheer helplessness faced by the deceased in such adverse circumstances," the court said while convicting both husband and his father under Section 304-B and Section 498-A IPC and awarded seven years’ rigorous imprisonment, which is the minimum sentence prescribed for an offence under Section 304-B IPC. "The above glaring circumstances, when viewed together, can hardly mitigate the offence of the respondents or take the case out of the purview of Section 304-B IPC, when all the four prerequisites for invoking the said provision stand satisfied, namely, that the death of Geeta Bai took place at her matrimonial home within seven years of her marriage; that the said death took place in abnormal circumstances on account of burning and that too when she was five months pregnant; that she had been subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondents before her death and such cruelty/harassment was in connection with demand for dowry," the court said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/any-material-demand-by-in-laws-should-be-considered-dowry-supreme-court/articleshow/88841904.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

With the theme of “Rahul/RG connect”, Congress is also mulling an App for a penetrative online cadre contact across the states nationally. The idea is to radically transform its social media-online strength for the next parliamentary elections, based on the exigencies faced during the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic. According to sources, WhatsApp groups-“RG connect 2024” - will be launched and members will be asked to propel the delivered publicity material and political messages further, by posting them on their personal social media platforms and disseminating them to other citizens. While the plan is to initially make multiple large groups in the states, they will then be subdivided down to zonal level or assembly segment level. In some states, they may even be taken to the booth level. Sources said active members will be made part of these WhatsApp groups, who will then network with party members and general voters through the strategy designed for the project. Given the ambitious project that Congress is going ahead with on the social media campaign, with “Rahul connect“ as the theme, it is likely to be seen as a hint that Rahul may assume the leadership of the party towards the end of the year when organisational elections are scheduled. It also suggests that Congress is focusing separately on the Lok Sabha elections which are over two years away even as it battles a survival crisis and faces a number of assembly elections In the interim period. Congress is in the middle of its membership drive, which precedes organisational elections, and the members are likely to be issued cards, who would then be enrolled in the WhatsApp groups.

---||World||US President Joe Biden to ask US lawmakers to protect democracy in Georgia voting rights push||ATLANTA: President Joe Biden on Tuesday sought to revive U.S. voting rights reforms and fight new state laws that critics say hinder Black and Hispanic voters as his Democrats face a dwindling opportunity before congressional elections this year. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris flew to Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthplace of Atlanta, where they will speak at Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, two historically Black schools. In a powerful moment of symbolism before the speech, Biden and Harris paused and bowed their heads before a wreath laid at the King grave site as members of the King family stood by. King was slain by an assassin in 1968. "Keep the faith," he told reporters when asked what his message was to people disappointed that he had not done more on voting rights to date. He and Harris then ducked into King's former place of worship, Ebenezer Baptist Church. Democrats are girding themselves for tough 2022 congressional elections that could strip them of their majority and the chance to change federal voting laws. Many civil rights activists say Biden should have done more during his first year in office to push for reforms, and some, including Georgia's Stacey Abrams, won't attend his speech. Biden told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that he spoke to Abrams and despite a schedule mix-up, they are “on the same page.” The speech will be Biden's second in as many weeks warning about the health of democracy in the United States. On Jan. 6, he targeted former President Donald Trump's "web of lies" about the 2020 election, blaming his Republican predecessor for the deadly attacks on the U.S. Capitol a year before. Trump continues to say that the 2020 election was stolen by Biden's Democrats through voter fraud, despite recounts and investigations that found no evidence to back the claim. Since then, Republican lawmakers in 19 states have passed dozens of laws making it harder to vote. Critics say these measures disproportionately affect minorities. Biden wants to build public support for proposed reforms to strengthen voting rights, particularly the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Both have so far withered under opposition from Republicans, who argue they would impose questionable national standards on local elections. "This is one of those defining moments. It really is," Biden told reporters as he left Washington. "The risk is making sure people understand just how important this is." In Atlanta, he planned to ask Americans, and particularly U.S. lawmakers, whether they will "choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadow, justice over injustice?," according to prepared remarks provided by the White House. "I will defend your right to vote and our democracy against all enemies foreign and domestic," he planned to say. Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said Democrats were promoting the idea that a "sinister anti-voting plot" was sweeping America. "It does not exist," he said. Biden will be joined in Atlanta by Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, two of the slain civil rights leader's children, as well as top civil rights activists, including Reverend Jesse Jackson, Reverend Al Sharpton, NAACP President Derrick Johnson and National Urban League President Marc Morial. Some voting-rights advocacy groups frustrated with a lack of progress are boycotting the president's visit. April England-Albright, legal director for Black Voters Matter in Atlanta, said the groups told Biden, "We don't need a photo op."

Claiming that most attacks were targeted at outspoken critics of the government and the ruling party, the EGI asked the Supreme Court to order a probe into the use of the ‘Tek Fog’ app to harass women journalists with abusive tweets. “This is a travesty of all democratic norms, and in violation of law,” the Guild said commenting on the latest instances of “organised trolling and harassment”. “The purpose of these deeply hurtful messages was to instil fear in them and to prevent them from expressing themselves freely and go about their jobs… According to the reports, several women journalists were subjected to thousands of abusive tweets,” an EGI statement said. “Further, given the allegations that there may be the involvement of influential people linked to the ruling party with the app Tek Fog, the Guild demands that the SC takes cognisance of the matter and order a probe into it,” the guild added. The EGI also took note of the recent instances of online “auction” of Muslim women. “The Editors Guild demands the government take urgent steps to break and dismantle this misogynistic and abusive digital eco-system and thorough investigations are carried out to identify and punish the culprits and entities behind it,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/editors-guild-slams-trolling-of-women-journos-critical-of-govt/articleshow/88842018.cms||---

A vaccine mandate imposed by President Joe Biden in September covers about 3.5 million federal workers and required them to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 22 or face potential discipline or even termination. The administration said on Tuesday that unvaccinated employees - including those seeking religious or medical exemptions - "should be tested weekly for any week during which they work on-site or interact in person with members of the public as part of their job duties. Agencies may require more frequent testing." The rules do not apply to federal workers who are working remotely. As of December. 8, the US government said it has achieved 97.2% compliance, with 92.5% of employees having received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. The White House Office and Management and Budget (OMB) last month encouraged federal agencies not to issue discipline beyond education and counseling or a letter of reprimand for most employees who had not complied until January. OMB did not immediately comment on how many U.S. employees have been disciplined for failing to comply with the rules. Biden's vaccine mandate does not cover federal employees in the judicial and legislative branches or workers in the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). USPS is covered by a vaccine or testing mandate for companies with 100 or more employees, but has asked for a delay in meeting those requirements. The administration said on Tuesday that federal agencies may impose disciplinary measures on workers who refuse to get tested, and may also bar employees from agency workplaces pending resolution of any disciplinary action.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-prsident-joe-biden-wants-us-agencies-to-mandate-covid-19-testing-for-unvaccinated-employees-by-feb-15/articleshow/88842202.cms||---

Maharashtra reported a marginal increase in its daily detections. The city’s Covid tally on Tuesday stood at 11,647 as against 13,648 on Monday, 19,474 on Sunday and 20,318 on Saturday. Mumbai conducted 62,097 tests in the last 24 hours, which is lower than the tests conducted a few days ago. “The Omicron wave (in Mumbai) is flattening for sure,” said Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. As experts expect different peaks in various cities and regions, the Covid tally in Maharashtra registered a 3% rise over a 24-hour period: cases climbed to 34,424 on Tuesday as against 33,470 the day prior. The reason for cheer in Mumbai stems not only from a dropping daily count, but also a drop in the daily positivity rate. Read AlsoMaharashtra sees 25% drop in Covid-19 cases on fewer tests, Pune tally down tooMaharashtra registered 33,470 Covid-19 cases on Monday, a drop of almost 25% and a reflection of the 'Sunday effect' as fewer tests were done over the weekend (diagnostic results are collated a day later), report Malathy Iyer, Bhavika Jain & Sarang Dastane. The state had reported 44,388 cases theBMC commissioner I Chahal said, “Mumbai’s positivity is down from 30% to 20 % in the last two days. Daily cases are down from 20,700 to 11,647 in the last four days.” The city’s test positivity rate was 18.75% on Tuesday as compared to 23% on Monday and 28% on Sunday. “The number of tests has not dropped drastically, but the positivity rate has. The overall trend thus is a flattening of the curve,” said Joshi. Reiterating that there is “no need to panic”, Chahal said 80% of Covid beds in Mumbai are vacant. “While 851 hospital beds were occupied on Tuesday in one day, 966 were vacated today,” he said. In the ongoing wave, the city has registered 46 deaths in 22 days, which is an average of two deaths a day, added Chahal. A senior BMC doctor said Mumbai has always registered the week’s highest tally on Wednesdays. “We should see tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) tally before stating that the decline has begun,” said the doctor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbais-covid-19-cases-graph-flattening-but-tests-down-too/articleshow/88842234.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||World||GOP bill in Florida would ban abortions after 15 weeks||TALLAHASSEE: Most abortions would be banned in Florida after 15 weeks of pregnancy under bills filed Tuesday by Republicans on the first day of the state's annual legislative session. The measures by Sen. Kelli Stargel and Rep. Erin Grall are similar to a Mississippi law currently under challenge before the US Supreme Court. It does not go as far, however, as a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy with enforcement provisions allowing citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone who assists in an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Florida legislation drew a quick endorsement from House Speaker Chris Sprowls, who said in a statement that House Republicans are ``steadfast in our commitment to Florida's children, both born and unborn.'' Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is up for re-election this year and is considered a top Republican presidential hopeful for 2024, told reporters he would likely be in favor as well. ``There's a lot of pro-life legislation. We're going to be welcoming it. I haven't looked at every single bill. I think if you look at what's been done in some of these other states - I mean when you start talking about 15 weeks where you have really serious pain and heartbeats and all this stuff - having protections I think is something that makes a lot of sense,'' the governor said. The bills have no exceptions for rape and incest but they do say an abortion outside the proposed 15-week limit would be allowed if necessary to save the mother's life, prevent a mother's serious injury or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. Florida currently allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Democrats, the minority party in both legislative chambers, said they would fiercely oppose the measure. ``We will continue to fight vociferously for a woman's right to choose and right to health care,'' Senate Democratic leader Lauren Book said. ``We will fight tooth and nail over that bill,'' added Rep. Evan Jenne, the House minority leader. These latest abortion bills will join others that could be considered in committees during the 60-day legislative session that began Tuesday. Senate President Wilton Simpson said he is optimistic the 15-week bill can pass. ``I think it's a very good start and I think it's something the committee process will vet out and perhaps be on the floor at some point,'' said Simpson, who was adopted as a young child. ``I've been pro-life all of my life.''||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gop-bill-in-florida-would-ban-abortions-after-15-weeks/articleshow/88842311.cms||---
---||India||Create separate jail wards for trans inmates: MHA to states||NEW DELHI: Sharing suggestions with all the states and Union Territories on how to ensure safety of transgenders lodged in jails and their protection from any form of exploitation, the home ministry has proposed creation of a separate enclosure or ward for trans-men and trans-women inmates in prisons, separate from the male and female enclosures, while ensuring that this does not isolate them completely or propagate any social stigma. In a letter sent to all state chief secretaries, UT administrators and DGPs and IGPs on Monday, the home ministry suggested that there should be adequate preservation of the right of privacy and dignity of transgenders in regard to separate toilets and shower facilities for trans-men and trans-women inmates. The suggestions on treatment and care of transgender persons in prisons are aimed at bringing the infrastructure in jails and correctional facilities in line with provisions of The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the rules framed thereunder. The act guarantees transgenders – whose gender does not match the gender assigned to them at birth, persons with intersex variations or persons having socio-cultural identities such as ‘kinnar’, ‘hijra’ etc – a recognition of their preferred gender identity, prohibition against discrimination and access to state-sponsored welfare measures. Asking for self-identity of transgender persons to be respected in regard to jail admission procedures, medical examination, search, lodging, clothing and treatment or care inside prisons, the MHA suggested that the prison department of the respective states/UTs facilitate the process of acquiring of transgender identity certificate if such a request is received, by registering them on the online national portal for transgender persons. Not only transgender identity option must be included in the prison admission register and the electronic prison management system, but the home ministry suggested that a transgender inmate be searched only by a person of their preferred gender or by a trained medical professional. Privacy and dignity of the transgender person being searched should be maintained, including a strip search only in a private space, and the procedure should be limited to honouring security protocols and restriction of contraband, and not aimed at determining the person’s gender. MHA said the transgender inmates should have equal right to healthcare, without any discrimination on grounds of their gender identity. Such prisoners, it added, must be allowed an opportunity to interact with their family members, relatives, friends and legal advisers and after-care planning by probation, welfare or rehabilitation officers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/create-separate-jail-wards-for-trans-inmates-mha-to-states/articleshow/88842323.cms||---
---||World||North Korea says leader Kim attended 'successful' hypersonic missile test||SEOUL: North Korean state media said on Wednesday that the country has conducted a successful test of a hypersonic missile, state media reported, with leader Kim Jong Un attending the launch for the first time in more than a year. On Tuesday authorities in South Korea and Japan detected the suspected launch, which drew condemnation by authorities in Washington and Tokyo and prompted an expression of concern from the UN secretary-general. It was the second test in less than a week, underscoring Kim's New Year's vow to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled. "The test-fire was aimed at the final verification of overall technical specifications of the developed hypersonic weapon system," state news agency KCNA reported. After its release from the rocket booster, a hypersonic glide vehicle made a 600-km "glide jump flight" and then a 240- km "sea in waters" 1,000 km away, the report said. "The superior maneuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire," KCNA said. Kim urged military scientists to "further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernize the army," KCNA added. It was the first time since early 2020 that Kim had officially attended a missile test. "His presence here would suggest particular attention on this programme," Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, posted on Twitter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-leader-kim-attended-successful-hypersonic-missile-test/articleshow/88842407.cms||---

Following the decision by the companies, the government will become the single largest shareholder in Vodafone Idea, holding 35.8% in the country’s third-largest telecom company. The Vodafone group will see its holding drop from 44% to 28.5%, while the Aditya Birla group will see its stake drop to 17.8% from 27.7%. The government will also get stakes in two companies under Tata Teleservices (TTL). While it will get 9.5% in the listed Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) or TTML, the exact holding in the unlisted TTSL, that has services in 17 telecom circles, is yet not public. Although telecom has been identified as a strategic sector, resulting in the government repeatedly bailing out laggards MTNL and BSNL, the Centre will get shares in the two private companies at a time it wants to exit several sectors of the economy. The government insisted that the move “in no way” means that it will take control of the companies and run them on a day-to-day basis. It does not want a management control and would rather prefer the companies to be managed by the current promoters, even as it plans to liquidate its positions in the future. The board of Vodafone Idea, which cleared the proposal on Monday, estimated that the interest payout for the delayed payments will be around Rs 16,000 crore, which it decided to offer as equity. The move, which saw the company’s scrip crash by 21% as it closed the day at Rs 11.8, was, however, seen as a positive by the analysts. Some analysts said that the entry of the government as the largest shareholder and the assurance of sovereign backing will be a positive for Vodafone Idea as it goes about raising funds from investors in India and abroad. In the case of TTL, the interest value estimated by TTML is around Rs 850 crore, although the same is not known for TTSL. The company had sold its mobility business to Airtel, and now runs an enterprise-focused broadband business. While the government has given a long rope to the companies to comfortably work out their business plans towards a revival, analysts also say that it will be a tall task for Vodafone Idea to stage a comeback. The company, which runs a mammoth debt of around Rs 1.8 lakh crore, has to compete with stronger players such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel even as it prepares for the transition to 5G and other modern telecom technologies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-set-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-vodafone-idea-get-stake-in-tata-tele/articleshow/88842322.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||Ahead of elections, SP Maurya quits UP cabinet, may join SP||LUCKNOW/BAREILLY: Uttar Pradesh labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya resigned from his post, sending ripples in the poll-bound state on Tuesday. Hours after Maurya quit, claiming that about a dozen more BJP MLAs would also quit, the party’s MLA from Tindwari in Banda, Brijesh Kumar Prajapati, three-time MLA Roshanlal Verma who represents Tilhar constituency in Shahjahanpur and has won the elections thrice – in 2007, 2012 and 2017 – and Bilhaur legislator Bhagwati Sagar also resigned from the primary membership of the party. All of them are expected to join the SP soon. There was also buzz of Vinay Shakya from Bidhuna assembly seat in Auraiya tendering his resignation. While Maurya, a prominent BSP face who crossed over in 2017 and whose daughter Sanghmitra Maurya is a BJP MP, did not disclose if he had resigned from the BJP as well, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav tweeted an undated photograph of him with Maurya, saying, “We welcome the leader of social justice and equality in the SP.” Sources close to Maurya, an MLA from Padrauna, said he was expected to formally join the SP later this week. The development, significantly, came on a day when the top BJP brass met in New Delhi to finalize the names of party candidates for the upcoming state polls. Maurya’s defection to the SP camp could potentially lend a shot in the arm of Akhilesh Yadav, who has been positioning himself as the most potent rival of the BJP in the forthcoming state elections, and help his effort to undercut the perception about the SP essentially being a Yadav-Muslim enterprise. Maurya, Prajapati and Verma belong to the politically significant non-Yadav OBC category -- a big factor in BJP’s spectacular wins in last assembly polls as well as the LS contests of 2014 and 2019. Sagar is a dalit, who, like Maurya, started his political journey with the BSP and became MLA thrice and a minister twice. He quit the BSP just before 2017 polls and successfully contested from Bilhaur on a BJP ticket. In his resignation sent to UP governor Anandiben Patel, Maurya categorically accused the state government of “gross negligence” towards dalits, backward classes, farmers, youth and small investors and gave this as the reason behind his decision. Prajapati, in his resignation letter sent to BJP national president JP Nadda, also levelled the same charge, saying that the Yogi government’s apathy towards backward castes, dalits, Muslims and small traders has compelled him to take the decision. Prajapati, himself from the potter sub-caste within the MBC bloc, said that he stood in solidarity with Maurya who is the “voice of the oppressed”. The development also set the speculation mills whirling about a few more BJP MLAs being in touch with the SP leadership. This also included Tilhar MLA Roshan Lal Verma who took Maurya’s resignation to the Raj Bhawan. Banking on farmers’ issues and helped by the saffron wave, Verma had defeated Jitin Prasada by 5,700 votes from Tilhar constituency in 2017. The defeat of Prasada, who was in Congress then and was contesting on a SP-Congress alliance, was a shock for everyone as it was his first defeat in any election in his home district of Shahjahanpur. In 2021, Prasada joined BJP and was promoted as UP’s minister of technical education. Prasada’s switching over to the saffron camp seemed to have played a role in Verma’s decision and he referred to that. “I have resigned from the BJP and will be contesting on a SP ticket. The decision was not taken in a day as I had joined the BJP to serve the poor, but the saffron party has neglected farmers, Dalits and those from the Backward Classes. It never hesitated from exploiting the poor. When I was with the BJP, I took up these issues with CM Yogi Adityanath many a time, but was always ignored as an influential party leader from Shahjahanpur played down these issues.” While BJP leaders refused to comment on the resignation of Verma, SP’s district president for Shahjahanpur, Tanveer Khan, told TOI, “Roshanlal Verma is connected to the roots and such leaders are always welcome in the party. Our primary aim is to uplift the poor and address their issues and make their lives better. The decision of ticket distribution will be taken by the party leadership and tickets are expected to be announced on January 12.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-elections-sp-maurya-quits-up-cabinet-may-join-sp/articleshow/88842521.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Covid-19 in Karnataka: Only 4.4% infected in hospitals, 0.1% in ICUs||BENGALURU: The rapid rise in daily Covid infections is not reflecting in the hospitalisation rate yet, as the number of infected persons requiring admission to hospitals is less than 5% of the total active cases. Experts said the 5% hospitalisation rate during the third wave is not a source of solace because the sheer numbers as the wave peaks are likely to pose a huge challenge to the health infrastructure. On Jan 9 when there were 49,602 infected patients in Karnataka, only 2,162 (or 4.4%) of them were in hospitals and only 53 patients (0.1%) required to be in ICU. This contrasts with the 2nd wave when more patients required hospitalisation and ICU. On April 7, 2021, in the beginning of the 2nd wave, the state had 49,254 active cases of which 353 (0.7%) were in ICU. According to official data, during the upturn of the cases in the 2nd wave, 30% of the 1,27,762 patients required hospitalisation between April 15 and 22 of 2021."As of now, the hospitalisation rate is 4%. The situation is better than that of the second wave," said Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Covid technical advisory committee. In a video conference on Tuesday by the Union health minister with 126 doctors across the country, the global update on Omicron was discussed. One of the points highlighted was France's public health authority's statement that said the risk of hospitalization from Omicron was around 70% lower. Besides, in his letter dated January 10, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has directed all the states to keep daily watch on the total cases, those under home isolation, in oxygen beds, ICU beds and those on ventilator. His letter said 20-23% of those infected needed hospital care during the second wave. "In the present surge, 5-10 % of the active cases have needed hospitalisation so far. The situation is dynamic and evolving and the need of hospitalisation may also change rapidly," Bhushan has said. A senior bureaucrat told TOI one can't draw categorical comparisons between the two waves. "At present, the hospitalisation number may be lower. Our fear is the cases are going to increase. During the second wave, the active cases across the country was over 4.5 lakh during the peak. Now, it is likely to touch 16 lakh," the officer said. The officer said Karnataka will, in some time, witness 1.2 to 1.5 lakh cases a day. "Although the percentage of the hospitalisation is lower, the number of active cases requiring hospital admission in days to come will be a substantial number. With 12,000 to 14,000 daily cases, we are just 10% of where we are headed to. Hence, we have 10 more steps to go," the officer explained. The officer said the thumb rule in the second wave in Karnataka was 13-15% required hospitalisation, 5% critical care and 2% ICU and ventilators. "In the third wave, 5-7% would be requiring hospitalisation and 1-2 % in ICU. Once the hospital beds are 70-80% full, there will be panic," the officer said. The state health and family welfare department has arranged for nearly 2 lakh beds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/only-4-4-infected-in-hospitals-0-1-in-icus/articleshow/88842598.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Three dental colleges get notices for excess fees||BENGALURU: The admission overseeing committee has sent notices to three dental colleges in the state for charging excess fees for PG courses, reports Sruthy Susan Ullas. The committee headed by Justice B Manohar has asked the colleges to refund the additional fees or they have to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violating the consensual agreement. The colleges which have been sent notices are Rajarajeshwari Dental College and Hospital, Bengaluru; Oxford Dental College, Bengaluru; and Maratha Mandal Dental College, Belagavi. The colleges have been accused of collecting Rs 1.2 lakh more than the prescribed fee. According to the agreement signed between the government and the Karnataka Religious and Linguistic Minority Professional Colleges Association and Association of Professional Colleges in Karnataka, the colleges can collect Rs 3.6 lakh for government-quota seats and Rs 6 lakh for private-quota seats. Additionally, other fees of Rs 15,000 a year and transportation fees can be collected. Colleges can also charge an additional Rs 30,000 as skill fees, if they provide it. According to the complaints received by the committee, when students went to colleges for reporting, the college authorities "demanded and forcefully collected Rs 1.2 lakh towards dental material and clinical fee". "Any fee collected over and above the fee mentioned in the covenant is contrary to law and construed as collection of capitation fee which was prohibited under the provisions of Karnataka Educational Institutions (prohibition of capitation fee) Act, 1984," read the notices. "The notices were dispatched on Tuesday. We've the admission order and receipts from students. They have charged Rs 75,000 for dental material and Rs 50,000 for clinical labs, which are not permissible under law," said Justice B Manohar. Maratha Mandal Group of Institutions president Rajshree Nagaraju told TOI they have not yet received the notice. "For every amount we are charging, we are giving a receipt. We have also displayed on our website the fees we are charging. We have a research centre, which is a centre for excellence approved by RGUHS, where we give skill development programme, and a red cross fee that we give to the university. Students have the right to ask if I am not giving a receipt. Here, there is a receipt and a reason. There is transparency," she said.RR Nagar Dental College said it did not want to respond until it received the notice. Oxford Dental College said they have not asked students to pay any fees at the college. "We have not asked students to come and pay any fees in our college. Students have to pay fees only at KEA. The last date for admissions, as per Dental Council of India, was November 20. However, the state government conducted the counseling in December. Hence, all admissions are yet to be approved," said Dr AR Pradeep, principal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/3-dental-colleges-get-notices-for-excess-fees/articleshow/88842604.cms||---

The scrip closed nearly 3% up on Bombay Stock Exchange at Rs 44.80 on Tuesday.From Tuesday, the GIL scrip began trading as just an airports operator following the demerger of its non-airports businesses like power and urban infrastructure into GMR Power and Urban Infrastructure Ltd (GPUIL). With this, the existing shareholders of GIL will receive one equity share of Rs 5 face value each of GPUIL for every 10 equity shares of Rs 1 face value each of GIL. The demerger took place through a vertical split that resulted in listed companies – GIL and GPUIL – and a mirror shareholding of both. With the demerger, all the shareholders of GIL will become shareholders of GPUIL in the same proportion and GUPIL shares are expected to start trading independently on the bourses in February this year post approvals from the markets regulator Sebi and stock exchanges.GIL, which operates multiple airports in India and abroad with a 182 million per annum capacity under operation and development, has emerged as the world's second largest private airport operator after VINCI Airports of France, as per CAPA. In India, it operates the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi and the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad. Overseas, it runs the Mactan Cebu International Airport in the Philippines in partnership with Megawide and the Medan Airport in Indonesia along with Indonesia's Angkasa Pura II.GIL's greenfield projects under development include the GMR Goa International Airport at Mopa in Goa and the Heraklion International Airport in Crete in Greece in partnership with GEK Terna.While it has recently completed construction of the new terminal building of the Clark International Airport in Philippines along with its consortium, it has also bagged the Bhogapuram greenfield airport project in Andhra Pradesh.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, RJD's Tejashwi Yadav meet amid 'federal front' buzz||HYDERABAD: TRS supremo K Chandrasekhar Rao peeled off another layer from his thus far opaque plans to forge a political alliance ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election by meeting RJD leader and leader of the opposition in Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, in Hyderabad on Tuesday. KCR also spoke to former Bihar chief minister and Tejashwi's father, Lalu Prasad, on the phone and enquired about his health. Lalu talked about how he had openly supported creation of a separate Telangana. TRS sources added that KCR asked Lalu to return to active politics and play an important role nationally. "The nation needs experienced leaders and who have worked for the welfare of the poor like you," the TRS president reportedly told Lalu. This is KCR's second meeting with national leaders in just two days. On Sunday, he had met top leaders of both the CPI and CPM who were in the city for a national convention. KCR had been gung ho about a non-Congress, non-BJP 'federal front', until the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but had put his plans in cold storage after BJP's resounding win. He has been making efforts to revive the front more recently. Last month he met Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin. Tejashwi's visit to Hyderabad is seen as crucial because he came to the city solely to meet the Telangana chief minister and brought with him ex-minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, ex MLC Sunil Singh and ex-MLA Bhola Yadav. Tuesday's meeting was also attended by TRS working president KT Rama Rao and MP Santosh Kumar among others. Though the chief minister's office (CMO) claimed Tejashwi's was a courtesy call, sources said both leaders discussed joining hands with other parties ahead of 2024 general elections. Sources in TRS said both Tejashwi and KCR felt there was an urgent need for parties with similar ideologies to join hands and put up a united fight against the BJP. They spoke about the need to hammer out a detailed action plan. "The Modi government is ignoring weaker sections of society and adopting policies that would hurt SC, ST, BC communities, minorities and farmers. The government should be dethroned," CM KCR is believed to have told Tejashwi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/kcr-rjds-tejashwi-meet-amid-federal-front-buzz/articleshow/88842664.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Ahmedabad||Cost estimate to hold assembly polls in Gujarat in 2022 — Rs 450 crore!||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government is likely to spend Rs 450 crore to conduct ‘free and fair' assembly elections which are scheduled to be held by the end of this year. This amount is estimated to be the expenditure incurred by official agencies in conducting elections and does not include expenses which will be made by political parties and candidates. According to sources, the total expenditure to be incurred for the 2022 Gujarat assembly election will be in excess of Rs 1,000 crore. As a practice, the office of the state chief electoral office requests the state government to make a budgetary provision in a year when Lok Sabha or assembly elections are conducted. The actual expense normally exceeds the provisional allocation made in the budget, sources said. "For the 2022 assembly election, we have requested the Gujarat government for making a provision of Rs 387 crore in the state budget for 2022-23. For the 2017 assembly election, a provision of Rs 250 crore was made in the budget, but the actual expenditure turned out to be Rs 326 crore," official sources said, adding,"Against a primary estimate of Rs 387 crore, the actual expenditure on conducting the 2022 assembly election could touch Rs 450 crore. "The cost of remuneration of election staff, logistics, vehicles, increased polling booths and the like has increased substantially since 2017. Our provisional estimate does not include additional financial burden because of enforcing Covid-19 protocols," sources said."If we will have to enforce Covid-19 protocols in the 2022 election, many more booths, staff and other resources will have to be allocated, pushing expenditure up further. A fresh estimation of costs will be possible only before the election, and the present estimation has been done assuming a normal election process," sources stated. A sum of around Rs 175 crore had been spent by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to conduct the 2012 assembly elections in Gujarat. In 2017, actual expenditure increased to Rs 326 crore which is now pegged to cross the Rs 450 crore mark. As far as political parties are concerned, in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP showed an expenditure of Rs 111 crore, while the Congress had shown an expenditure of Rs 18.47 crore. As per the new guidelines of the ECI, per candidate expenditure limit has been increased from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 40 lakh. There is no limit on expenditure by any political party for their candidates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cost-estimate-to-hold-assembly-polls-in-state-in-2022-450cr/articleshow/88842681.cms||---

A simple question, but possibly the biggest challenge that most employees are facing since the pandemic. Several have lost jobs. And managers have lost members of their teams. In both cases, it’s a huge crisis and, after all that, how to keep oneself motivated is the key question. I was taking a session for a group of managers at a multinational corporation a couple of months ago. While I was requested to design and take this session, I was told that they do not want to listen to theories on motivation, but on ‘How to motivate team members and self after we face difficult situations at work’. I was a bit stumped. Having worked in the industry for almost four decades, I sat down and reflected on what motivated me, what demotivated me, who motivated me. And tried to answer these questions based on my own personal experiences at work and life. I realised that I had all the answers, but still found it difficult to implement them in real life. So, I decided to ask the participants the very same questions which came to my mind while designing this session. The outcome was fascinating. Let me summarise what I learnt from this session and how I found answers to these fundamental questions in life. For my first question ‘What motivates people?’, I asked them to reflect on any incident in their personal or work life where they felt highly motivated. What happened and what were the factors that motivated them in that moment. The answers revolved around freedom at work, challenging opportunities, empowerment, recognition, opportunities to experiment & fail, and so on. The next question was ‘What demotivated them the most?’. The answers revolved around micro management, public criticism, lack of recognition, lack of freedom at work, routine & ritualistic work, and so on. My next question was ‘Who ultimately helped you bounce back in life or work?’. While many shared it was parents, siblings, friends, colleagues or bosses, most felt that it was ultimately the individuals themselves. This whole session was engaging for me. When I then moved to some of the basic theories of motivation like Maslow, McGregor or Herzberg, they realised that all these theories point to the same factors which motivate people, demotivate people and so on. So, the inference can be that we know all the answers in life and work. But what prevents us from asking ourselves the right questions at the right time? It may be important to realise that these factors which motivate or demotivate us as individuals are not very different from what it does to others. So, the answer is simple. We need to do to others what we want others to do to us. This is equally true at work and in life. Then the participants said that it is easy to conquer the world, but may be more difficult to conquer oneself. That is the crux of the matter. It may be easier to advise others rather than oneself. It is also fun to give advice rather than implement any idea. Another important lesson from my corporate life is that your followers at work or your children at home follow what you do and not what you say. It is better not to say anything and make them follow by doing things, which you want them to do. Leaders always lead by example, not by quotes. So, I decided that I need to share this great insight with as many people as possible. Let us sit down and reflect. Let us look within ourselves. Maybe we have the answers for the most challenging questions in life. We also need to realise that we are responsible for bouncing back in life and work. Whether pandemic or otherwise, everyone else can support us, but it is up to us to stand up and get back. Let’s look within.

By close of trade, it had gained 13 paise to end at 73.91 against the US dollar. The last time the rupee had closed around this level was at 73.84 on September 27 last year. The domestic currency continued to be supported by inflows in the capital markets. The rally in equities extended to Tuesday with the BSE sensex closing 221 points higher at 60,617, while the NSE Nifty gained 52 points to end at 18,056. “Rupee has risen above 74 with an opening around 73.95 and flows continue to take it higher as importers are absent from the market, as is the RBI. The US Fed may be in for a rate hike, but that has overall not affected the dollar-rupee exchange rate,” said Finrex Treasury Advisors head (treasury) Anil Kumar Bhansali. Even as the dollar is expected to gain strength globally following anticipated rate hikes by the US Fed, the outlook for the rupee is positive. This is partly because of the strong reserve position. India’s forex reserves stood at $633.6 billion in the week ended December 31 — a $1.4-billion decline from the preceding week. According to a report by Barclays, the RBI is seen to be moving towards a policy of capital account convertibility. “The key objective behind this push towards further liberalisation of the capital account remains to fund India’s investment savings gap. India’s growth cycles tend to be constrained by widening current account deficits. Further liberalisation of the capital account to shore up financing can help extend the life of the demand revival,” Barclays said. “While the RBI has indicated it will take a closer look at easing resident outflows, we believe the policy appetite for large-scale outflows is limited. That would be especially true when the current account deficit is no longer benign from a funding standpoint,” the report added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-hits-3-month-high-of-73-91-against-/articleshow/88841231.cms||---

The accused Ramanjeet Singh, hailing from Meerut in UP, was booked under relevant sections for disturbing public peace. Ramanjeet Singh had allegedly abandoned his car on the premises of a hotel at Pattom on Sunday afternoon following a quarrel with the staff of the hotel over parking of his vehicle. The anti-Modi messages written on the car with spray paint drew the attention of the hotel staff who alerted the police. The slogans written on the car held Modi responsible for the deaths of those involved in the farmers’ protest and soldiers in Pulwama attack. He was picked up by the police from his friend’s residence at Pallippuram on Monday night. Museum station house officer inspector Dharmajith said that Ramanjeet, who was an automobile spare parts dealer, had arrived in the city five days ago. He stayed in a hotel at Kovalam for the first two days and then in a hotel at East Fort for the next two days. The inspector said that Ramanjeet was ailing from neuro-related illness. He had undergone two surgeries in the recent past and hence suffered from memory loss too. ‘’His answers during the interrogation session were incoherent. He was granted bail and let go after his younger brother, who also happened to be in the city, turned up at the station,”the inspector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/anti-modi-slogans-accused-released-on-bail/articleshow/88841137.cms||---

It’s learnt that a three-day statewide inspection has been undertaken by FDA authorities under the supervision of commissioner Parimal Singh. The objective behind the exercise is to ensure that the plants are ready to cater to the supply needs of medical oxygen if demand suddenly rises due to increasing patients. In the last two waves, especially the second, acute shortage of oxygen was felt across the state. In Nagpur, oxygen had to be brought from other states in oxygen-special trains and Indian Air Force (IAF) load carriers. During emergencies, some oxygen plants faced technical snags too, leading to disruption in supply as the healthcare system was crumbling under the demands of oxygenated beds. FDA assistant commissioner PM Ballal said liquid medical oxygen manufacturers like Inox Air Products at Butibori were being inspected to ascertain their current production capacity, fitness of plant machineries, storage capacities and such parameters which are crucial for their functioning and delivering ability during peak requirement. “FDA officials will visit the manufacturers, re-fillers and air-separation units of private ownerships for inspections. The reports will be forwarded to the Mumbai FDA head office for statewide review,” said Ballal, adding that joint commissioner Viraj Paunikar is co-ordinating the oxygen plant audits in Vidarbha region. Apart from Butibori, FDA officials will also visit the key players in oxygen production like Aditya Air Products at Hingna, Aassi Cryogenic Private Limited at Butibori and Jagadamba Gases at Mauda. It’s learnt that the civil surgeon and district health officer are conducting similar oxygen plant audits at the government premises like the medical colleges, AIIMS and rural health centres and hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/fda-begins-oxygen-preparedness-review-at-12-places/articleshow/88841614.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police recovered the money from the accused room within minutes after they reached the shop at Town Hall for an inquiry. The accused was identified as, M Mohammed Jamshed, 21, from Palakkad district. He worked at the shop owned by Abdul Ajeez, 35, from Palakkad. Ajeez also owned two other commercial establishments, which he rented out, a police officer said. “Jamshed had been working at the shop for three months and he was staying near Ukkadam. On Monday evening, he noticed the owner keeping the rental amount at the shop. Jamshed closed the shop around 10pm and returned to his room. Around 2am, he returned and stole the money. He threw the lock in a drainage canal and shuttered the shop,” the officer said. Next day, Jamshed went to shop at 10am as usual. “Upon reaching there, he called the owner and told him that the shop was broken open and the lock was missing,” the officer said. Immediately, the owner called the Ukkadam police who found that the CCTV camera was wrapped with black paper. “We found Jamshed’s behaviour suspicious and took him to his room and found Rs 11.50 lakh cash in a travel bag,” the officer said. Subsequently, police arrested and remanded him in judicial custody.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/grocery-shop-staffer-steals-rs-11-5l-arrested/articleshow/88841625.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Lankan don Lokka had close links with LTTE operative: CB-CID||Coimbatore: The CB-CID recently recovered a country-made pistol used by Sri Lankan underworld don Angoda Lokka from an isolated spot near Madurai -Sivaganga districts border. Lokka died of cardiac arrest in Coimbatore in July 2020. “We learned that the pistol, along with five live rounds, was buried on the spot by Madurai-based lawyer D Sivakamai Sundari. Her father is a LTTE sympathiser,” a CB-CID officer said. In August 2020, Sivakami Sundari, her friend Dhyaneswaran and Lokka’s girlfriend Amani Dhanji were arrested by the Coimbatore police for hiding the identity of Lokka and cremating his dead body in Madurai. Meanwhile, a CB-CID official said there was a nexus between former LTTE operative Satkunam alias Sabesan, 47, and Lokka. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Sabesan last October for his involvement in smuggling drugs and arms from Pakistan. Later, Coimbatore CB-CID officials took him under custody, along with Chinna Suresh, 35, an underworld don in Sri Lanka, and Sounderrajan, 25, of Chennai, for harbouring Lokka and his close aide Chanuka Thananayake alias Ladiya. P Sivakumar, deputy superintendent of police, CB-CID, Coimbatore, and his team arrested Ladiya, a native of Athurugiriya in Sri Lanka, and T Gopalakrishnan, 46, of Bengaluru, in last November. Gopalakrishnan aided Lokka and Ladiya in hawala transactions. Recently, CB-CID had taken the custody of Ladiya and Gopalakrishnan for five days. During the inquiry, the duo revealed that Sabesan and Chinna Suresh had left Sri Lanka after they were involved in a series of crimes against rival gang and drug smuggling. Lokka and Ladiya, who also had their hands in drug smuggling, moved to India subsequently. All the four were in contact with each other in India and they smuggled heroin to Sri Lanka from different countries, the official said. “After Lokka’s death in July 2020, Ladiya took over the drug smuggling business,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/lankan-don-lokka-had-close-links-with-ltte-operative-cb-cid/articleshow/88841645.cms||TNN

A substantial number out of the 371 may also remain ‘on duty’ in the work-from-home arrangement, as per state police guidelines. “The cops deputed to work from home can participate in online police training and upgrade skills in this period,” said an official. In the ongoing Covid wave, around 28 constables, three inspectors and three assistant police inspectors have tested positive with mild or no symptoms. The city police, devastated by Covid-19 in the first wave with 1,830 personnel testing positive and 28 deaths, had managed to pull back the number of casualties to four in the second wave, with 630 testing positive. City police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar said 27 senior inspectors have been instructed to speak to the personnel testing positive from their units twice a day, in addition to a central desk at the commissioner’s office which too would be communicating with the ailing cops and their families to monitor their requirements and offer assistance. “The eligible ones are also being provided booster doses from the police hospital,” he said. “Five zonal teams have been formed for random rapid antigen testing,” said the CP. Dr Sandeep Shinde, chief medical officer of the police hospital at headquarters, said 210 cops took the booster dose on the first day. “Apart from five zonal teams, one special moving police hospital team was also created for random testing. The personnel are getting tested and positive ones are immediately isolated for surveillance and treatment,” said Dr Shinde, adding that vitamic C, multivitamin, zinc, immunity boosters and kadha are being provided to all the cops. CP Kumar added that apart from periodic random tests, the special medical teams are also conducting contract tracing of the cops testing positive. “We are providing oximeters and medicine kits to all the personnel,” he said. The police hospital is also engaged in collecting medical history and data of all the personnel in city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/371-cops-aged-55-with-co-morbidities-removed-from-public-contact/articleshow/88841635.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Lucknow||Omicron found in 106 out of 136 samples in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: The genome sequencing of the swab samples of over 100 Covid-19 patients in the city has found presence of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. These samples were taken for tests about 10-12 days after patients tested positive, the results of which were declared on Tuesday by the health department. The finding, said experts, indicates that the Omicron was fast replacing the Delta variant in the state capital. Officials said that about 132 samples were sent for genome sequencing to KGMU. Among them, the Omicron variant was found to be present in 106 samples. Officials also informed that the Omicron variant has been found mostly in those patients who had traveled to other states and countries and their contacts. "At present, Omicron variant is being found in nearly 90% of the samples taken from across the state. This shows that the new variant is replacing the Delta variant in Lucknow in other parts of UP," said state Covid surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agrawal. "Seeing the trend, we are now focusing on home isolation and treatment of the patients along with massive contact tracing," he added. Experts also said that experience so far shows that the Omicron variant can evade antibodies generated by vaccines, but its impact on lungs is lower in comparison to the Delta variant. This, they added, explains why hospitalisation is low in the third wave caused by the Omicron variant despite a high positivity rate in comparison to the second wave which was triggered by the Delta variant. When asked about localities to which the patients infected with Omicron variant belong, chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, "State administration has not shared the details of the cases with us yet. Contact tracing will be done as soon as we get the data."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/omicron-found-in-106-out-of-136-samples-in-lucknow/articleshow/88842704.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The corporation will organise the collection drive from January 15. Collection points will be set up in all the wards and the drive will be held from 8 am to 12.30 pm. Clothes, bags and sandals will be collected on January 15. Glass waste will be collected on January 22 and CFL and tube lights will be collected on January 29. This will be the first collection drive to be organised by the city corporation after two agencies were selected for zone based collection. The city corporation council had in September 2021 approved the proposal of the health standing committee to engage two agencies for the collection of dry waste. As per the proposal, the corporation will earn money from transportation of 14 types of dry waste while it has to pay for multi-layer covers, bags, chappals, clothes and road waste. Pet bottles and hard plastic, two of the major components of non-biodegradable waste in the city, will fetch the corporation Rs 15 and Rs 13 per kilo respectively. Colour plastic, rubber and coconut shells are other items for which the corporation will receive money from the firm for transportation. The most commonly dumped plastic waste milk cover will earn the corporation Rs 13 per kg while carry bags will be transported at Rs 7 per kg. Oil covers, white plastic covers and paper waste are other types of dry waste for which the corporation will now earn money for collection and transportation. The corporation will have to shell out money for the collection and transportation of clothes, bags and chappals at rates ranging between Rs 5 - Rs 8 per kg. Road waste will be transported at a cost of Rs 7.5 per kg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/dry-waste-collection-drive-to-resume-on-jan-15/articleshow/88841157.cms||---

Now, the passengers can enjoy their time at the terminal by reading books. The library members have set up an aluminium box with a glass door named ‘Pusthakakoodu’ to keep the books. The box is placed in the waiting area and the passengers are encouraged to read books. The box installed at the Pothencode bus terminal includes newspapers, magazines and a few novels. As there are schools and colleges near the bus stand, a huge number of students also turn up every day. As a pilot phase of the project, only a few books are kept in the box. The library has decided to increase the number of books considering the people’s feedback and reaction. The Pusthakakoodu project was initiated by the State Library Council. The project aims at installing book boxes at public places thus providing an opportunity for the passengers to read. From Thiruvananthapuram district, a total of 50 libraries are selected to implement the project. As the library is on the top floor of the bus stand, the officials will also be able to take good care of the box. The readers can also donate books to the box. The total expense of the box is Rs 6,800 which was equally funded by the State Library Council and the library. “Some passengers even take the books to their houses and will return it once they finish reading. The library employees have given their constant support from the beginning stage itself,'' said Thulaseedharan T, the librarian. “In this modern time, reading has also gone digital. This project will surely bring back the book reading habits among people,'' said B Sreedharan Nair, library president. The Pusthakakoodu was inaugurated on January 6 by writer V S Bindhu. The function was presided over by the library president B Sreedharan Nair.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/pusthakakoodu-to-amuse-oneself-at-bus-terminal/articleshow/88841163.cms||---

The restaurant and hotel industry has learnt it the hard way that getting qualified staff back after the first and second wave, was tough as many had shifted to other jobs or to other cities. And with people flocking again to both restaurants and hotels/resorts almost instantly after cases started to decline during previous waves, business owners struggled to keep up with the demand. Navneet Singh Tuli, whose diversified business portfolio also includes restaurants said, “It is very difficult to get hold of staff who are obviously looking for stability. During lockdown they all shifted to other states where restrictions were not so stringent.” And the quality staff crunch is hurting till date. Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association (NRHA) said, “This is definitely the case with majority of people in the hospitality industry. I too have experienced this and that experienced staff has moved on to do some small business or other jobs. We tried to call them back but at the back of their mind the fear of again facing lockdown is always there.” Gaurav Choukasey, director of Olive Resorts, who first shared with TOI this new strategy of holding on to human resources said those who do will be able to survive. “Business is bound to bounce back as soon the new cases graph starts to settle. At that time resorts need to be fully staffed to handle the fully booked rooms and provide quality service,” said Choukasey. Even those who rely purely on catering services for revenue, have decided to hold on to their staff. Vinod Kanakdande, secretary of Nagpur Halls and Lawns Owners’ Association said, “Even with 50 people, we are providing services in the huge premises. We are losing money but it is much less as compared to keeping everything closed. Also we know that within a month or two things will be back to normal and it will be easier for us to operate at full capacity.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hospitality-sector-holds-on-to-staff-despite-restricted-operating-hours/capacity/articleshow/88841655.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The police believe the gang has many more members and have sent teams to neighbouring states to find out about them.The gang, the police said, would buy newborns from couples from humble backgrounds and sell them to “agents” in Rajasthan for Rs 1.5 lakh for a girl or Rs 4 lakh for a boy. The cops are still trying to find out the number of infants sold by the gang till now and locate some of the babies. Of the three infants rescued by the police, two are girls who are less than a month old while one is a four-month-old boy.A couple who had sold their baby boy to the gang for 50,000 were among the four persons who were picked up from Delhi on Monday. However, a deal by the gang to sell the boy failed as a childless couple refused to accept him over skin colour, police said.The network of the gang, however, went much beyond child trafficking. “Some of the women members were involved in a prostitution racket. They targeted couples and single mothers who were willing to give up their children for money,” an officer said.ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan said they were trying to find out about the other members of the gang. “They claimed to buy babies from couples who could not afford to raise them. But we are also trying to find out if they stole babies from hospitals too,” the ACP said. The gang was exposed on Saturday when an alert cab driver from the city had driven straight to the DLF-3 police station and got arrested two women and a man who had stolen two infants and were planning to sell them to childless couples.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/members-of-baby-trafficking-gang-also-part-of-sex-racket/articleshow/88842707.cms||Bagish Jha

In a directive issued here on Tuesday, HRC chairman Antony Dominic said that all station house officers shall be directed to take strict action against drivers who park their vehicles on footpaths blocking the path of pedestrians. The directive was given to the city police commissioner. The commissioner has submitted a report on this regard. As per the report, instructions have been given to police to take action against people who park vehicles on footpaths within Cantonment subdivision limits. Special attention will be given to regulate footpath parking at Statue Junction. The report said that the police department and the corporation have jointly deputed wardens to check the practice of footpath parking. The directive was issued based on a complaint filed by M Vijayakumaran Nair, secretary of Thiruvananthapuram development forum. In the complaint he said that the footpaths in front of Secretariat annex buildings and in front of the Cantonment police station are often encroached by vehicles. He also attached a picture of a vehicle parked on the tiled footpath near the Cantonment police station. The study and analysis section of the draft master plan prepared by the town and country planning department also highlights the issue of unscientific parking.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/footpath-parking-hrc-demands-action/articleshow/88841169.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana village in mourning: ‘The 4 girls were inseparable, died together too’||GURUGRAM: The cousins were inseparable. They would play, eat, study and go around the village together. “Look at their fate. They died together too,” said a villager in Kangarka of Nuh, where four girls died on Monday evening after a 20ft mound collapsed on them. A fifth, aged eight years, could be rescued alive from under the heap of soil. Around 6.30pm, the five cousins — Janista (18), Taslima (12), Vakila (19), Gulsafa (9) and Sophia (8) — had walked up to the 20ft mound in the village to dig soil for building clay ovens at home. As they began digging at the base, the soil came loose and the entire structure collapsed on them. Vakila, who was the eldest of the five, was to meet a suitor on Tuesday. The boy’s family visited the village on Tuesday, but to attend the funeral instead of fixing the marriage. “My daughter was so excited to meet the boy’s family today. We were preparing for their visit for the past few days,” said Vakila’s father Sher Mohammad, a cabbie. Vakila, who had studied till Class VIII, would help her mother with household chores. “I last spoke to her around 12.30pm, when she gave me food before I left for work,” her father said. The four houses in a row, where the girls lived, were shrouded in grief. Villagers flocked to the houses through the day to express condolences. One of them was Mohammad, who recollected how he would always see the girls together. “You could say they were inseparable,” he said. The spot where the accident happened appeared more like a trench, surrounded by small mounds of soil. The area, which was barren earlier, was now covered with stones and soil chunks from Monday evening’s collapse. Jakam, who lost his two daughters — Janista (18) and Taslima (12) — was too shocked to speak. His brother Hameed lost his nine-year old daughter, Gulsafa. While returning from work, Hameed had heard on the way that a few girls were trapped under mounds of soil. “Even in my wildest imagination did I ever think that my daughter would be one among them. I rushed there on my motorcycle. The villagers were busy removing the heaps of soil,” he said. After initial rescue efforts by the villagers, an earthmover had to be called for. “All that could be dug out were bodies of the four girls. Imagine the plight of a father who has seen his daughter like that,” said Hameed, fighting his tears. Sophia, who was the first to be brought out after around an hour, was still breathing. “There are four others,” she mumbled, before passing out. “She went with four sisters, but came back alone. It’s such a tragic thing to happen to any family,” said Javed, Sophia’s father.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/a-village-in-mourning-the-4-girls-were-inseparable-died-together-too/articleshow/88842709.cms||Sagrika Kissu

---||Gurgaon||Mercury drops to 6.9°C, IMD issues orange alert for today||Gurgaon: Residents woke up to a cold morning on Tuesday, with a thick layer of fog enveloping several parts of the city. The minimum temperature plunged to 6.9 degrees Celsius, a notch above the normal, from 8.7 degrees Celsius the previous day. In the early morning hours, commuters faced difficulties due to reduced visibility. However, the situation started improving from 7.30 am. With a clear sky during the day, residents basked in the sun after witnessing several gloomy days. The maximum temperature rose to 16 degrees Celsius, four notches below the normal. It was 15.4 degrees Celsius on Monday. An Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) official said that the minimum temperature is likely to fall by two-three degrees Celsius in the coming days. The IMD has issued an orange alert for south Haryana, including Gurgaon and Faridabad, predicting dense to very dense fog on Wednesday, with a possibility of a cold wave and cold day conditions. It has advised commuters to use fog lights and drive cautiously in the morning and night. “Heavy snowfall in the Himalayan region and the prevailing cold north-westerlies is causing the dip in temperature, which is likely to drop further by two to three degrees. High humidity with low temperature and winds are favourable conditions for the formation of fog, and moderate to dense fog is likely in most parts of Haryana in the next few days,” the IMD official said.Meanwhile, the city’s air quality deteriorated on Tuesday but remained moderate for the second consecutive day. The overall AQI reading was 175 compared to 130 the previous day. Two of the four monitoring stations, including Gwalpahari and Teri Gram, recorded moderate AQIs of 112 and 137, respectively. The AQI was poor in Sector 51 with a 267 reading. The AQI at Vikas Sadan remained unavailable due to insufficient data.Meanwhile, dense fog enveloped Delhi’s Palam for around four hours on Tuesday morning. However, there was no disruption at the Delhi airport due to the dense fog. Moderate fog was seen at Safdarjung, the city’s base station.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the visibility dropped to 50 metres at Palam from 5.30 am to 9.30 am. Safdarjung witnessed moderate fog with visibility of 500 metres.“It was the first time in this season when dense fog was observed for such a long duration. The fog spell will continue for one to two days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. He added, “The high moisture was supported by pollution and led to the formation of dense fog. It rained till January 9 and rain washed out the pollutants and hence, fog was missing in the morning of January 10.” After the passage of the most active western disturbance of this season, the minimum temperature dropped to 6.5 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/mercury-drops-to-6-9c-imd-issues-orange-alert-for-today/articleshow/88842711.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Only 2,865 recipients got jabs on Tuesday, while the health department had opened 10,180 slots — 5,000 for CoWIN-registered recipients and 5,180 for walk-ins — at 74 session sites. Nearly 38,000 healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens with comorbidities are eligible for the booster dose. “More people will come for booster doses once the Covid surge deteriorates a bit. Those aged over 60 years with comorbidities are not venturing out fearing infection. Thus, the response is slow.

---||Gurgaon||Workers not back at sites as cases spike, infra projects stare at delays||Gurgaon: With an uptick in coronavirus cases, ongoing development projects and road repairs have started to slow down across Gurgaon with officials and contractors indicating that “a sense of fear had set in among workers” of possible largescale curfews and lockdowns to contain the spread of the deadly infection, reminiscent of the first and second waves of the pandemic when hundreds of workers were stripped off their livelihoods and forced to leave for their hometowns and villages. Some contractors told TOI that although the situation was not “out of control”, many of their workers were already exploring options to return home.“A section of labourers have started returning home because fear has set in that if the cases go up, there will be wider restrictions and they may be stranded in the city without means of livelihood and food. Though the numbers are few, some labourers have also started leaving without informing their employers,” a contractor working on Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) projects, said on Tuesday.Contractors engaged in roadwork, too, have found themselves in a tight spot. Most of their workers, who had returned home in December following a ban on construction activities to check high levels of air pollution, are refusing to return to work now, they claimed.“December is generally an offseason for us since bituminous work requires a higher temperature. Also, because of the ban on construction activities, several labourers had returned home. The season normally starts again around January 15, but the recent rise in Covid cases has dented the prospects of their return,” a contractor associated with GMDA, PWD, and MCG projects, including repair and revamp, said. Many labourers, he said, were asking for job and salary guarantees in case of another round of lockdown.Senior GMDA officials told TOI that though none of their projects has defaulted due to this new wave of infections so far its impact was discernible at some construction sites. “Contractors are having problems engaging labourers. Covid is having an impact and things are slowing down. None of the infrastructure projects have defaulted so far, but there are other issues, such as workers with fever or other symptoms having to be isolated that are affecting the work,” a senior GMDA official said.The Public Works Department, however, said they had not noted any slowdown at work sites. “There has been no impact on our projects yet. There is no shortage of labourers or anything else. Everything is proceeding smoothly,” a senior official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/workers-not-back-at-sites-as-cases-spike-infra-projects-stare-at-delays/articleshow/88842716.cms||Sakshi Dayal

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 'Guard behind 4 killings also committed thefts, fraud'||GURUGRAM: A hospital guard in Faridabad who allegedly killed four girls in two years after they resisted his rape attempts is a habitual criminal who also committed thefts and frauds, police have said. He was arrested in connection with the murder of a 22-year-old woman last month. According to police, Singhraj (54) committed his first crime in 1986, when he murdered his uncle and cousin over a family dispute. He was convicted in the case and released after serving a jail term. For the past 13 years, he had been working as a security guard at a private hospital in Faridabad. Singhraj was produced before the court and sent to one-day police remand on Tuesday. During interrogation, he told police that he was involved in three cases of thefts and one fraud in various areas of Faridabad between 1991 and 2015. “He is a habitual criminal. Several cases are registered against him at different police stations,” police spokesperson Sube Singh said. Singhraj allegedly took a 22-year-old woman to an isolated area in Faridabad on December 31 last year and attempted to rape her. When she tried to raise the alarm, he allegedly strangled her and dumped her body in the bushes, taking her mobile phone. The woman’s father filed a missing person’s complaint with police after she failed to return home. Initially, police didn’t consider him a suspect as he had given a statement and even helped them in scanning CCTV footage of the area. Police zeroed in on him through the woman’s mobile phone, which was recovered from his possession. Cops claimed to have learnt during Singhraj’s interrogation that in December 2019, he tried to rape a 15-year-old girl who was working at a tea stall and killed her when she resisted. He allegedly disposed of the body in a canal. Singhraj allegedly killed two more minors after that and disposed of their bodies in a similar manner. “He was in open view, but managed to stay away from the police radar even after committing a series of murders,” said a police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/guard-behind-4-killings-also-committed-thefts-fraud/articleshow/88842718.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||1.3L more properties under tax ambit after MCG survey||Gurgaon: A property tax survey carried out by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has found that properties falling under the ambit of the tax have increased from 3.7 lakh to 5 lakh. This doesn’t include new areas added to MCG’s limits in December 2020. The civic body has now invited objections, if any, from residents.MCG officials said the tax assessment will be done once the data is updated after the objections are received. The civic body had outsourced the work of conducting the survey to a private consultancy firm and had assigned them the work in 2019. Officials said the firm took a long time to complete the survey. “When we hired the firm, we had around 3.7 lakh properties and by the end of the survey, 1.3 lakh more properties had been added to the tax net. It implies that around 5 lakh properties are eligible to pay property tax and should pay their taxes,” said Dinesh Kumar, MCG zonal taxation officer-2.These properties include commercial, residential properties and plots. Claims and objections can be raised on the online portal www.pmsharyana.com. For example, if the surveyor has made an assessment that a property has an area of 5,000 sq yards and the property owner says it is 4,000 sq yards, an objection can be filed online since tax bills will be issued on the basis of the survey.“After objections are raised, we will send an assessment notice to the property owners and bills will be made accordingly. The bills will also include property dues, if any,” Kumar added.Officials said the addition of new properties under the tax ambit will add to the corporation’s revenue. MCG’s income from property tax in 2021-22 is estimated to be Rs 1,235 crore. It has, however, collected only around Rs 133 crore till now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/1-3l-more-properties-under-tax-ambit-after-mcg-survey/articleshow/88842720.cms||Vishakha Chaman

With the Samrat Mihir Bhoj controversy in the backdrop, Gurjar leaders have started making a pitch for their candidature from Dadri, currently being represented by teacher-turned-politician ‘Master’ Tejpal Nagar. A Gurjar candidate, Nagar had to bear the brunt of the “anger” within the community, following the alleged removal of the word “Gurjar” from a plaque under the statue of the ninth century ruler Samrat Mihir Bhoj installed in a Dadri college. Insiders in the BJP say that it may be the only constituency where a change of face is likely due to the “discontent” within the community. “Noida is a safe seat and Jewar too has a strong candidate. However, it is Dadri, for which eight names have been sent,” a senior leader of the GBNagar BJP unit told TOI.At 5,86,889, Dadri has the most number of Gurjar voters. An estimate in the 2017 elections stated Dadri had some 1.2 lakh members of the Gujjar community. Meanwhile, the Akhil Bharatiya Gurjar Mahasabha too has demanded that most political parties give tickets to a Gurjar candidate from Dadri, Jewar and Sikandrabad. State president Amit Pehalwan, also a member of the BJP’s Picchda Varg Morcha, said “We have demanded from all political parties that the gurjar candidates should be given tickets. Our community will vote unitedly this time.”BJP leader Surendra Nagar, however, said that he didn't feel any change was likely in any of the assembly segments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/after-mihir-bhoj-row-gurjar-candidates-vie-for-dadri-seat/articleshow/88842722.cms||Shikha Salaria

It's not the sand mafia she has written about, but a subject that she calls “too close to my heart” – pregnancy and motherhood. Nagpal, who was suspended in July 2013, now has many more life experiences to share. Personally, and for her career, the stint in Greater Noida as subdivisional magistrate (Sadar) was a defining one. “When I look back, it was worth it,” Nagpal, who has returned to serving the UP government after two stints with the Centre and is now a special secretary in the medical education department, told this paper. The events of 2013 find a brief mention in the introductory pages of her book. “The sand mafia had the resources and travelled in cavalcades of SUVs while we had to function with restricted manpower and decrepit vehicles. After a few weeks of continued raiding, threats were issued against us,” she writes. Just 27 then, Nagpal says she never thought performing her duty would trigger a “hurricane”. “ It was a new government with a people-friendly face, especially popular among the youth, and wanted to do good work. We, as young bureaucrats, too wanted to perform our duty but never realised that it would result in such a hurricane. But in hindsight, it was worth it,” she says. She agrees it was a phase that toughened her up mentally. “The sooner you face challenges in life, the stronger you become from inside, whether it is on the professional or personal front. Soon after the raids, there was so much glare…. And then, so many policy changes were happening at different levels… the NGT stepped in, the administration came down heavily, the Supreme Court, and then the DoPT, which said you cannot arbitrarily suspend an IAS officer without giving her a chance of hearing…,” she says. But what transpired in the 57 days between her suspension by the UP government after the crackdown on sand mafia and its revocation? “A lot of miscommunication happened… the episode would not have lasted that long. I was told that my suspension would be revoked within three days. The file had also reached, but when something does not have to happen, reasons are created,” she says. While Nagpal was at the forefront of the crackdown, she recollects how people came in support of her. “Villagers would visit my office with ghee, butter, vegetables and flowers and say what I was doing was good. They often complained that their fields would get affected because of the illegal dredging of sand at night,” she says. Nagpal feels that while much has changed now, there’s still a lot of work to be done and illegal mining is a problem not restricted to Noida. She recommends the use of technology and surveillance to tackle the sand mafia. “Nowadays, you don’t need to physically check mining spots. You need to keep data surveillance strong and tackle the problem using a targeted approach. The machinery that they use for dredging is sophisticated. We need to target that. If I do not have a machine, how will I dredge? You need to confiscate that machinery first. Then check the companies that are selling them, they will have the data you need,” she says. The book, she says, was the answer to an “inner calling”. “When I first said I wanted to write a book, I was told to write something about myself. And then, when I finally decided to pen down my memoir, I wrote on pregnancy because you have an inner calling…. Wherever I have been posted — whether in Mathura or Kanpur Dehat — after Noida, my interest has been towards this. Pregnancy is a very important part of human health,” says Nagpal, mother to two daughters — Dania (6) and Digara (3 months). The bureaucrat says she wants to invest her time in working for children’s and women’s health, and remains ever confident in her ability, which also finds an echo in her book. “There’s nothing a woman cannot achieve if she puts her heart and soul to it,” she writes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/it-was-worth-it-says-ias-officer-who-took-on-sand-mafia-in-noida-9-yrs-ago/articleshow/88842725.cms||Shikha Salaria

There is one elderly patient who is currently requiring oxygen. But it is more to do with his COPD condition. Eight prisoners are also undergoing treatment in the hospital, as they cannot be kept in isolation the jails,” Dr Saxena said, adding that most patients admitted at the dedicated facility were asymptomatic, while others have mild symptoms.Most of the 22 patients admitted at Greater Noida’s Kailash Hospital have mild symptoms, like fever and vomiting. “We are advising people to take the prescribed medicines and stay indoors for their own safety,” Dr Dinesh Sharma of the hospital said.At Jaypee Hospital in Noida, doctors said most of the patients were suffering from body aches, excessive vomiting among others symptoms. “For patients who are getting hospitalised, the symptoms are almost the same as during the second wave which includes high-grade fever, breathlessness and oxygen saturation less than 93-94%”, Dr Gyanendra Agarwal said.In Ghaziabad, of the 26 patients admitted only one has been put on high-flow nasal cannula and eight others are requiring oxygen intermittently and most of their saturation level is between 90 and 93, district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said.Meanwhile, the state government has put several government and private hospitals on alert mode on Tuesday. In Ghaziabad, ESIC Hospital (L-1) and Santosh Hospital (L-2 and L-3), Rama Medical College (L2), District Combined Hospital and four community health centres (CHCs) have been identified as Covid facilities.

Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar told TOI, “We are going to adopt a zero-tolerance approach against hate speeches. Anyone found making provocative remarks will be arrested.” Sadhus from across the country have already been invited to take part in the 'pratikar yagya' to protest cases registered against seers who allegedly delivered hate speeches at the Dharam Sansad event held in Haridwar from December 17 to 19. On Monday, Yatindranand Giri, one of the organisers of the Dharam Sansad event, who is also among those organising the pratikar yagya, had claimed that "thousands of representatives of akhadas and ashrams will be present at the event." Meanwhile, a probe into the Dharam Sansad event is ongoing. A five-member special investigation team, constituted by police, has been given charge of the investigation. Among those booked for delivering "hate speeches" at the conclave include -- Jitendra Narayan Tyagi (alias Waseem Rizvi), former chairman of the Shia Central Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh, Yati Narsinghanand, the controversial priest of Dasna temple in Ghaziabad, and seers Dharamdas, Sadhvi Annapurna, and Sindhu Sagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/action-will-be-taken-in-case-of-hate-speech-at-jan-16-revenge-meet-by-dharam-sansad-organisers-says-police/articleshow/88839617.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Noida||Two barge into Greater Noida flat, snatch items at knifepoint||GREATER NOIDA: Two men impersonating polio vaccinators allegedly forcibly entered into a flat in Gaur City 2 at Greater Noida (west) and decamped with valuables on Tuesday. The men allegedly had taken the daughter of the complainant at knifepoint and snatched the valuables, including some jewellery. While police have received a written complaint and begun scanning CCTV footage of the society to identify the criminals, the family claimed to have recovered the stolen items. The booty, they claimed, had been left in a bag outside their house. The police, however, said that the incident might have been concocted and have called the complainant for questioning in the matter. “As per the complainant, she was alone in the house with her minor daughter when the two masked men, posing as polio vaccinators, approached their flat. The woman said that the two men wanted to administer polio drops to her child but she had refused,” a senior officer at Bisrakh police station said. According to the complainant, the men then asked her for water. “When the woman opened the door of the flat and went to fetch water for them, the accused allegedly barged in and held her daughter at knifepoint,” the officer said, adding that the two men allegedly took some jewellery and other valuables fled. The woman, additional deputy commissioner of police (Central Noida) Elamaran G said, immediately alerted the society members and police. “We closed the society’s gates and briefly checked all people moving in or out, suspecting the miscreants could still be hiding on the premises. Subsequently, teams were also formed to nab the accused and they started scanning the CCTV footage. By the evening, however, we received a call that someone had kept a bag, containing the looted valuables, outside their house. We have now called the woman for questioning as the details given by the family are not adding up,” the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/2-barge-into-gr-noida-flat-snatch-items-at-knifepoint/articleshow/88842732.cms||Advitya Bahl
---||Noida||Noida: These online frauds rode a Harley, kingpin got Rs 1.7 lakh per month in Mumbai job||NOIDA: Eight people, including a woman, have been arrested for allegedly duping nearly 300 people across the country over five years in the name of providing insurance policies, police said on Tuesday. The suspects are believed to have stolen Rs 8-9 crore. Police have recovered nearly Rs 47.5 lakh in cash, some jewellery, a Harley Davidson bike, four cars, 16 smartphones, 85 Aadhaar cards, six laptops and some other documents from the accused. In April 2021, police received a complaint from Riyaz Hasan (60), a retired general manager of National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) and resident of Sector 60, Noida, alleging that he had paid Rs 1.43 crores to the accused from 2017-2021 to purchase and maintain 11 insurance policies. "In 2017, Hasan received a call from a person who introduced himself as A K Tripathi and claimed to be a representative of an insurance company. The caller lured Hasan into purchasing several insurance policies with the promise of high returns. Later, some more people from the gang got in touch with him, with more lucrative offers,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Noida. Hasan had taken voluntary retirement from his company in 2019 and received retirement benefits. "The gang saw Hasan as a vulnerable target and started calling him regularly, demanding Rs 1-2 lakh and saying that the policies would expire if he did not make the payments. Hasan transferred a total of Rs 1,42,74,330 from 2017-2021 to purchase or maintain 11 policies," the DCP said. However, in April 2021, Hasan visited the insurance company office and found no policy in his name. "On April 13, Hasan realised it was a fraud and approached the Sector 58 police station and filed a complaint. We, initially, faced problems as the accused switched off all their numbers and went incommunicado. It was difficult to trace them," said Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida. However, police then got a tip-off that the gang hideout was in Ghaziabad. Cops arrested the accused from the Dasna area on Tuesday. Police have identified the accused as Niraj Kumar(35) aka Nikhil Pradhan, an MBA graduate and the mastermind; Amar Pal (30) aka Ram Pratap aka Atal, an MCA graduate; Vikas Kumar (28) aka A K Tripathi; Sohan aka A K Gupta; Sushil aka Sunil; Swati Sethia aka Preeti Tyagi; Shah Rukh Khan aka Rihan and Azharuddin aka Shambhu Nath. “During interrogation, they revealed that they used their alias names to call the customers and dupe them. Most of them had previously worked at insurance companies and used the same data and knowledge in cheating people,” the ADCP said. Suspects used to purchase flats, high-end vehicles The Gautam Budh Nagar police have revealed that the accused were fond of a luxurious lifestyle and used the money from their victims to buy properties and high-end vehicles. According to ACP-2 Noida Rajneesh Verma, the gang has revealed that they own properties in Dehradun and Ghaziabad. “They have flats in these two cities. The exact evaluation of the flats is not clear yet. The accused were keen on a luxurious lifestyle and bought high-end vehicles, including a Harley Davidson motorcycle, which costs nearly Rs 10 lakh," Verma said. “The estimated amount they stole is Rs 8-9 crore. The mastermind earned a package of Rs 1.7 lakh a month for work at a Mumbai-based company,” he said. The company, Essity India, operates in the healthcare segment. The accused were produced in court and sent to judicial custody, police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/these-online-frauds-rode-a-harley-kingpin-got-1-7l/mth-in-mum-job/articleshow/88842734.cms||Advitya Bahl

Moreover, the residential category has been kept out of the purview of the ordinance introduced in August 2020. About 1,200 allottees stand to benefit from this move in Noida of which 900 own residential plots.“The objective of the ordinance amended by the government on January 7 on the recommendation of the Noida Authority, was to promote and encourage industrial growth in the city,” said CEO Ritu Maheshwari. “Hence we asked the government to keep residential and other categories out of it. We are going to send final notice to the allottees before the deadline and warn them about cancellation.”The earlier order of the government had evoked sharp response from individuals holding residential plots, particularly the farmers who had been given land under the 5% abadi resettlement schemes. Officials said that more breather has been granted to the industrial and IT plot holders on account of the pandemic as several who were issued cancellation notice sought more time to arrange for funds. “The allottees have already made the payments and it does not look good to cancel their lease in a hurry. We want to give them sufficient time to complete work and get the unit up and running. The idea is to create employment and bring investments,” said an official.Soon after the ordinance was introduced in August 2020, the Authority had identified 3,766 vacant plots in the city. However, a majority of them were residential plots. Officials said less than 250 industrial or IT plots have been left vacant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/allottees-of-vacant-plots-to-get-time-till-december/articleshow/88842736.cms||---
---||Mumbai||As new Covid cases fall, experts say curve may be flattening in Mumbai||MUMBAI: As the city’s daily Covid tally tumbled for the fourth consecutive day on Tuesday, experts said the Covid-Omicron wave may already be “flattening”, barely three weeks after cases started rising exponentially. The state reported a marginal increase in its daily detections. The city’s Covid tally on Tuesday stood at 11,647 against 13,648 on Monday, 19,474 on Sunday and 20,318 on Saturday. Mumbai conducted 62,097 tests in 24 hours, which is lower than the tests conducted a few days ago. “The Omicron wave (in Mumbai) is flattening for sure,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. As experts expect different peaks in various cities and regions, the Covid tally in Maharashtra registered a 3% rise over a 24-hour period: cases climbed to 34,424 on Tuesday as against 33,470 a day earlier. The reason for cheer in Mumbai stems not only from a dropping daily count, but also a drop in the daily positivity rate.   BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal said, “Mumbai’s positivity is down from 30% to 20% in the last two days. Daily cases are down from 20,700 to 11,647 in the last four days.” State reports 22 deaths, its highest daily Covid-19 toll in the last 12 daysMunicipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has reiterated that there is “no need to panic”. He said 80% of Covid beds in Mumbai are vacant. “While 851 hospital beds were occupied today (Tuesday) in one day, 966 were vacated today,” Chahal said. “In the ongoing third wave, the city has registered 46 deaths in 22 days, which is an average of two deaths a day.” The state reported a surge in fatalities on Tuesday. With 22 deaths, the state has reported its highest Covid fatalities in 12 days. Read Also98 lakh in Maharashtra still haven’t got a single Covid jabHealth authorities have expressed concern over the fact that nearly 98 lakh citizens across Maharashtra are yet to take the first dose of the anti-Covid vaccine. They have directed the district administration to step up the drive and get the left-out population inoculated.The city’s test positivity rate was 18.75% on Tuesday as compared to 23% on Monday and 28% on Sunday. “The number of tests has not dropped drastically, but the positivity rate has. The overall trend thus is a flattening of the curve,” said Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. A senior BMC doctor said Mumbai has always registered the week’s highest tally on Wednesdays. “We should see tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) tally before stating that the decline has begun,” said the doctor. Officials said though Mumbai showed a declining trend, MMR cities like Thane and Navi Mumbai were reporting a surge in cases apart from cities like Pune and Nashik. Read AlsoCovid-19: Booster for elderly, vax for teens still to get shot in the arm in MumbaiThe tepid response to the new vaccination drives – one for the 15 to 18 age group and the other to give booster shots to healthcare and frontline workers and senior citizens – continued on Tuesday, with BMC tying up with an NGO to boost the paediatric drive.“Despite three weeks into the third wave, deaths in the state continue to be low. This could be due to the high vaccine coverage of cities like Mumbai and Pune. The effect of the variant could be fatal once it spreads to smaller districts with low vaccination,” said an official. The state cabinet is likely to meet on Wednesday and a review on the ongoing wave and restrictions will be held. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a virtual review meeting with the CMs of all states on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/as-new-cases-fall-experts-say-curve-may-be-flattening-in-city/articleshow/88842737.cms||Bhavika Jain

In the past six days alone, there has been an increase in reporting of hate and communal speeches over social media; 466 of the 1,121 cases were registered in the past six days. A total of 367 arrests have been made till date. Of the 1,121 cases, 1,055 are registered as cognizable offences and 66 as non-cognizable. Cyber police said cases have risen of late as local body elections are round the corner. In all, 367 accused were arrested and 1,049 were identified and notices were served under the Criminal Procedure Code’s Section 152 for prevention of injury to public property. “Preventive action as per CrPC Section 107 (security for keeping the peace) has been carried out against 145 of the arrested accused. ‘Takedown notices’ were issued to the concerned platforms. So far, 138 posts have been removed and action against the rest is in progress. The rise in hate speech cases in the past few days is due to the elections which are round the corner. These have activated all party members to make allegations and pass derogatory statements using social media platforms,” said a senior police officer. Since March 2020, cyber police across the state have registered cases against derogatory and obscene content posted on social media platforms. Among the total offensive posts, 409 cases are only from WhatsApp users, and due to the nature of technology and encryption the posts were deleted. Other posts that attracted penal code sections include 394 on Facebook, 26 on Twitter and 76 on Instagram, among others. State cyber police superintendent and spokesperson Sanjay Shintre said four teams—the monitoring desk, intelligence, a coordination committee and an awareness team—work round the clock to filter and identify fake posts and hate speeches on social media. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said such incidents are rising exponentially across the country. Former state DGP and former Mumbai police commissioner D Sivanandan said unless proper cases are registered and fast trials conducted, the number of cases registered are of little consequence.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/1k-fake-news-hate-post-cases-in-state-since-march-2020/articleshow/88847087.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Navi-mumbai||1,000 fake news, hate post cases in Maharashtra since March 2020||MUMBAI: Since the pandemic-related lockdown of March 2020, Maharashtra cyber police have registered 1,121 cases of fake news, rumours and hate speeches posted and shared on social media in the state. In the past six days alone, there has been an increase in reporting of hate and communal speeches over social media; 466 of the 1,121 cases were registered in the past six days. A total of 367 arrests have been made till date. Of the 1,121 cases, 1,055 are registered as cognizable offences and 66 as non-cognizable. Cyber police said cases have risen of late as local body elections are round the corner. In all, 367 accused were arrested and 1,049 were identified and notices were served under the Criminal Procedure Code’s Section 152 for prevention of injury to public property. “Preventive action as per CrPC Section 107 (security for keeping the peace) has been carried out against 145 of the arrested accused. ‘Takedown notices’ were issued to the concerned platforms. So far, 138 posts have been removed and action against the rest is in progress. The rise in hate speech cases in the past few days is due to the elections which are round the corner. These have activated all party members to make allegations and pass derogatory statements using social media platforms,” said a senior police officer. Since March 2020, cyber police across the state have registered cases against derogatory and obscene content posted on social media platforms. Among the total offensive posts, 409 cases are only from WhatsApp users, and due to the nature of technology and encryption the posts were deleted. Other posts that attracted penal code sections include 394 on Facebook, 26 on Twitter and 76 on Instagram, among others. State cyber police superintendent and spokesperson Sanjay Shintre said four teams—the monitoring desk, intelligence, a coordination committee and an awareness team—work round the clock to filter and identify fake posts and hate speeches on social media. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said such incidents are rising exponentially across the country.

Anwari Shaikh, the complainant, who looked after the child while her parents were away for work, lodged an FIR. She told police that most of the time the child would be with one Ibrahim Shaikh, 32. Shaikh was staying as a live-in partner of the baby's mother. Zonal DCP Dr Saurabh Tripathi said that after they got the complaint, several police teams were formed. “We collected information and nabbed six persons including Shaikh and a woman in Mumbai,” said Tripathi Police had carried out search operations at Sion, Dharavi, Jogeshwari, Nagpada, Malad and Thane. After police got a clue of ‘child selling’ angle, the accused were subjected to sustained questioning during which they admitted to having sold the child. Two teams led by sub inspectors Dilip Tambe and Abhijit Deshmukh left for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to trace the child. The team searched for the baby in three different districts in Tamil Nadu. “Our teams reached Coimbatore and finally traced the baby to an engineer couple’s house. The child was rescued and five more persons were arrested,” said Tripathi. Shaikh has claimed to be the father of the baby, said police. The police have also begun the process for a DNA test. “Most of the accused played a role in selling the baby for money. It looks like a racket.

---||Mumbai||SEBC quota: Maharashtra govt starts fee refund of private medical students||MUMBAI: Two years after their admissions to medical colleges, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday started refunding the difference in the sum between the fees of a government college and a private institute’s tuition to students. Amravati’s Priyal Saraf knew she wanted to be a doctor, but her dream came with a clear condition: She wanted to join a government college so when she graduates, she does not need to worry about the money spent on studying. However, while she put in enough efforts that would entitle her to her dreams, Saraf says she was “shortchanged by the sudden change in the admission rule” in 2019 by the Maharashtra government. The state decided to implement 16% reservation for the socially and economically backward classes (SEBC). Many like Saraf who knew they would clinch a seat in a government or aided college were missing a spot by a few marks. On the other hand, Maratha candidates with lower scores benefited by the quota. “I want to be a doctor to serve the community. I am glad that the government realised that many of us had the requisite scores to get into a government college and decided to compensate us for the fees we were paying in a private college,” said Saraf, a student of Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Medical College. “Close to 60 students have received the refund for the first year’s fee since this morning,” said Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative who has been helping students get justice. “Candidates are liable to pay second and third year fees. But they are protected by a court ruling which does not permit private colleges to force them to shell out the tuition,” added Shenoy. “We met the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and he had agreed a total of 259 students were affected by the state’s decision to implement the quota. However, the state later released a list of 106 students and agreed to refund the additional fees minus those paid by students to private colleges that are charged by government colleges,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent representative. For Saraf, now in her third year, Tuesday brought delight. “The money came after three years.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sebc-quota-state-starts-fee-refund-of-pvt-med-students/articleshow/88842742.cms||Hemali Chhapia

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stolen gold worth over Rs 8 crore restored to family after 22 years||MUMBAI: After a 22-year wait, the owners of Charagh Din, an established name in the fashion community, received stolen property worth over Rs 8 crore following a court order. Sessions judge U J More on January 5 passed an order to hand over the property, comprising one gold coin containing Queen Victoria’s picture, two gold bracelets, and two ingots weighing 1,300 gram and 200 milligram (collectively worth Rs 13 lakh then and now over Rs 8 crore) to Raju Daswani, the son of Charagh Din founder Arjan Daswani. Public prosecutor Iqbal Solkar as well as inspector Sanjay Donnar of Colaba police stated they had no objection to return the property, subject to certain conditions. Raju Daswani submitted various bills and receipts, which confirmed that the booty belonged to his family. “No purpose will suffice by keeping the articles, especially gold articles, in custody of the police. More than 19 years have passed. The judgment of acquittal in this case (was) by the learned session court. No progress (made) in the arrest of two absconding accused. If a complainant asked to wait for years and years together for the return of his own property, it would be a mockery of justice and abuse of the process of law,” the order said. A precedent was cited too. “Considering the ratio laid down in Sunderbai Ambala Desai's case, the applicant is entitled for return of all the properties claimed in the application,” the order said. On May 8, 1998, a gang armed with knives barged into the house of Arjan Daswani, who resided on the fourth floor of Joy Eden building at Merryweather Road, Colaba. The gang assaulted the security guard, forcibly took the keys of the safe, tied up Daswani and his wife and fled with the booty. Police arrested three of the accused who were booked for robbery, wrongful confinement and under the Bombay Police Act. Police in 1998 recovered part of the booty. After the committal of the case to the sessions court in 1999, a trial was conducted and the three were acquitted. Three more accused are still absconding. Arjan Daswani died in 2007. The court has set a condition that the articles are produced as and when directed by the court. The articles cannot be sold and default would result in forfeit of Rs 1 lakh. The court also directed the police to take pictures and prepare a detailed handing-over panchnama. Raju Daswani's lawyer, Sunil Pandey, said, “It’s a major relief to the family as there is a lot of emotional attachment to the ornaments, which are from their ancestors.” Police said Raju's two sisters (living in Canada and the US), who were also legal heirs of the property, had given no-objection certificates if the gold was given to him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/stolen-gold-worth-over-8-cr-restored-to-family-after-22-yrs/articleshow/88842746.cms||Ahmed Ali

Satheesh of Panayara under Ayiroor police station limits is accused of murdering his father Sathyan, 55. According to the police, the alleged crime took place on Sunday night at their residence. Both men reportedly consumed booze together and broke into a quarrel, which soon grew into a brawl. Though the family took Sathyan to Government Taluk Hospital at Varkala, he soon succumbed to injuries. The police have registered the case as an unnatural death and launched a probe. They also took Satheesh into custody after learning about the brawl. On Tuesday, the police received the opinion of the surgeon who performed the post mortem examination that Sathyan was murdered. There was a major injury on the head and ligature marks around the neck suggesting the possibility of strangulation. The doctor opined that the death could have happened owing to strangulation. Based on this information, the police recorded the arrest of Satheesh by Tuesday evening. Both Sathyan and Satheesh were masons by profession. They often used to consume liquor together at home and quarreled with each other. Sathyan is survived by wife Sobhana. Besides Satheesh, he has two other children, Sarath and Sajini, the police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-fathers-murder/articleshow/88841181.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Land development on 4 lakh sqm of agricultural and orchard land raises eyebrows in Quepem||QUEPEM: Over four lakh square metres of contiguous agricultural and orchard land and a hillock that lie within Quepem municipal limits are in the process of being cleared for real estate with some “illegal” structures having already come up here. Councillors of the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) have cried foul and demanded an inquiry into “the sale of plots in the no-development zone (NDZ)”. A Delhi-based developer allegedly made about 500 plots on the land parcel between Igramoll and Gaonkarwada and sold them. The land stretch comes under various survey numbers and more than 150 mutation entries have been made in the property survey numbers. Under Section 49(6) of the Goa Daman and Diu Town and Country Planning Act, which came into effect from March 2018, an NOC is needed from the town and country planning department to register sale deeds. However, on being questioned, an official from the TCP department at Quepem said they are not authorised to issue NOCs for such non-settlement land. Details furnished by the Quepem civil registration office to an RTI revealed a different story. NOCs had been issued by then deputy town planner Manguirish N Verenkar. With the Quepem TCP office failing to respond to an RTI even 15 months later, information on other aspects continues to remain obscure. Meanwhile, even as controversy has erupted over the legality of the sale deeds, some have already carried out hill cutting on their respective plots and even constructed houses. Any construction activity requires permissions from the respective civic body and in this case the QMC has not received any applications for constructions. QMC engineer, Nitin Khotarkar told TOI that he had issued showcause notices to three persons on March 12 for undertaking illegal construction in the land, which comes under the no-development zone. Khotarkar added that the developer had constructed the road without council’s permission. “Hill cutting is being carried out openly, but the authorities have failed to take action against the developers. This is a blatant act of violation of environmental laws and massive destruction of our ecology and natural resources,” local activist Hilario Fernandes said. Former chairperson and QMC councillor Filu D’Costa had raised the issue during a recent council and demanded that a five-member committee be constituted to investigate the “illegal sale of plots”. QMC councillors alleged that developers are working hand in glove with the authorities and politicians in changing land use for settlement purposes. They criticised the development in the eco-sensitive area saying that the authorities have ignored the disastrous consequences of the act. Earlier, about 2.95 lakh sqm out of the over 4 lakh sqm of the same parcel of non-settlement land had been proposed for construction of 1,856 flats under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Then member secretary of Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA), Tariq Thomas on May, 17, 2019, had sent a proposal to the QMC requesting it to furnish comments for the project. The QMC in its council meeting held on June 18, 2019, had rejected the project after stiff opposition from locals and a group of councillors. Referring to this, Fernandes questioned the present sale of plots on the land by the Delhi-based developer and the subsequent hill-cutting and development there. “How was the builder allowed to sell plots when QMC rejected it? The land is a hill and a natural water source,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/land-development-on-4l-sqm-of-agricultural-and-orchard-land-raises-eyebrows-in-quepem/articleshow/88841700.cms||Johnny M

Somaiya also said mayor Kishori Pednekar cornered the contract for the Worli Dome Covid centre.Addressing a press conference at the BJP state HQ on Tuesday, Somaiya alleged Jadhav had diverted Rs 15 crore through shell companies from the BMC to the various accounts of his family. He said a shell company named Pradhan Dealers was used for the transfer by showing purchase of shares of the company for Rs 500 each. He said Rs 2 crore was transferred to the account of Jadhav’s wife, Yamini, who is the Shiv Sena MLA from Byculla, and Rs 50 lakh each to the accounts of his son.He said Jadhav transferred Rs 3 crore to the Shauru Trading Company account, Rs 2 crore to the Cressida Traders account and Rs 5 crore to Sunanda Mohite’s account.Somaiya demanded an audit of all Covid centres in the city. He alleged mayor Kishori Pednekar’s firm was allotted the contract for running the Worli Dome Covid centre without inviting tenders. The work was awarded by minister Aditya Thackeray, he alleged. He said the BMC was a source of income for the Shiv Sena and it must be removed from the civic body.While Jadhav was not immediately available for comment, Pednekar said Somaiya was in the habit of making allegations. “If he has evidence he must give it. He is the ‘ganjadia of tamasha’,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mayor-civic-panel-chief-made-crores-from-covid/articleshow/88842751.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Relief for assn of buyers in Kurla housing project||Mumbai: In a relief to an association formed by home buyers of flats to be built by Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) in a project called ‘Whispering Heights’ and other buildings at Kurla, the NCLAT set aside a NCLT order of September 2021 and granted 90 days extension to a resolution profession in a 'corporate insolvency resolution process' (CIRP) of HDIL to enable the resolution professional (RP) and committee of creditors (CoC) to complete ‘project wise resolution’. The CIRP was initiated against HDIL after Bank of India invoked the insolvency and bankruptcy code against the developer in 2019. The RP is a person, usually a chartered accountant, appointed primarily to ensure revival of the corporate debtor. The process has to be completed in 330 days. The flat buyers associations requested the Resolution Professional to undertake a project-wise plan which the CoC approved on September 8, 2021 with the aim to divide HDIL assets into eight projects. The RP had thus moved the NCLT for time, which was declined as over 730 days later the CIRP was far from completion. The NCLAT said reasonable time should be given to ensure projects get completed as 1,500 flats were proposed to be built at Whispering Heights project in Kurla and the SC has said it is in the interest of all stakeholders for a corporate debtor to be back on its foot instead of being sent into liquidation. The Whispering Tower Flat Owner Welfare Association and a similar association for Majestic Towers in Bandra which has 290 home buyers and Galaxy Apartment at Kurla as well as Sarang Wadhawan, ex-promoter of the real estate company HDIL—presently in judicial custody—had moved National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against a September 29, 2021 order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench which rejected the extension plea filed by Resolution Professional of HDIL, Abhay Manudhane, saying the CoC had passed the resolution due to pressure from home buyers. Advocates Soumya Sanyal for Whispering Tower, Sunil Fernandes for Majestic Towers and Disha Shah for Wadhawan essentially sought an appeal of the NCLT order that closed the resolution process and ordered housing projects and other assets of HDILbe liquidated - in which case thousands of home buyers, many “from lower middle classs” get nothing - no flat or refund. All proceeds of Liquidation were to flow to Banks and Financial Institutions, was their contention. For Bank of India, its counsel Nishith Dhruva opposed the appeal on the grounds that a piecemeal process would only delay the ultimate liquidation and will not serve any purpose or better the cause of buyers. Shahdab Jan counsel for the RP said 70 days would be requires to set the plan in motion. The NCLAT bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan in its judgment said it is clear that CIRP period after extensions was over on September 30, 2021. It also said, “Adjudicating Authority lost sight that after extension given from time to time the period expired only in the month of September 2021. This Project Wise Resolution became possible only after 8th September, 2021. The CoC, whose commercial wisdom has to be given due weight, rightly took the decision for Project Wise Resolution.’’ The NCLT “ ought to have ought to have given reasonable extension to proceed further’’ with Project Wise resolution for which 25 expresses of interest have already been received with the RP. After the Tuesday order, advocate Ameet Mehta and Manish Sukhani for Majestic and Galaxy Tower home buyers said the NCLAT “judgment would go a long way in benefitting purchasors” against builders facing insolvency proceedings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/relief-for-assn-of-buyers-in-kurla-housing-project/articleshow/88842752.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||ED takes hold of MLA Gutte’s mill, plots||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) took possession of the Gangakhed sugar mill along with several land parcels spread over about 40 hectares, including a poultry farm, in Parbhani and Beed districts last Thursday. The ED is investigating a money laundering case against MLA Ratnakar Gutte of the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP). It is alleged that Gutte had taken bank loans through a company controlled by him and had defaulted on the payments. The MLA allegedly used the money to purchase assets. The ED had provisionally attached his assets in December 2020 and recently the adjudication authority had confirmed the attachment, after which the ED officials visited the Parbhani and Beed districts in Marathwada to take possession of the lands and factories. The ED initiated a money laundering investigation against Gutte, a sugar baron, in 2019 after raiding 10 premises in various places, including an educational institution in Bandra (W). The ED said Gutte, chairman of the Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Pvt Ltd (GSEPL), fraudulently took Rs 635 crore ‘crop loans’ in the name of around 10,000 farmers, some of them even dead, between 2012 and 2017 after forging their documents. The bank financed the loans in the name of the farmers for purchasing equipment for their crops, seeds and fertilisers. The GSEPL stood guarantor.

Only buildings in the suburbs are levied this tax and it is not applicable to the housing societies in the island city,” he said.Advocate Godfrey Pimenta, convenor, Watchdog Foundation, said the amount demanded in several cases are absurdly high and has led to panic among residents. “A few years ago when the demand was raised to abolish the tax for housing societies in Mumbai, political leaders had promised to amend the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code but nothing has been done till date,” he said.Shelar said the Devendra Fadnavis government had stayed the notices issued for payments due since 2008 but now the MVA government has once again issued the notices, he said adding Thorat had assured he would discuss the issue with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and take a decision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/defer-non-agri-tax-collectionfrom-housing-societies-bjp/articleshow/88842755.cms||---

Party supremo Sharad Pawar said, “We are contesting five seats in Manipur. In Uttar Pradesh, we will join hands with Samajwadi Party and smaller parties; we are meeting in Lucknow on Thursday to work out the final seat-sharing formula. In Goa, we have proposed an alliance with Congress and Trinamool Congress. We are sure the ruling BJP will be dislodged in Uttar Pradesh and Goa.” He said that in the run-up to the elections, he and senior NCP leaders will campaign extensively in Uttar Pradesh for defeating the saffron party. “I will be campaigning in UP. In addition, senior NCP leaders will campaign in Manipur and Goa,” Pawar said. Former legislator Seeraj Mehandi, a senior Congress leader in Uttar Pradesh, joined the NCP in the presence of the NCP supremo. Pawar’s decision to contest the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Goa assumes significant political importance. The decision was essential to retain national party status for the NCP. On the current political situation in Uttar Pradesh, Pawar said people of the state are looking for a change. “The decision of senior BJP leader and cabinet member Swami Prasad Maurya to quit the cabinet is the beginning of the downfall of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. Maurya is not alone; more than a dozen BJP legislators will follow him before the state assembly polls. Maurya himself has disclosed it,” Pawar said. He pointed out that the people of Uttar Pradesh have been hurt by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement that 80% of the population is with him and the remaining 20% against him. “A CM belongs to all. The UP CM’s statement has hurt the sentiments of the members of the minority community. Such a statement is not expected from the CM of Uttar Pradesh. This is encouraging communal and divisive forces. People’s sentiments will be reflected in the ensuing assembly elections,” Pawar said. On Goa, he said it was high time to dislodge the BJP-led government. “We are negotiating with the Congress and Shiv Sena to work out a joint action plan for defeating the BJP. The people of Goa have now understood that there is no scope for development under BJP rule,” he said. On the PM’s security breach, Pawar said PM is an institution and it will be wrong to discuss the PM’s security in public. “The Supreme Court is seized of the matter. It has set up a high-level committee to probe into all aspects of the PM’s security. We should wait for the outcome of the report,” Pawar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/manipur/news/ncp-to-contest-polls-in-up-goa-and-manipur-pawar/articleshow/88846249.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

Civic authorities said maintenance of all fountains and statues in south Mumbai has been proposed to be taken up, and Flora Fountain maintenance is also a part of it. Sanjay Sawant, executive engineer from the BMC’s heritage cell department, said maintenance works of Flora Fountain should be completed by the month-end. “After its inauguration in January 2019, the fountain has not been shut for prolonged maintenance. The BMC has appointed a private agency that has been entrusted with maintaining the Flora Fountain and other heritage structures as well,” he said. The iconic Flora Fountain situated in Fort business district was reopened after restoration on January 24, 2019. Restoration works of the fountain had begun in September 2016, which included beautification of the area around the statute. Activists, however, questioned the need for closing it down for a prolonged period, especially when weekly maintenance is regularly being taken up. Activist Zoru Bhathena, wondered why the fountain needed to shut down completely barely three years after it was completely restored. The fountain depicting Roman goddess Flora was designed by British architect Richard Norman Shaw and built in 1864.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/3-yrs-after-restoration-flora-fountain-goes-under-wraps-for-maintenance/articleshow/88842759.cms||Richa Pinto

The HC also held that anticipatory bail can be sought and is maintainable for offences under the special Act—Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. The reasoned order of the pre-arrest bail granted on September 27 was made available this week. The bail was granted on a PR bond of Rs 25,000 after hearing his advocate Ali Kaashif Khan who said the FIR was “concocted” and advocate Adnan Shaikh for the intervenor, his wife since 2015, who said she was “continuously harassed”. Additional public prosecutor R M Pethe opposed his plea saying there is proof of his pronouncing triple talaq, which is illegal and her jewellery has been misappropriated by him. The man said he anticipated arrest in connection with an FIR of June 16, 2021. .The wife alleged she was she was “advised to go to her parents and later asked to return with the money and via a text message her husband said he was pronouncing triple talaq. A sessions court in July rejected his pre-arrest bail but gave xit to her in-laws. Advocate Shaikh submitted that the offence is serious and pre-arrest bail plea is not maintainable. There is no specific prohibition under the law to seek pre-arrest bail said his advocate, Khan. Justice Naik said, “Clause (c) of Section 7 stipulates that married women upon whom talaq is pronounced have to be heard and court has to be satisfied there are reasonable grounds to grant bail to such person.’’||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/triple-talaq-case-accused-granted-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/88842760.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Cyber harassment cases see upswing in pandemic||MUMBAI: The pandemic seems to have resulted in a surge in cyber harassment cases. Over 900 complaints were made to an anti-cyberbullying platform from 257 Indian cities last year. A report by the platform, Cyber Bullying Action Awareness Prevention (CBAAP), says most complaints pertain to trolling, followed by sextortion. “Not everyone is comfortable going to the police directly, particularly in cyberbullying cases. Instead, they look for help and not finding any could push them into depression. We founded the CBAAP platform to reach out to such individuals, offer counselling and assist them in lodging an FIR, if needed,” said psychologist Nirali Bhatia, its co-founder. Among the top three cities that cyberbullying complaints were received by CBAAP were New Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. College and school students formed a huge chunk (60%) of complainants. “Kids and young adults are very sensitive to opinions people have of them... This makes them vulnerable to cyberbullying,” said psychiatrist Dr Payal Sharma Kamath. Some complainants who approached CBAAP were suicidal. “It’s not easy to get an FIR lodged in emotional harassment case,” Bhatia said, adding that she often has to counsel families of complainants too since their support is very vital. “There have been instances, particularly of revenge pornography or image abuse, where I have to make the families understand how a victim has been targeted,” she said. “Fear of parents’ inability to understand or the feeling that parents will make the situation worse are major concerns we see among young victims of cyberbullying,” added Dr Sharma Kamath. CBAAP got more complaints from men (54%) than women in 2021. Most were from Uttar Pradesh, next Maharashtra. Bhatia cited a case where a newly married man was cyber-harassed via a fake profile. “His wife and sister’s photos were morphed over obscene content and circulated to his relatives through the fake ID. The display picture was of the man and his ex-girlfriend to convince his relatives he had created the obscene content, although he was the victim,” said Bhatia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cyber-harassment-cases-see-upswing-in-pandemic/articleshow/88842765.cms||---

He added Mangeshkar, who is 92 years old, is in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). “It’s a mild case of Covid-19, but we thought of removing Didi (as Mangeshkar is addressed by her family, friends and legions of fans) to the ICU in view of her advanced age. She is recovering,” said Rachana Shah, writer and Mangeshkar’s niece. “A team of best doctors is looking after her. Didi's countless admirers and friends are praying for her health and their prayers will surely be answered,” Shah added. Mangeshkar is on oxygen support and could remain in hospital for a few more days. Sources said she doesn’t need invasive ventilator support at the moment. A senior official from the D Ward, where Mangeshkar resides, said she was at the hospital for another medical condition three days ago and tested positive for Covid-19 while on treatment. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said she has been informed that Mangeshkar's condition is stable. “If required, I will also visit the hospital and inquire about her health with the doctors as I may not be able to meet her in person,” said Pednekar. Mangeshkar, who was honoured with Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian award in 2001, was admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in 2019 after complaining of breathing problems which doctors said was due to a viral infection. Mangeshkar is held in high esteem not only for her mellifluous songs, but also for her ability to fuse India into a pulsating, cultural whole, say observers. Close friends, musicians and filmland personalities have been calling up Prabhu Kunj, the legendary singer's Pedder Road residence, to inquire after her health. Admirers tweeted all through Tuesday for her speedy recovery. A torrent of tweets that kept pouring in all through the day reiterated Mangeshkar's popularity across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inquired after her health. In a tweet, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said she prayed for Mangeshkar’s speedy recovery. Actor Abhishek Bachchan echoed identical sentiments. “Prayers for Lata-ji’s speedy recovery,” said sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. Union minister Prakash Javdekar said, “Get well soon, Lata Mangeshkar-ji. Whole country is praying for your good health.” Bahujan Vikas Aghadi legislator Kshitij Thakur said, “I join millions in wishing a speedy recovery to legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar-ji.

He said 80% of Covid beds in Mumbai are vacant. “While 851 hospital beds were occupied today (Tuesday) in one day, 966 were vacated today,” Chahal said. “In the ongoing third wave, the city has registered 46 deaths in 22 days, which is an average of two deaths a day.” The state reported a surge in fatalities on Tuesday. With 22 deaths, the state has reported its highest Covid fatalities in 12 days. The city’s test positivity rate was 18.75% on Tuesday as compared to 23% on Monday and 28% on Sunday. “The number of tests has not dropped drastically, but the positivity rate has. The overall trend thus is a flattening of the curve,” said Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. A senior BMC doctor said Mumbai has always registered the week’s highest tally on Wednesdays. “We should see tomorrow’s (Wednesday’s) tally before stating that the decline has begun,” said the doctor.Officials said though Mumbai showed a declining trend, MMR cities like Thane and Navi Mumbai were reporting a surge in cases apart from cities like Pune and Nashik. “Despite three weeks into the third wave, deaths in the state continue to be low. This could be due to the high vaccine coverage of cities like Mumbai and Pune. The effect of the variant could be fatal once it spreads to smaller districts with low vaccination,” said an official. The state cabinet is likely to meet on Wednesday and a review on the ongoing wave and restrictions will be held. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a virtual review meeting with the CMs of all states on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-reports-22-deaths-its-highest-daily-covid-19-toll-in-the-last-12-days/articleshow/88842769.cms||Bhavika Jain

The corresponding number during the Delta wave in April 2021 was 6.2 lakh. The number of people in home quarantine was around 30,000 when the Omicron wave began rising around December 21, but has climbed almost 25 times in the last three weeks.  Civic experts said the reason for the high home quarantine numbers could be the highly infectious nature of the Omicron variant of the Covid virus. “Entire families are getting infected in a matter of days as against one or two members during the previous waves,” said an official.  E ward’s assistant municipal commissioner, Manish Walunju, said that as entire families are getting infected, not many opt for institutional or paid quarantine facilities. "If the entire family is positive, people prefer to isolate themselves in their own homes. This is both comfortable and economical,” he said. Moreover, most patients recover by the fourth or fifth day. G North ward’s assistant municipal commissioner, Kiran Dighavkar, pointed out home quarantine is not an option if people share a common toilet. “In the case of Dharavi where too positive case numbers have shot up over the past few days, we have civic quarantine facilities such as a community hall,” he said. Civic public health department officials said that the number of people in quarantine as well as the number of sealed buildings and containment zones could change drastically due to the updated parameters released by the Centre on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/omicron-wave-sets-home-quarantine-record-at-7-2l/articleshow/88842770.cms||Richa Pinto

But, even for them this place is without sun or fresh air and houses patients with mild and severe symptoms together. It has dogs running around and pooping in corridors. Its public toilets are filthy with malfunction and squalor,” he said in his post, seeking attention and help. “I was given no option to stay in home quarantine, nor pay for a better facility, nor avail on-campus isolation in a guest room offered by my employer –IIT) Bombay. All this because I returned from US travel to see an ailing relative on Dec 27 but developed a fever from Covid and volunteered to get tested on Jan 7,” he added.

On Tuesday, response to the booster dose rollout was a shade better, with 61,550 in the state, including 15,127 in Mumbai, turning up for the extra jab on Tuesday. On the first day, on Monday, 49,307 took the shot in the state. "People, including senior citizens, are coming for the booster rounds. We expect turnout to improve soon,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. However, a senior doctor in BMC-run KEM Hospital said the 9-month wait between second shot and the booster for senior citizens has proved to be a dampener. Meanwhile, BMC has roped in an NGO, Project Mumbai, to boost response to the other vaccination drive for those between 15 and 18. “We will start vaccination of 15-year-olds directly in schools and colleges. This was finalised with BMC on Tuesday,'' said Shishir Joshi of Project Mumbai. School heads will first have to write to BMC and Project Mumbai on the email address: collegevaccination@gmail.com. “Project Mumbai has been helping in door-to-door vaccination for elderly... We’re hoping beginning now, every eligible teenager is given a vaccination shot at his college doorstep,”' Joshi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/booster-for-elderly-vax-for-teens-still-to-get-shot-in-the-arm/articleshow/88842774.cms||---

By close of trade, it had gained 13 paise to end at 73.91 against the US dollar. The last time the rupee had closed around this level was at 73.84 on September 27 last year.The domestic currency continued to be supported by inflows in the capital markets. “Rupee has risen above 74 with an opening around 73.95 and flows continue to take it higher as importers are absent from the market, as is the RBI. The US Fed may be in for rate hike, but that has overall not affected the dollar-rupee exchange rate,” said Finrex Treasury Advisors head (treasury) Anil Kumar Bhansali.Even as the dollar is expected to gain strength globally following anticipated rate hikes by the US Fed, the outlook for the rupee is positive. This is partly because of the strong reserve position. India’s forex reserves stood at $633.6 billion in the week ended December 31 — a $1.4-billion decline from the preceding week.According to a report by Barclays, the RBI is seen to be moving towards a policy of capital account convertibility. “The key objective behind this push towards further liberalisation of the capital account remains to fund India’s investment savings gap,” Barclays said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hits-3-month-high-of-73-91/articleshow/88842775.cms||---

The day’s 10,800 new infections came on the back of the daily test positivity rate touching 15.7% on Monday.

They will be easy to use and durable. The innovative technology has been introduced, designed and implemented for the first time in India by the National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation (NATMO), which functions as an attached office to the department of science and technology (DST).According to DST, digital embossing eliminates the need for printing plates, moulds, chemicals and solvents, emitting no pollutants or waste and reducing overall energy usage. The technology is not only useful for high-speed production but can also produce Braille maps that can be used for years. “... Maps produced using earlier technology lost their readability and feeling experience within a short span of time. Feedback from experts and students from the Braille community encouraged us to prepare this low-cost product,” DST said.

---||Business||Digital tech is a powerful deflationary force: Nadella||BENGALURU: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that digital technology is a powerful deflationary force in an inflationary economy because of the enormous increases in productivity it brings. “Fundamentally, we're moving from a mobile and cloud era to an era of ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence, an era that will experience more digitisation over the next 10 years than the last 40,” he said at Microsoft's leadership forum Future Ready held on Tuesday. Nadella said a digital business requires the firm to have the best multi-cloud multi-edge infrastructure. “Going forward, every organisation will need a more distributed, more intelligent, more autonomous computing fabric, one that they can use to rapidly build, manage, and deploy applications anywhere. And they will need new tools that bring together both professional developers and domain experts,” he said. Computing, he said, is becoming distributed and embedded in the real world. “The percentage of industrial control systems that will include analytics and AI inference capabilities at the edge will increase by six-fold in the next four years,” he said. Nadella spoke about the metaverse and how Microsoft is describing it both in terms of a new platform and a new application type, similar to how it talked about the Web and websites in the early 1990s. "Across the Microsoft Cloud, from Azure IoT to Azure Digital Twins to Connected Spaces and Microsoft Mesh, we're building the metaverse intrinsic, the metaverse platform for you to build upon. In a sense, the metaverse enables us to embed computing into the real world and to embed the real world into computing, bringing real presence to any digital space," he said. Nadella also shared his thoughts on the new world of hybrid work. “We are seeing a change in how we work when we work and where our work gets done. More and more people are also asking that very fundamental question, why we work. This leads to two challenges that what we call the hybrid paradox and the great reshuffle. 70% of the employees want more flexible remote work options, and about the same number also say that they want more in-person connections. 58% of the people who expect to spend most and the least time in the office tell us they plan to do so for the very same reason, more focused work," he said. Microsoft India president Anant Maheshwari said a digitally native customer is a trendline that will reshape all industries. "It is estimated that India's consumer digital economy which was pegged at a sizable $85-90 billion in the calendar year 2020, is now expected to become 10 times more to become an $800 billion market by 2030," he said. Maheshwari said India's unique strength is its large developer population. “Every company is digital and that is powered by software that is created by this ecosystem…Rapidly adding to it now is the low-code / no-code platforms that are democratising digital asset creation. With the power of India's large young population that is natively connected and mobile, India can scale the creation of digital assets without necessarily knowing how to code software,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/digital-tech-is-a-powerful-deflationary-force-nadella/articleshow/88842791.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Supply chain woes: French IT co Atos issues profit warning||Bengaluru: Atos has issued a profit warning following a reassessment of the cost of a financial services BPO contract and project slippages due to supply chain challenges. It caused the company's share price to slump.Rodolphe Belmer, CEO of the French IT services company, said, “I joined the company last week, at the time when the figures were being collected and consolidated. The current state of financial insight leads us to the obligation to issue a profit warning today due to the significant variance in the financial KPIs (key performance indicators). However, most of the items underlying this severe gap are non-recurring. In particular, the large gap in free cash flow mostly stems from working capital.” Belmer said he was convinced that the firm has the necessary assets and all the talents to operate a swift turnaround. "In this context, I will present at the end of February a new organisation to the board of directors, and in Q2 a plan that will demonstrate the drivers of this turnaround and the focus on profitable growth and value creation,” he said. Atos recorded ₹10.8 billion in revenue last year, a decrease of 2.4% at constant currency. It said the unexpected reassessment of the cost to go on transformation, re-platforming, and operations of a financial services BPO contract, signed in 2018 for 15 years with a large UK financial institution, led to a major revision of the completion rate on the project, at the end of December last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/supply-chain-woes-french-it-co-atos-issues-profit-warning/articleshow/88842793.cms||---

Preliminary investigation revealed that the driver’s attempt to overtake the cars ahead of him was the main reason for the accident. The truck driver took an extreme right turn, which led to the right-side wheels hitting the median. He lost control of the gravel-laden vehicle and it fell to its left on two cars and a motorcycle. The gravel too came down in a torrent on them. Police said the truck belongs to a businessman in Bidadi and the driver has been identified based on the information provided by the vehicle owner.Four victims from one familyFour of the dead — Veenamma, 44, Keerti Kumar, 40, Indra Kumar, 14, and Nikhitha Rani aka Neetu, 29, — were in one vehicle and belonged to one family. At the time of accident, they were returning home after visiting Muthathi. There were two more persons in that car and they sustained injuries. The two — Rani’s husband Gajendra, 36, and son Siddarth, 9 — are out of danger. TJ Shivaprakash, 42, the lone occupant of the other car, also died on the spot. He was manager at an automobile firm and was returning to his Ittamadu home in south Bengaluru when the accident occurred. The biker, Jatin B George, 40, an engineer with a private firm, was returning to his Kengeri residence.

Let the DK brothers prove their “manhood” by developing the district they represent,” he said.  Suresh said BJP can prove its “manhood” in Delhi by bringing the project. “Let them prove their manliness in Delhi and get the project cleared.

However, opposition leader Siddaramaiah, who rejoined the march on Tuesday after recovering from fever, asserted that they will go ahead with the event as planned and conclude it in Bengaluru after a public rally. He alleged that the BJP is trying to disrupt the padayatra. “They don’t want this march to be successful; they don’t want people to be aware. They feel this will cause political gain for Congress and hence, they are trying to thwart it...it is a frustrated attempt by the BJP government,” he said, accusing the ruling party of favouring Tamil Nadu, with an intention to increase the party base in that state. “We intend to host the public event by following Covid norms. If the government does not allow us, then there is nothing we can do. It will expose the BJP’s intentions of not supporting the Mekedatu project,” said Congress working president (in charge of Bengaluru) R Ramalinga Reddy. Jnanedra earlier defended the government’s decision to allow the Congress to organise the event by stating that they wanted to be “considerate” to the opposition functionaries in this regard. “We also made an appeal to the Congress to drop the padayatra in the interest of the public and then we gave them three days to reconsider the plan, but it appears to be in vain,” he added. He also accused the Congress of playing politics with the issue to boost the party’s image ahead of the 2023 polls by putting lives of people at risk.. “But this padayatra will be more detrimental to the Congress than useful,” he said. As part of their 11-day padayatra demanding implementation of the Mekedatu project, the opposition party members covered a distance of 14.5km from Kanakapura to Chikkenahalli on Tuesday. Curbs on rallies: Late in the evening, the government issued additional containment measures which specifically mention that “all rallies…” are prohibited.

---||Bengaluru||Covid surge, UP polls cast shadow on cabinet reshuffle in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Ministerial aspirants in the BJP may have to wait for some more time as the party leadership has decided to put off the cabinet reshuffle in view of the spike in Covid cases and assembly elections announced in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. It was said that the BJP high command had given a go-ahead to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to rejig his cabinet and he would effect a reshuffle after the three-day Chintan Baithak, that was scheduled to begin on January 7. While the party brass was to evaluate the performance of ministers at the Baithak, Bommai was expected to replace some senior ministers with new faces after Sankranti on January 14. However, the high command decided to postpone the Baithak indefinitely owing to the third wave of Covid-19 that prompted the state government to clamp curbs, including weekend curfew. Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India announced assembly polls in UP and four other states, and the BJP leadership reportedly decided to put the cabinet reshuffle in Karnataka on hold till March 10 when the election gets over. “BJP has postponed all political activities because of Covid and it applies to the cabinet reshuffle too. The high command and chief minister will discuss this and take a call after the assembly elections,” said BJP state general secretary N Ravikumar. BJP sources said the ruling party is also preparing for the BBMP elections expected in April even as the state government has decided to file an affidavit before the Supreme Court seeking directions for conducting the civic polls at the earliest. The apex court has posted a petition seeking BBMP polls for disposal and the verdict is expected shortly. “The high command is unlikely to give permission for cabinet expansion or reshuffle till the BBMP polls and ZP-TP elections are over in April-May as it may affect the prospects of the party in these elections,” said a BJP functionary. This has left many in the party frustrated as the decision to postpone cabinet reshuffle would also delay the allocation of districts to ministers. Some ministers are learnt to have voiced their concerns in the cabinet meeting that they could not even conduct meetings of officials in districts since they have no authority to call such meetings although they have been allocated districts to supervise Covid management. This is leading to friction, especially in districts like Bengaluru Urban and Ramanagara where the financial and political stakes are high. “Ministers have been made in-charge of Covid and works being done under AMRUT scheme. We are doing our best within the limited scope,” said CN Ashwath Narayan, who is in-charge of Ramanagara.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/covid-surge-up-polls-cast-shadow-on-cabinet-reshuffle/articleshow/88842800.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

On July 29 last year, the court had directed the civic body to file its statement of objections stating the outer time limit within which construction would be finished. The bench said the statement of objections wasn’t filed and the BBMP counsel wasn’t in a position to give a time frame. The BBMP counsel submitted that issues pertaining to cutting of trees and penalty imposed upon the contractor had slowed down the project. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said the court isn’t prepared to hear about excuses, but wants results in the first place. “If there were so many problems for completion, it should not have been started and so much public money should not have been invested. There is no excuse for not completing the flyover. We direct the second respondent (BBMP chief commissioner) to submit a detailed plan for completion of the project. The project was required to be completed by November 4, 2019, so no further unnecessary delay should be caused,” it said. The bench also said if the detailed plan isn’t submitted by the next date, the BBMP chief should be present before the court. The next hearing is on January 20.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-raps-bbmp-for-ejipura-flyover-work-delay/articleshow/88842802.cms||---

The accused is Narasimha Reddy, a resident of Saptagirinagar. Girinagar police got credible information that Reddy was near Kerekodi. A team headed by sub-inspector Sunil Chandrashekar Kaddi went to detain him. Around 5.30am, they found Reddy heading towards his house in his car. On seeing the cops, Reddy tried to drive away. But police surrounded his vehicle and asked him to surrender. Reddy got down and attacked Mohan DP, a constable, with a machete. Kaddi sensed danger and fired a bullet in the air and warned Reddy to surrender. But Reddy didn’t pay heed and tried to attack the other cops. Kaddi fired another bullet at his right leg. Police then rushed Reddy to a hospital. Police said Reddy was an accused in 36 cases cases, including for chain snatching, kidnap, burglary, and preparation for dacoit, in Vijayanagar, Girinagar, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Byatarayanapura, Electronics City, HSR Layout, Kengeri, Mico Layout and other areas.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hacked couple wins battle against bank||BENGALURU: Cybercriminals hacked into the bank accounts of a Bengaluru couple and transferred their money to foreign accounts without OTPs being generated. When the bank did not refund the entire amount, the couple approached a consumer court and won a refund of the lost money with interest and also Rs 10,000 each as compensation. The accounts of Arup Kumar Ghosh, 51, and Mahuya De Ghosh, 51, of Ramamurthy Nagar, with Axis Bank were hacked in June and July 2020, respectively. While the man’s credit card was compromised, the wife’s bank account was hacked into. The fraudsters transferred a total of over Rs 75,000 into some foreign accounts through NEFT. While the duo didn’t receive an OTP on their respective registered mobile numbers for any of the transactions, their pleas to the bank to block the accounts too weren’t heeded. Despite filing complaints with the bank and the cyber wing of Bengaluru city police as per RBI guidelines, the money lost in some of the transactions weren’t refunded, prompting the couple to approach the Bengaluru Rural and Urban 1st Additional District Consumer Redressal Forum with separate complaints. In the litigation that commenced in both the cases on March 10, 2021, lawyers of the bank stated the couple’s claims were false and frivolous. They asserted that all the transactions were legal and OTPs were sent to the registered cellphone numbers of the complainants. There was carelessness on the part of the customers as they had shared confidential bank details, including PIN and UPI access numbers, with third parties leading to transfer of the money and the bank carried out the transactions as it was found to be legal, they argued. However, the judges noted that the bank had failed to produce details of the OTPs generated for the transactions. Therefore, the judges were of the view that it was indeed a banking system error that caused all the trouble. The bank had failed to set it right and refused to rightfully refund the couple by taking responsibility, the judges said. On December 23, 2021, the judges directed the bank to refund or revert Rs 28,607 to Arup Kumar Ghosh and Rs 19,648 to Mahuya De Ghosh with interest. Apart from this, the bank was ordered to pay Rs 5,000 each towards damages and Rs 5,000 each for the couple’s court expenses. The amount has to be paid within 30 days from the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hacked-couple-wins-battle-against-bank/articleshow/88842805.cms||Petlee Peter

Police said Cyrill had come to Delhi in 2019 on a business visa with his elder brother. He moved to Ramamurthynagar in Bengaluru six months ago and shifted to Tarabanahalli two months ago. Police have seized 930 grams of methylsulfonylmethane, 580 grams of sodium hydroxide crystal, 5 litres of acid, an altered 10-litre pressure cooker, a pipe, digital weighing machine, two mobile phones and a scooter, together worth Rs 50 lakh, from him. According to police, Cyrill’s brother is the main accused and is absconding. The duo learnt to make MDMA crystals through the internet. They purchased the pressure cooker and altered it to suit their needs. They would put the raw materials in it, boil them and collect the vapour generated. On cooling, it would turn into MDMA crystals. The raw materials are said to have been bought from Mumbai and Delhi. The duo sold MDMA crystals across India, including in Bengaluru. A case has been registered under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act against Cyrill and his brother at Soladevanahalli police station. Efforts are on to nab the latter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/nigerian-held-for-making-drugs-at-home-using-pressure-cooker/articleshow/88842807.cms||---

Police also seized 333 grams of gold worth Rs 16.6 lakh from them. The accused are Venkataramana and Krishnamurthy of Andhra Pradesh and Ramesh of Bagepalli. Police said the trio teamed up after getting to know each other at Bengaluru Central Prison. They allegedly stole a gold chain, weighing around 50 grams and worth Rs 2.2 lakh, belonging to Akkayamma, 65, a resident of Jedarahalli in Rajajinagar on October 11, 2021. Akkayamma had kept the chain on the table in the hall of her house and gone to take a bath. She later found it missing. Police took up a case and launched a hunt for the thieves. The three are said to have confessed to the crime. Police said the trio used to go around on bikes looking for unlocked houses. Two of them would enter the house and steal valuables while the other kept an eye outside. Police said with this, they have solved eight cases registered in Magadi Road, Vijayanagar, KP Agrahara and Channapatna rural stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/trio-who-teamed-up-in-bluru-jail-arrested-for-theft/articleshow/88842808.cms||---

He was speaking after chairing a meeting along with Basavaraj Horatti, chairman of the legislative council, at the State Higher Education Council. Guest lecturers across the state have been protesting seeking better pay and regularisation of services, among other demands. At another meeting, the minister discussed with vice-chancellors of universities and experts the autonomy that needs to be attained by varsities as per the National Education Policy, 2020 and their financial self-reliance. Universities need to gear up to meet at least a third of their expenses from internal resources, minister suggested. “NEP also allows online learning of up to 40% and it is high time we thought about running universities on a PPP model. CSR funds of industries should be used and alumni associations need to be involved in developmental work at universities.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/will-resolve-guest-lecturer-issues-soon-min/articleshow/88842810.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Dog that survived suicide pact looks for new home||CHENNAI: He is the sole survivor of a suicide pact. And now he is looking for a loving family that will give him a forever home. R Loganathan, 55, and his wife Shanthi, 49, the pet parents of Shyam, an Indian spitz, died by suicide in June last year as they were unable to settle their debts. The couple, who lived in Mandaveli, also tried to hang their dog but he escaped. “I got a call from someone who knew me saying that a middle-aged couple had died by suicide and also tried to hang their dog,” says animal welfare activist Manjula Ganesan, who immediately rushed to the spot. “When I reached the place, I was told that the couple had put a black plastic cover over their dog’s head and tried to hang it. But he somehow wriggled free and escaped. Since all the doors and windows had been closed he kept barking and alerted the neighbours.” The deceased couple had also left behind a suicide note in which they requested that the dog be buried or cremated along with them, says Manjula. “They had no children and they treated Shyam like their son,” says Manjula. The dog, who was completely traumatised, refused to let anyone near him. “It took me more than five hours to put him on a leash. With the help of a neighbour, I was able to put him in an auto and take him to a veterinary hospital,” she says. “He was treated for minor injuries on his neck and I also got him vaccinated and sterilised.” After 10 days at the hospital to deal with his trauma, Manjula brought Shyam home. “I have 14 rescue dogs and he couldn’t get along with them. And due to what he had been through, he would get aggressive if he saw plastic covers or ropes,” says Manjula, who then placed him at a paid foster home in Tambaram. “They have a huge space and he has recovered over the months. He has become more trusting of humans.” Manjula, who has been paying 250 per day to board Shyam, is looking for pet parents who can give him a loving home. “He is five years old, toilet and leash trained, and is friendly with humans but not with other dogs. So we are looking for someone who doesn’t have any other pets,” she says. Most importantly, the pet parents need to be kind and understand the trauma he has been through. “He is still very scared of plastic covers, dupattas, and ropes. But in the right home, with love and care, I am confident he will do well,” says Manjula.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/dog-that-survived-suicide-pact-looks-for-new-home/articleshow/88842819.cms||Priya Menon

---||Chennai||Government doctors protest salary arrears; boycott work||Chennai: About 250 doctors from Chengalpet Government Medical College Hospital boycotted their work on Tuesday in protest against non-payment of stipends for over three months.The house surgeons and postgraduate (non-service) doctors, who are posted in covid-19 wards, operation theatres and most other departments in the hospital, said they would continue protests until their demands were met. "Around 30 doctors among us have tested positive for covid-19. Without their monthly pay, they are struggling to meet their expenses and are seeking financial help from their friends and families," said Lakshmanan, a protesting doctor. Since the infected doctors were in isolation, the workload on the available workforce had increased, he said adding that many continued to work on 48-hour shifts without taking adequate rest. Amidst the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Chengalpattu hospital continues to perform all kinds of elective surgeries. Hence, doctors have to be available on call round the clock. The doctors said, despite their working on a tight schedule, the government failed to respond to their plea on the release of stipends. Their representations to the college dean and directorate of medical education (DME) went unanswered. Hence, they resorted to the boycott on Tuesday demanding immediate release of the pending pay and urged the DME to ensure that they received their pay on time in the coming months. The medical college dean J Muthukumaran said the bills were presented before the treasury on Tuesday and the money would be disbursed to their bank accounts before Wednesday afternoon. Despite the protest, patient care remained unaffected on Tuesday as service PGs, assistant professors, professors, and heads of departments were available to meet the needs of patients. The hospital currently has over 50 covid-19 patients. House surgeons (or compulsory rotatory residential internship) were promised a monthly stipend of 25,000. PG doctors get 48,000-50,000 per month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/government-doctors-protest-salary-arrears-boycott-work/articleshow/88842821.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||We need pulse oximeters: Health minister||Chennai: At least nine out 10 Covid-19 patients in home isolation need pulse oximeters, health minister Ma Subramanian said on Tuesday, appealing to philanthropists and corporates to consider donations.“We are not looking for oxygen cylinders, oxygen generators and tanks. We want pulse oximeters so that people can measure their oxygen saturation in blood and raise an alarm if it drops below 92%,” he told reporters after distributing pulse oximeters to Covid-19 patients in Thiruvanmiyur, where there is a cluster of new cases. The Greater Chennai Corporation have stocked up more 1,000 devices in each zone and the health department too has made procurement during the last wave. The clip-like device is placed on the finger or ear lobe to measure how much oxygen is in the blood. The tiny device uses infrared light refraction to measure how well oxygen is binding to the red blood cells to measure peripheral capillary oxygen saturation or SpO2. Although most patients have mild or no symptoms of the disease, it is important for patients to do basic tests such as measuring body temperature and oxygen saturation levels. Patients are told to ensure that the SpO2 reading stays consistently at or above 92%. “If the number consistently drops below this threshold, family members have to call the doctor or 108,” he said. Patients with oxygen saturation below 92% are treated in government hospitals, he said. The Greater Chennai Corporation has more than 178 members, including doctors and health workers, in the tele-consultation team, who counsel patients. Doctors offer medical advice and prescriptions, Subamanian said.“The tele-consultation team works round the clock making calls to most patients at least one a day,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/we-need-pulse-oximeters-health-minister/articleshow/88842822.cms||---

Health department data shows 1,938 people have availed the service as on January 11. On Monday, 1,041 took the booster shot. The dose is available to only 73,000 eligible senior citizens as they have taken both doses of covid vaccines nine months prior. For taking the booster dose, nine months should have lapsed since taking the second dose. Those who want to avail the service can dial 044-25384520/46122300. The booster dose is available at 196 centres, of which 15 will function 24x7. According to the GCC, among those eligible, 37,301 are health workers, 6,925 frontline workers and 29,338 senior citizens. Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said, “As of now, we have 73,000 people eligible to take the booster dose. We have vaccinated 1,041 people on January 10, the first day the door-to-door service was made available. All the urban primary health care centres as well as community health centres are providing the vaccination.” The civic body has formed 15 teams for home vaccination. However, corporation officials encouraged those aged 60 and above with comorbidities to visit the centres to get vaccinated as door-to-door service will be available to only a limited number of people every day. “We have adequate stock of vaccines. The booster dose coverage will be higher if eligible people visited the centres to get inoculated,” an official said. Also, the focus is more on the second dose vaccination for the senior citizens. There is no requirement of a doctor’s certificate to avail this dose. As per the civic body data, out of the 55-lakh total eligible population, 40.32 lakh have been administered second dose. “The main aim is to get the entire population complete its vaccination course,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/booster-dose-campaign-goes-door-to-door/articleshow/88842823.cms||Komal Gautham

According to Crisil’s analysis of 300 companies, corporate profitability, as defined by the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin, “dropped 100-120 basis points (bps) on-year and 70-100 bps sequentially in the third quarter ended December 31, 2021. The analysis did not include financial services, and oil and gas sectors.”“This marks the first on-year decline in 12 quarters,” said the report. As many as 27 of 40 sectors tracked by Crisil Research are likely to see their Ebitda margins shrinking, said the report. In terms of sectors, margins in consumer discretionary segments fell 130-150 bps on-year, and those in export-linked sectors were down by 200 - 250 bps. Information technology services likely saw margins contract 230-250 bps due to increased subcontracting, while steel products and pharmaceuticals may witness a contraction of 110-130 bps each due to rising input cost. “Companies were unable to fully pass on soaring input cost, especially key metals and energy prices. Flat steel prices were 48% higher on-year in the third quarter, while aluminium was up 41%. The price of Brent crude surged nearly 79%, while those of spot gas and coking coal rocketed almost 5.4x and 2.4x, respectively, on-year,” said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research. All these factors played spoilsport with profitability. However, for the first nine months of FY21-22, Ebitda margins are up 80-100 bps on-year to 22%-24%, thanks to the low base of last year. Corporate revenue however is growing nicely by 16%-17% to Rs 9.1 lakh crore, “driven by surging commodity prices”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/india-inc-sees-q3-margins-shrink-for-first-time-in-3-yrs/articleshow/88842824.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lok Nayak study finds 35 mutations in Omicron variant||New Delhi: A study conducted by Lok Nayak Hospital has shown that the Omicron variant, which is in circulation in India, has 35 mutations. Of them, three are non-significant. According to Dr Suresh Kumar, the medical director of the hospital, the researchers in South Africa where the Omicron variant was detected first had found 31 or 32 mutations only. “We have found 35 mutations of which three are non-significant,” he said. The Omicron variant is known to be less virulent as compared to the Delta variant but it is highly transmissible. A study conducted in Hong Kong where the scientists infected the human lung tissue with different variants of SARS-CoV-2 to assess its effect showed the Omicron variant replicated about 70 times higher in the bronchus than the original SARS-CoV2 and the Delta variant. The experiment also showed that the Omicron variant replicated with much less efficiency in the lung. “The new variant makes the virus stay longer in the throat, which makes it more transmissible. But because its capacity to replicate in the lungs is less, it does not cause severe symptoms. Only a few, who have a weak immune system, suffer from severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation,” said a senior doctor. He, however, warned that higher transmission could put pressure on community immunity leading to severe disease in a fraction of cases and an increased burden on the healthcare system.

The author of the book, Manoj Panjani, told TOI that the book is the sequel of famous 2003 flick Baghban but written in a novel format. “I had cordial relations with B.R Chopra and was inspired by the story of Baghban which was written in 1962. Despite the movie’s story not meant for the youth, yet B.R Chopra produced it and the film became a hit. In 2006, I asked Ravi Chopra to make a sequel and he asked me to come up with a story. It got delayed and now I have come up with a sequel in a novel format. The story is set partially on my personal life like a library plays a central role in the entire novel,” said Panjani. The novel is written by Panjani and his colleague Naseem Bano. The book was unveiled during the launch by former MKP College professor Vidya Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/baghbans-sequel-novel-launched-at-doon-library/articleshow/88839682.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: No lockdown, need to balance health, livelihood while imposing curbs, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Reiterating that a lockdown won’t be imposed in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said a very delicate balance had to be maintained while imposing restrictions, which shouldn’t jeopardise either people’s health or their livelihood. Meanwhile, health minister Satyendar Jain said Covid-19 cases would “definitely peak this week” and then start dipping. Talking to NDTV, Jain said he felt that the peak had already arrived, or would arrive in a day or two. “This week, the peak will definitely come and then the cases should start decreasing. We might need to impose a weekend curfew again to remind people to not lower their guard,” he added. Arvind Kejriwal takes stock of preparations at LNJPThe CM said for the last three days, 20,000-22,000 cases were being reported daily, with a positivity rate of 24-25%. While this didn’t rule out the possibility of a further rise in cases, the government would not be imposing a lockdown as it was prepared for any eventuality. “If restrictions are imposed, people’s jobs will be jeopardised, but if we do not enforce limitations, their health and life will be in danger,” said Kejriwal during a visit to Lok Nayak Hospital on Tuesday, adding that restrictions were imposed under compulsion. Kejriwal said, “I want to reassure everyone that we will reduce the restrictions when feasible and impose the fewest possible. Right now, no one can say anything with certainty. The Centre’s representatives who attended the DDMA meeting on Monday were told that imposing limitations just in Delhi would not work and the entire NCR must be included. They assured us that these limits would be implemented throughout the NCR.” Mentioning that everyone was fortunate to be dealing with a relatively mild wave compared with April last year, which was incredibly dangerous, Kejriwal said, “During the second Covid-19 wave, many were coming to hospitals due to dropping oxygen levels and other problems, but the number of such people this time isn’t much.” “If we look at the 2,000-2,500 Covid patients admitted in hospitals currently, I believe the number is extremely low. Most people get infected incidentally. Even if the number of cases rises, Delhi government is completely prepared to tackle it. If necessary, we may create 10,000-11,000 ICUs by preparing 37,000 beds. However, there isn’t much of a need for that right now,” said the CM. After taking stock of the Covid preparations, Kejriwal said Lok Nayak, in his opinion, was the best hospital in the country with more than 22,000 patients returning home after receiving treatment there. “This is the only hospital in Delhi that has never turned away a pregnant lady. There have been over 700 successful deliveries here,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-lockdown-need-to-balance-health-livelihood-while-imposing-curbs-cm/articleshow/88841708.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why there’s no magic pill for Covid-19||NEW DELHI: Every wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has had its share of star drugs promising a potential remedy. While the first wave had everything from malaria medicines to antivirals, the second had Remdesivir. In the middle of the third wave, there is the monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drug called Molnupiravir. This drug is in high demand, even though its benefits are limited. A monoclonal antibody is a molecule developed in a laboratory that is designed to mimic or enhance the body’s natural immune system response against an invader, such as cancer or infection. SARS CoV2, the virus that causes Covid, has a spike protein on its surface that helps the virus attach to human cells. Monoclonal antibodies have been developed to bind to the virus’ spike protein and prevent it from invading human cells. Read AlsoIt’s official, Omicron variant fuelling January Covid surge in DelhiThe latest report of Covid-positive samples analysed in genome sequencing labs of Delhi proves what medical experts have been saying for some time — the massive surge in new cases is fuelled by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care, Holy Family Hospitals, said monoclonal antibodies available in India were not effective against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. “We have used it in six or seven patients, mostly those suffering from Covid caused by the Delta variant,” he revealed. To this, Dr Rajesh Malhotra, chief of AIIMS Trauma Centre, added that the monoclonal antibodies proved effective in initial treatment of Delta infection by preventing serious complications and death, especially in elderly patients or patients with comorbidities. However, since Omicron has shown immune escape capability, meaning resistance to vaccines and antibodies, the monoclonal antibodies aren’t effective. “There is no rationale for using these in the current wave,” Malhotra said. “The only combination antibody treatments for Omicron are Evusheld and Sotrovimab.” Molnupiravir is a new molecule that acts by getting incorporated into the viral genetic material of the virus and stopping its replication by causing mutations, explained Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor of medicine, AIIMS. “The subset of population on which the trial was conducted during the Delta wave showed only minor risk reduction in hospitalisation, translating, therefore, to a modest benefit in the real world scenario today (Omicron wave) against potential toxicity it can cause to the patient,” he said. Read AlsoDelhi government will give free online yoga lessons to Covid patients, says CM Arvind KejriwalChief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that Delhi government will provide free online yoga and pranayama lessons to Covid-19 patients recuperating in home isolation. Kejriwal said the classes will be held in batches of 15, with enough instructors to look after 40,000 patients.Alongside the possibility of causing mutations in the virus and producing new unpredictable variants, Molnupiravir also carries serious risks of damaging the DNA of rapidly dividing human cells, especially in the reproductive organs, bone and cartilage tissue in young individuals. “Hence, we warn against its use in men and women of reproductive age and in children less than 18 years old, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. It is clearly not a magic pill to prevent or treat Covid-19 and should not be used indiscriminately,” said Nischal. Read AlsoCovid-19: 3.5 lakh students vaccinated in Delhi, focus now on out-of-school teensA total of 3.5 lakh teens have received their first dose of Covaxin. Tuesday was the ninth day since the vaccination of beneficiaries in the 15-17 years age group began.Dr Sudha Kansal of Apollo Hospitals and Dr Suresh Kumar of Lok Nayak Hospital also advised against the indiscriminate use of new drugs for Covid management. “For patients with mild symptoms who are in home isolation, we do not need any aggressive management strategy. Paracetamol and anti-allergic drugs may be sufficient if there are symptoms such as fever and sore throat. For hospitalised patients, steroids, anticoagulants, antiviral drugs or immunosuppressant drugs may be required,” said Kansal, who is a senior consultant in the department of respiratory medicine and critical care at Apollo Hospital. Dr Kumar, the medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, also said steroids, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab remained the drugs of choice for severe cases of Covid.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-theres-no-magic-pill-for-covid/articleshow/88841704.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Dismissing an appeal moved by SpiceJet on Tuesday, 11 January 2022, a division bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay and Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup said: “The appellant (SpiceJet) claims to be one of the largest passenger carrier in the civil aviation industry of our country, which by its own stand has carried hundreds of thousands of passengers for all these years without maintenance of its aircrafts and engines from any service provider with valid license from DGCA. The admission of winding up petition may become more relevant in this background. ” A single judge of the court passed the order on December 6, as the airline failed to pay its debt of over $24 million to a Switzerland-based company. After rejecting the appeal, however, the bench suspended the order till January 28 to enable the airline to move the SC. Pointing out that the winding up petition filed in 2015 was taken up for hearing only in 2021, the bench said records showed that SpiceJet had not demonstrated any bona fide defence against the wind-up order. The issue pertains to a plea moved by Credit Suisse AG, a stock corporation registered under the laws of Switzerland. According to the company, SpiceJet had availed of the services of SR Technics, Switzerland, for maintenance, repair and overhauling of aircraft engines, modules, components, assemblies andpar ts whichare mandatory for its operations. A 10-year contract was signed between the companies on November 24, 2011. SR Technics had raised seven invoices and the same was acknowledged by SpiceJet from time to time by issuing certificates of acceptance in relation to the bills of exchange. Meanwhile, SR Technics entered into a financing agreement with Credit Suisse AG on September 26, 2012 and assigned all its present and future rights to receive payments to the petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner made repeated requests to SpiceJet to make payments under various invoices. Since it had not honoured its commitment, the petitioner issued statutory notice under the Companies Act. Since the notice did not evoke any response, the petitioner moved the present plea .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-upholds-order-against-spicejet/articleshow/88842831.cms||Suresh Kumar

---||Chennai||EPS, OPS say poor quality Pongal gift; min seeks proof||Chennai: Food minister R Sakkarapani on Tuesday took on former chief ministers and AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami for their allegations that there were irregularities in the Pongal gift hamper scheme. “If there is any evidence, let OPS and EPS submit it to me. The state is ready for any inquiry,” the minister said, refuting the opposition charges. Talking to reporters here, the minister said that leaders like Panneerselvam were exaggerating fabricated reports. “Doesn’t OPS know that orders were issued to the lowest bidder in a transparent bidding process, where several companies had taken part. Doesn’t he know that companies from across the country could participate under the Transparency in Tenders Act,” Sakkarapani said. The DMK government has been distributing Pongal gift hampers consisting of 21 items, including sugarcane, to 2.15 crore rice cardholders at Rs 1,297 crore.The previous AIADMK regime had distributed 20gms of cashew nut, 20gms of dry grapes and 5gms of cardamom at Rs 45 during last Pongal, whereas the DMK government had been giving 50gms of cashew nut, 50gms of dry grapes and 10gms of cardamom at Rs 62. The government saved Rs 48 in procurement of three products, the minister said.In a statement earlier in the day, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam said the state government’s Pongal gift hamper scheme was a failure and flayed the state government for procuring products from other states that bore names in Hindi. OPS said the government’s purchase from other states amounted to disrespecting Tamils and the state of Tamil Nadu. “Much of the products have been procured from north India and Karnataka,” the AIADMK leader asked, adding that only god knew who the beneficiaries were.For his part, Sakkarapani alleged that the AIADMK leadership indulged in irregularities in Pongal gift hampers in the past but chose to blame the DMK that purchased the products in an honest manner. The AIADMK leaders had carried out false propaganda about the hampers with the support of employees appointed in the cooperative outlets in its previous regime, the minister said. They, however, failed to succeed, after the chief minister himself held an on-the-spot inspection and spoke to the public. Such propaganda would not succeed, Sakkarapani said.The cardholders were happily collecting the high-quality products distributed by the government free of cost, while the AIADMK leadership was annoyed about the public appreciation, the minister said.Meanwhile, AIADMK joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami has alleged a scam in the procurement of sugarcane to be distributed to ration card holders for Pongal. Interacting with reporters in Salem, he accused the DMK government of swindling 15 per sugarcane.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/eps-ops-say-poor-quality-pongal-gift-min-seeks-proof/articleshow/88842836.cms||---

---||Chennai||12 Chola-period idols worth 40crore recovered from shop in Mamallapuram||Chennai: The idol wing police recovered 12 panchaloha idols, including a rare one of Ravana, worth around Rs 40 crore from a heritage shop attached to a luxury hotel in Mamallapuram and arrested the shopkeeper, a J&K native, on Tuesday. Most of these antiques are said to belong to the Chola period.While archaeological survey of India (ASI) officials have confirmed the antiquity of these idols, an ASI team is visiting the idol wing unit office to ascertain their ages.An idol wing CID police officer with expertise in dealing with idols said the recovered idols dated back to the 11th century, citing the position of Lord Nataraja’s hands and fingers. Sreedharan, the expert with ties to the ASI, estimated the value of the idols to be around Rs 40 crore in the international market.Based on a specific tip, the idol wing CID police raided a cottage showroom at the Ideal Beach Resort on East Coast Road (ECR) in Mamallapuram on Tuesday. Shopkeeper Javed Shah, a B.Com graduate and native of Jammu and Kashmir, had been involved in idol smuggling for the past five years, while his brother-in-law had been selling the idols for the past three decades, police said.During questioning, cops found that Shah was running a similar shop in Thanjavur. A police officer said Shah’s attempts to smuggle the idols to foreign countries had been stalled by the Covid-19 pandemic.Sleuths recovered an idol of Goddess Parvathi from Shah’s showroom besides 11 more idols — including the rare Ravana idol — from a secret cellar underneath his shop. Some of the antiques had been buried underground, cops said. Shah was subsequently arrested.Addressing the media, additional director-general of police (ADGP) Jayanth Murali said, “We are searching for Shah’s brother-in-law Riaz who is believed to be hiding in Srinagar.”Investigations revealed that Shah’s kin had been involved in idol-smuggling for the past two decades through the cottage showroom. The idol wing police are questioning Shah on where he procured these idols from.A police officer said, “As Mamallapuram is a tourist destination, we are investigating if Shah acquired the Ravana idol from tourists from Sri Lanka, as Ravana was one of the most powerful kings of the island nation.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/12-chola-period-idols-worth-40crore-recovered-from-shop-in-mamallapuram/articleshow/88842844.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Slow down on ECR, speed detection system may be in place by January-end||CHENNAI: You may want to reconsider the next time you think of stepping on the gas while on East Coast Road. Starting this month, a speed detection system would book people who drive faster than 80kmph on the stretch. Every year, at least 50 accidents are reported on ECR and 90% of these are due to according to speeding, official data. Despite police patrols, traffic violations continue unabated. To put an end to such violations and reduce road accidents, the Tamil Nadu government in February 2020 began installing an advanced traffic management project along the 33km stretch between Akkarai and Mahabalipuram on ECR. The project, set up at 8.6 crore, has three components — Vehicle-Activated Speed Signs (VASS), an Automatic Speed Enforcement System (ASES) and a Video Incident Detection System (VIDS). A pole-mounted VASS, installed by the road or on the central median, can measure the speed of the approaching vehicle and display it on a screen. Every time a driver exceeds the speed limit, the VASS displays the speed in red. As a follow-up measure, HD cameras are installed near these display boards to automatically detect these speeding vehicles. The ASES will transfer the vehicle (registration number) details to the local police, who will issue a traffic challan in the name of the vehicle owner, said a Tamil Nadu Road Sector Project (TNRSP) official. Though all the infrastructure was ready, the project remained a non-starter. The control and command centre at Uthandi toll plaza was kept locked for most part of the day. However, a trial run of the project began recently. “Discussions are going on with other government agencies like National Informatics Centre (NIC), which maintains the database for all registered vehicles in the country. Before January-end, the project and recorded data will be handed over to police,” the TNRSP official added. While ECR residents have welcomed the project, they complained that basic road safety initiatives have been kept pending. B Sricharan of Kanathur pointed out that some portions are poorly-lit and have no road signs warning motorists about curves or speed breakers ahead. “This is why even when you travel at 50kmph, it is still dangerous on ECR,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/slow-down-on-ecr-speed-detection-system-may-be-in-place-by-jan-end/articleshow/88842846.cms||Ram Sundaram

IIT-M students have developed a rendering of the campus in a futuristic martian landscape that will let participants travel between venues using a virtual hyperloop. They can also visit landmarks on the campus through 3D navigation. A virtual Mars dome will be the platform for lectures, events, exhibition booths and interactive games. The 22nd edition of Shaastra, with the theme ‘code to chaos’, will be held from January 13 to 16 and have 50 events.“Conducting Shaastra virtually would not have the same impact as it would have if the event was held on campus. But, the team is trying to achieve a good traction by imagining different ways in which they can reach out virtually to provide students from IIT Madras as well as other institutions a good exposure on what is happening in the field of technology,” IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthi said during a media interaction on Tuesday. Many of the events are free to access for the public and The Times of India is associated with Shaastra this year too.The highlight of the festival is the Shaastra Summit, a virtual conference which will focus on gaming and gaming technology this year, from January 14 to 16. New additions include Shaastra Grand Challenge, a competition to find ways to tackle real-life problems, workshops on trending topics like Arduino, Internet of Things, robotics and AI. The Spotlight lectures will feature speakers including Nobel laureates David Wineland, American physicist and pioneer in quantum computing, Stefan Hall, one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Gottingen, Jane Goodall, founder of Jane Goodall Institute and UN messenger of peace, and Carolina Marin, Spanish badminton player and Olympic champion. Shaastra nights will feature illusionist and magician Suhani Shah and stand-up comedian Biswa Kalyan Rath. Ratna Kumar Annabattula, co-curricular advisor, said the festival will host a CFI (centre for innovation) open house with displays of projects by students, who can network and seek potential collaborators and mentors who can help take the products to the market.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/iit-m-shaastra-fest-to-take-participants-to-virtual-martian-landscape-this-time/articleshow/88842847.cms||---

The bench passed the interim order while admitting a plea moved by the foundation challenging the prosecution. According to the foundation, since 1994 it has constructed buildings over 1.3 lakh sqmt of build-up area on 48.3 acres in Coimbatore for its yoga school and of which 28,279sqmt of building was constructed before issuance of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification 2006 mandating environment clearance for such constructions. As per the notification, an application was made to the director of country planning for necessary building plans constructed till 2006 and thereafter, post 2006, the petitioner said. While so, in 2014 anew EIA notification was issued granting exemption for buildings of educational institutions. However, an unreasonable classification was made between buildings constructed in 2006-2014 and those constructed post 2014, it said. As per the 2014 notification, the petitioner made another application to authorities to grant exemption for its buildings since they are used for educational purposes. While the same is pending consideration, TN Pollution Control Board issued a notice dated November 19, 2021, seeking to showcause as to why the foundation should not be prosecuted for violation of the notification.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-stops-tn-from-proceeding-against-isha-foundation/articleshow/88842848.cms||---

Police suspect that Rani of Uthukottai village was murdered as her gold earring and nose stud are missing and her house was locked outside. An officer said the widow had three daughters who stayed with their partners in nearby villages. They would visit her once a month and give her money for expenses. She stayed near Ellaiamman temple, where devotees gathered in large numbers and distributed food, which she too took some days. Neighbours grew concerned after they noticed that Rani’s home had been locked for the past four days. At first, they thought she locked up her house and was visiting her daughters, but later they sensed a foul smell coming from her home. A few people peeped in through the window but couldn’t see much. They then contacted the Wallajahbad police. A team arrived at the spot and found Rani’s body in a decomposed state on the bed. They also noted that her gold earrings and nose stud were missing. Police have sent the body to Kancheepuram government hospital to find out the cause of death. “Based on the level of decomposition, she is suspected to have died at least four days ago. People recalled seeing her visit the temple last week,” said an officer. Police are checking with neighbours regarding people who frequented her house. An officer said everyone in the locality knew that she lived by herself.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/85-year-old-found-dead-gold-missing/articleshow/88842850.cms||---

Nagaraj, 44, of Poonamallee, took 19-year-old Prathap to task for stalking and harassing his teenage daughter, police said. Prathap reportedly stalked her whenever she stepped out to visit a nearby shop. Frustrated, she complained to her father, who does odd jobs in the locality. Last week, Nagaraj told Prathap to stay away from his daughter, and said he would complain to police if he continued to harass his daughter. An angry Prathap hatched a plot with his friend Mani to attack Nagaraj. Police said the two got drunk and went to Nagaraj’s house on Monday, and hurled abuses at the father and daughter. An argument ensued and Prathap stabbed Nagaraj with a broken beer bottle. Nagaraj’s wife Manjula, who witnessed the incident, cried out for help and neighbours rushed to the spot. They took Nagaraj to a nearby private hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. While Mani escaped, Prathap was caught and beaten up by neighbours. He was later handed over to police. Prathap sustained neck injuries and has been hospitalised. Based on a complaint from Nagaraj, the Avadi police have registered a case and are investigating.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/warned-for-stalking-youth-goes-to-girls-home-stabs-her-dad/articleshow/88842851.cms||---

The existing 4,320MW generating stations in North Chennai, Mettur and Tuticorin consume 62,000 tonne of coal a day.The auction process of 88 coal mines for sale of coal was launched by the Union ministry of coal in October last. As many as 53 bids were received by the ministry under the third tranche for 20 coal mines, of which 16 were fully explored mines and four were partially. “The auction was to have taken place from January 7 but has been postponed. Tangedco is hopeful of getting the coal blocks,” said a senior official.The ministry had successfully completed the auction of 28 coal mines in the first two tranches. Tangedco is eying the fully explored Meenakshi coal block spread over an area of 492 hectares and 998 hectares of the partially explored Bankhui coal block. The distance between Ennore Port and the coal blocks is 1,200km to 1,300km via Paradip port.Even as Tangedco explores renewable energy options, with a major thrust on solar energy, the power managers pointed to the upcoming thermal projects under various stages of implementation to look for more coal. North Chennai Stage III, Ennore SEZ and Udangudi Stage I projects were announced by the previous DMK regime. Tangedco had also sought the Union government’s support to revise the time schedule for the development of Chandrabilla coal block allotted in 2016.The development of the coal block was affected due to non-issuance of clearance for exploration in the forest area of the coal block by the environment and forests ministry. “The best way forward is distributed renewables. Solar brings down carbon emissions and provides clean energy in comparison with fossil fuels. Economic and environmental aspects of thermal stations remain disadvantageous,” said G Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tangedco-bids-for-2-odisha-coal-blocks/articleshow/88842853.cms||Julie Mariappan

Of the 37,000 planned Covid beds in hospitals, Delhi currently has 31,695. The additional healthcare personnel required for managing the surge of patients is also in place. Delhi government had sanctioned 25% additional doctors, 40% additional nurses, and 40% additional paramedics from the numbers that served the Covid hospitals last year. “Any additional manpower will be provided by NGOs and other organisations at approved honorariums,” a government official said. The government has also carried out intensive training of healthcare personnel, including all regular and contractual staff, as well as medical students. “The training is now complete. A hub-and-spoke model was followed with 500 master trainers in each category training the personnel,” the official said. “Among the modules were oxygen therapy, ICU management, paediatric Covid care, tele-consultation and non-invasive ventilation,” the official added. Refresher training for personnel engaged in treatment of Covid patients is under way. The official said that out of the healthcare manpower available, 4,673 of the 4,995 doctors had completed the refresher training, 6,265 of the 6,584 nurses were fully trained, and 2,726 of the 3,190 paramedics had undertaken the required training. With the third wave of Covid in sight, Delhi government had also been training nursing assistants, called ‘swasthya mitras’, since last year in batches of 500 at IP University and other facilities. Around 8,520 of these assistants have been trained and deployed in the districts. The target is to have 10,000 such assistants. The government official said that the swasthya mitras had been trained in basic nursing, paramedic training, lifesaving, first aid, home care, sample collection, handling of oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders, among other things. “These assistants have been trained to tide over any shortage of healthcare personnel in the event of a major surge in cases demand for mass hospitalisation,” the official said. The assistants will act as force multipliers by helping doctors and other healthcare workers during a crisis. The assistants, however, will only carry out tasks assigned to them by doctors and nurses and will not decide procedures on their own. From measuring oxygen and blood pressure to vaccination and patient care, the work of the assistants will have a big range and will also include diaper changing, catheterisation, bedpan and sample collection, etc. While the assistants are at the disposal of the district authorities for the moment, they will be deployed at Covid care centres, where they can assist the healthcare personnel and ensure better patient care. The assistants will be given a salary based on the number of days they work every month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/trained-volunteers-to-give-a-helping-hand-to-health-workers-in-battling-covid/articleshow/88841709.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He held a review with the secretaries of government departments on the implementation of various programmes he had announced during the debate on demand for grants during the budget session in September and in the financial and agriculture budgets. “Evolve an action plan. Plan programmes for this year, next four years and up to 2030. Prepare such a road map. Only if we think big, dream big, the results will be big,” Stalin said while expressing satisfaction over the performance of the administration. The departments have issued orders for 1,313 out of 1,641 announcements made by the DMK government in the last eight months. The chief minister said the officials must avoid the mindset that the state was doing better in comparison with others in the country. “We need to set our goals on a par with the developed countries and South Asian nations,” he said, stressing the need to coordinate with one another. The officials were told to constantly monitor the implementation of projects for which orders had been issued and speedy delivery of services by allocating funds. The secretaries of the departments should visit the districts at least twice to take necessary action of the programmes, which the chief minister would review next month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/think-big-dream-big-results-will-be-big-cm-to-officials/articleshow/88842854.cms||---

The upcoming 300MW GIS powered facility, scalable to 700MW, is being set up at the 2 million sq ft CtrlS Datacenter Campus that is currently under construction in Navi Mumbai, top officials of the company told TOI. While four of the data centres in the Navi Mumbai cluster are already operational, the remaining are expected to be operational by 2024.Sources said the company is investing about $100 million in deploying GIS technology to power all its upcoming data center campuses spread across a total 5 msft across the country over the next 24 months.This includes the 2msft cluster under construction at Mahape, Navi Mumbai, another 2msft campus powered by 300MW GIS spread across 40 acres that is ready for construction in Hyderabad and a 1msft facility (200MW GIS) is planned in Chennai, CtrlS Datacenters vice president BS Rao said, adding that by 2024 the company will be operating about 6msft of data center space across India powered by over 1GW of power.Pointing out that India is emerging as one of the largest datacenter hubs in the world, Sridhar Pinnnapureddy, founder & CEO, CtrlS Datacenters, said, “The total power capacity currently deployed by the data center industry in India is over 650MW. However, we at CtrlS alone are now doubling the industry power capacity to address the growing needs of hyperscalers, telcos, BFSI, healthcare, gaming, and new age companies.”While GIS was first developed between 1968-72, it is more expensive than conventional air insulated substations (AIS). However, it occupies 10 times less space than AIS, requires much lower maintenance, offers better protection of parts from deterioration due to atmospheric air, moisture and contamination and a longer service life, CtrlS added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ctrls-to-deploy-1-2gw-gas-insulated-substations-to-power-data-centers/articleshow/88842855.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

In contrast to the first and second waves, the use of readily-available home test kits has increased in the third wave. Taking advantage of the situation, the prices of kits have been raised to 600 from the original price of around 250. According to Anand Jain, distributor of health care needs, Dreams, enquiries for the kits have increased in the third wave. “Enquiries have doubled during the third wave. People were not really aware about self-check kits before. There has been a lot of campaigning done about these kits. Many think when symptoms are mild self-check tests are enough,” he told TOI. Besides the ease of access, another reason for the increased use of these kits is that many people are afraid of standing in lines. The cost of the kits is also lower than the cost of RT-PCR tests where the samples are collected by private diagnostic labs. Coronavirus live updatesFor their part, some shopkeepers have been selling the kits at higher rates because there was limited supply till recently. “I went to buy a kit, I had to pay 600, but I took it because I had aged parents at home,” Mekala Chandrasekhar Reddy, a private employee, said. Meanwhile, doctors and experts say that self-testing kits are not the best option. They should only be used in extreme cases where regular testing is not immediately available. Read AlsoHigh sales of self-testing kits spark Covid count concernOver 5 lakh self-testing kits have been sold by one company alone in the city in the past one week, underlining the increase in demand for the rapid at-home tests in the Omicron surge.“Very rarely one or two cases are found through home tests as well,” Dr Y Sridhar, critical care consultant, Jubilee Hills Apollo, said. “It is advisable to do follow up with regular RT-PCR tests even if the home test is negative and symptoms persist. These kits can only be used in emergency situations.

They have asked people to steer clear of fancy names like antibody cocktail method, steroids and antibiotics, including doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine. “. Even if one finds out the variant, the treatment is the same. Very few cases require non invasive oxygen support. People should not get carried away by fancy treatment modules,” director public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said on Tuesday. “We are seeing many patients asking for medicines that they searched on the Internet, others are asking to be put on oxygen even when they do not require it. We are explaining to them that there is no need to panic as majority of the patients do not require any major treatment. In fact, the new variant is self limiting within four to five days and all that we need in such cases is paracetamol and in advanced cases molnupiravir or oxygen support. We do not have any patient on ventilator currently,” said a doctor from the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS), Gachibowli. Mild to moderate cases do not even require hospitalisation. “Treatment of Covid depends on risk factors, severity. Mild cases with no risk factors can be treated at home to relieve symptoms and include rest, fluid intake and pain relievers. In high-risk cases, 3-gene multiplex RT-PCR testing may be done before using Covid Cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) as cocktail method is ineffective against Omicron,” said Dr K Usha Rani, senior consultant physician, Aster Prime Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/steer-clear-of-fancy-treatments-cocktail-regimen-say-experts/articleshow/88842861.cms||Amrita Didyala

On Tuesday, a total of 2.50 lakh jabs (precaution and regular) were given in the state. According to officials, the pace of the drive for precaution doses will pick up in the coming months as many people will meet the criteria of nine-month gap with the second dose of the vaccine. In the state, a total of 7.3 lakh frontline workers are eligible. Currently, only healthcare workers have completed their nine-month gap. There are about 3.5 lakh healthcare workers in the state. About 70 lakh doses were administered to people over the age of 60 (first and second doses combined). Officials have been instructed to increase the pace of vaccination drive by operating centres even late at night. Since the teen vaccination drive began on January 3, the Adverse Effect Following Immunization (AEFI) has remained negligible. According to data obtained by TOI, only 230 such cases were reported, despite the fact that more than 50 lakh doses were administered this month. "Though parents had initial reservations about vaccinating their children, they are now coming forward. Vaccination has increased, and we are hopeful of meeting the target within a few days," a top official said. Officials said that enough vaccine stocks are available with the state to complete the targets. Many elderly over 60 years are also enthusiastic about taking vaccines.

The Road Transport Authority (RTA) had launched a crackdown on Tuesday on private travel operators violating rules and formed nine teams to prevent violations of Motor Vehicles Act. “As it is the Sankranthi season, we have stepped in to check the dealings of private travel motorists who are plying between Telangana and AP. Raids are aimed at illegally operating travel buses and vehicles charging high fares without permits,” said an official from the transport department. Authorities carried out inspections at several places on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Officials warned that the documents of private vehicles were being scrutinised. People have also been advised to avoid travelling in such vehicles. Officials also urged private travel operators not to violate the rules and to abide by the Motor Vehicles Act. The crackdown will continue for the next few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sankranti-rush-rta-raids-travel-agencies-books-42/articleshow/88842876.cms||Amrita Didyala

Digging up of roads for identifying the location of leakage is one of the major hindrances in the way of addressing the issue and KWA has introduced ‘water stethoscope’, a device to identify the leak without digging roads or with little digging. This will expedite the process of identifying leaks and plugging it. According to the data with KWA, at least 22 to 25% of water supplied in the city is being lost during transmission. Leakage and theft are the main reasons for transmission loss. “To identify the leakage location, we will have to dig up roads and check pipes to examine whether there is any leak. If any leak is suspected in a certain area, we will have to dig up roads at many spots near the area. Sometimes, the leak may not be identified even after conducting such manual checks,” said Jochan Joseph, superintending engineer, KWA, Kochi. “Water stethoscope is a small device and is easy to handle,” he said.  “At present, we use a pressure gauge meter to identify leaks. If the pressure of water pumping is low, we can assume that there is leak in the area. Rather than cutting roads and checking the pressure on the pipeline on roads, now we will connect the water stethoscope to the water meter of the supply line of a consumer. If the pressure is low, we can deduce that there is leakage in the area,” he said.  “This will help us to avoid digging roads. It will also save a huge cost on account of digging and restoration of road. The inconvenience caused to the public can also be reduced. Moreover, we will be able to identify the leak fast,” Joseph said.  KWA is to procure at least 40 water stethoscopes to identify leaks in the city and adjoining areas. KWA also plans to organize a workshop to train officials on how to use the device. KWA authorities have instructed officials to map the distribution network in their limits. Difficulty in tracking various pipelines laid decades ago is another problem being faced by the water authority.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kwa-to-use-water-stethoscopes-to-identify-leaks-in-supply-lines/articleshow/88840453.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The court pulled up the company for exchanging out-of-court communications with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to settle the dispute relating to execution of over Rs 4,600 crore arbitral award passed against the PSU. DAMEPL had earlier claimed in the court that it was not interested in any settlement. “You say something in court but take another stand outside court. Why are you wasting time of court if you want to settle outside? On one side your client is sitting with them and in court you file applications, you are playing hide and seek with court,” Justice Suresh K Kait observed. It said DAMEPL was not coming to court with “clean hands” and asked it not to “waste” the court’s time. It also refused to hear the matter on a shorter date. “Since the petitioner’s (DAMEPL) counsel is making submission before the court and simultaneously communicating with the judgment debtor (DMRC) to settle the dispute in the manner...the decree holder is not coming to court with clean hands. Therefore, renotify on March 29,” the HC said in its order. The court also took on record the DMRC affidavit furnishing the details of its bank accounts along with the balance amount. Senior advocate Parag Tripathi, representing DMRC, submitted that it was ready to take over the liabilities of Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary to the extent of the award money as it would be a better position to negotiate with the lender banks. However, the offer was turned down by DAMEPL. He informed the court about a communication dated December 30, 2021 exchanged with DAMEPL on the issue of taking over the debt which was to be paid to lenders. DMRC said it has asked DAMEPL to first disclose the full amount of its liabilities. On learning of the communication, the court pointed out that DAMEPL was taking a different stand in the court and outside. “If you are settling the dispute outside the court, why are you wasting the court’s time? Don’t communicate with them when the matter is before the court. If you want to, then withdraw the case,” the judge told advocate Prateek Seksaria, appearing for DAMEPL. The lawyer maintained that the company was exercising its legal right in the court by seeking execution of the decree passed in its favour and claimed that DMRC was not disclosing the whole issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-slams-damepl-for-playing-hide-seek/articleshow/88841713.cms||---

The east corporation is sending notices for the tax that has been rolled back and traders are being summoned to extort large sums in the name of settlement, AAP MLA Atishi claimed. “Under what law are showcause notices being issued on the property tax rates withdrawn by the east corporation?” asked Atishi. However, Delhi BJP brushed off the claims saying that AAP is stooping to ‘dirty politics’ as civic polls are closing in. “On the one hand, Delhi government is not releasing funds, while on the other hand, AAP leaders often accuse corporations of not recovering their revenue. And now when the east corporation is trying to recover its property tax revenue, AAP is objecting to it alleging corruption,” said BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-wrongful-tax-notices/articleshow/88841712.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao finalised Jafri’s name after consulting with AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan is also said to have cleared the file and sent it to the legislature secretary. The term of previous pro-tem chairman V Bhoopal Reddy had expired on January 4. He had been serving the post since June 4, 2021.Jafri will be the first Muslim candidate to hold the post in Telangana. Before bifurcation, Syed Mukasheer Shah had served as the council chairman for two terms — 1979 and 1985. Jafri will also become the first AIMIM functionary to hold the position. The AIMIM currently has only two MLCs, including Jafri in the 40-member state legislative council.Speaking to TOI, Jafri refused to confirm the development and said that he had not received any official communication regarding his appointment. The MLC is also among the most senior MLCs in the council and has been serving as the member of the council from Hyderabad local authorities’ constituency for the last 12 years.Sources said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao wanted to put a pro-tem chairman in place to administer the oath of office to the 12 newly-elected MLCs while also holding elections for the post of chairman.Given the relationship between TRS and AIMIM, KCR had earlier taken a decision to appoint senior-most MLA Mumtaz Ahmed Khan as the pro-tem Speaker of the state assembly in January 2019.

Tirupathi, who was earlier involved in an Excise Act case at Kalwakurthi in 2020, had shifted to driving a cab at Shamshabad airport. He had purchased a car a year ago, but as business was slow due to the pandemic, he recently shifted to ganja smuggling to make up for lost earnings, the commissioner said.Tirupathi got the first taste of the trade about a month ago after a man from Maharashtra hired him for a trip to Rampachodavaram where he saw the passenger buying ganja from Butchi Babu. “Babu advised Tirupathi to peddle ganja.

The decision was taken during a meeting convened by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) on ‘student academic record verification service’ along with all the state university vice-chancellors on Monday. The meeting was attended by director general of police (DGP) Mahender Reddy where discussions took place on measures to make the system foolproof. “Universities have to introspect on whether the current system of verification is foolproof or not. Universities may verify certificates that come before them. But there are many others who continue to work with a fake certificate. Universities must establish a system where no person who duplicates a certificate goes scot-free,” said Reddy, asking university VCs to approach the police whenever a fake certificate is detected. Citing best practices being followed by various foreign universities, the DGP asked the VCs to upgrade their existing verification processes. “Online verification does not mean that universities have to put up their certificates only. There are many other universities where they have online and back-end verification system that flags a fake certificate,” said Reddy. Following this, a parallel system of machine-to-machine exchange of data between state-level TSCHE server and university server will be established to achieve automatic data capture. Universities will be working with National Academic Depository via DigiLocker and upload data as much as and as early as possible. “The TSCHE has asked us to submit data pertaining to certificates that have been issued in the past few years. We are also in the process of setting up security features for our certificates as we have identified several fake certificates that came for verification recently,” said D Ravinder, vice-chancellor of Telangana University, Nizamabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-varsities-cops-join-hands-to-weed-out-fake-certificates/articleshow/88842888.cms||---

They said that five of them were government teachers, while the rest worked in other departments.“The government employees are in severe distress as they are transferred to faraway places without considering their local cadre. While some of them died by suicide, others have died because of heart attack as they couldn’t come to terms with going to faraway places leaving everything behind,” TPTF vice-president M Ravinder said. He alleged that the state made several irregularities while transferring government employees and added that the root cause for all the problems was dividing erstwhile 10 districts into seven zones instead of 10. “Had the state divided each district into a zone, there would have been no issue, but they divided zones by combing districts because of which employees, including teachers, are transferred to faraway places,” he added.The teachers demanded amendments to GO 317 and alleged that the state failed to follow due procedure while transferring employees as separate GOs were not issued by the departments concerned instead transfers were made by following the GO issued by the general administration department. They further said that the state also failed to take the opinion of all associations before implementing the GO.“Teachers and other government employees have been running around various offices to get their transfers stopped. Many are depressed and are getting heart attacks as they are under tremendous pressure. Even teachers who are at the fag end of their career are transferred to faraway places by considering their present post seniority instead of their overall seniority,” United Teachers Federation general secretary Chava Ravi said, adding that on Monday a constable committed suicide as he was transferred from Khammam to Mulugu district.They said the state should react and make amendments to the GO before more lives were lost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govts-faulty-zone-rejig-cause-of-stress-says-teachers-body/articleshow/88842892.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj asked the state government to submit the area-specific data on certain parameters such as Covid positivity rate, percentage of population affected, rate of increase of the Covid-hit, and the number of containment zones.Petitioner Bimal Bhattacharya had filed a public interest litigation seeking postponement of the upcoming civic polls in view of the Covid surge. Senior counsel Bikash Bhattacharya pleaded that elections should be deferred for at least four weeks.The Chief Justice observed that SEC had the power to postpone elections. “You have the power to postpone elections. Are you not able to take decisions on your own?” he said. SEC counsel Jishnu Saha said he would take instructions from the commissioner. At the same time, Saha placed the commission’s position before the court, submitting that SEC would go with the announced poll schedule because the state hadn’t announced a lockdown. The SEC counsel further submitted that the commission had issued fresh guidelines for all civic-poll stakeholders and was getting all assistance from the government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hc-seeks-covid-updates-on-4-poll-bound-municipal-areas/articleshow/88842899.cms||---
---||Kolkata||HC Gangasagar order is ‘very balanced’: TMC||Kolkata: Terming the Calcutta High Court order on Gangasagar Mela “very balanced”, Trinamool Congress on Tuesday said that a political personality cannot substitute the work of state officers, health and other experts. The HC on Tuesday, in a fresh order, replaced leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari and the state human rights commission representative with a retired high court judge.Party’s Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said, “The HC order will be implemented by the state authorities to the best of its ability. The honourable high court has done the right thing by dropping political personalities from the committee. It is not the work of a politician to be part of the committee. How can a political leader do the work of state officials, health and other experts? We believe the HC order (today) is very balanced and we welcome it.”On the issue of RT-PCR tests for all pilgrims, he said: “That should be the case since it is done at airports, but I personally do not know the feasibility of doing it for thousands of pilgrims who will go to Gangasagar. The state administration will look into it.”Earlier in the day, TMC MP Saugata Ray said that the party fully endorsed Abhishek Banerjee’s statement that all religious and political gatherings should be deferred by two months. “Abhishek Banerjee’s view is the party’s view. But one must see it in the context that the statement was made much after the dates of the civic polls and the Gangasagar Mela were fixed. There was no time for anything else. But for any programmes in future, the party will convey its view to the administration, whenever it can,” said Roy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/hc-gangasagar-order-is-very-balanced-tmc/articleshow/88842900.cms||---

They feared that the huge gathering at Gangasagar would only worsen the situation during the steep Covid surge in Bengal.Calling the court nod to the mela and also the dropping of leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari from the monitoring committee unfortunate, Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said: “Does the state government have the infrastructure to screen thousands of pilgrims heading to the mela?”“The government had to suspend Covid tests in Diamond Harbour for a day because majority of the health staff there were down with Covid. The CM wants citizens to remain indoors at least for a week. The high court is holding hearing on virtual mode. Yet this sarkar wants the mela to happen,” he said.Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury held that the mela was on schedule because the state government wanted it. “The government is putting the high court at the front as though the high court has ordered the mela. This is a plea to pass the blame on the court in case the Covid situation,” Chowdhury said, pointing to the Haridwar makar snan decision.CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty held that the mela was happening because the state government wanted it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/oppn-hits-out-at-mela-decision/articleshow/88842901.cms||---

The construction of the Rs 78 crore drainage pumping station is expected to begin by February this year with a one-year deadline given for its completion, said a KMC sewerage and drainage department senior official. According to a KMC official, the pumping station has been planned to drain out storm water from large areas of Kidderpore. “When the drainage pumping station starts functioning, over a lakh residents of Karl Marx Sarani, Satya Doctor Road, Sudhir Bose Road, Dent Mission Road in Kidderpore will be able to get rid of waterlogging every monsoon,” said a KMC official. Apart from large areas of Kidderpore, the proposed pumping station will also prove beneficial for residents of Ekbalpore and Mominpore. “This is one of the major drainage upgrade projects for south Kolkata. The drainage pumping station has been planned to take care of flooding woes of around 2 lakh population in the Kidderpore — Ekbalpore belt,” a civic official said. The proposed drainage system will have six heavy duty pumps to drain out storm water of vast areas. “At present we need to depend on the Mominpore drainage pumping station to drain out storm water from the entire Kidderpore — Ekbalpore belt. But, several pumps at Mominpore drainage pumping station often falter and thus waterlogging can’t be prevented during heavy rains,” a KMC drainage department official said. Mohammed Aslam, a resident of Ekbalpore Road expressed hope. “Every year before the onset of monsoon we keep our fingers crossed. The ordeal continues for over two and half months. After a heavy spell or two, we are compelled to stay indoors. Now, if the KMC comes up with a solution, we will not only welcome this project but if need be we will extend our cooperation,” Aslam said. Tender for the project would be floated by end of January. “Normally, such a project needs 48 months for completion. But we have set a one-year deadline for the construction firm,” said a KMC official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ekbalpore-pumping-stn-work-may-start-in-feb/articleshow/88842902.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Tiger enters village in Sunderbans again, 4th case in less than a month||KOLKATA: In the fourth incident of tiger straying in the Sunderbans in less than a month, another big cat entered a village on the fringes of the tiger reserve area late on Monday night and killed a few cattle animals. The incident, this time, happened at Mathurakhand village near the forest compartments of Pirkhali II and III. According to villager Habul Das, he could sense the movement of the big cat around 1am on Tuesday. “I, along with some of my neighbours, immediately went to our farm to find the tiger sitting at one corner. It had already killed three goats, kept under a mosquito net, and a cow. As we flashed torchlight on its face, he jumped out of the place inside the farm where it was hiding and went to the local forest on the edge of our village,” said Das, adding that on the other side of this forest is Bidyadhari river beyond which lies the forest compartment of Pirkhali. Later in the morning, pugmarks nearby helped villagers trace the tiger at the nearby mangrove thicket. Soon, foresters were informed and they swung into action with a team of 60 staff. Anil Mistry of Wildlife Protection Society of India, who’s also in the field, said that they have spotted the tiger and surrounded all four sides, where it’s hiding now, with nylon nets. According to Justine Jones, deputy field director of Sunderbans Tiger Reserve, the department was also in the process of placing two trap cages with baits to capture the animal. “Like earlier, we have to find out its movement pattern. We are placing the trap cages with baits so that we can capture it. If needed, we have kept our team of tranquillising experts ready who will be pressed into service to dart the animal.” said Jones. He added that the department might use excavator machines and even play recorded audio clip of a female tiger’s roars to bring the tiger out of the thicket.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tiger-enters-village-in-sunderbans-again-4th-case-in-less-than-a-month/articleshow/88842903.cms||---

The Supreme Court had recently turned down his plea for a stay on his arrest and the investigation. He was suspended last July following ACB and EOW raids on his residence and other premises. Singh had earlier headed the same agencies. Assets worth Rs 10 crore and Rs 16 lakh in cash were recovered, along with several documents, the agencies had said. On July 10, less than a week after the anti-corruption raid, the IPS officer was booked on charges of sedition as well. The FIR was filed at Raipur Kotwali police station around midnight under IPC 124A (sedition) and 153A (promoting enmity). Police didn’t make a copy of the FIR public, saying it’s a sensitive case. Later, CM Bhupesh Baghel said the sedition case and the other charges were registered based on documents seized by the ACB. A minister hinted at a “conspiracy to destabilise the government”. Singh then moved the high court alleging that he was being victimized but got no relief.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-cops-arrest-ips-officer-in-delhi/articleshow/88842579.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Santragachhi bird count dips in 3 days, lens on sudden temperature rise||KOLKATA: Two draft bird counts at Santragachhi Jheel, three days apart, have recorded a significant variance from 6,551 on Saturday to 5,792 on Tuesday, indicating that the winged guests may be deserting their favourite winter haunt due to the sudden rise in temperature. Rains on Tuesday evening could either result in a dip in temperature if the skies clear up by Friday and woo the flock back before the official bird count at Santragachhi on Saturday. Or if the rain persists, it can lead to scattering of the birds, forcing them to take shelter in the foraging grounds in Amta, Bagnan and Uluberia rather than return to their roosting spots at the Jheel. TOI had in November-end reported how bird counts at various migration spots were low this year, primarily owing to rains that had continued till late this year. Cyclones, particularly Jawad in early December, also affected the migration pattern of birds. “The lesser whistling ducks usually arrive in fairly large numbers at Santragachhi Jheel around 1.5 to 2 months after they hatch the chicks. The birds wait for the chicks to be big enough to undertake the flight that may range from 50km to 500km. This year, owing to the heavy rains, the breeding season that is usually in July has been delayed, thereby disrupting their migration,” said habitat conservationist Arjan Basu Roy of Nature Mates that maintains the Jheel. Another reason why birds may be abandoning the Jheel is the change in the foraging ground nearby. With development activity in Howrah district in recent times, the night scene has changed. There is light even near the farms at night. This may prompt birds to hunt for other foraging grounds and then pick up a roosting spot close by, he explained. The diversity of birds is also lower than usual. Northern pintails, gadwalls, ferruginous pochard and other bird species have hardly been sighted this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/santragachhi-bird-count-dips-in-3-days-lens-on-sudden-temp-rise/articleshow/88842904.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||District admin screens Sagar pilgrims, police run check on transit camp||KOLKATA: The South 24 Parganas administration, that is in charge of organizing the Gangasagar Mela, will first screen the double dose of all pilgrims heading to Sagar Island before conducting RT-PCR tests on those that are fully vaccinated. For the thousands that have already reached Gangasagar, random RT-PCR is being carried out to prevent the spread of Covid. Kolkata Police officers also carried out an inspection of the transit camp at Babughat in the city to chalk out a strategy on how the twin checks would be carried out before the pilgrims are allowed to proceed to Sagar Island. Sources said the challenge will be to turn back those who are not fully vaccinated. A majority of the 5 lakh pilgrims who are expected to attend Gangasagar this year will transit Kolkata. South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulganathan said his team was duty-bound to comply with the order. “We have identified nine buffer zones along Diamond Harbour Road in addition to the mega transit camp at Babughat. There will also be checks at the entry points to Sagar Island. While Rapid Antigen Tests were being conducted at these places, we will now conduct RT-PCR tests. Since the RT-PCR capacity is limited, we will first screen the pilgrims for the double vaccination certificate and turn down those who have not received the second jab,” said Ulganathan. With the court identifying the state health secretary as the individual responsible for the vaccination checks, district officials expect a big team from the department to help conduct the screening and tests. A chief medical officer (health) will be in charge of the RT-PCR tests on pilgrims. A team of doctors has been engaged for seamless operation of the entire process. A health official said all necessary requirements of South 24 Parganas district authority will be met and all assistance will be extended to comply with the HC order. The DM said an awareness campaign was already afoot to make the pilgrims aware of the high court order. From tomorrow, the awareness on double vaccination screening will be carried out. “We will request all those who are not fully vaccinated to kindly go back home citing the extraordinary situation at present,” he said. SDO Diamond Harbour, Sukanta Saha said the shift to RT-PCR tests from RAT at nine buffer points would begin on Wednesday. “Those who test positive will be sent to hospitals and safe homes according to the degree of illness,” he said. The buffer zones are at Kashinagar, Kakdwip, Namkhana Ramzannagar, Kanpur, Tulsichawk, Sarishabazar, Diamond Harbour Stadium More and Kulpi Bazar. Besides, screening and RT-PCR tests will be carried out extensively at Lot no. 8, Kachuberia, Chemaguri, Namkhana, Benuban, all entry points to Sagar. In Diamond Harbour Medical College & Hospital, isolation wards with 184 beds have been earmarked for positive patients. In addition, there are 29 ICU and CCU beds allocated for Covid patients. At DH Stadium and Sagar, isolation centres with 100 beds each have been set up. At Kakdwip, another 80 bed isolation ward has been kept ready for Covid positive patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dist-admin-screens-sagar-pilgrims-police-run-check-on-transit-camp/articleshow/88842905.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Workout from home: New mantra for fitness lovers||Kolkata: For a large section of the population WFH (work from home) has been one of the most popular acronyms in the last couple of years. But there is another group for whom it also means ‘workout from home’. With gymnasiums and other fitness centres, where workout happens in groups, shut down by the government to stop the spread of Covid-19, several individuals have turned to digital mode to get their daily dose of exercise. From zumba to cardio, from yoga to strength training, living rooms in many homes are quickly transforming into workout zones. Binita Sen’s instructor Angela now leads people in a full-body workout from her home over Instagram live, a far cry from her gymnasium in New Alipore. “Since all gymnasiums have been shut down my instructor goes live on Instagram four times a week and I join in for my workout along with many others. Since we don’t have all the equipment at home we mostly do basic exercises to stay in shape,” said the homemaker from Behala. Most popular exercises have been yoga and pilates, two disciplines which do not require equipment and focus on flexibility and strength. “During the second wave my instructor started sending out pre-recorded videos, a practice which has resumed again during the third wave. Good thing is I can use these to workout anytime and don’t have to go online at any specific time,” said Abhishek Ghosh, a businessman from Naktala. Many fitness centres are not charging their members extra for the digital sessions and it is already included in their subscription. Digital platforms are flooded with fitness apps and exercise tutorials as more and more people are taking up some fitness routine since the start of the pandemic. Several individuals are saying they are doing workout sessions more since gyms have shut down since the beginning of this year. “Firstly, it is working as a distraction from all Covid news around me. Secondly, since the gymnasium is shut I don’t have to travel physically which has made the proposition of working out at home more attractive,” said Ruchi Gupta, a Lake Town resident. Several trainers and fitness experts have started conducting sessions online. “Any form of exercise has to be done regularly for progress. So our clients cannot take a long break otherwise they will have to start from scratch. That is why I decided to conduct classes online,” said Samaresh Ghosh, a yoga instructor in New Town. For Diya Banerjee, an English language trainer in a corporate group, her living room is her office during the day and transforms into a gym in the evening. “Going by my experience during the first and second wave, I had purchased some gym equipments last year. I am using the equipments to workout at home. I think I might not go back to the gym again and continue to workout at home,” said Banerjee.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/workout-from-home-new-mantra-for-fitness-lovers/articleshow/88842906.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors, health workers on Covid leave, hospitals’ in-patient services take a hit||KOLKATA: Many doctors and health workers across the city’s private hospitals — who had tested Covid positive last week and were forced into home isolation — are yet to return to work, making it difficult for the hospitals to keep their in-patient services, especially at the non-Covid wards, running. Even before the first group of infected doctors and health workers could return, more have tested positive this week. Though most planned surgeries and admissions have been cancelled in the wake of a massive spread in infection, hundreds of non-Covid patients are still admitted. Some hospitals said they could soon be forced to shut down their non-Covid facilities for want of manpower. Around 100 healthcare workers (HCW) at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) have tested positive in end-December and the first two days of January. “Of them, 45 have returned to work till Monday with a few still recovering. However, many more HCWs got infected from last week onwards and this constant gaps happening regularly are affecting a seamless operation. A few consultants across specialties, support doctors, DNB students in all specialties have been infected,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that patients are testing positive on their routine testing in OPD prior to surgery forcing a rescheduling of procedures. Peerless Hospital, which has 189 non-Covid patients, is struggling to cater to them. “Many planned surgeries have been cancelled over the last one week. But we already have non-Covid patients who can’t be discharged immediately. Twenty-six of our doctors and more than 40 other staff are in home isolation,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that coupled with the lack of doctors, the number of Covid patients has swelled to 82 and it will rise further over the next few days. Surgeries have taken a major hit at Charnock Hospital since several surgeons and operation theatre nurses have gone into home isolation since last week. “Around 37 HCWs, including nine doctors and 17 nurses, are now in isolation. There has been a dramatic increase in Covid admissions in the last few days and a sharp drop in non-Covid patients who are avoiding hospitalisation. Doctors are falling sick,” said Charnock managing director Prashant Sharma. Five doctors and 55 other healthcare workers of Wodlands Hospital, including nurses, are in isolation now. “We have not yet faced any issue with patient care as overall occupancy is low,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. “We have not cancelled any surgery but the elective cases have dipped by over 50%,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-health-workers-on-cov-leave-hosps-in-patient-services-take-a-hit/articleshow/88842907.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Dip in new Covid cases with drop in number of tests in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The Covid spike remained lower than the record spikes on January 9 but still had 21,098 new cases in Bengal and 6,565 in Kolkata. The positivity rate also showed a slight decline but remained at 33.3% with 65,210 tests state-wide, with rapid antigen tests contributing around 47% of the total number. Covid fatalities stood at 19 in Bengal, including six in Kolkata, on Tuesday. “The fall in the number of fresh cases is because there has been fewer tests. The fresh cases are likely to go down further as number of test is expected to dip again after the revised ICMR testing guideline. Therefore, the absolute number does not make much of a sense for now. The infection is also spreading fast in other districts,” said a senior health official. The Covid case spike was the sharpest on Sunday with Bengal recording 24,287 cases and Kolkata 8,712 cases. On that day, 71,664 samples were tested. On Monday, when there were 51,675 tests, Bengal reported 19,286 and Kolkata reported 5,556 daily cases. Experts didn’t read much into the daily case slide due to the reduced testing numbers. The positivity rate on Monday remained high at 37.3%. “The case load is fluctuating, depending on the number and type of test. Therefore, this number does not matter much. What matters is the alarmingly high positivity rate,” said surgery professor at IPGMER Diptendra Sarkar. Experts, however, pointed out that Kolkata cases seem to be more or less stabilising. We need to observe this declining trend for a few more days, they said. Neighbouring North 24 Parganas recorded 4,000-plus cases on Tuesday. Other districts like Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas are also reporting cases in four digits despite comparatively low tests there.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/dip-in-new-cases-with-drop-in-number-of-tests/articleshow/88842908.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||India||1-year suspension of Maharashtra MLAs worse than expulsion: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said suspension of 12 BJP MLAs in Maharashtra for one year is worse than expulsion and as per the constitutional provision a constituency can’t go unrepresented for more than six months. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar said that the House has power to suspend a member but not for a period of beyond 59 days and hinted that it would only pass order on the quantum of punishment. “You can’t create a constitutional void, a hiatus situation for the constituency. And it is one constituency or 12 constituencies, it makes no difference. Each constituency has equal amount of right to be represented in the House,” the bench said. The bench referred to Article 190 (4) of the Constitution which says that if for a period of 60 days, a member of a House, without its permission, is absent from all meeting, the House may declare his or her seat vacant. The apex court said it would set a “dangerous precedent” for the democratic set up if elected members are removed from House for a long duration. “This will be very dangerous for the democratic set and complete democratic value will be compromised,” it said, adding, in this case there are 12 members and there can be a case where is the number could be 120 also. The counsel appearing for the state said that he would discuss the issue with the government and come back to the court. The apex court had posted the matter for further hearing on January 18. On December 14 last year, the apex court had sought responses from the Maharashtra legislative assembly and the state government on the pleas filed by these 12 BJP MLAs challenging the resolution passed by the assembly to suspend them for one year. The suspended members are Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Parag Alavani, Harish Pimpale, Yogesh Sagar, Jay Kumar Rawat, Narayan Kuche, Ram Satpute and Bunty Bhangdia. These MLAs were suspended on July 5 last year from the assembly after the state government had accused them of “misbehaving” with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker’s chamber. The motion to suspend these MLAs was moved by state parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab and passed by a voice vote.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-year-suspension-of-maha-mlas-worse-than-expulsion-sc/articleshow/88842839.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Pragmatism’ vs ‘false security’: New test norms split experts||KOLKATA: While scaling up tests to detect the maximum number of positive cases was the advisory during the first and second wave of the pandemic, ICMR has now waived off testing requirement for many categories, including asymptomatic contacts of a positive person. According to healthcare experts, this revised testing strategy has both pros and cons. “The nature of the pandemic is evolving. Now Covid is behaving mostly like a mild disease. Therefore, in the current scenario, it is only prudent to focus the testing strategy on people in the high-risk category in a resource-stretched country like ours,” said IPGMER associate professor of infectious diseases Yogiraj Ray. The revised guideline recommends test for the symptomatic, only high-risk asymptomatic contacts of a positive patients, individuals who needs to undertake international travel and international arrivals. “While this strategy will ease the burden on RT-PCR labs, asymptomatic positives can spread the infection. We have come across many asymptomatic positives with very low CT value, indicating the viral load. These individuals, if not tested and put under isolation, could become silent spreader into the community,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar said that in contrast to the second wave where about 20% of the infected needed oxygen and other intensive therapies, the scenario has now changed where the virus is causing only mild disease. “Testing this time is not linked to the disease. The disease this time is more about is disruption of life rather than death. We can reduce the test given that the virus is behaving like an innocuous flu now. But the paradox is that while it can be mild to an individual, in large numbers it becomes a disruptive mild disease,” said Sarkar, who is the senior vice-chairman of Medica Superspecialty Hospital. Clinical pharmacologist Santanu Tripathi said:“There seems some justification of the advisory. But responsible implementation of this strategy needs to be emphasised. Or else this can only encourage the prevailing reluctance among people to go for testing. This can yield an incorrect (rather low) representative data. Further, indirectly this would perhaps strengthen the view that there is nothing to worry for this mild flu-like illness. The vulnerable populations may be at the receiving end.” Beliaghata ID hospital MSVP Asis Manna felt that asymptomatic individuals with no risk are unlikely to develop any complications. “Imagine the kind of pressure on labs if all go for testing. In the current scenario, even hospital care should also be reserved for people with signs of bad infection,” said Manna. “Whether this changed policy will create issues or not, in terms of under-reporting or delayed diagnosis, is not clear at the moment. One can be more sure only once the third wave ends with no unexpected turns,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly of Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. “We need to see the practical implementation of the hospital settings even as we may soon start assuming all around us to be positive,” said gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee, FOGSI vice-president. Cardiac surgeon Sarkar also pitched in for more testing in hospitals as a preventive measure to minimise infection among health workers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/pragmatism-vs-false-security-new-test-norms-split-experts/articleshow/88842909.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Govt to introduce 17 evening polyclinics in Kolkata, 59 in Bengal||KOLKATA: Seventeen urban primary health centres in Kolkata, and 59 across Bengal, will now function as polyclinics with evening OPDs and diagnostic facilities. There will be one of these Kolkata Municipal Corporation clinics each in 16 boroughs, with two in Borough VI – one in Mirza Galib Street and the other in Raja Subhodh Mullick Square. There will be three such clinics under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area, too. According to sources, there will be specialists in the polyclinics who will help run the outdoor clinics for medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics thrice a week and eye clinics twice a week. Recruitment of specialists to run these polyclinics will start soon. The identified urban primary health centres will provide specialist services and will be a hub for providing tele-consultation services, an official said. “Evening OPDs should be encouraged,” the official said. The official said that the timings of these polyclinics would be decided as per the need of the community, as in many areas it had been felt that evening clinic can have a better footfall. He said that the names of the specialists and their timings at the polyclinics are to be properly displayed so that local people can know about the new service facilities that are on offer. The diagnostic clinics will have haematology analyser, Elisa machine and X-ray machines. The urban development department had been asked to visit the sites for early functioning of the polyclinics and diagnostics centres. The official said that there should also be tie-ups with nearby hospitals for the purpose of referring critical patients. The state health department on Monday gave its nod to run 77 polyclinics and 102 diagnostic centres at the urban health centres. The missive issued by Swasthya Bhavan on Monday gave nod to State Urban Development Agency (SUDA) to operate 59 polyclinics and 85 diagnostic centres and asked KMC to operate 17 polyclinics and diagnostic centres in the existing health centres. A senior health official of KMC welcomed the move and said that community-based clinics are very important during this pandemic and diagnostic clinics will help people. He said that right now the health units of KMC function as fever clinics and provide treatments for diarrhoea, malaria, dengue and also diabetes, other than babies and their mothers. But if these clinics are properly utilised by converting them into diagnostic centres and polyclinics at a low-cost, more services can be provided because government hospitals are overcrowded, the doctor said. He added that there are already plans to set up ECG machines and X rays in some of the KMC clinics.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/govt-to-introduce-17-evening-polyclinics-in-city-59-in-bengal/articleshow/88842910.cms||---

This directive comes after the Union health ministry had said that the hospitals can augment their manpower by taking in medical and nursing students if the need arises. With an increasing number of healthcare workers getting infected, many hospitals are currently managing with 60% to 70% of its workforce.According to the Tuesday directive from Swasthya Bhawan, while the first and second year BSc nursing students can be deployed for screening of Covid patients, third and fourth year students could be used for the mild and moderate cases and MSc nursing and basic BSc nursing students could be used in the care for critical Covid-19 patients. “The principals of all nursing colleges must ensure that these students undergo the required training to handle Covid-19 patients,” said the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covid-training-for-nursing-students/articleshow/88842911.cms||---

In a WhatsApp message, cops were informed that they can go to any government health facility for the third dose of vaccination but there should be a gap of minimum 39 weeks from their second dose. Officers at the Welfare Cell of Kolkata Police have asked all police units to provide compliance reports and health status updates of all those who are receiving the third dose. The first day saw a steady response across all Kolkata Police units. The maximum rush was witnessed at the Kolkata Police Hospital in Bhowanipore where 81 cops were vaccinated. Most of them were from the traffic wing as they have to interact with people more than the rest. Several cops from the Tollygunge police lines also turned up at MR Bangur and the KMC clinic at Kalighat for booster dose vaccination. “Several cops, from constables to IPS officers, got vaccinated on Tuesday,” said an officer. Total 536 cops of Kolkata Police have been infected with Covid so far during the third wave. The officers of Bidhannagar Police and the CID — two other major police units with a large number of Covid cases — also confirmed that they have asked their personnel to get vaccinated from Tuesday. “We are monitoring the whole process,” said a senior officer at Bidhannagar Police headquarters. When contacted, Bengal police officers said that they have asked their personnel to get vaccinated at the nearest government facility. On Monday, when frontline workers were allowed to get vaccinated for the third time, some cops took the booster dose by producing their identity cards at private vaccination centres. Baruipur Police, Sunderban police district, Barrackpore City Police and Barasat police district have together reported over 200-odd cases, said sources.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/3rd-dose-for-cops-gets-nod-steady-response-on-1st-day/articleshow/88842912.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sources said that around 40 HCWs have been infected including very senior professors and administrators.Even as STM does not have a Covid-19 treatment facility, the microbiology lab at the institute on Central Avenue has been testing Covid-19 samples since the beginning of the pandemic. Currently, the lab is being used for extracting RNA from Covid-19 positive samples before sending the specimens for genome sequencing. Sources in the hospital said that most of the infected have mild symptoms while some are asymptomatic. A majority of them are under home isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/40-stm-staffers-in-covid-grip/articleshow/88842913.cms||---

The last date of submission of the final bid for the deep sea port is January 31, 2022. This was disclosed by WBIDC chairman Rajiva Sinha during an interactive session with the members of Merchant’s Chamber of Commerce (MCC) on Tuesday. Sinha pointed out that a lot of big players have already been in touch with the state government for this. “Some of them have met us as well,” he said. According to him, the work order for the port may be issued within three months of the closing of bids. “We hope that the port should be ready in 3-3.5 years following the work order,” he added. Sinha pointed out that Tajpur port will have a stated capacity of 50 million tonne.There has been a pre-bid meeting with prospective bidders earlier on November 21 with the state government. As per sources, the response was overwhelming as a host of leading port players like Adani Ports, DP World and JSW Infrastructure, Essar Ports, an entity from Singapore and Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port participated in the meeting. The successful bidder will be given 125 acres of seafront to develop the port and another 1,000 acres of land situated 4 km away for port-linked industrial development. For the first time, a land swap (of 1000 acres) between WBIDC and the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co (WBSEDCL) was done last year in order to make it more attractive for the bidders. During the meeting, Sinha also said that a single window application gateway would be introduced from WBIDC in the next three months. Sinha requested MCC president Rishabh Kothari and other committee members to set up an IPR cell in the chamber.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tajpur-port-to-commence-ops-in-3-5-yrs-wbidc/articleshow/88842914.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Flare-ups at markets as cops enforce mask rule||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police did book 851 people till afternoon on Tuesday for not wearing masks and not following Covid-safety norms, but enforcing the measures seem to gradually become a challenge. The day earlier, 1,084 people were prosecuted. While cops faced resentment at several spots, a hawker in Kidderpore, who was repeatedly asked to wear mask while selling his wares, pushed a cop and assaulted him. He was later arrested. In Tangra, a shopkeeper got into a spat with a cop over the same issue. He was also detained and prosecuted. “Almost 80% people not following Covid norms are in and around markets,” said an officer at the police headquarters. Cops said the scene was better at bigger markets, such as Gariahat and Maniktala, very few wore masks or maintained distance at smaller markets, like those in Kalikapur, Parnasree, Park Circus and Dhakuria. The markets near railway stations were the worst, police said. Kolkata Police has formed dedicated teams that will monitor Covid SOP compliance at local markets. “While crowds have thinned, compliance level has not improved. We have been asked to ensure no one loiters around. We have been appealing to people to leave,” said an officer at the Patuli police station. Lalbaar is also evaluating whether some unorganized markets can be relocated to parks and grounds. Sources said the KMC-KP teams have decided to concentrate on Ultadanga-Maniktala-Kankurgachi belt. Rashmoni Bazar in Beliaghata is also under scanner. In central Kolkata, Posta is considered the epicentre of the virus spread. Besides College Street, markets at Taltala, Koley and Entally in central Kolkata, are also being monitored closely. In the south, markets at Tollygunge Phari, New Alipore, Behala Chowrasta, Azadgarh, Bijoygarh, Bansdroni, Kudghat, Garia and Jadavpur 8B, are back in the focus of the KMC-KP teams. Several of these markets were shut during the peak of Covid second wave as the infection spread fast to the densely populated neighbourhoods. “We are keeping a close vigil on some markets that have been spreading the infection of late. If need be, we may shut a few of them for a couple of days to break the chain of infection,” said a KMC health official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/flare-ups-at-markets-as-cops-enforce-mask-rule/articleshow/88842915.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The rule has been enforced across India from January 1 this year. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Nagpur, is set to kick-start a drive to ensure implementation of the FSSAI’s new guidelines. The violators will face action under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. According to FDA assistant commissioner (foods), Abhay Deshpande, “The first violation may lead to a fine up to Rs2 lakh, while the fine amount would be doubled for subsequent violation. Third violation may lead to cancellation of the licence/ registration.” The rule applies to all food business operators including manufacturers, distributors, stockists, retailers and owners of restaurants, hotels and other outlets selling eatables, he said. Deshpande said the FSSAI had earlier made the licence and registration number mandatory on food labels, which was the responsibility of manufacturers only. Now others in the chain would also have to print them on their receipts and invoices, he said. “The new guidelines will enable consumers to report low-quality products to authorities leading to action against the culprits. With the registration/ licence number, one can track down manufacturer, distributor, stockists, retailers and outlet owners with the details of their businesses, location and corporate office address,” he said. Deshpande said earlier tracing the manufacturers from the food labels was easy, but now anyone from the supply chain can be easily tracked down from the printed 14-digit licence/ registration number on the bills or invoices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/display-licence-no-on-bills-or-face-rs2l-fine-fbos-warned/articleshow/88841711.cms||Soumitra Bose

Talaulikar secured eight votes while BJP-backed Pradeep Naik got seven votes in the 15-member-council. The post of chairperson was lying vacant since December 27 after the resignation of Shantaram Kolvenkar. Though Naik has already served as the first chairperson of the council between May 21, 2018 and August 29, 2019, he was contesting for the post for the second time. In the May 2018 general election, the MGP-backed ‘Rising Ponda’ panel emerged victorious by winning seven seats. Naik was selected as the first chairperson. BJP-backed ‘Ponda Nagrik Samiti’ was the second topper with five seats while the Congress-backed Ponda Citizens Progressive Front got only three seats. Currently, MGP has four councillors including Talaulikar, Jaya Sawant, Amina Naik and Seema Fernandes while BJP has six councilors, Vishwanath Dalvi, Virendra Dhavalikar, Archana Dangui, Yatish Sawkar, Ritesh Naik and Anand Naik. Goa Forward Party (GFP) has two members, Venkatesh Naik and Chandrakala Naik while Shanatarm Kolvenkar, Naik and William Aguiar are now independents. Talaulikar was initially supported by the three other MGP members, two GFP members and Kolvenkar. However a cross vote from the BJP side lead her to win the post.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cross-voting-by-bjp-man-helps-mgp-backed-councillor-become-ponda-civic-body-chief/articleshow/88841740.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Delhi||Delhi: Fresh push to putting a number to monkey population||NEW DELHI: The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has submitted a proposal for a census of monkeys in the city after it was approached by the forest department in this regard in December. The department is yet to give its approval to the plan. In a separate move, the forest department has asked WII to hold the first ever animal census and habitat assessment at Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary. Officials said talks are at very “initial stage”. “We are assessing the proposal for the monkey census and will soon take a call after considering issues like budget and feasibility of the project,” said a forest department official. WII experts said they have proposed a mobile app-based census that would involve citizens as volunteers. A similar census had been successfully conducted in Gurgaon, they added. “Our proposal focuses on high monkey-human interaction areas. The mobile app will consolidate data sent from volunteers from different parts of the city. All they would need to do is take pictures of the monkey when they see it and upload it on the app,” said a WII expert. He added that the census will map areas with a high population of monkeys, rate of proliferation and use the collated data to chalk out a strategy for reducing their numbers. The census, which was earlier proposed in 2019, was aimed at devising a strategy to control the man-monkey conflict in several areas. However, it never took off owing to various reasons, said a WII official. “We had sent a proposal to the Delhi forest department in 2019 but it was never funded. The idea was to find the population of the monkeys and control it through different modes. There is not one single solution to the problem. Monkeys will thrive in the city as there is no dearth of food. Neither sterilisation nor relocation to Asola Bhatti will work because they will return to urban areas. So, a proper strategy is required for specific areas with support from local citizens. And Delhi needs to work fast because it’s already too late,” said WII expert Qamar Qureshi. He added that though there are some rough estimates of Delhi’s monkey population, they are not accurate as there is no groundwork on the rate of proliferation. The capital reports more than 1,000 cases of monkey bites annually. Many attempts to resolve the monkey-human conflict have failed in the past. A PIL was filed in Delhi high court in 2001, following which several orders were passed. In 2018, the court had pulled up the forest department and central government over failure to control the menace. A three-year plan for sterilisation, which was put in place by the Delhi forest department and for which Rs 5 crores were sanctioned by the Centre, was later dropped.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fresh-push-to-putting-a-number-to-monkey-population/articleshow/88841721.cms||Kushagra Dixit

The possibility of the bus service being temporarily halted had led to concerns among a section of traders who regularly travel between Siliguri and Kolkata. As reservation on trains is rather difficult in this sector, the bus service acts as a lifeline for the traders. “The bus service between Dharmatala in Kolkata and Tenzing Norgay Bus Stand in Siliguri will remain unchanged,” a transport official said. He, however, admitted that NBSTC, like several other government and private organizations, was struggling to function normally amidst the rising Covid cases that had afflicted many employees.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/buses-to-n-bengal-to-continue/articleshow/88842916.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Topsy-turvy weather may lead to spike in ailments, doctors warn||KOLKATA: The weather see-saw that the city was witnessing might lead to spike in various viruses, including that of influenza, doctors warned. As predicted by the Met office, it rained in pockets in the city on Tuesday evening. Brought in by a western disturbance, this weather system has not only caused the untimely showers but also blocked the path of chill-bearing Northwesterly winds. The Alipore weather office has warned of more rain in Kolkata and other parts of Bengal. “We can expect more thundershowers till Friday, after which the sky will start clearing up,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director (weather) G K Das. The maximum and minimum temperature on Tuesday remained above normal. While the day temperature is expected to slip below the normal by Wednesday, due to rain and cloud cover, nights will be warmer. “We expect the cloud to start disappearing from Kolkata skies by Saturday. The chill should return by next week,” said Das. “The warmer temperature will facilitate virus replication, including those of influenza. While the infection itself could be not of major concern, the overlapping symptoms will confuse both doctors and patients,” said Partha Sarathi Karmakar, professor, medicine, College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta. Doctors have flagged health concerns caused by the unseasonal rain and the temperature flip-flop. Health experts fear the rise in number of mosquito-borne diseases and respiratory and GI infections, apart from influenza-like illness. “This abrupt weather change could trigger chest and respiratory infection, especially in the elderly. People might catch cold and cough, which could be overlapping with those with Covid-19 symptoms,” said internal medicine specialist Rahul Jain of Belle Vue Clinic. Doctors said while the temperature fluctuation could make one susceptible to respiratory infections, the untimely rain could again aggravate mosquito-borne diseases. “This sudden change in weather can also aggravate the condition in people who are suffering from asthma and related diseases. The temperature change can bring in more viral infections,” said pulmonologist Sushmita Roy Chowdhury of Fortis Hospital. According to Dibyendu Raychaudhri, associate professor of paediatrics, children can also be susceptible to viral and influenza,apart from waterborne and mosquito-borne aliments. “This weather change could lead to kids falling sick due to infections caused by rhino, adenovirus and syncytial virus, in addition to diarrhoea and dengue,” said Raychaudhuri of Bankura Sammilani Medical College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/topsy-turvy-weather-may-lead-to-spike-in-ailments-docs-warn/articleshow/88842917.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He replaced Subha Sankar Sarkar. Calcutta High Court on Monday fined the chairman, West Bengal Central School Service Commission, Rs 20,000, asking him to pay it from his own pocket and asked Bengal government to examine whether he is fit to remain in that post. The decision was made after a meeting at the education department after the HC order said, “I seriously doubt about the quality of the person who is manning the post of chairman after perusing the order and it is for the Education Department of the Government of West Bengal to see whether such a chairman can continue as the Chairman of WBCSSC or not.” The HC had asked the education department to “give due importance to this order” asking the order copy to be sent to the chief secretary and state education secretary by January 14. Even before the deadline was over, the state school education department issued a notice on Tuesday making Majumdar a member of the WBCSSC who will also act as its chairperson with immediate effect. Majumdar said, “I have received the intimation. I would like to first understand the issues before speaking.” Majumdar, an academic for over two decades, had helmed the College Service Commission from 2011 to 2014. Sarkar was not available for comment. The HC’s observations came on a Commission order justifying why a TET applicant was bypassed and appointments were given to candidates below her on waiting list. HC asked the Commission to arrange for the applicant’s counselling against immediate vacancies, or in its absence, any five future vacancies closer to her home within a month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/after-hc-order-ssc-gets-new-chairman/articleshow/88842921.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Twin checks of double vax and RT-PCR on all Sagar pilgrims||Kolkata: The South 24 Parganas administration, that is in charge of organizing the Gangasagar Mela, will first screen the double dose of all pilgrims heading to Sagar Island before conducting RT-PCR tests on those that are fully vaccinated. For the thousands that have already reached Gangasagar, random RT-PCR is being carried out to prevent the spread of Covid.Kolkata Police officers also carried out an inspection of the transit camp at Babughat in the city to chalk out a strategy on how the twin checks would be carried out before the pilgrims are allowed to proceed to Sagar Island. Sources said the challenge will be to turn back those who are not fully vaccinated. A majority of the 5 lakh pilgrims who are expected to attend Gangasagar this year will transit Kolkata.South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulganathan said his team was duty-bound to comply with the order.“We have identified nine buffer zones along Diamond Harbour Road in addition to the mega transit camp at Babughat. There will also be checks at the entry points to Sagar Island. While Rapid Antigen Tests were being conducted at these places, we will now conduct RT-PCR tests. Since the RT-PCR capacity is limited, we will first screen the pilgrims for the double vaccination certificate and turn down those who have not received the second jab,” said Ulganathan.With the court identifying the state health secretary as the individual responsible for the vaccination checks, district officials expect a big team from the department to help conduct the screening and tests. A chief medical officer (health) will be in charge of the RT-PCR tests on pilgrims. A team of doctors has been engaged for seamless operation of the entire process.A health official said all necessary requirements of South 24 Parganas district authority will be met and all assistance will be extended to comply with the HC order.The DM said an awareness campaign was already afoot to make the pilgrims aware of the high court order. From tomorrow, the awareness on double vaccination screening will be carried out. “We will request all those who are not fully vaccinated to kindly go back home citing the extraordinary situation at present,” he said.SDO Diamond Harbour, Sukanta Saha said the shift to RT-PCR tests from RAT at nine buffer points would begin on Wednesday. “Those who test positive will be sent to hospitals and safe homes according to the degree of illness,” he said. The buffer zones are at Kashinagar, Kakdwip, Namkhana Ramzannagar, Kanpur, Tulsichawk, Sarishabazar, Diamond Harbour Stadium More and Kulpi Bazar. Besides, screening and RT-PCR tests will be carried out extensively at Lot no. 8, Kachuberia, Chemaguri, Namkhana, Benuban, all entry points to Sagar.In Diamond Harbour Medical College & Hospital, isolation wards with 184 beds have been earmarked for positive patients. In addition, there are 29 ICU and CCU beds allocated for Covid patients. At DH Stadium and Sagar, isolation centres with 100 beds each have been set up. At Kakdwip, another 80 bed isolation ward has been kept ready for Covid positive patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/twin-checks-of-double-vax-and-rt-pcr-on-all-sagar-pilgrims/articleshow/88842923.cms||---

With around 800 residents in the containment zones, the civic body, through a centralised Covid-19 control room, is sensitising residents not to wander outside for insignificant reasons. Simultaneously, random sampling process in the city has commenced with a mobile health team collecting 82 swab samples from traders in Gandhi market on Tuesday. The new year began with one containment zone on Bharathidasan road in the city but now Ponmalai zone has three containment zones while K Abishekapuram has four. Vayalur road localities that fall under ward number 52 and 53 has reported a maximum number of cases, including a gated community. Officials said if a same street or apartment complex has multiple cases from two different households, the locality will turn into containment zone. “Unlike the previous waves, we are not completely restricting the movement in a contained area. The purpose of barricading the entries is to alert outsiders and limit movement of multiple vehicles for the next two weeks,” a health official with Trichy corporation said. The civic body has informed the neighbours to report if home quarantined patients are spotted moving out. As of Tuesday, around 221 houses in the city are in the containment areas. Waste from the houses that have multiple positive cases were collected and stored separately for incineration. A separate drum has been provided to sanitary workers to collect waste from houses with positive cases. “We are informing sanitary workers if any house in their area has home isolation cases,” the official added. As the spread is increasing, the civic body on Tuesday launched random sampling in Gandhi market. Around 82 samples were collected from vendors including those vaccinated twice. Based on the results, the officials have planned to proceed further.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/7-containment-zones-in-trichy-none-in-madurai/articleshow/88842925.cms||Deepak Karthik

At some places, poor quality jaggery was allegedly supplied. Officials said they are taking efforts to distribute all the 21 items and good quality jaggery to cardholders. Municipal administration minister K N Nehru and school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi had inaugurated the distribution of Pongal gift bags to cardholders in the district on January 4. In all, 8.27 lakh cardholders including 905 Sri Lankan Tamils are being given the gift bags through 1,225 fair price shops. N Renuka, 60, from Maruthandakuruchi on the outskirts of Trichy said the one kg jaggery she received was of poor quality. “It was moist for several others also,” she said. When contacted, a senior cooperative department official in Trichy said moistened jaggery did not mean poor quality. During transit, some jaggery bars got wet. He said delay in arrival of a few grocery items to ration shops led to some shortage. “We have instructed salesmen not to distribute moist jaggery and also bags without all items,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/75-cardholders-get-pongal-gift-in-trichy/articleshow/88842926.cms||---

The accused shot her obscene photos and videos which he used to blackmail her and repeatedly raped her. A few days ago when one of the neighbours approached the survivor’s father and showed some obscene pictures of his daughter, then the girl somehow gathered courage to narrate the entire ordeal. Nazirabad SHO BP Singh said that the survivor is a resident of a village in Nazirabad locality and she is a student of class 11. She stated in her complaint that around ten months ago, she along with her family members had gone to offer prayer at Narmada river on a vehicle owned by accused Narayan Vishkarma (26), who resides in the same village. Since then duo came in contact and began chatting. Singh said that on April 16, the accused called the survivor to meet and allegedly outraged her modesty threatening to kill her. The accused even shot some pictures of the survivor on his smartphone and used it to blackmail and rape her. The SHO said the girl alleged that a sometime ago when accused again started pressuring survivor for sexual favours, she denied and blocked all contacts with him. Enraged over denial, he allegedly circulated her obscene photos within the village. When a neighbour questioned the survivor’s father showing the photos they counselled the survivor after which she narrated her ordeal. Later a complaint was registered and acting on the complaint a case of rape under relevant sections of IPC, POCSO and IT Act was registered and efforts are underway to nab the accused who is on the run.

---||Kochi||Amid opposition, 2nd bridge to come up across Periyar||Kochi: The state government is going ahead with the proposal for constructing a second bridge across the Periyar River in Malayattoor, ignoring the opposition from forest authorities. The bridge, which is going to be constructed in parallel to the existing Malayattoor-Kodanad Bridge across the river, is part of the proposed Thiruvananthapuram-Angamaly Greenfield highway project. The forest and wildlife department authorities had strongly opposed the move to construct a new bridge at Illithod, as the proposed approach road of the bridge is passing through the Kodanad research range area under the nature study centre (NSC), Kalady forest division.  It was in March 2015 that a bridge connecting Malayattoor and Kodanad was opened for traffic by the then chief minister Oommen Chandy. The bridge with a length of 253-m and width of 11m was constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 14 crore, under the Mission 676 project of the state government. “In the initial stage, we had opposed the proposal for a new bridge at Illithod as part of the construction of the proposed greenfield highway, as there is another bridge across the river just two kilometre away. We had formally communicated the disagreement to the government. But government is now going ahead with the project. The process of identifying the area which is going to be acquired for the road construction has already begun,” said a source in the forest and wildlife department. Construction of a new bridge through forest land can be avoided by utilizing the existing bridge for the highway. A new bridge parallel to the Malayattoor Bridge is unnecessary. The ecological impact of the construction of a second bridge in a distance of around two kilometre and the construction of the highway through the forest land also should be considered, said the official. Meanwhile, Stephen Thekkanath, an RTI activist in Malayattoor, has opined that the new road can be constructed by developing Kadappara-Illithod road, without acquiring forest land. “The authorities can reclaim acres of land encroached by private parties on both sides of the existing region and save forest land while constructing new road, which is expected bring major development to the region,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/amid-opposition-2nd-bridge-to-come-up-across-periyar/articleshow/88840506.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Debt-ridden Madhya Pradesh government plans mega statue amid Covid onslaught||BHOPAL: Amid the third Covid wave, a debt of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore, and a health infrastructure badly in need of a booster shot, the Madhya Pradesh government has drawn up plans for a Rs 2,000 crore project that includes the installation of a 108-feet high statue of Adi Shankaracharya on the banks of River Narmada in the holy town of Omkareshwar. This comes close on the heels of a NITI Ayog report that places MP fourth from the bottom in health index 2021. The government plans to finish the first phase of the project by 2023 — before the next elections in the state. Talking to TOI, culture and tourism minister Usha Thakur admitted that health infrastructure was necessary but hastened to add, “The statue of Shankaracharya is also important and we are committed to finish the project. This should have been done earlier.” Last week, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan addressed a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Acharya Shankar Sanskritik Ekta Nyas (trust) to discuss the project. The trust members include Swami Avedhashanand Giri of Juna Akhada. The mega project includes a 108-feet tall statue of Adi Shankara and an international museum “to connect the state to the rest of the world.” In fact, it is a five-year-old project. In February 2021, CM Chouhan had said at Omkareshwar that an institute of excellence in the memory of Adi Shankaracharya would be established at Omkareshwar and a course would be introduced about him in the school syllabus. He had planned to start construction of the statue on January 22, 2018 on the occasion of concluding ceremony of an Ekatma yatra to collect the metal in November -December 2017. On December 27, 2021, government think tank NITI Aayog released the fourth edition of its health index for 2019-20, ranking states on the basis of overall health performance. Madhya Pradesh was ranked 17th in terms of overall health performance among large states, while Kerala topped the list. Only Odisha, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (on the bottom) respectively followed Madhya Pradesh. “A lot is required to be done to improve the health infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh especially in the times of the pandemic,” top government sources said. Earlier in November last year, NITI ayog's first ever multidimensional poverty index declared MP as fourth poorest state in India with one third of its population living under poverty. Over the last few years, the debt figure in the state has been swelling. Presently, the state is under a debt of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore which is more than its total annual budget, which is about Rs 2.41 lakh crore.Though the government has not disclosed how it would mobilize Rs 2,000 crore funds for the Shankaracharya project, Usha Thakur said, “In the first phase about Rs 750 crore are expected to be spent.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/debt-ridden-govt-plans-mega-statue-amid-covid-onslaught/articleshow/88842973.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dheeraj Rajendran murder case: Targeting KPCC chief shameful, say Congress leaders||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader V D Satheesan and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala have deplored the murder of SFI activist Dheeraj Rajendran, saying such heinous crimes cannot be supported by the party. The opposition leader said the violence had taken place at Government Engineering College, Idukki in the presence of police and that it highlights the failure of police in handling violence in the state. There has been serious lapses by police, as pointed out by the SFI leaders themselves, he added. He hit out at CPM leadership and said it is shameful that the party is blaming KPCC president for the incident. The people of the state very well know that Congress has never sponsored political violence, it is CPM that is used to such acts, said Satheesan. Whatever happened in Idukki was not pre-planned. Terming the incident ‘unfortunate’, Satheesan said Congress condemns such acts and the police should conduct an impartial inquiry. Senior party leader Ramesh Chennithala said CPM is trying to silence Sudhakaran by making false accusations against him. This is not the first time that the CPM has targeted Sudhakaran and Congress will foil CPM’s attempts to place the blame on the KPCC president, he said. Congress has always condemned such political killings and political violence. The KPCC president was the first to denounce the murder of Dheeraj. He has made it clear that the people involved in it will not get support from the party leadership, said Ramesh. Youth Congress state President Shafi Parambil, MLA, said in Palakkad political killings cannot be condoned. Talking to media persons he said Youth Congress does not support any incident of violence in the name of politics, religion or for any other reasons. “It does not come under the list of organizations that want to fan violence and make gains from murders,” he said. He also criticized CPM over its alleged attempt to make the murder look like a planned crime committed by the Congress. CPM has unleashed violence throughout the state in the name of the murder of the student, he said, adding that CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan or DYFI leader A A Rahim should not preach what they do not practice. “It is CPM that has been organizing such political murders in Kerala,” he said. Meanwhile, SFI activists ransacked the block committee office of Congress in Thiruvalla town in Pathanamthitta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/targeting-kpcc-chief-shameful-cong-leaders/articleshow/88842991.cms||---
---||India||PBS doesn’t trust his own force, Maharashtra govt has no faith in CBI... it’s very disturbing: SC||NEW DELHI: It is a “very disturbing” scenario in Maharashtra where former police commissioner Param Bir Singh doesn’t have faith in his own force and the state government has no faith in CBI, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday. A bench of Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh made this observation after the counsel for the former police chief submitted that the state police was trying to corner him in departmental cases. The SC, refusing to extend protection from arrest to Singh, said: “This is the same police which you headed for so much of time. What do we say that head of police force doesn’t have any trust in the police force, state government has no faith in the CBI. It is a very disturbing scenario for us. We can’t resolve it peacefully. “The state government doesn’t think it appropriate for CBI to look into it and they filed a plea regarding this in Bombay HC which they lost. Now the matter is in the SC. We do not know what will be the view of the concerned bench here. We have given you enough protection, we are not giving any more protection,” the bench said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, expressed apprehension that the state government may take steps which could make its task difficult in concluding the probe. He told the bench that an affidavit has been filed by CBI and it is ready to take over the probe in one of the criminal cases lodged by Maharashtra police against Singh. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Singh, contended that the former Mumbai police commissioner is being targeted and the state government is trying to scuttle the probe in the CBI matter. The top court, however, remarked, “Nobody is holier-than-thou. When things go fine everybody gets along, when things don’t, everybody is getting at each other”. Senior advocate Darius Kambatta, appearing for Maharashtra, informed the bench that the state government has filed an appeal against the Bombay HC order dismissing its plea to hand over the investigation into the ‘cash-for-transfer’ allegations against Deshmukh from the CBI to a special investigation team. The SC has now posted the matter for hearing on February 22. The apex court had earlier allowed Mumbai Police to carry on the probe against Singh but restrained it from filing chargesheets against him. The police had told the SC that Singh can’t be considered a “whistleblower” as he chose to speak out against alleged corruption involving former home minister Anil Deshmukh only after his transfer. The top court had granted a major relief to Singh on November 22 by directing the Maharashtra Police not to arrest him in criminal cases lodged against him and had wondered if he was being hounded for filing cases against police officers and extortionists, "what could happen to a common man".||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pbs-doesnt-trust-his-own-force-maharashtra-govt-has-no-faith-in-cbi-its-very-disturbing-sc/articleshow/88842987.cms||---

As many as 15 products are sold at rates fixed in 2016, said the minister. He said that public sector undertakings will have to go through a lot of modifications and changes if they have to compete with private players, and the online sales have been launched as part of such an initiative, he said.He said that immediate steps will be taken to purchase agriculture products and sell them through SupplyCo stores. He pointed out that the procurement of cardamom from farmers by SupplyCo and its sales during last Onam season could effectively control its price rise by Rs 200 to Rs 300. Since there are limitations in directly procuring from the farmers, the government is making changes in the e-tendering rules, he said.Transport minister Antony Raju, who participated in the event, said that the SupplyCo mobile application through which goods will be delivered at the doorsteps of the consumer is a major effort by the department in bringing timely updates and embracing changes. He said that the government is also in the process of launching mini-outlets of SupplyCo at all KSRTC depots, and the civil supplies supermarket being launched at the KSRTC complex in the capital will begin functioning from this week.General education minister V Sivankutty, who was part of the event, said that the government could carry out sales worth Rs 45 crore through mobile outlets, from November 30 to December 11 across the state. All products, except those sold under subsidy at SupplyCo stores, will be available for online purchase. The products of Milma, Horticorp and Matsyafed also can be purchased through the same online facility.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/supplyco-supermarkets-to-go-online/articleshow/88842992.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Congress doors open but 'will not take leftovers of BJP', says Harish Rawat||Dehradun: Former Uttarakhand chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat has said that Congress will accept those in the BJP who wish to switch sides but with conditions. "Our doors are open but we will not take the leftovers of the BJP. There is a race ongoing among the BJP leaders to join Congress. Initially, I was against taking any BJP member but later decided to allow their entry. However, we will not take those politicians who are a burden on the BJP or have not got the poll ticket there." In the past few weeks, five legislators have switched sides between Congress and the BJP. While three MLAs have moved from the Congress to the BJP, two have quit the saffron fold to join Congress. Besides, political corridors are abuzz with speculations of other politicians looking to switch sides. Confirming such speculations, Harish Rawat, in an exclusive conversation with TOI, said, "Yes, a number of BJP leaders wish to join Congress. In fact, the BJP is not releasing its list of candidates as the party fears that those who do not find their names on the list would immediately join Congress. They are waiting for us to release our candidate list. This is very unlike BJP." The former CM asserted that Congress would not opt for a “wait and watch” policy and shortlist candidates on their merit. “In the last five years, our members have had their boots on the ground. Our leaders were prompt in opposing the anti-people decisions taken by the BJP government. Therefore, we will prefer giving a chance to such deserving candidates, who dedicated themselves to the party during its rough phase,” said Rawat. He added that the “party has no dearth of talent or deserving candidates.” On being asked if Congress has decided on any date to release its list of poll candidates, Rawat said the announcement would be made next week. “The process to finalise names is in its final phase. We plan to announce a majority of the names next week. The names of the remaining candidates will be released a little later. I am sure there would be panic in the BJP fold once we come out with our list.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/congress-doors-open-but-will-not-take-leftovers-of-bjp-says-harish-rawat/articleshow/88840510.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||I am careful with grammar and spelling of life, says VC||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Breaking his silence on Tuesday, Kerala University vice-chancellor VP Mahadevan Pillai issued a cryptic statement that sought to justify the goof-ups in his communication with the chancellor in connection with the DLitt row. Following is the rough translation of the Malayalam statement of the vice-chancellor, issued under the university’s letterhead. “I’m alert to the maximum possible extent so that the grammar and spelling of life doesn’t go wrong. I don’t consider the commonality of having trembling hands when the mind is shaken as a shortcoming. I try my best to learn good lessons from teachers. Not venturing for anymore reactions,” reads the statement. Pillai was maintaining silence ever since the row over the university syndicate members’ alleged refusal to honour the Indian President with DLitt degree broke out. Meanwhile, the university is about to engage in a damage control exercise. An emergency meeting of the syndicate, scheduled on Wednesday, will take stock of the situation, especially in the background of the chancellor’s claim that the vice-chancellor had defied him by not convening a syndicate meeting as directed by him to discuss whether an honorary degree may be conferred on the President of India. “The chancellor told the media on Monday that he knew very well of the Rashtrapati Bhavan’s policy that the President will not accept any honour from universities within the country. Moreover, there are a lot of protocol issues in this regard. If the president is to be honoured with DLitt, the university procedure requires him to be seated among the audience first while other university dignitaries, including the chancellor and vice-chancellor are seated on the dais. Conferring DLitt to the President is an impossible proposition. Since the chancellor himself is aware of this, he should not have suggested it. He should have at least shown the grace to accept reality when he was informed of the practical reasons,” said a syndicate member. The syndicate meeting on Wednesday will look into all these details and come out with the university’s version on the matter. The syndicate is all likely to rally behind the vice-chancellor, who according to many in the syndicate, did nothing wrong.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/i-am-careful-with-grammar-and-spelling-of-life-says-vc/articleshow/88842993.cms||---

In a directive issued here on Tuesday, HRC chairman Antony Dominic said that all station house officers shall be directed to take strict action against drivers who park their vehicles on footpaths blocking the path of pedestrians. The directive was given to the city police commissioner. The commissioner has submitted a report on this regard. As per the report, instructions have been given to police to take action against people who park vehicles on footpaths within Cantonment subdivision limits. Special attention will be given to regulate footpath parking at Statue Junction. The report said that the police department and the corporation have jointly deputed wardens to check the practice of footpath parking. The directive was issued based on a complaint filed by M Vijayakumaran Nair, secretary of Thiruvananthapuram development forum. In the complaint he said that the footpaths in front of Secretariat annex buildings and in front of the Cantonment police station are often encroached by vehicles. He also attached a picture of a vehicle parked on the tiled footpath near the Cantonment police station. The study and analysis section of the draft master plan prepared by the town and country planning department also highlights the issue of unscientific parking.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/footpath-parking-hrc-demands-action/articleshow/88842997.cms||---

Satheesh of Panayara under Ayiroor police station limits is accused of murdering his father Sathyan, 55. According to the police, the alleged crime took place on Sunday night at their residence. Both men reportedly consumed booze together and broke into a quarrel, which soon grew into a brawl. Though the family took Sathyan to Government Taluk Hospital at Varkala, he soon succumbed to injuries. The police have registered the case as an unnatural death and launched a probe. They also took Satheesh into custody after learning about the brawl. On Tuesday, the police received the opinion of the surgeon who performed the post mortem examination that Sathyan was murdered. There was a major injury on the head and ligature marks around the neck suggesting the possibility of strangulation. The doctor opined that the death could have happened owing to strangulation. Based on this information, the police recorded the arrest of Satheesh by Tuesday evening. Both Sathyan and Satheesh were masons by profession. They often used to consume liquor together at home and quarreled with each other. Sathyan is survived by wife Sobhana. Besides Satheesh, he has two other children, Sarath and Sajini, the police said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-fathers-murder/articleshow/88842998.cms||---

The corporation will organise the collection drive from January 15. Collection points will be set up in all the wards and the drive will be held from 8 am to 12.30 pm. Clothes, bags and sandals will be collected on January 15. Glass waste will be collected on January 22 and CFL and tube lights will be collected on January 29. This will be the first collection drive to be organised by the city corporation after two agencies were selected for zone based collection. The city corporation council had in September 2021 approved the proposal of the health standing committee to engage two agencies for the collection of dry waste. As per the proposal, the corporation will earn money from transportation of 14 types of dry waste while it has to pay for multi-layer covers, bags, chappals, clothes and road waste. Pet bottles and hard plastic, two of the major components of non-biodegradable waste in the city, will fetch the corporation Rs 15 and Rs 13 per kilo respectively. Colour plastic, rubber and coconut shells are other items for which the corporation will receive money from the firm for transportation. The most commonly dumped plastic waste milk cover will earn the corporation Rs 13 per kg while carry bags will be transported at Rs 7 per kg. Oil covers, white plastic covers and paper waste are other types of dry waste for which the corporation will now earn money for collection and transportation. The corporation will have to shell out money for the collection and transportation of clothes, bags and chappals at rates ranging between Rs 5 - Rs 8 per kg.

The engineering wing has been chosen for the e-governance scheme considering how the staff are already trained to use the software. The project is expected to give a much needed image makeover for the engineering wing which has over the years reported shameful instances of files going missing or files being withheld allegedly for bribes.The proposal which was presented in the previous council meeting is expected to be implemented in a phased manner. The first phase will cost Rs 34 lakhs, as per the report submitted by the executive engineer. The steering committee of the city corporation had pitched the e-filing system for the engineering wing. The corporation plans to implement the scheme using its own fund and an IT cell will also be set up for the purpose. The civic body has already called for expression of interests (EoI) from firms to implement a document management system in the civic body as part of digitization. As per the EoI, the main objectives of the project include secured storage of hardcopy files, reducing frequent manual handling, to provide easy access with self-search facility and to ensure high document security and compliance.The issue of missing files had figured in the local fund audit report for 2016-17. The audit had mainly cited lack of documents with regard to building permits and files for regularisation of unauthorised constructions. The lapses had been reported in main office and zonal offices. The audit report mentioned an instance at Attipra zonal office where 13 files related to regularisation of unauthorised buildings were deemed to be missing. In 2015 when a school building had collapsed at Muttathara, the engineering and town planning wing of the city corporation had groped in the dark trying to retrieve the files of a building constructed less than 10 years ago.The engineering wing always had a bad reputation when it came to maintenance of files and tracking systems. In case of building files, the applicants go through hell when they turn up for occupancy certificates after the completion of the building. The building permit file which ought to be kept by the corporation would have been lost and the owner will have no other option but to wait.When instances of files going missing became a common practice, contractors had started carrying around work files which should be maintained by the engineer concerned or the section clerk. The contractors had reasoned that when they turned up for payments, they would not want to risk losing the money since files would have gone missing. The corporation officials said that once the new system comes into effect, missing file issues would be resolved, besides files will be properly tracked ruling out chances of corruption.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/corporation-engineering-wing-all-set-to-switch-to-e-filing-system/articleshow/88843001.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The accused Ramanjeet Singh, hailing from Meerut in UP, was booked under relevant sections for disturbing public peace. Ramanjeet Singh had allegedly abandoned his car on the premises of a hotel at Pattom on Sunday afternoon following a quarrel with the staff of the hotel over parking of his vehicle. The anti-Modi messages written on the car with spray paint drew the attention of the hotel staff who alerted the police. The slogans written on the car held Modi responsible for the deaths of those involved in the farmers’ protest and soldiers in Pulwama attack. He was picked up by the police from his friend’s residence at Pallippuram on Monday night. Museum station house officer inspector Dharmajith said that Ramanjeet, who was an automobile spare parts dealer, had arrived in the city five days ago. He stayed in a hotel at Kovalam for the first two days and then in a hotel at East Fort for the next two days. The inspector said that Ramanjeet was ailing from neuro-related illness. He had undergone two surgeries in the recent past and hence suffered from memory loss too. ‘’His answers during the interrogation session were incoherent. He was granted bail and let go after his younger brother, who also happened to be in the city, turned up at the station,”the inspector said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/anti-modi-slogans-accused-released-on-bail/articleshow/88843002.cms||---

They were caught within 30 minutes of the incident as a GPS tracker was inside one of the parcels they had taken. The accused have been identified as Kishansingh Mazvi, 29, Govind Rajawat, 32, Amit Shivhare, 40, and Balram Rajawat, 35. Two others, Chandrabhan Tomar, their getaway driver, and their informant, Raju Jhala, are on the run. Investigators recovered a pistol worth Rs 15,000, two country-made revolvers worth Rs 10,000, 12 cartridges worth Rs 1,200, a Rs 50 knife, gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 19.55 lakh, silver bars worth Rs 8.59 lakh, Rs 43.90 lakh cash and two cellphones worth Rs 1,000 each from the accused. The angadia workers had got off an ST bus around 7.15pm on Monday and were waiting for a rickshaw near Hotel Hyatt Regency when the three bike-borne robbers struck. They fired four rounds at the workers, injuring one of them. As the victims ran for their lives, the accused fled with three bags and parcels containing Rs 75 lakh worth of valuables. The fourth accused was at a distance from the scene of crime. An FIR was filed at Vadaj police station. “Crime branch swung into action as soon as they received the message. Using the GPS tracker and human intelligence, they reached the warehouse of a decoration firm near Maya Cinema in Sardarnagar and nabbed the four accused,” said an official. Shivhare lived in the CTM area while the other three lived in the warehouse where they worked as casual labourers. After the robbery, they fled towards Shahpur. From there, Chandrabhan Tomar drove them to the warehouse in his rickshaw. “They were caught when they were changing their clothes and transferring the valuables to other bags,” said a police officer. While the initial FIR mentioned the value of stolen articles as Rs 8 lakh, cops seized valuables worth Rs 75 lakh.  An official said that the value of some parcels was not known at the time of the incident. The accused were booked for robbery and under the Arms Act. They have been handed over to Vadaj police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gps-tracker-landed-four-robbers-in-cuffs/articleshow/88843005.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Linking of lakes: Auda to plug missing links in plan||Ahmedabad: In April last year, the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (Auda) drew up a plan to link lakes of Jetalpur and Aslali areas — two places which through repeated flooding had caused serious disruptions to local shops, traders, and MSME units. But with it, Auda also drew up an audit of its interlinking of 11 lakes which it had tried to implement since 2001 along with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). “There are several storm water links that are blocked and damaged and need to be restore. We are yet to evaluate the lines,” said a senior Auda official. Since 2001, Auda had been linking various lakes in western Ahmedabad which include Gota, Chandlodia, Sola, Thaltej, Memnagar, Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Ambli, Prahladnagar and Makarba. “But some of these links were ineffective, we are now evaluating the issues as several lakes were dry despite three monsoons.” In a separate studies conducted by AMC and Auda between 1990 and 2017, it was realized that the net catchment areas of lakes like Thaltej, Memnagar, Vastrapur, Bodakdev, Prahladnagar and Sarkhej-Makarba had drastically reduced from 2,339.25 hectares to 29.97 hectares over 27 years, a large part of the catchment area was now occupied by built properties and roads with far less space for ground water seepage which in turn had affected the survival of lakes.A 2014, Cept University report prepared for Auda, claimed that some 65 lakes within Ahmedabad city had construction, garbage, building rubble and were choked with encroachment, which finally dried up the lakes. “The number of lakes in this city has been constantly declining with the expanding municipal boundaries,” the study had claimed. In 2001, Auda had drew up the 11 lake interlinking project. While citing the example of Vastrapur lake, the report claimed that in the 1990s the lake’s sub-catchment area was 11.52 lakh square metres. Large amounts of water seeped through large vacant surfaces and natural drains fed the lake. By 2000, vacant land reduced to 32% and when Auda began lake development in 2002, the built zone — roads, property construction, civic amenities — covered 60% of the area. Today only 9% of vacant land remains.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/linking-of-lakes-auda-to-plug-missing-links-in-plan/articleshow/88843006.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Woman with three husbands accuses partner of rape, he’s acquitted||AHMEDABAD: A local court has acquitted a married man of rape charges levelled against him after his breakup with his live-in partner, who resided with him for over a year even while her three marriages were in subsistence. The city sessions court considered the history of the live-in relationship between the man and the woman. “Having a live-in relationship with the accused despite the knowledge that he was a married man shows that the victim was fully aware of the moral quality of the act,” the court said in its December 29, 2021, order. “…and was a willing and consenting partner.” According to the case details, the accuser is a 30-year-old woman married thrice earlier and not divorced from any of her husbands. She came in touch with the man in question in 2016 and started living with him in 2017. After the relationship fell apart, she ingested insecticide and was hospitalized. She survived and lodged an FIR with Narol police in February 2018 accusing her partner of rape by giving her a false promise of marriage. During the trial, it came on record that the woman had two marriages before this relationship and her third wedding took place in 2017 when she was in the relationship with the man. The court noted that she had not got a divorce in any of her marriages. She was involved in litigation with two husbands. The court was told that she was aware of her partner’s marital status and problems started when his wife and in-laws learned about the affair and detained him. The court also heard that she had a suicidal tendency and tried to kill herself in the past. After the trial, additional sessions judge P K T Ram said her testimony was inconsistent and at variance with the complaint that she filed. In her statement to police, she alleged that sexual intercourse took place on the false promise of marriage. In her testimony in court she insisted that the relationship was forced, spurred by a false promise. While acquitting the man, the court said: “This court is of the opinion that the sexual intercourse between the couple which was with the consent of the victim cannot be said to be a ‘rape’.” The court added: “The victim was 30 years of age and had adequate intelligence and maturity to understand the significance and morality associated with the act she was consenting to.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/woman-with-3-husbands-accuses-partner-of-rape-hes-acquitted/articleshow/88843008.cms||---

On Monday, the woman was alone and watching a film on her phone when two youths barged in through the main door, which was ajar.

As she screamed for help, the intruders attacked her with a blade, but they then fled on sensing trouble. Her neighbours rushed in. “She was found in bad shape.

---||Ahmedabad||Fliers navigate spike in cancellations||AHMEDABAD: K Prakash, an energy sector professional from the city, had booked his ticket from Ahmedabad to Kochi. He paid Rs 3,100 per person and made a booking for January 6 way back in October. Three days prior to his journey, he received a message from the airline, stating his flight had been cancelled. “My travel plans were well in place. I had no choice but to pay double the airfare and book another ticket at the last minute,” said Prakash. With airlines cancelling flights at the last minute following spike in Covid cases, several passengers like Prakash have been left in the lurch. With weekend curfews imposed in certain states, dwindling passenger footfall has driven several airlines to cancel flights. For instance, Indigo Airlines on Sunday announced cancellation of 20% of its flight movements. Similarly, other low-cost carriers too have cut down flight movements from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International airport in Ahmedabad. Well-placed sources confirmed that flight frequencies to Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi have been reduced whereas those to less frequented sectors such as Kolkata, Indore, Porbandar, Lucknow and Dehradun, among others have been reduced as well. Travel agent, Anuj Pathak, who was scheduled to take a flight from Jaipur to Delhi for a social commitment, was compelled to cancel his ticket at the last minute and book another. “I had to pay almost 1.5 times the fare to book an alternate ticket in the last minute. Several of my clients whose flights were cancelled were also compelled to do the same. While airlines are providing refund for the cancelled ticket, the last-minute cancellation is hampering travel plans and budgets too. Instead, the airlines must provide the option to reschedule the flight at the same cost,” said Pathak, who is also the president of Tour operators and travel agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG). Bholabhai Gedia, a construction contractor from Ahmedabad who travelled to Chennai for a work trip, also faced similar constraints. “We were on a holiday and were scheduled to return on January 11. Ten tickets were cancelled three days prior to our departure from Chennai. We scrambled to get another flight. This one was via Goa and involves a five-hour layover before we reach Ahmedabad. We had to pay more for the tickets too,” said Gedia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fliers-navigate-spike-in-cancellations/articleshow/88843011.cms||Niyati Parikh

As he went into a coma, he was immediately shifted to Ahmedabad for treatment. Dr Hardik Patel, a city-based pediatric critical care specialist, said the case was critical on multiple accounts. “The majority of his internal organs were not functioning properly. His heart was pumping at about 10% capacity and his lungs had been ruptured. Due to inflammation, he was getting epileptic seizures. He was put on a ventilator and different treatment protocols were started to ensure that his internal organs get support,” he said. After seven days of intensive care and monitoring, the child started responding. “After 12 days, he was discharged on Tuesday, with his internal organs healing.

It also ordered the closure of bars and restaurants, with the latter allowed only takeaway and home delivery. Apart from banks and financial institutions, the private companies that have been allowed to operate include insurance and mediclaim firms, pharmaceutical units, courier services and offices of advocates, If operation of courts, tribunals or commissions of inquiries are on. In addition to healthcare services and those dealing in food and medicines, others put in the essential services category include educational books for students, veterinary and animal care, telecommunications, Internet, broadcasting and cable, IT and IT-enabled services, etc. Even cold storage and warehousing, aviation and related services, data centres, cloud services, etc have been exempted. Earlier, all private offices were allowed to function with up to 50% staff between 9am and 5pm. Offices falling under the exempted category were, however, allowed to function with 100% attendance. The decisions were taken in the meeting chaired by LG Anil Baijal. The DDMA order stated, “It has been observed that Covid-19 cases (including the highly contagious and transmissible Omicron variant) have been rapidly increasing over the last few days and positivity rate has crossed 23%.Therefore, it was felt necessary that some more additional restrictions were required to be imposed to contain the spread of the virus.” The order directed that all private offices would remain closed, except those falling under the exempted category according to DDMA’s Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). “The practice of work from home shall be followed. All restaurants and bars shall be closed. However, restaurants will be allowed only for home delivery or takeaway of food items,” it added. Night curfew and weekend curfew would continue for the time being, apart from all the other restrictions in place under the Level 1 (Yellow Alert) of GRAP. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who assured that Delhi government had no intention of imposing a complete curfew, reiterated on Tuesday that the government wouldn’t impose a lockdown. He added that the government wanted the wave of Covid-19 cases to subside with the least number of restrictions being imposed. Sources in Delhi government said there was a discussion on whether the seating capacity of Delhi Metro and public transport buses should be reduced to 50% from the current 100%, but it was felt that the move would lead to crowding at bus stops and outside Metro stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/back-to-work-from-home-for-pvt-offices/articleshow/88841757.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Goa mining case: What have you done in last 7 years, HC asks state||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday pulled up the state government for its reluctance to file an affidavit regarding compliance with the Supreme Court’s judgement against those engaged in illegal mining. The HC asked the advocate general to get a responsible officer to file an affidavit on what the state government has done over the past seven years in the case. Goa Foundation approached the high court seeking an inquiry by an independent committee headed by a former high court judge in the case of the illegal transfers of mining leases in Goa in violation of rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. “The Supreme Court, in its judgment dated April 21, 2014, has expressly stated that rule 37 cannot be allowed to be violated by the lessees with impunity, and the state government cannot overlook transfers by saying that the transfers of the mining leases are part of the mining practice in the state,” the petitioner said. A bench comprising justices Sadhana Jadhav and Manish Pitale told advocate general Devidas Pangam, “…it cannot be like this ... give a list of six persons and (say) this court doesn’t have the power… this can’t be done. There is rule of law in this country. You have to show what is done in the last seven years”. Pangam stated that the government has started proceedings against some of the leaseholders, but stated that filing a reply on merits could have the private respondents saying that the government has already prejudged the matter. When the bench asked the advocate general about the delay, he stated that the state filed a review petition in the SC requesting the Union government for amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act to take care of the situation that has arisen in Goa, and added that the state government has initiated proceedings for recovery of money, and there are orders to recover several crores. The court asked whether it was dragging its feet or not taking action against all these persons. Pangam told the bench that Goa Foundation couldn’t insist on a retired high court judge to conduct an independent inquiry into illegal mining, but the bench said that Goa Foundation is pointing out inaction on part of the state. The bench asked whether this would amount to contempt of the Supreme Court’s order. Norma Alvares, representing Goa Foundation, told the court that the state government has delayed and has been complicit in the whole issue of violation of rule 37 of the MCR, and has been dragging its feet and despite the Shah commission identifying 53 parties and the central empowered committee (CEC) stating that there were a substantial number of parties, the state government has found only six parties who committed violations after seven years. Alvares said that an independent inquiry by a retired high court judge is necessary because she doesn’t believe the government would really investigate the violations, and has been looking elsewhere. The bench also lashed out at a party, asking whether the Supreme Court is required to run the affairs of Goa sitting in Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mining-case-what-have-you-done-in-last-7-years-hc-asks-state/articleshow/88863428.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Thus with SC, ST and OBC quotas accounting for 49%, 10% EWS quota, 5% for persons with disabilities and 10% reservation for in-service doctors, a total of 74% of seats will be reserved.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/state-reserves-10-seats-in-pg-courses-for-in-service-doctors/articleshow/88843015.cms||---

The ban is not found effective, with sale shifting under the counter instead of over the counter across certain select markets in the city. While Ahmedabad city police officials seized a stock of Chinese manja available in Sarkhej last week, TOI reporters who ventured out looking for Chinese manja in Delhi Darwaza and Kubernagar kite markets found at least a couple of dealers dealing in Chinese manja, albeit under cover. At the Sindhi market in Kubernagar area of the city, Chinese manja is available in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 700. On the contrary, the conventional manja is available for Rs 350 for a small reel. Until two years ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic, Chinese manja was available for as low as Rs 100-150 a reel – even cheaper than the conventional manja. “Yes Chinese threads are banned but they continue to be in demand right? So they will sure be available. A lot of things are restricted and yet they’re available. It’s festival time and those who want Chinese manja will diligently come looking for,” said a dealer in Kubernagar area, as he pulled out a reel of Chinese manja from a nylon sack placed near a shop in the area. Yet another dealer who operates in Delhi Darwaza area, also assured to fetch more reels based on requirement. “With increased restrictions, wholesalers and retailers don’t keep stocks at all due to repeated checking by police officials. However, independent sellers do keep the stock at their residence or other places and retail these items based on orders,” he said. Clearly, wholesale and retail kite and manja sellers at other markets namely Jamalpur, Kalupur and Raipur areas of the city, dealers tend to outrightly deny availability. Mohammed Ashrat, wholesaler at the kite market in Jamalpur, said, “Around 80% of the wholesalers are aware of the ban and do not sell Chinese manja. We are here to do business and nobody wants to mess with the law and pay hefty penalties. Many youngsters still come looking for them and they do manage to find the Chinese manja with some effort.” The Chinese manja is banned for use in kite flying. However, given its strength and durability, it is widely used for industrial purposes and even by decorators. “Therefore, the manufacturing continues to take place round the year. Even before the ban, the sale widely took place around Makar Sankranti festival simply because of its easy availability,” Ashrat added. Sources said that Chinese manja is often procured from Indore and Dehgam and are largely available in Kubernagar, Sarkhej and Delhi Darwaza markets of the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/sale-of-chinese-manja-continues-despite-ban/articleshow/88843017.cms||---

Learning from the second wave experience, we wanted to ensure that hospitals and doctors offer uniform services,” he said, adding that all their member hospitals have agreed to adhere to these rules.According to the organization, the maximum one can charge will be Rs 700 per day. Individual hospitals can charge less, they added. The basic home care package – for the period of isolation – must include initial teleconsultation with an expert (MD/DNB), preparation of a Covid care plan and protocol, daily teleconsultation by a qualified nurse, preparation of vitals monitoring chart, education about home quarantine, home visits by a qualified nurse twice in 10 days, teleconsultation by a dietician, teleconsultation by a physician on discharge and home care advice.Similarly, the rate – which will be available on AHNA website – were also fixed for services such as attendants, nurses, oxygen supply, multipara monitoring machine and suction machines, among others.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/demand-for-home-care-grows-ahna-fixes-treatment-rates/articleshow/88843019.cms||---

Last year, we managed with students of the second and third year of the MBBS course,” said a senior AMC health official. “This year we cannot ask them to join Covid duties as there is a restriction order.”The reason is that over the past one and a half years, several strikes and a few court cases have put Covid duties under the scanner. The claim is that such duties meddle in the academic work of the doctors in training. Till now just 241 second-year students of AMC-MET run medical colleges have consented to provide services. The AMC has demanded 440 medicos till late January. “Thankfully there are no hospitalizations or we would have been in deep trouble,” the AMC official said. “This time we plan to manage patients in home quarantine with the help of paramedics.”In fact, about 300 of the 1,100 paramedics who were asked to leave after their 11-month contract ended are now being told to join Covid duties, AMC officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/civic-body-scrambles-for-doctors/articleshow/88843023.cms||---

Students in courses under such councils will be bound by what these bodies decide, the GU statement said. GU VC Himanshu Pandya said, “How colleges are to conduct their internal exams will also be communicated to them soon. We decided to give students this option because we cannot predict how the Covid situation will be in a month or two.” “The university conducts exams for a total of 250 separate subjects in its undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and these are held through February, March and April,” Pandya said. “With this kind of exam scheduling, if disruptions are to occur or exams are deferred, it will have a snowballing effect on the next academic year or semester,” Pandya added. Around 1.25 lakh students are to take these university examinations. “We have given all the departments of the university autonomy to decide on how they should take examinations, online or in-person,” the VC said. On whether online exams open up scope for unfair practices or cheating, Pandya said, “We have learned lessons from the online exams we conducted last year. Around students had secured full marks in various exams for the first time ever last year. Now we have put in place many more measures for proper vigilance.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gu-students-can-choose-exam-format/articleshow/88843028.cms||---

In his notice issued through advocate Anand Yagnik, the Congress councillor has sought facilities like drinking water, public latrines, sanitation, drainage and disposal of waste needed for meaningful right to life with dignity for the poor and marginal section of society as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Looking at one of the largest slums situated in his constituency, the councillor has also demanded urban housing facilities under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna and Regulations for the Rehabilitation and Redevelopment of Slums 2010. Amid allegations that slums around the Chandola lake have been a refuge for Bangladeshi immigrants, the councillor claimed that the 5,000 families for whom he is seeking housing facilities are citizens of India and they do not belong to Bangladesh or any other country to be identified as foreign citizens. These families have ration cards, election cards, Aadhaar cards and other identification proofs to establish their Indian citizenship. Thus, they are entitled to protection of their fundamental and statutory rights conferred under the Constitution and the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949. The lawyer said that if the authorities do not heed to the legal notice, the councillor would approach the high court to secure rights of these citizens.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/councillor-issues-notice-to-govt/articleshow/88843029.cms||---

Chartered Accountants Association Surat had approached the high court seeking extension of deadline of filing tax audit reports till February15 on the ground that the technical glitch with I-T department’s portal might delay the filing. They urged the HC to direct the department not to levy interest and penalty for the delay. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Nisha Thakore told the CA’s association, “If the assessee has not been in a position to file his return in time on account of his inability to upload the audit report on account of technical glitches in the Portal, he can always point out all such circumstances beyond his control when he is called upon to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed.” The HC has sought a detailed reply from CBDT on this issue by February 8 and ordered the authorities to report to the court what progress made with regard to the technical glitches. While seeking explanation from the government, the court said, “We once again impress upon the respondent to attend to the technical glitches, which are being experienced in the portal at the earliest.  The portal is something which is within the control of the respondent and if there are any technical problems in the same, it is only the respondents, who can take care of such problems.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/solve-technical-glitch-in-i-t-portal-hc-to-government/articleshow/88843032.cms||---

The appointment was made nearly 11 months after the civic polls held last year. The decision to appoint a minority community leader in a polling year in BJP-ruled Gujarat is being seen as an attempt by the Congress to keep its flock together in the face of challenge from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) which plans to contest assembly elections from Ahmedabad in full force. As Pathan’s name was being finalised for the post of LoP, there were protests from at least 11 councillors, who even approached Gujarat Congress president Jagdish Thakor and threatened to resign. The party has 24 councillors in the 192-member AMC. “After due deliberation and taking into confidence all the party leaders and the high command, Pathan has been appointed LoP in the AMC. Nirav Bakshi was appointed the deputy LoP and Jagdish Rathod the chief whip,” said state Congress legislator C J Chavda who was the observer for the appointments. In September 2021, he met AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi with a few other Muslim councillors, leading to speculation that they might leave Congress. “I would like to thank our senior leaders Raghu Sharma, Jagdish Thakor and each and every councillor and party worker for supporting me. I will fulfill my responsibilities with total dedication. The Congress will work with all its might to curb the rampant corruption in the civic body. We will work taking everyone together,” Pathan said on Tuesday. “Four or five” councillors have been served show-cause notices for their opposition to the appointments, especially that of Pathan, Chavda said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cong-appoints-pathan-as-lop-in-amc/articleshow/88843033.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||SCs assert rights, ST workers exploited||AHMEDABAD: On January 6, Amarsingh Vasava, a migrant labourer from Bharuch, was made to enter a manhole to clean the drainage line in Sector 3B of Gandhinagar. Vasava is a member of the Scheduled Tribes (ST) community. On December 10 last year, an AMC-contracted worker, also from the ST community, was made to enter a manhole near Mira Cinema in Shah-e-Alam. On December 11, several contracted tribal labourers, including a 17-year-old boy, were made to enter manholes without safety gear near Jirvraj Hospital. In August last year, three contracted tribal workers of one family — Bharat, Sandip, and Raju Meda — were made to enter a drainage line in Bopal and lost their lives. Dalit activists said that earlier contractors working with civic authorities used to hire workers primarily belonging to the Scheduled Caste Valmiki community. However, the activists said, that over the past couple of years, contractors have started hiring more ST workers. The reasons vary from increasing awareness among SC workers to joblessness among ST workers in construction work due to Covid-inflicted lockdowns. “The SC community has become aware of its rights and it asserts them,” Dalit activist and independent MLA from Vadgam Jignesh Mevani said. Mevani added: “Contractors fear a backlash if their misdeeds are exposed. So they hire workers from the ST community who are being exploited because of their sheer poverty.” Mevani went on to say: “The movement for SC rights has been strongly politicized and a lot of voices are raised whenever a single atrocity is committed.” This is not the case with the Scheduled Tribes, he said. “The ST leadership, even if it is in the mainstream politics and is associated with major parties, hardly speaks up when atrocities are committed against an ST person,” Mevani said. “Forget about the BJP, the ST leadership has failed miserably even in the Congress party.” Ravindra Bhartiya, an RTI and Dalit rights activist, said that hiring more ST workers instead of SC workers is a new trend. “ST workers from Godhra, Dahod, and Dungarpur normally work at construction sites,” Bhartiya said. “But due to joblessness in Covid times, they are forced to accept any job they are offered.” “Over the past five years, as many as 25 contracted civic workers belonging to the ST community have lost their lives working in manholes,” said Parsottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima Trust, an organization working for the rights of sanitation workers. Vaghela said that the tribal community members are still disconnected from the mainstream society. “They don’t know the laws that protect their rights. Most of them don’t even have identification documents,” he said. “They are easy to exploit and are being exploited.” Vaghela said that contractors make manhole workers enter drainage systems late at night without safety gear. “They make them work continuously for five to six hours and when they die, contractors and civic authorities shrug off responsibility,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/scs-assert-rights-st-workers-exploited/articleshow/88843034.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Ahmedabad||3 acquitted in death of sanitation worker||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court has acquitted three persons who were charged in connection with the death of a sanitation worker after he fell into the manhole. This, because the police did not gather evidence about the worker’s employment with an agency that was contracted by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to clean its sewage lines. In this case, one Dalsukhbhai Chavariya died after he entered a manhole at Jamalpur Chakla on the night of June 12, 2018. His elder brother lodged a complaint stating Chavariya lost his life due to criminal negligence on part of the contractor and AMC officials, who had neglected a 2007 government resolution prohibiting any person from being compelled to enter a manhole. He alleged that the deceased was working on a contract basis for one Darpan Valmiki Samiti, which had AMC’s sewage cleaning contract. Samiti’s contractor Altafhussain Thakor and two AMC officials Girishbhai Chauhan and Amrutbhai Prajapati were booked by Gaekwad police under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and for violation of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The victim’s brother sought action against the responsible persons. . He claimed that the agency had made the sanitation worker enter the manhole despite assurance given to the AMC about following the 2007 GR. During the trial, the complainant’s brother and other family members did not support the prosecution's case. Moreover, the investigating officer did not place any evidence regarding Darpan Valmiki Samiti having received AMC’s contract and about Chavariya’s contractual employment with the agency. This resulted in the acquittal of three accused. In its order, the court mentioned that the investigator could have supplied evidence about the agency’s contract with the AMC for sewage cleaning and produced the worker’s ID card and PF details to establish that he was employed with the agency. Even the 2007 GR was not placed on court’s record. The court further said that it was established by medical evidence that Chavariya’s death occurred due to asphyxiation after he entered the manhole. However, there was no evidence linking his employment with the agency and so it could not be proved he was made to enter the manhole.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/3-acquitted-in-death-of-sanitation-worker/articleshow/88843036.cms||---

This is an almost 90 per cent jump from Monday’s infection numbers (984 cases). The case positivity rate also crossed the 5 per cent mark as the new cases were detected from tests conducted on 36,452 people. This is the highest case positivity rate in the last 200 days. The state did not record any deaths from the novel coronavirus disease in the last 24 hours. Chittoor posted a record 467 new cases, followed by Visakhapatnam (295), Guntur (164), Anantapur (161), Nellore (129) and Srikakulam (122). Kadapa reported 20 cases, the lowest among all the districts. Due to the sudden spurt in the case numbers, the active caseload has increased to 7,195 from as low as 1,100 two weeks ago. Chittoor alone has 1,549 active cases, followed by Visakhapatnam (1,310), and Krishna (802). Health officials have administered about two lakh booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the last two days. The second dose has been given to 3.19 crore people, reflecting more than 80 per cent double vaccine coverage. The first dose coverage among the 15-18 age group stands at about 82 per cent. In all, the state has administered 7.43 crore doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/positivity-touches-5-as-ap-logs-1831-cases/articleshow/88843037.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Covid-19 cases doubling every 3-4 days, faster than first & second waves||VISAKHAPATNAM: Hardly two weeks into the surge, the daily Covid-19 cases in Andhra Pradesh are doubling every three to four days compared to the gradual increase in the first two waves. From an average 130 daily cases in December 2021, the state is now posting 1,800 cases a day with a case positivity rate of 5%. The state took more than a month to reach the 1,800 daily case range from the initial 100 cases during the second wave, and nearly 45 days in the first wave in 2020. But as the third wave is believed to be fuelled by the Omicron variant, its reported immune evading behaviour and high transmissibility might be leading to the rapid doubling time. The doubling time is one of the key metrics to understand the current rate of spread of the virus in the community. According to the globally available data, syndromes of Omicron variant closely mimic the common cold with a higher rate of transmissibility and doubling time. Due to this, the Union health ministry recently asked the states to keep a close watch on doubling rates, weekly and daily case positivity rates, Delta and Omicron cases, and newly emerging clusters. Urban local bodies like Tadepalli, Visakhapatnam, Narsipatnam, Sullurpeta, Tirupati and Vijayawada recorded about a 10% weekly case positivity rate. Several districts like Chittoor and Visakhapatnam are already posting a daily case positivity rate of more than 5%. The dramatic surge in daily cases and rapid doubling rates may suddenly overwhelm health systems.  Even if hospitalisations remain minimal as reported in other countries, the state may have to face many social and economic consequences. These include the need to ramp up testing, sequencing and tracing efforts, besides the sudden surge affecting key services and forcing the state to impose restrictions on public gatherings, economic activities, mobility, etc. If daily cases double in the third wave compared to the second wave, there may be more patients in hospitals than in the second wave. The state may also have to focus on home isolation facilities and home care. State Covid-19 nodal officer and Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr K Rambabu said Omicron spreads at a faster rate than its predecessor variant of concern, Delta, due to its mutations. “Even if a single person contracts the virus, he/she may spread it to the entire family. The highly mutated Omicron variant may have implications for binding and spread, thus increasing transmissibility,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/cases-doubling-every-3-4-days-faster-than-first-second-waves/articleshow/88843038.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The 50,000 Goans identified by TMC will be provided with 250 sq m of plot each. TMC also declared to implement the tenancy and Mundkar laws in toto. TMC’s alliance partner, MGP president Deepak Dhavalikar, was also present along with TMC’s Luizinho Faleiro and Churchill Alemao, among others TMC functionary Kiran Kandolkar said that the scheme was drafted after studying the plight of Goans who are without homes. It is a “landmark housing rights scheme” that aims at securing the housing rights of Goenkars, he said.

---||Goa||Goa Medical College functioning hit as over 100 doctors, staff test Covid positive||PANAJI: Around 100 personnel at Goa Medical College, including consultants, resident doctors, nurses and paramedics, have tested positive for Covid-19, putting severe stress on the functioning of the state’s premier hospital. A senior GMC doctor told TOI that on Wednesday, all routine surgeries were postponed, as also functioning of out-patient departments (OPDs). President of the Goa Association of Resident Doctors Dr Pratik Savant said that the residents were already working at reduced strength owing to the delays in joining of a fresh batch of residents, due to the admission to postgraduate courses being deferred. “It is another 15 days before the process will be completed and new residents will join. We are afraid that by then, the system may collapse,” Savant said. Acting dean Dr R G Wiseman Pinto issued a circular asking heads of departments to maintain routine OPDs with around 50% of patient capacity, and to defer all routine surgeries except for life-saving and limb-saving operations. Also, surgeries requiring blood are to be postponed. The departments have been asked to depute all their staff for Covid duties, as well as divert resources for Covid management. However, it will continue to attend to emergency cases, and emergency treatment is being carried out without hindrance. The GMC has yet again started online appointments after requests from HoDs, in order to avoid crowding. Now, about 50% of appointments will be given online. This practice was adopted during the first and second waves, after GMC was compelled to suspend routine services to cater to Covid patients. On any given day, GMC sees over 2,000 OPD patients, making the hospital the most crowded venue in the morning session. The circular stated that the monoclonal antibody cocktail will be made available by the hospital pharmacy. It also said that GMC staff will not be entitled to quarantine leave, but those having mild symptoms will be able to avail seven days leave from the first symptoms and submission of the Covid-positive report. GMC on Wednesday announced that the first round of admission-cum-counselling for PG and diploma courses will be held on January 24. The senior GMC doctor said that the hospital is also burdened due to referral cases from district and sub-district hospitals, though several of them can be easily handled at their end. Meanwhile, three members of the state’s expert committee for Covid management have tested positive. The committee last met on Saturday, however, the three were not present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gmc-functioning-hit-as-over-100-docs-staff-test-covid-ve/articleshow/88863441.cms||Bindiya Chari

The active cases inched closer to 30,000, according to the Covid-19 bulletin issued by the state health department late in the night.In less than a week, more than a dozen deaths have been reported from across the state even as health experts have attributed that the ongoing third wave, primarily triggered due to the Omicron variant, is less lethal and not many patients need hospitalisation. The experts said the death rate is high among those with severe comorbid conditions. They, however, added that it is still not clear whether the new cases are caused by the Delta or the Omicron variant as Jharkhand does not have a genome sequencing machine to identify the strain. Reports of samples that have been sent to other states for sequencing have also not arrived yet.Meanwhile, Ranchi and East Singhbhum reported the highest cases in the last 24 hours with the capital city reporting 1,592 cases and the latter reporting 1,160 cases. Six districts also logged triple-digit cases while the remaining districts reported cases in two-digit figures.Currently, the total active caseload in the state now stands at 29,042 and the cumulative death toll since the start of the pandemic has reached 5,176.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/e-sbhum-reports-4-deaths-as-state-logs-4719-new-cov-cases/articleshow/88843046.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Admin seeking -ve report to end home isolation: Locals||Ranchi: Authorities in Ranchi are allegedly demanding a negative report to officially end home isolation, local residents said. As a result, many are reluctant to proactively undertake Covid-19 test even if they have cough, cold, fever or other symptoms. In many cases, people are getting themselves treated through home-made remedies to avoid ‘unwanted hassles’. As per Union government’s guidelines, a patient with mild symptoms or is asymptomatic is permitted to remain in home isolation and can end it after at least seven days if he/she has no fever for the last three days from the date of testing positive. It also specifies no retesting is required. Deputy development commissioner Vishal Sagar conceded that no retest was required for ending home isolation. “The home isolation guidelines are very clear and no retest needed. If no fever for three days and after seven days, home isolation automatically ends. But if anyone is asking for negative report, then we will have to verify it and take steps accordingly. As far as barricading is concerned, we do it as micro containment zones only,” he said. Narendra Kumar Jain (73), resident of Blair Apartment on Main Road, said that the authorities aren’t following the prescribed norms. He said, “On January 4, I tested positive for Covid-19. On January 8, my house was barricaded as micro-containment zone. I didn’t get any fever. On January 10, I again got tested to get negative test report. I informed the local authorities about it and urged them to remove the barricade. As we speak around noon today, it wasn’t removed even after I am negative.” He added that such barricades lead to fear psychosis among people and turn them off from getting proactively tested.Agreed another resident of the same apartment, Indu Mehta stating that he tested positive on January 3 and his isolation period technically ended on January 9. “During this period, I had no symptoms at all. But when I called up the local authorities/incident commander, they said unless I produce a negative certificate, they won’t remove the barricades. I am aware of the home isolation guidelines as my relative is head of a prominent city hospital, but to no avail,” he claimed.Sudhir Das (name changed on request), a Morabadi resident, however, preferred not to get tested fearing such hassles. “Over a week back, I had fever for a day and throat ache and cold for two-three days. But I chose to speak to my doctor to get medicines but not get tested deliberately. However, I had isolated myself till I got cured of those symptoms,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/admin-seeking-ve-report-to-end-home-isolation-locals/articleshow/88843047.cms||ASRP Mukesh

With doctors recommending protein-rich diet for post covid treatment, various soya products flooded the market. At this time, 'soya chaap', commonly known as vegetarian chicken, was introduced in markets here and soon became a favourite.Jeetendra Kumar, propreitor, Abundant Healthcare Private Limited, the company that manufactures processed soyabean products, said that people are aware of the health benefits of soya chunks, tofu and soya milk but soya chaap came as a healthy but tasty option. “We had to increase production by 80-90% in comparison to production in 2020, just to meet the market demand,” he said. Soya chaap is semi-cooked soyabean product that is sold frozen in general stores. Nishant Kumar, owner of Chinese vs Tandoori, a street side food truck on Harmu Road, has championed tandoori preparation of soya chaap. “Most of our customers demand soya chaap and it is one of the hot favourites on our menu,” he said. “Soya chaap wasn’t popular in Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Bokaro and Jamtara. But after Covid happened, people started looking for protein rich diet, and slowly this item became a favourite,” said Ravi, a distributor of soya chaap in the state. Dr Voomika Mukherjee, a dietitian, said, “For vegetarians, it is the best substitute for animal-based protein. Apart from pulses and dairy products, it can be taken as an alternative.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/sale-of-soya-chaap-picks-up-in-state/articleshow/88843049.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Strike at HEC called off after mgmt promises timely wages||Ranchi: The 40-day tool down strike at the Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd (HEC), Ranchi, was called off on Tuesday morning after the public sector unit’s management assured the workers of the timely payment of wages every month and promised them not to make any pay cuts for the period of strike. On January 7, the HEC had declared that the workers’ strike has been successfully resolved. Though the workers owing allegiance to two out of the eight unions at HEC had resumed work, they had soon abandoned it to join their striking compatriots.The workers, in turn, gave up their demand of a one-time payment of unpaid wages of the past six months to reach an amicable settlement. A bipartite agreement signed by HEC and the representatives of eight trade unions said while a month’s wages have been released by the HEC for permanent and contract workers on January 10, efforts would be made to pay at least 15 days’ wages by the end of this month. Beginning February, the HEC shall endeavour to pay a month’s wages to all workers by the end of each month. However, the payment of wages would depend on the cooperation of the workers concerned and the level of production achieved, the agreement read.“On the successful resumption of work, food would be served to workers from the canteens located at the three HEC plants. Steps would be taken to address the problems faced by the workers regarding payment of school fees of their wards studying in various schools located in the HEC area. Requisite approvals have been received regarding the granting of promotions to workers. Necessary orders would be issued once all formalities are completed,” the bipartite agreement added.“The HEC has also given a verbal assurance to trade unions that it would neither invoke any pay cuts for the period of strike nor initiate any disciplinary action against the workers or trade union leaders for proceeding on strike, for which it would seek necessary approvals from its chairman-cum-managing director. The oral assurances are not a part of the written agreement signed today though we expect the HEC to honour its commitments to its workers,” Harendra Yadav, working president, Hatia Mazdoor Union affiliated to CITU, said. Regarding the payment of six months of unpaid wages, Yadav conceded that since HEC was faced with a serious liquidity crunch, it has decided to keep this issue in abeyance for some time until the situation improves.“The workers have returned to their workplaces since today morning. We shall review the situation again on February 15. In case HEC fails to keep its commitments, we shall be free to take any action that we may deem fit, including a return to strike,” Yadav clarified.The 40-day strike, which began on December 2 to demand immediate payment of unpaid wages for the past six months, had crippled production at all the three HEC plants and disrupted the delivery of finished goods, causing huge financial losses to the 58-year-old PSU.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/strike-at-hec-called-off-after-mgmt-promises-timely-wages/articleshow/88843050.cms||Tapas Biswas

I hope that this trend will continue for the near future and the Covid spread reduces,” Kejriwal said during a digital press briefing, adding that Covid patients currently occupy 1,500-2,000 hospital beds and the rest are in home isolation. “To aid the patients who are recovering at home, Delhi government has brought forward a one-of-a-kind programme,” he said. Kejriwal said Delhi government was starting special online yoga-pranayam classes for all those in home isolation. “We have prepared a huge team of instructors for this, who have been given specific training in asanas and practises related to Covid recovery,” he said. “I wouldn’t claim that they offer complete protection against the virus, but they definitely help one cope and recover more efficiently,” he said. A registration link will be sent to all patients in home isolation to choose a slot as the classes are to start from Wednesday.

It is far more paced up with the addition of active cases of pandemic virus than in initial months of surge in second wave, showed analysis of daily health bulletin. The active cases count in the district crossed 1000 on January 5, when 512 infections were reported in the day.

If this continues for even a couple of weeks, we will have a very high number of active cases creating issues including compromised management of comorbid patients in Covid-19 facilities”, said Hod respiratory medicine, MGM Dr Salil Bhargava.  Explaining it he said, “Last year, only 10% of 100 Covid-19 cases needed ICU and only 1 with virus infection was dying.” “But, because this time, the infection numbers are expected to soar very high, even with a lesser percentage of persons requiring ICU, we will match or surpass the absolute numbers of last year in the next couple of weeks”, Dr Bhargava said. “Now, in the case of comorbid patients like those suffering from heart ailment, renal issues test Covid-19 positive. The patients will be shifted to Covid-19 facilities, where he will get compromised care for his morbid condition increasing chances of severity and fatalities”, said Dr Bhargava. “The morbid patients suffered even during the second wave after Covid-19 infection. So, it is going to be a challenging task for health care workers, administration to manage this”, added Dr Bhargava.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/indore-taking-only-2-days-to-add-1000-active-covid-cases/articleshow/88843063.cms||Antriksh Singh

---||Indore||Industrial boilers may get a green makeover||Indore: In an effort to improve air quality of Indore, one of the non-attainment cities of the country, the district administration is contemplating to convert industrial boilers running on coal and diesel to Piped Natural Gas (PNG). A joint team of senior officials from Smart City, Pollution Control Board and Indore Municipal Corporation on Tuesday held a meeting with home grown drug manufacturers to advise them to switch to PNG for running boilers. The team also inspected a few facilities in Sanwer road using boilers and evaluated the pros and cons of alternate sources of energy. Indore is a hub for small and medium sized drug manufacturers while over 15 industries representing the IV segment uses boilers with coal and diesel as the primary source of energy. Himanshu Shah, president, MP Small Scale Drug Manufacturers Association said, “We were asked to convert the boilers to PNG. We are ready to convert as per the directions of the district administration. Small units with less capacity and likely to incur less expenses may be shifted first while large plants will take some time as it will be an expensive affair.” Drug manufacturers said the use of PNG will help in reducing pollution and escalate the cost of operations by over 10 per cent.Industries have urged for reduction in VAT on PNG and subsidised rate of supply to industries. A drug manufacturer Amit Chawla said, “We have assured the administration to convert boilers to PNG. This will not only reduce pollution but it will be cheaper for them who use electricity for boilers.Officials from the gas supply company proposed to lay the pipelines in industrial areas.Indore Smart City CEO Rishabh Gupta sought suggestions from industries on converting the source of energy and inspected a few boilers in factories running on diesel.Gupta also directed officials to assist industries in teething problems likely to be faced during the initial transition phase.Gupta also instructed the gas supply company to carry a survey in the industrial area and present a report on pipeline installation.

Before going for disconnection drive, we have given sufficient notices to all defaulters and have also informed the heads of departments and agencies,” he said. He said as these defaulters have failed to pay the arrears, the interest to arrears has increased over the years. “It is the responsibility of the government departments and local bodies to pay the bills. To avoid this problem, we are introducing prepaid meters by 2025. By 2023, the meters will be installed at to all commercial establishments and the first target will be government offices. The power for Gundlupet sub-registrar office was disconnected for not paying arrears and they have agreed to pay,” he said adding that defaulters must pay arrears and also reconnection charges to get power supply back.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/cesc-to-start-mopping-up-dues-from-govt-depts/articleshow/88843071.cms||Lakshmikantha BK

The tigers, which are territorial animals, cannot be let back into the forest again.Almost every tiger or leopard that has been rescued from the forest, has either killed cattle or caused fear in residents due to being sighted.

So we are creating awareness among people to fight against corruption,” he said, adding every year, the social welfare department is spending about Rs 70,000 crore for the welfare of the poor.“Despite spending such a huge amount, poverty cannot be eradicated. This is due to the corruption across government departments. As public representatives get elected by distributing money and gifts during elections, people cannot even approach them. So voters must elect their representative who is not corrupt and who fights for their cause,” he said.Later, Samithi members received complaints from the public.

Police have ruled out any foul play in his death. Abhishek, 31, of Valmiki Nagar in KR Nagar, was found dead in his room early in the day.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna said builders would be liable to refund the money if the homebuyers were forced to pay higher taxes and water charges arising from the lack of an occupancy certificate. It set aside the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which had turned down homebuyers’ plea against a builder and held they should approach against the authorities which are charging higher taxes. The SC passed the order on a plea of Mumbai-based Samruddhi Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. Advocate Sunil Fernandes said homebuyers were living in the society for 25 years without occupation certificate and had to pay 25% higher property taxes and 50% higher water charges. The builder said the plea was barred by limitation as the cause of action arose in 1997 when they took possession but the complaint was filed 18 years later.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/builder-liable-to-pay-damages-for-occupation-certificate-delay-sc/articleshow/88843052.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The HC order says CBI is free to approach the court if it needs any further direction to complete a fair and independent investigation.Vishwanath Nair was found beaten and stabbed to death in his farmhouse. Local police arrested five suspects, four of them minors, and claimed loot was the motive. They say Nair was murdered because he woke up during the robbery. His family, however, feels many aspects of the case have gone uninvestigated.Nair was the nephew of Prabha Devi, the Rajmata of the princely state of Kawardha and a two-time MLA from Kawardha constituency -- 1977 to 1980 for Akhil Bharatiya Ramrajya Parishad and 1985 to 1990 for Congress. She was a highly influential person, with property worth crores, says the petition, which names the Rajmata’s son Yogeshwar Raj Singh and his wife Kirti Devi Singh as respondents.The writ petition says there were major differences between the Rajmata and her son Yogeshwar, and that she was quite close to her nephew Vishwanath Nair. It says the Rajmata executed a will, transferring all her property to both her daughters and Vishwanath, but not giving any share to Yogeshwar.After the Rajmata’s death, her daughters reposed the same faith in Vishwanath Nair for managing and administering not only their properties but also that of Rajmata’s, says the petition.The petitioners submitted that during the investigation, they informed police about the ‘animosity’ between Nair and the two respondents, but the cops didn’t probe this angle. The petition claims there are many lacunae in the investigation to “shield the real culprit”.The petitioners say they repeatedly urged police to gather call details of the five suspects, who were arrested, and the two respondents, but in vain. They allege that state police “overlooked many facts and did not conduct the investigation in a fair manner”.The high court, in its order, took note of the ‘previous animosity within the family’ and the fact that a large amount of property is involved. There is apprehension that the investigation may be influenced, the court said, and handed the case to CBI to be “investigated in a fair and independent manner”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/hc-hands-royal-family-murder-probe-to-cbi/articleshow/88843090.cms||---

---||Raipur||Wild buffaloes translocation: HC notice to Centre, CG, Assam||Raipur: Chhattisgarh high court has issued notices to the Centre, the governments of Chhattisgarh and Assam, and chief wildlife wardens of both these states on a writ petition that seeks return of two wild buffalos, arguing that their translocation from Assam and captivity here is illegal.A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Naresh Kumar Chandravanshi, issued the notices on a PIL filed by environment activist Singhvi, and directed that replies be filed within four weeks.Seeking intervention of the court against the captivity of wild buffaloes translocated from Manas National Park in Assam to Barnawapara Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh, the PIL said that the Asiatic wild buffalo – the state animal of Chhattisgarh and a Schedule-I animal -- is a highly endangered species with only six males left in Chhattisgarh. According to forest department data, there were 67 wild buffaloes in 2005 but by the next year, it had plunged to 12.With conservation plans failing and the wild buffalo population continuing to dwindle, Chhattisgarh sought permission to translocate wild buffaloes from Assam. The petition points out that though wild buffaloes from Central India and Assan belong to the family of Bubalis Bubalis arnee, they have a different gene pool.In September 2018, in-principle permission was granted to capture, translocate and rehabilitate five female wild buffaloes under Section 12 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act,1972. In March 2020, permission was granted for a male wild buffalo too.The PIL argues that permission was granted to translocate the animal but not to keep it in captivity. At present, a male and a female wild buffalo have been translocated from Manas to Barnawapara Sanctuary.Pointing out that these Schedule-1 animals have been kept in captivity without authority, the PIL says that the authorities have “very conveniently put the animals in an enclosure and the state government has no plan to release the wild buffaloes or their progeny back in the wild”. “Clearly, the government intends to keep them in captivity,” the petition says.“If any animal like the wild buffalo is kept in captivity for a long time, they turn into domestic buffaloes and the progeny of domestic buffaloes are also domestic by nature and it is very difficult to rehabilitate them in wild,” it says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/wild-buffaloes-translocation-hc-notice-to-centre-cg-assam/articleshow/88843093.cms||---

---||Raipur||ADG GP Singh arrested in Delhi over sedition & assets cases||Raipur: The Chhattisgarh Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Tuesday arrested ADG Gurjinder Pal Singh, a 1994-batch IPS officer, who is under suspension and faces charges under Prevention of Corruption Act and is also accused of sedition and promoting enmity. “A team of ACB-EOW has arrested the IPS officer in Delhi. He is being brought to Raipur by flight tonight,” an Anti-Corruption Bureau press release said on Tuesday night, adding that Singh had not responded to notices. The IPS officer has been under suspension since July last year, following a raid on his premises.Around a week ago, the Supreme Court had turned down his plea for a stay on his arrest and the investigation into cases registered against him. He had moved SC after Chhattisgarh high court rejected his plea for relief.In July last year, the Anti-Corruption Bureau and EOW had raided the residence and other premises of Singh, who had earlier headed the same agencies. The searches went on for three days and assets worth Rs 10 crore and Rs 16 lakh in cash were recovered, along with several documents, the agencies had said. He was booked in a disproportionate assets case.On July 10, less than a week after the anti-corruption raid, the IPS officer was booked on charges of sedition as well. The FIR was filed at Raipur Kotwali police station around midnight under IPC 124A (sedition) and 153A (promoting enmity). Police didn’t make a copy of the FIR public, saying it’s a sensitive case.Later, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel explained that the sedition case and the other charges were registered against Singh on the basis of documents seized by ACB during the raids. A minister hinted at a “conspiracy to destabilise the government”. The IPS officer then moved high court, alleging that he was being victimized. He sought a probe by an “independent agency, like CBI”, into the sedition case against him but he did not get relief, either in HC or the apex court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/adg-gp-singh-arrested-in-delhi-over-sedition-assets-cases/articleshow/88843096.cms||---

The actor-politician, responding to TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s recent comments that he was open to a tie-up with any party including the Jana Sena to defeat the YSRC in the 2024 elections, asked his party men not to fall into the trap of other parties who are playing mind games.During a teleconference with his party’s executive committee members, Pawan said his main focus now is to strengthen the party at the grass roots level. “We should focus on forming committees and taking the party’s ideology to the public. We are in alliance with the BJP and everyone should work with them. Though many political parties are trying for an alliance with us, this is not the time to think of alliance. I appeal to party workers not to become pawns in the political mind game being played by other parties,” he said.He added that he will not take any alliance-related decision without consulting his party’s senior leaders, district presidents, and political affairs committee. Naidu, during his road show in Kuppam last week, hinted at an alliance with Jana Sena. “When you love a girl, it is not correct to insist her for marriage. Love should be from both sides, one-sided love never works. Similarly, the alliance with Jana Sena is possible only if Pawan Kalyan thinks and accepts,” he had said. Meanwhile, BJP state president Somu Verraju said Naidu is capable of building alliances with anyone for his benefit. “He was in alliance with the Congress, BJP, and Left parties but betrayed all of them after coming to power ,” Verraju said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/our-alliance-is-only-with-bjp-says-jana-sena-chief-pawan/articleshow/88843104.cms||Venu Lanka

In one such incident, a sand laden dumper attempted to run over the police vehicle, which was chasing of the dumper on Sunday night.Alert police team, however, foiled their bid to harm them and succeeded in getting hold of two vehicles of the mafia including the dumper and arresting three persons. A case against them has been filed in Banar police station under relevant sections of IPC. As per Banar SHO Sitaram Khoja, he spotted a sand laden dumper while he was on his way to the police station on Sunday night. When he signalled the vehicle to stop, the driver, instead of responding to the signal, tried to speed away. He began to chase the dumper. The speeding dumper also attempted to hit and run over the police vehicle. An escort vehicle covering the dumper also tried to block the way of the police. In spite all this, the police succeeded in intercepting the dumper a little distance away and asked the driver to get down.“While we were interrogating the driver, the escorting vehicle suddenly stopped, and its driver quickly sat on the driver’s seat of the dumper. Sensing his intentions, we threw tyre blasters in front of the dumper to deflate the tyres,” said Khoja.Cops again chased the dumper and after travelling 20 kms they arrested both the drivers,Pukhraj and Rakesh and seized the vehicles.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Archaeology dept to renovate 9th-century stepwell in Pali||JAIPUR: The department of archaeology and museums (DAM) has decided to renovate a 9th- century unprotected five-storey stepwell dated back to the Chauhan Dynasty (800-1300 AD), which ruled Sojat in Pali. Following a campaign by the villagers, the team from Jodhpur and Jaipur, which inspected the site located at Savrad village in Sojat City near Ramdev Temple on Monday, expressed urgent attention and action to protect the crumbling structure. The architecture of the stepwell is expected to be much older than the one found in Merta (Nagaur) and Chand Baori - Abhaneri (Dausa). “The five-storey structure is constructed in a unique Rajput style with idols of local deities placed at every storey which is called Toran Dwar. The first four-storey is divided into three parts. It is a classic example of highly decorated wells meant to showcase the architectural excellence,” said Imran Ali, Superintendent DAM, Jodhpur circle. As per the inspection, the building is divided into five parts to accurately calculate the volume of water filled in the well. The officials have calculated the height, width and collected samples of the structure to present their case for renovation. The locally available red stone has been used in the construction and carvings were done using the geometrical skill. Other officials claimed that the structure is not in its original form as it appears that it was renovated more than once with the availability of different construction materials. Chandra Shekhar Sharma, an associate professor of History, Meera Girls College in Udaipur, also an expert on the Chauhan Kingdom, said “The structure testifies the golden era of the Chauhan Kings who had the habit of leaving an indelible mark of their knowhow of architecture, culture and religion even on a very common structure. Fortunately, the well is still preserved due to its proximity to an ancient temple, otherwise it would have been deeply buried like many other architectural marvels.” He argued that an inscription containing the details of the structure may still be present on a stone or a wall of the building, which is crucial to trace its right timeline and origin. However, the locals claim the structure to be nine-storey tall while the officer found it to be only a five-storey building. The priest of the local temple, Manak Prajapath told TOI, “I have seen the building divided into nine parts with sometimes water filled to the top for almost four months in a year. We have been campaigning for years to declare the site as protected, which now seems to be happening.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/archaeology-dept-to-renovate-9th-century-stepwell-in-pali/articleshow/88843108.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Growing gun culture in Dholpur over tiffs||Jaipur: A minor tiff between two groups over a piece of land took an ugly turn when a 30-year-old man was shot dead by armed assailants in Dholpur on Monday.According to the Nandanpur police, the incident happened between two groups at Vijay ka Pura, who were at loggerheads for a long time over a piece of land.“During early hours, at least six armed assailants including Vishnu, Siaram, Gyan Singh and Kalla entered a farm where the victim Raju (30) was watering the crops. When the victim resisted the assailants from damaging the crops, he was thrashed with batons and iron rods. Later they opened fire and fled from the scene after killing Raju,” said a Nandanpur police official on Tuesday.Such attacks over trivial issues and confrontations are becoming common in Dholpur, Karauli and Bharatpur districts due to easy availability of illegal weapons. It may be recalled that a doctor couple was also shot dead by armed assailants in broad daylight last year.Senior police officers in Dholpur admitted that minor disputes do end up in violent confrontations and people in this region take pride in keeping illegal weapons. “We had organized a campaign for crackdown on illegal weapons. As we are close to the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh borders, people also bring illegal weapons from these states,” said a senior Dholpur police official.In a similar incident a youth was attacked and later shot at Kotara Dehar village under Sadar police station in Karauli. “The victim Satish (26) sustained bullet injuries on his thighs. It was found that earlier his family had attacked the group, which assaulted him in retaliation,” said a police officer. Talking about the rampant gun battles in the region, SP Karauli, Shailendra Indoliya, said, “Yes it is true that use of illegal weapons is rampant in Karauli and other nearby districts. We have made a result oriented strategy and will ensure a crackdown on the use of illegal arms in the region.”In yet another incident on January 9, two bike-borne assailants looted a youth’s gold chain and opened fire.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/growing-gun-culture-in-dholpur-over-tiffs/articleshow/88843110.cms||Ashish Mehta

The forest land was under encroachment for the past 20 years, claimed forest officials.Deputy conservator of forest G K Verma said that joint team of 125 staff of the district administration and forest department carried out a special campaign to remove the encroachments in two days.Verma said that during the encroachment at Karahjod, illegal farming was being done for the last 15-20 years. Encroachers had put up fencing and pillars and other construction were demolished to remove it, the officer said.Three months ago in a survey by the forest department it was found that the land in Karahjod and Kalyan Ghat belonged to the department. Following this, the department gave notices to the encroachers but the land was not vacated. Instead, crops were sown, the officials claimed. Verma said that the team made the land plain by running tractors and JCB. The land will be useful for cattle of this area as it is fertile and during monsoon grass will grow which will provide fodder for the cattle.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/30cr-forest-land-freed-from-encroachment-near-jaisalmer/articleshow/88843115.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cops yet to identify owners of Gupta era gold coins in Tonk||JAIPUR: Tonk police is yet to determine the ownership of 207 gold coins of the Gupta period (2-4th century), which were discovered in Jankipura village near Malpura in Tonk district in 2016. The ancient treasure trove that was claimed by the department of archaeology and museums (DAM) in 2017 is locked up at the police lines in Tonk. Due to lack of coordination between the departments, non-clarity in rules and the cumbersome process, the ancient gold coins with fascinating inscriptions, which could have shed more light on the bygone era, failed to find its rightful custodian. Prince Uppal, numismatist, DAM, Jaipur told TOI who has written to the local administration in Tonk several times, “As per the Rajasthan Treasure Trove act, the office has requested the police to expedite the investigation and sought the ownership of the coins but in vain.” Many locals fled with the gold coins that were discovered in December 2016 by some labourers working in the local mine. It took the Diggi Police in Tonk 10 months to recover 207 gold coins before closing the chase. As per the rule, the local police have to deposit the coins at the police line till they find the owner of the coins. “The first point of contact is the owner of the site. Once the police verify that the coins don’t belong to any individual or a family, they hand them over to the local treasury office. Thereafter, the district collector has to declare it ownerless and hand it over to the DAM,” said Neeraj Tripathi, Circle Superintendent, Ajmer Division. Om Prakash, SP Tonk told TOI, “The gold coins are kept at the police line. I will check the status and expedite the police investigation in the case so that it can be moved to the treasurer's office.” The total weight of the coins is more than 1.4 kgs but their value cannot be measured economically. Zafarullah Khan, retired superintendent, DAM with expertise in coins, said, “Once the coin is acquired by our department, it undergoes thorough research, documentation and cataloguing. The report is shared with all major research institutes for scholars. Finally, the coins are kept in the museum for the general public.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cops-yet-to-identify-owners-of-gupta-era-gold-coins-in-tonk/articleshow/88843116.cms||---

More than 1,000 children required counselling for academic issues, which had cropped up during the pandemic. While 44% of the counselled callers were children between 12 and 18 years, 24% parents were among those councelled. The maximum number of callers were from Dungarpur with over 900 calls. Till last year, the helpline worked six days a week but from this year it will be operational between 10am and 7pm on all days.Umeed helpline aka Mental Health and Pyscho Social Support Plus (MHPSS +) helpline can be accessed by using the toll-free number 0141-4932233. Ramakanta Satapathy, manager of child protection, Save the Children, Rajasthan said, “This is the first helpline that provides counselling as well as intervention to the callers if they require it. Looking at the trend, it shows that there is a need for the helpline. Most of the callers originated from districts where awareness was spread about the helpline. While calls related to academic concerns, internet use were received from most districts, from Tonk we got calls about lack of availability of sanitary napkins”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/childline-umeed-got-4000-calls-last-year/articleshow/88843117.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Over 90% samples sent for genome sequencing test Omicron positive||JAIPUR: The current surge in Covid-19 cases is driven by Omicron, as 92 per cent samples sent for the genome sequencing last week tested positive for the variant. The weekly positive rate has increased to 5.26 per cent due to the spread of the virus at a fast pace. “Though Omicron is spreading in the state, people need not to worry much. But, they need to remain cautious and follow the guidelines issued by the centre and the state from time to time,” Parsadi Lal Meena, health minister told TOI. The weekly genome sequencing report last week showed 71 per cent of the samples tested positive for the variant. Around five weeks ago, the variant, which was dominating in the state, was Delta as 75.7 per cent samples sent for genome sequencing tested positive for it, 15.37 per cent tested positive for Delta like variant. With Omicron leading the current positivity rate, the health authorities are now focusing more on Covid testing for identifying the cases early to prevent its spread further. Health secretary Vaibhav Galriya held a video conferencing on Tuesday directing the officials to collect more Covid samples for testing. “The more tests will be conducted, the earlier we will be able to control the spread of the virus,” said Galriya. In the meeting, health department officials from across the state, principal and controller of medical colleges, chief medical health officers took part. The health department has alerted the microbiologists to remain prepared as sample collection will be increased in coming days. There should be no shortage of manpower. In remote areas, the health department officials will intensify Covid surveillance too. In the state, 532 medical oxygen plants are proposed, out of which, 473 have started functioning. The rest of them will be commissioned soon, said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/over-90-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing-test-omicron-positive/articleshow/88843118.cms||---

Decks were almost cleared for the rooster fights across the state as many politicians have reportedly given green signal to organise not only rooster fights but also various gambling activities at the cockfight venues. According to punters, betting would be more this time than previous two years . It may cross Rs Rs 400 crore as against the Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore last year. “Big arenas have already been set up at various places in both Godavari districts and Krishna, besides Vizag, Prakasam, Guntur, and Nellore districts,” says a punter from West Godavari district. Rooster fights would take place in a big way only in Godavari districts and Krishna. Despite all this, rooster fights would go on during the three days of Sankranti. The West Godavari police have already bound over more than 3,700 people and seized 4,117 rooster knives (to be tied on the legs of the roosters during the fighting), besides serving notices on 355 people who were involved in the rooster fights in the past few years. “We have already put the teams on the job. Joint teams are pressed into action. Our teams focus on arrack sale, lodges and hotels,” West Godavari SP Rahul Dev Sarma told TOI.  “We are promoting sports such as volleyball, cricket, kabaddi and others under ‘Sampradaya Sankranti Kreedalu’. Women constables are creating awareness among the women in villages,” East Godavari SP M Ravindra Babu said.

The upcoming 300MW GIS powered facility, scalable to 700MW, is being set up at the 2 million sq ft CtrlS Datacenter Campus that is currently under construction in Navi Mumbai, top officials of the company told TOI. While four of the data centres in the Navi Mumbai cluster are already operational, the remaining are expected to be operational by 2024.Sources said the company is investing about $100 million in deploying GIS technology to power all its upcoming data center campuses spread across a total 5 msft across the country over the next 24 months.This includes the 2msft cluster under construction at Mahape, Navi Mumbai, another 2msft campus powered by 300MW GIS spread across 40 acres that is ready for construction in Hyderabad and a 1msft facility (200MW GIS) is planned in Chennai, CtrlS Datacenters vice president BS Rao said, adding that by 2024 the company will be operating about 6msft of data center space across India powered by over 1GW of power.Pointing out that India is emerging as one of the largest datacenter hubs in the world, Sridhar Pinnnapureddy, founder & CEO, CtrlS Datacenters, said, “The total power capacity currently deployed by the data center industry in India is over 650MW. However, we at CtrlS alone are now doubling the industry power capacity to address the growing needs of hyperscalers, telcos, BFSI, healthcare, gaming, and new age companies.”While GIS was first developed between 1968-72, it is more expensive than conventional air insulated substations (AIS). However, it occupies 10 times less space than AIS, requires much lower maintenance, offers better protection of parts from deterioration due to atmospheric air, moisture and contamination and a longer service life, CtrlS added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ctrls-to-deploy-1-2gw-gas-insulated-substations-to-power-data-centers/articleshow/88841314.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Three leopard cubs spotted with mom at Jhalana forest||JAIPUR: Five-year old leopardess, ‘Sharmili’ was recently spotted with her second litter of three cubs in the Jhalana forest, said officials, who claimed it to be the first sighting of the new cubs this year. The cubs, which appeared to be a couple of months old, were spotted with their mother at the watering hole in zone 3 of the forest following which monitoring has been enhanced in the area. Earlier, Sharmili, the daughter of leopardess Aarti had given birth to two cubs. With this, the counting of Jhalana leopards now stands at 43 compared to earlier figure of 44. Explaining this reduction in number despite the birth of three cubs who are around two months old, forest ranger Janeshwar Chaudhary said, “Till last August, there were 44 leopards in Jhalana. However two of the big cats ventured into other parts of the forest. Later one died and the other was transferred out. Therefore now we have a total of 43 leopards in Jhalana.” Last year, the female leopards gave birth to 12 cubs in Jhalana, taking the big cat population to 44, which dipped and rose again in the first month of this year. While the leopard population is increasing, recent study revealed that the density of leopards is too high for an urban jungle. With new cubs being regularly born, sub-adults are getting pushed out. In search of territory, these wild cats venture out and go missing or get killed in territorial fights. With the leopard population on an upward trajectory, there is an expected spill over to adjoining areas of the reserve. Ideally, one male leopard requires at least five sq km area. While the Jhalana forest area is spread over an area of 20 sq km, other forest areas, including Galta, which is over 700 hectares, are also being developed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/three-leopard-cubs-spotted-with-mom-at-jhalana-forest/articleshow/88843120.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Avoid antiviral drugs without medical prescription: Doctors||JAIPUR: As more than 98 per cent of the Covid-19 cases are taking treatment under home isolation, patients have been advised to take proper medication under the supervision of medical practitioners rather than self-medication. Doctors suggest avoiding antiviral drugs, which they had taken during the second wave. Only on medical prescription, such medicines should be consumed. The latest corona variant is expanding at an alarming rate since the beginning of the year. Though less number of hospitalisations is a sigh of relief, those under home treatment must follow all safety measures strictly, said the doctors. Dr Ankit Bansal, consultant, pulmonology and critical care at a private hospital said, “Those who have tested Covid positive, should maintain home isolation strictly for at least seven days. It is to be noted that in the last three days, the patient should be febrile (without fever) since Omicron has three times more infectivity than Delta. Secondly, the patient should regularly monitor their temperature and oxygen levels. Oxygen should be monitored every six hours while temperature should be checked every four hour.” He further adds that the patient should be adequately hydrated. Those with heart and kidney diseases should consult their doctor regarding the water intake but the healthy individuals should stay hydrated. “For fever, one can take Paracetamol but the antivirals should be taken only after doctor consultation. Medicines such as Molnupiravir are available in the market but it depends from case to case,” said Dr Bansal. The doctors are also advising Covid patients at home to take supportive treatment, such as steam for cold and gargles for sore throat. Even if a woman is tested positive after giving birth at a hospital, they are discharged to take home isolation treatment. “We conduct Covid test before c-sections and if the woman is tested positive, she stays in the hospital for three days. But, after three days, if she has mild symptoms or is asymptomatic, she can be discharged to take further treatment under home isolation,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, Covid incharge at Mahila Chikitsalaya. She added that they are prescribing medicines such as paracetamol and in some cases azithromycin in mild Covid cases under home isolation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/avoid-antiviral-drugs-without-medical-prescription-doctors/articleshow/88843123.cms||---

However, as far as the availability and sale of Chinese manjha, which is actually a plastic wired manjha, is concerned the traders are ‘selective’ in their sale. They are not selling it openly but are giving these to their ‘trusted’ and ‘selected' customers. As Jaipur police had issued orders under Section 144 of CrPC to ban the sale and purchase of manjhas, IPC gives them power to take action against those disobeying the order. TOI on Tuesday visited the Walled City markets to analyse the sale of manjhas, especially the Chinese manjha. "We have stopped keeping it since 2019 when police had lodged FIRs against the traders. Also in past a few years deaths were reported in the city in which plastic manjha got stuck in the neck and cut the throat badly which had proved fatal. Thus, we are only selling the regular manjha but not the plastic manjha," said Narendra Saini, a wholesale trader of kites and manjhas at Handipura locality. However, when asked if any customer is ready to pay whatever price is quoted for plastic manjha, a wholesale trader at Walled City on the condition of anonymity said, "Some customers ask for it. We don’t keep plastic coated manjhas at the shop but make them available". When contacted, Haidar Ali Jaidi, additional commissioner of police, law and order, said, "Anyone found disobeying an order of public servant could be booked under Section 188 of IPC. Like every year we have made some cases. But people should also understand that they should avoid using this dangerous manjha that can be fatal. " However, senior police officers stated that even the public representatives ask the police to withdraw cases. "Last year, we had lodged 14 FIRs but some public representatives came and asked us to withdraw four cases," said a senior officer on the condition of anonymity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-traders-sell-chinese-manjha-only-to-trusted-customers/articleshow/88843124.cms||---

Kite sellers at Handipura, Haldiyon Ka Rasta, Kishanpole Bazaar and other areas stated that though the sale has picked up, it is not as good as it used to be during pre-Covid times and that too when merely three days are left for Makar Sankranti. Also, the rising prices of kites have not deterred the kite lovers. TOI on Tuesday visited the Walled City markets to capture the mood, customers, kite sellers and the old Ustaads (masters) of kite flying. "We started selling the kites from December and believed that this time we will have good sale as during the first week the Covid cases were not much.

However, Tuesday has been good so far as good number of customers visiting since morning," said Abdul Saagir, a kite seller from Bareilly who is selling kites at Handipura in the Walled City of Jaipur. Traffic connecting Chandpole to Choti Chaupar, Choti Chaupar to Badi Chaupar and Ajmeri Gate to Kishanpole was chaotic as large number of people came to buy kites. "Just some days are left. Since it is lunchtime at office I am here to get 5 kaudi (one kaudi has 20 kites) kites and 12 gatta (one gatta has 1000 metres of manjha) for my family. Prices are very high compared to previous years," said Jaidev Jain, who works in a courier company. Traders stated that kites are almost 40% expensive compared to 2020 because of abrupt weather conditions in December and first week of January. "We used to get 80,000 kites per day from the makers from Bareilly and Rampur of Uttar Pradesh but for the past one week we are getting only 35,000 to 45,000 kites per day. Prices have gone up but that has not deterred for the kite lovers," said 60-year-old Farhan Qureshi, a wholesale dealer of kites. The kite makers are expecting bumper sale in the coming days till January 13 evening.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/prices-of-kites-soar-40-this-year-as-sales-pick-up/articleshow/88843126.cms||---

Even as Hikal Ltd issued a statement claiming that the discharged chemical was not the same the same that had left the company’s premises in Taloja, DCB arrested were Mansukh Patel (50), head, sustainability and corporate affairs, Abhay Dandekar (48), general manager in-charge of supply chain and Machhindranath Gorhe (49), head of production division at Hikal. “Sodium hydro sulphide (dilute solution 16%) which is a non-hazardous chemical is generated at the Taloja plant of the company that was entrusted to Sangam Enviro Private Limited for processing and onward sale to the textile/cement sector.

An engineer-turned-entrepreneur, Prashant named the new equipment ‘Sarathi’ which not only saves money and time but also helps to minimise the burden of humans. Speaking to TOI, Prashant said, “The trolley can carry two LPG cylinders at a time. It will help avoid wear and tear of the cylinders and save money in maintaining the cylinders.” Prashant has invented many novel gadgets for Indian Oil Corporation and most of them are being used in its godowns and refilling plants across the country. The new patent’s maiden demonstration was done in an LPG agency in Washim district recently and it received great acclaim from the dealers and the corporation. Meanwhile, the chief working president Cornelia Roodlof Shofar of the office of German Patent and Trademark approved the new equipment and granted the global patent to Prashant. He got guidance from IOC sales officer Nilesh Thakre and chief zonal manager Anil Mehar. The equipment will soon be marketed across the country, said Prashant. Prashant gives the credit of his success to father Muralidharrao Dehankar a ‘Krushibhushan Puraskar’ recipient. An avid environmentalist Prashant has planted thousands of saplings under the social forestry scheme around Kalamb.

A heritage building in the old PWD complex, comprising four other edifices of the 50s and Liberation era, on Rua de Ourem creek is slowly being taken apart. Two ground floor buildings—built before Liberation—standing parallel with their back to the creek and facing the road had their roof removed and some columns razed by Wednesday evening. The building being demolished was part of Obras Publicas (now PWD) and was talked about as an iconic site for recreational activities after PWD offices were shifted from it some time ago. Under the initiative of smart cities mission, the work order was issued on December 13 last year for ‘restoration, refurbishment and interior design of the headquarters of Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd’ and is stipulated to be completed by December 12 this year. “We are appalled by what is happening. There is a need for the formation of a committee with the citizens of Panaji, who know the city, to protest such atrocious decisions. The government must listen to the people of Goa,” Armando Gonsalves, who founded Goa Forgiving, said. Heta Pandit of Goa Heritage Action Group said some of the monumental buildings of Panaji are being emptied overnight and abandoned without any repurpose. The Lyceum, High Court at Altinho, Old Goa Institute of Management building, Adil Shah Palace and others are on this list, she said. “In addition to the building housing the National Theatre, another landmark, the Praca de Comercio, which is known for its unique architectural style of being a circular building is also slated for demolition,” said Prajal Sakhardande of Goa Heritage Action Group. However, CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes told TOI that no order was issued by him for the demolition of the old PWD building. Historians and architects have demanded that conservationists be brought in to preserve such monuments that are tangible edifices. When the PWD offices were shifted from Obras Publicas, the department staff along with the Goa Government Employees’ Association objected, saying that they were being moved out only to make way for the Serendipity Arts Festival.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/to-make-panaji-smart-govt-begins-demolishing-heritage-bldgs-in-city/articleshow/88863494.cms||Paul Fernandes

A 30% decline in revenue collection of the Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (NMPML) has been registered in the last one week due to the drop in passenger footfall. According to an NMPML official, the daily average footfall of passengers in city buses has declined from 55,000 to 42,000 during the last seven days between January 3 and 9. Moreover, during the same period, the daily average earnings of the NMPML through sale of tickets and bus passes has reduced from Rs 15 lakh per day to Rs 11 lakh. “The footfall and daily average income has reduced due to the pandemic. Cases of Covid-19 started increasing from the last week of December, but of late the numbers have spiked multi-fold. This has reflected in our daily footfall of passengers and daily average earning through city bus service,” the official said. The official further added the government had announced closure of schools for classes I to IX. As a result, the income through students’ bus passes has dropped from Rs 1.25 lakh per day to Rs 10,000 per day. The civic body has deployed two private agencies on the basis of procuring, operating, maintaining and managing city buses. Both the agencies have procured a total of 250 buses — 200 CNG and 50 diesel. The CNG buses are 48- seater and diesel buses are 28-seater. The NMPML started rolling out city bus service from the first half of July with a fleet of 27 buses on 11 select routes. During the last five-and-a-half months, the NMPML has deployed 150 buses on 42 different routes in the city in phases. The transport wing is yet to deploy additional 100 CNG buses due to lack of CNG supply from the MNGL.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/drop-in-revenue-footfall-of-nmpml-buses/articleshow/88843157.cms||---

The actor-politician, responding to TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s recent comments that he was open to a tie-up with any party including the Jana Sena to defeat the YSRC in the 2024 elections, asked his party men not to fall into the trap of other parties who are playing mind games. During a teleconference with his party’s executive committee members, Pawan said his main focus now is to strengthen the party at the grass roots level. “We should focus on forming committees and taking the party’s ideology to the public. We are in alliance with the BJP and everyone should work with them. Though many political parties are trying for an alliance with us, this is not the time to think of alliance. I appeal to party workers not to become pawns in the political mind game being played by other parties,” he said. He added that he will not take any alliance-related decision without consulting his party’s senior leaders, district presidents, and political affairs committee. Naidu, during his road show in Kuppam last week, hinted at an alliance with Jana Sena. “When you love a girl, it is not correct to insist her for marriage. Love should be from both sides, one-sided love never works. Similarly, the alliance with Jana Sena is possible only if Pawan Kalyan thinks and accepts,” he had said. Meanwhile, BJP state president Somu Verraju said Naidu is capable of building alliances with anyone for his benefit. “He was in alliance with the Congress, BJP, and Left parties but betrayed all of them after coming to power ,” Verraju said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/our-alliance-is-only-with-bjp-says-jana-sena-chief-pawan/articleshow/88840626.cms||Venu Lanka

The institutes are testing all primary and secondary contacts of the infected students. On both the campuses, the infected students are asymptomatic and fully vaccinated, sources said. Dr T Gangadhar, the director of Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) in Ballari told TOI that 31 students tested positive first and after testing their primary contacts, “we found 24 more students positive on Monday. A total of 55 students are now infected in the institute,” he said. The students have no travel history and may have contracted the virus while treating patients in hospitals, he said. “We have sealed the 19th and 28th blocks in the hostel where the infected students were staying. As all infected students are asymptomatic, they are isolated and quarantined in the Covid care centre,” he added. “We have also intensified the checking of staff and teachers and we have sent 293 samples for testing. Results of some are awaited,” the director said. PS Bhusaraddi, the director of the Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), said in the last three days, 10 students tested positive. They have no travel history and are asymptomatic. “We have tested all 900 students, including primary and secondary contacts of infected students, and all reports are negative.

---||Hubballi||Will Cong take up Krishna, Mahadayi issues too?||Hubballi: While Congress embarks on a 168-km padayatra from Mekedatu (Sangam) to Bengaluru, residents of the Krishna and Malaprabha river basins wonder why the leaders are not taking out a padayatra for Upper Krishna and Kalasa-Banduri Nala projects. They recall that Siddaramaiah had come to power by holding padayatra from Hosapete to Kudalasangam in 2013. They also hold Congress, BJP and JD(S) responsible for backwardness of the river basin.GC Muttaladinni, convenor, Krishna Teera Mulugade Santrastara Kshemabhivruddhi Samsthe, told TOI that all governments, irrespective of party affiliation, have neglected the UKP. “However, there was a considerable progress in the project during the tenure of HD Deve Gowda, SM Krishna and JH Patel. Now, whether it is Congress or BJP, they should try to remove all the nine conditions put for Karnataka in the second verdict of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal. Then only the state can utilise 130tmc of Krishna mainstream water. Irony is that none is demanding a gazette notification. Keeping all these issues aside, Congress is on Mekedatu padayatra. In fact, commoners should agitate and it should be supported by political parties like how it had happened at Krishna river basin in 2004. After Siddaramaiah’s sanction of maximum of Rs 8,000 crore in for years for the UKP, neither Congress-JD(S) coalition nor BJP government has shown any interest in the last four years,” he analysed.However, he said Congress padayatra can draw the attention of the state government at least to show some minimum interest.Vijay Kulkarni, president, Kalasa-Banduri Horata Samiti, said that he welcomes if Congress or any party holds padayatra demanding implementation of Mahadayi and Kalasa-Banduri nala project. “We had approached Congress government between 2013-18 demanding Bhoomi Puja for the project. However, Sonia Gandhi said in Goa that her party won’t let a single drop of water of Mahadayi for Karnataka. It shows that irrigation projects have become an election stunt for all parties. We wonder how Congress is holding padayatra for Mekedatu for which no estimation, project report or dam is ready. While Kalasa-Banduri project has everything ready it’s only the lack of political will of North Karnataka politicians in implementing it. Whether they are in BJP, Congress or JD(S), they are all negligent about our project and that is why Congress, which is currently an opposition party, is focusing on Mekedatu.

The general condition provides if there is a wildlife sanctuary within 10 km of the project, the project will be treated as category A and require approval of ministry of environment, forest and climate change. There are two sanctuaries at a distance of 3.90 km and 1.6 km, Bir Shikargah and Khol-Hai-Raitan, the applicant had submitted.The tribunal was informed that the earlier environment clearance had expired on March 24, 2017. “Fresh one had been granted under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The project proponent applied for environment clearance on November 3, 2020, which was forwarded to SEAC, which accepted and SEIAA granted the clearance on January 5, 2021, which is illegal,” the applicant said.DG, Town and Country Planning has given approval for the projects, as revised building plans. When the matter came up for hearing before the tribunal on March 25, 2021, a joint committee of SEIAA and chief wildlife warden was directed to examine the matter and take action. When the authorities failed to comply, the applicant filed a plea before the tribunal seeking execution of the orders. The tribunal on June 15, 2021, directed SEIAA and chief wildlife warden to file a status report in the matter. When the matter came up for hearing before NGT, SEIAA sought time for constitution of a fresh committee. Miffed, NGT observed it could not find any justification for SEIAA stand. “If it has granted EC, it cannot plead lack of clarity. Grant of EC and lack of clarity are contradictions in terms. If it is not clear whether EC could be granted, we fail to understand how it is allowed to continue. In environmental issues, doubt about legality cannot be ground to permit a project,” the tribunal observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/environment-clearance-to-amravati-enclave-illegal-ngt/articleshow/88843170.cms||Ajay Sura

He addressed the concerns of Afghan students at a local university. On Tuesday, a special vaccination drive was conducted for Afghan students at the Sukhna Lake vaccination centre. Ambassador Farid Mamundzay was the chief guest on the occasion.The vaccination drive was conducted by United Sikhs and Karan Gilhotra Foundation in association with the UT health department along with ASR Foundation. Later, the ambassador interacted with media persons and expressed concern over the issues of Afghan students studying in Punjab. On the promise of 250 scholarships for Afghan students made by Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal, Mamundzay said, “I will speak to him personally and write to him formally, seeking the support of the state government as 250 is not such a huge number and you have so many students enrolled in these universities. So it can be managed easily, moreover we share a unique history with Punjab and I would request him to consider the same.”He said they have been in talks with the MEA but the process is slow and around 1,000 scholarships are awaited. He requested the Government of India to reconsider giving scholarships first to students on self-financed basis and secondly to those who have finished their bachelors and are looking forward to further studies. Mamundzay criticised the non-issuance of visas to students for security reasons saying that “they could not have become Taliban overnight.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/vax-drive-for-afghan-teens-at-sukhna/articleshow/88843178.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Designated gender officers needed to address violence against women’||PANAJI: The Goa Network on Gender Justice has once again demanded appointment of independent protection officers under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, as block development officers are already overloaded. The network, which comprises representatives of organisations dealing with women and child issues, will place its demands before all the political parties to be included in their election manifestos. It has also demanded appointment of designated gender officers to address violence against women, a one-stop crisis centre and helplines. “The office should be the nodal point for accessing justice, including assistance and link to services like social and legal counselling,” Sabina Martins representing the network said. The network is also seeking the setting up of a state-run shelter home for women in each taluka for those who are thrown out of their homes or who wish to get out of violent homes. “The shelter home should have space to house the belongings of women in the intervening period of resolution. In addition to this, free open shelters for women, at least in major towns like Vasco, Mapusa, Ponda and Margao, with proper arrangements for waiting rooms in the night for women and children near railway stations and bus stands and free drop services for women and girls in the night when public transport is not available are also necessary,” she further stated. The network has demanded quarterly meetings of police, NGOs and statutory bodies to address issues of long arduous hours for registering complaints and FIRs and conducting medical examination along with regular data collection on cases of domestic and sexual violence. This they said will help in framing policies to address the causes of the violence and prepare a plan of action. “Trained counsellors should be posted at police stations, hospitals and primary health care centres to provide social and legal counselling. Training programmes have to be conducted on a regular basis for capacity building of all officers and personnel to deal sensitively and effectively with cases of domestic violence and sexual violence,” Martins said. Stating that FIRs of crimes against women are often not registered or nominally registered without effective investigation and assistance from protection officers, shelter to those in distress and immediate social security support is not provided to the victims. The network has also said that reports of the State Commission for Women and Protection of Children should be presented regularly in the assembly. It said the independence of these human rights institutions be ensured through transparent selection process and appropriate defined financial allocation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/designated-gender-officers-needed-to-address-violence-against-women/articleshow/88841840.cms||---

---||Delhi||It’s official, Omicron variant fuelling January Covid surge in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The latest report of Covid-positive samples analysed in genome sequencing labs of Delhi proves what medical experts have been saying for some time — the massive surge in new cases is fuelled by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. Delhi has reported 546 Omicron cases till date, behind Maharashtra’s 1,247 and Rajasthan’s 645, which have added to the national tally of 4,461. In all, 1,711 patients have recovered from the disease, including 57 in the capital. The first Omicron case was reported in Delhi on December 6, when a 33-year-old man who had returned from Tanzania confirmed positive. In December, 1,553 Covid-positive samples were sent to laboratories for analysis, out of which 590 were of other variants, 533 (34%) were strains of the Delta variant and 430 (28%) Omicron. The 511 samples analysed between January 1 and 8 revealed the overwhelming presence of the Omicron variant, which was found in 402 (79%) of the samples. The Delta variant, which was till recently dominant, was found in 89 (17.4%) of the samples, while other variants were found in 20 (3.9%). While the overall presence of the Omicron variant in all samples analysed between December 1 and 31 was 28%, the genome sequencing data from December 25 to 30 revealed that half the samples were of Omicron. Out of 863 samples analysed during this period, 433 (50.2%) were of Omicron, 293 (34%) of Delta and 137 (15.8%) of other variants. Initially, Delhi government had announced that all Covid-positive samples would be analysed in genome sequencing laboratories, but the need was not felt when the number of cases spiralled as it was evident that most were Omicron cases, sources said. “People are demanding the Omicron test these days. But the information on Omicron is necessary only for the government and policy makers so that they can ensure the system works accordingly. Patients will not get to know anything new about the variant because the treatment and prevention process is exactly the same as the other variants,” health minister Satyendar Jain had stated earlier this month. While initially all cases of the Omicron variant were admitted in a designated isolation ward at Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital, later it was decided that only those whose symptoms were severe would be admitted to hospitals. The patients were moved to Covid Care Centres or paid isolation facilities in hotels, in case they opted for it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/its-official-omicron-fuelling-jan-covid-surge/articleshow/88841811.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||HC to 15 panchayats in Goa: No construction nods till you have material recovery facilities||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday restrained 15 panchayats from issuing construction licences till they construct material recovery facilities (MRFs) and make them functional. “It will be the responsibility of the director of panchayats to take strict action against such panchayats and their office bearers,” stated the division bench comprising justices Sadhana Jadhav and Manish Pitale. The court passed the directions after the report filed by the Goa Waste Management Corporation specifically stated that 15 village panchayats have failed to set up MRFs and don’t have any temporary facility for collection and storage of waste. These are the panchayats of Gaondongrim, Assolda, Xeldem, Naqueri-Betul, Morpila, Kalem,Tivrem-Orgao, Curti-Khandepar, Shiroda, Cundaim, Chinchinim-Deussua, Seraulim, Loutolim, Sarzora and Raia. The high court also directed that unpaid fines of Rs 5,000 each by nine panchayats be paid within four weeks personally by the sarpanches of Kalem, Netolim, Rivona, Cana-Benaulim, Loutolim, Carmona, Sao Jose de Areal, Navelim and Colva. The fines were imposed via an order dated February 10, 2021, for failing to comply with directions to set up the MRF and composting facility. “It is reiterated that if it is found that the said sarpanchas were not personally responsible for non-compliance, then suitable orders can be passed permitting the said sarpanches to recover the amount from the panchayat funds,” the high court stated. In the case of Nerul, the MRF has been constructed and made functional, but there was a representation received from the villagers of Nerul objecting to it being set up close to a school. “It appears that the said objection raised by the villagers of Nerul has been considered and the GWMC has reported that the MRF is in terms of the order of this court. In view of the same, it is recorded that the village panchayat of Nerul has complied with the directions of this court. Accordingly, the interim order restraining the village panchayat of Nerul from issuing construction licences stands vacated,” the high court stated. The court was told that the village panchayats of Amona and Arambol have set up MRFs and made them functional, and directed the corporation to conduct an inspection of the MRFs and place a report. CCP filed an affidavit stating it has been complying with the requirements of the Goa state pollution control board. The court asked 13 municipal councils to file affidavits on compliance within three weeks. A resident of Sancoale has raised certain issues concerning illegality in construction of MRF by the Sancoale village panchayat and the high court has given the panchayat an opportunity to respond.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-to-15-panchayats-no-construction-nods-till-you-have-material-recovery-facilities/articleshow/88863516.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGI to get OmiSure kits to detect new Covid variant||Chandigarh: As whole genome sequencing takes more than two weeks for the report to come, PGI will soon get OmiSure kits to detect the omicron variant of Covid-19 within two hours. This will be the first kit in the Tricity for early detection of random Covid samples. OmiSure is the first made-in-India kit for detection of omicron which cannot be picked up by RT-PCR test. OmiSure is approved by the ICMR which targets three genes with a single tube, fully multiplexed assay in a unique design that identifies simultaneous S-gene Target Failure and S-Gene Mutation Amplification. The kit evaluated in partnership with the ICMR reported 100 per cent sensitivity and 99.25 per cent specificity for detection of variants like omicron. “We are in the process of procuring these kits. This is not for research but to understand the trend which variant is circulating. The genome sequencing takes 10-15 days’ time,” said Prof Mini P Singh, virologist, PGI. Presently, the positivity rate in the city has crossed 14% and is above the national average. However, it is not known scientifically if it is the delta or the omicron variant which has increased the rate of infection. “Though it will not make a difference in clinical management, as the period of isolation and treatment remains the same, it will help in surveillance. We will take some samples randomly as it is not feasible to test all,” said Prof Mini. Chandigarh sends random Covid positive samples to National Centre for Disease Control Laboratory, Delhi, after every two weeks. Till date, there have been three cases of omicron as detected from the Delhi laboratory in the city. All these cases have tested negative after isolation and have been discharged. “The cost of these kits is between Rs 250 and Rs 300. The RT-PCR kits cost us Rs 30 and Rs 40. Therefore, all the samples cannot be tested for the variant,” said Prof Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/pgi-to-get-omisure-kits-to-detect-new-variant/articleshow/88843179.cms||Shimona Kanwar

In some schools, less than 100 students have been jabbed, according to sources. The final decision of vaccination will be of parents but it is duty of school heads to inform students about the facility, sources added.Garg on Monday had issued an order asking principals of all private and government schools to inform students about vaccination camps being organised on campus. In case principals don’t comply with these directions, action under provisions of The Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 will be taken against them, according to the order.The order stated It was found that in some schools where the vaccination camps were held, students were not informed, resulting in low turnout and vaccination figures. This led to wastage of the vaccine doses. “Though Covid vaccination is voluntary, it is our duty to inform every eligible child about the available option,” Garg mentioned through the order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/worry-over-low-vax-figures-in-schools/articleshow/88843180.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

With this, researchers are busy writing research papers under the supervision of their guides. This time, PEC has combined research with performance to increase the number of publications to give a boost to research.During the PEC senate meeting held a few days ago, its administration proposed that the institute be taken forward in every type of ranking, from NIRF. For this, research has to be linked with performance. The proposal was appreciated by Senate members and prolonged discussions were held. It was decided that as soon as a researcher enters second year to third year, he or she will have to write a high quality research paper.Researchers will be able to take help from their guide for this. PEC scholarship will also be given on the basis of this performance. The linking of scholarship with research has given added incentive to researchers. Talking to TOI, PEC director Baldev Setia said, “We want scholars to come forward and showcase their research work which can be used further.

Names doing the rounds include those of a senior BJP leader; a former UT administration official; a senior BJP leader’s wife; a former MC councillor; two office-bearers of Chandigarh BJP and a representative of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM). An architect and a businessman closely associated with the ruling BJP are also among the probables.While the BJP plans to adjust leaders who were denied ticket in the Chandigarh MC elections, the party is also checking whether these leaders supported the official party candidate or helped rivals. Although a case related to restoration of voting rights of nominated councillors is scheduled for hearing in the Supreme Count on January 18, it does not have any direct or indirect connection with announcement of the names. The Punjab and Haryana high court had removed voting rights of nominated councillors in 2017. Former councillor and senior BJP leader Satinder Singh challenged the decision, saying that there was no such provision in either rules or the Constitution. Later, the UT administration moved Supreme Court against the HC order.Sources said the administration had received many applications and BJP leaders and city MP were also discreetly involved in “recommending” names for nomination. The UT administrator is taking time to finalise the names. Case for more councillorsMany people are demanding increase in the number of nominated councillors from the existing nine to 12. Arguing for the increase, a senior political leader said that in the last MC house, there were 26 wards and nine nominated councillors. Now, the number of wards has increased to 35 and proportionately the number of nominated councillors should be increased to 12.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/parleys-on-for-posts-of-nominated-councillors/articleshow/88843184.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

A police spokesperson said that some anonymous persons, using the name of Kashmir Press Club, had released a statement on Monday about the arrest of Sajad Gul alias Dar of Hajin in Bandipora, stating that he be released and all charges against him be dropped. "The fact of the matter is that J&K Police on Saturday filed a chargesheet against one Sajad Ahmad Dar of Shahgund in Bandipora district for provoking people against the government and spreading enmity against the nation among people," the spokesperson said.Police said that Sajad Ahmad Dar, son of Ghulam Muhammad Dar of Shahgund in Hajin, runs a Twitter account in the name of Sajad Gul and is always in search of anti-government news and uploads tweets which are not based on facts in order to provoke people against the government and to spread enmity against the nation. "To this effect, a case under FIR number 12/2021 under sections 147, 447, 336, 353 of IPC stands registered against him and the final chargesheet against him has been produced before the court in Sumbal for judicial determination," police said. “The individual, Sajad Gul, by virtue of his false tweets, spread a fake narrative regarding the recent anti-militancy operation in Gundjahangeer in which one local militant, namely Imtiyaz Ahmad, was killed, thereby provoking locals against the army and the police. In this regard, a case under FIR number 79/2021 under sections 120B, 153B, 505 of IPC stands registered against him. The day most-wanted militant Saleem Parray was killed in Srinagar, Sajad had uploaded videos of anti-national slogans by some women, mostly relatives, thereby trying to disrupt peace.

---||Madurai||Consider application for freedom fighter’s family pension: HC||Madurai: Observing that there is no age restriction to declare a person as a freedom fighter as per the Madras Freedom Fighters’ Pension Rules,1966, the Madras high court has directed the Theni district collector to consider and pass orders on the application submitted by the wife of a freedom fighter seeking state government’s freedom fighters’ family pension.The court was hearing the petition filed by M Saiyedha Begum of Theni district. The petitioner’s husband Mohammed Sheriff, a freedom fighter was incarcerated in Allipuram camp jail in Bellary district in Karnataka between October 8, 1943 to April 11, 1944.The petitioner submitted an application seeking freedom fighter family pension. However, the authorities in 2017, rejected the application on the ground that her husband had not been granted pension and therefore, she was not eligible for the same.When the petitioner filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2017, a single bench set aside the rejection order and directed the authorities to consider the petitioner’s application.Following this direction, the petitioner had submitted another application and the same was rejected by the collector in 2019. Challenging the same, the petitioner had filed the present petition.Justice C V Karthikeyan said that the single bench in 2017 had given a categorical ruling that the petitioner was eligible for freedom fighter’s family pension and that her application cannot be rejected on the ground that her husband was not granted pension or not applied for grant of pension.The judge said that the earlier order of the single bench had not been taken on appeal and therefore, it is binding on the authorities. Unfortunately, the authorities seem to take pleasure in violating the ruling of law. The collector had once again rejected the grant of pension on the very same ground that her husband had not applied for pension.The judge said that the rejection order conveys no sense. It reflects deliberate bureaucrat refusal to understand that the collector owes his or her position only because of the sacrifices and the sufferings of freedom fighters, like the petitioner’s husband. This court doubts whether the collector can ever justify the stand taken, as on date, in completely refusing to acknowledge the order of this court and the Madras Freedom Fighters’ Pension Rules.Hence, the judge set aside the rejection order and directed the collector to consider the application of the petitioner in accordance with law and pass orders within six weeks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/consider-application-for-freedom-fighters-family-pension-hc/articleshow/88843193.cms||Kaushik Kannan
